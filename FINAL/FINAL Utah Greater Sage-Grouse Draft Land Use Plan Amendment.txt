U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management November 2018 Utah Greater‐Sage Grouse Proposed Resource Management Plan Amendment and Final Environmental Impact Statement The Bureau of Land Management’s multiple-use mission is to sustain the health and productivity of the public lands for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations. The Bureau accomplishes this by managing such activities as outdoor recreation, livestock grazing, mineral development, and energy production, and by conserving natural, historical, cultural, and other resources on public lands. Cover Photo: Steve Ting Lower Bar Photos (L to R): US Fish and Wildlife, Rachel Woita, James Yule Utah Greater Sage-Grouse Proposed Resource Management Plan Amendment and Final Environmental Impact Statement Responsible Agency: United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management Abstract: This Proposed Resource Management Plan Amendment (RMPA) and Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) have been prepared by the United States Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Land Management (BLM) with input from cooperating agencies. The purpose of this RMPA is to enhance cooperation with the States by modifying the approach to greater sage-grouse management in existing RMPs to better align with individual state plans and/or conservation measures and DOI and BLM policy. This document is considering amendments to 14 BLM RMPs in Utah. The EIS describes and analyzes two alternatives for managing Greater Sage-Grouse habitat on approximately 2.5 million acres of BLM-administered surface estate and 1.5 million acres of BLM subsurface mineral estate. The No-Action Alternative is a continuation of the current management; use of public lands and resources would continue to be managed under the BLM RMPs, as amended in 2015. The Management Alignment Alternative was developed in coordination with the State and cooperating agencies to align with the State conservation plan and to support conservation outcomes for Greater Sage-Grouse. The Proposed Plan Amendment is a modification of the Management Alignment Alternative and was developed in response to comments received on the Draft RMPA /EIS. The Proposed Plan Amendment does not constitute a final decision; the Approved RMP Amendment will be presented in the Record of Decision (ROD) that will be released following the protest period, Governor’s consistency review period, and the resolution of any protests. Major planning issues addressed include Sagebrush Focal Area designations, habitat boundary designations, density and disturbance caps, habitat objectives, energy and minerals, and lands and realty. Protest Period: Protests must be postmarked by or received no later than 30 days after the publication of the US Environmental Protection Agency Notice of Availability in the Federal Register. Please refer to the Dear Reader Letter preceding this abstract for additional information regarding protest procedures. For further information, contact: Quincy Bahr, Project Manager Telephone: (801) 539-4122 Bureau of Land Management, Utah State Office 440 West, 200 South, Suite 500 Salt Lake City, UT 84101 This page intentionally left blank. TABLE OF CONTENTS Chapter Page EXECUTIVE SUMMARY.............................................................................................................ES-1 ES.1 Introduction.................................................................................................................................ES-1 ES.2 Purpose of and Need for Action ............................................................................................ES-2 ES.3 Issues and Related Resource Topics Identified Through Scoping...................................ES-2 ES.3.1 Issues Retained for Further Consideration in this RMPA/EIS...........................ES-3 ES.4 Alternatives Considered...........................................................................................................ES-4 ES.4.1 No-Action Alternative................................................................................................ES-4 ES.4.2 Proposed Plan Amendment.......................................................................................ES-4 ES.5 Public Comment Response ......................................................................................................ES-6 ES.6 Summary of Environmental Consequences..........................................................................ES-6 CHAPTER 1.

These ecosystems are managed in partnership across the range of the Greater Sage-Grouse by federal, state, and local authorities. Efforts to conserve the species and its habitat date back to the 1950s. Over the past two decades, state wildlife agencies, federal agencies, local partners (county governments, local area working groups, university researchers, etc.) and many others in the range of the species have been collaborating to conserve Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitats. The United States (US) Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) have broad responsibilities to manage federal lands and resources for the public benefit. Nearly half of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat rangewide is managed by the BLM. In September 2015, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) determined that the Greater Sage-Grouse did not warrant listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. In its “not warranted” determination, the USFWS based its decision in part on regulatory certainty from the conservation commitments and management actions in the BLM and US Forest Service (Forest Service) Greater Sage-Grouse land use plan amendments (LUPAs) and revisions, as well as on other private, state, and federal conservation efforts. Since 2015 the BLM, in discussion with partners, recognized that several refinements and policy updates would help strengthen conservation efforts, while providing increased economic opportunity to local communities. The BLM continues to build upon its commitment to on-the-ground management to promote conservation through close collaboration with State governments, local communities, private landowners, and other stakeholders. Table ES-1 shows the rangewide acres of on-the-ground treatment activity between 2015 and 2017 and planned for 2018, based upon annual budgets allocated by Congress. BLM’s accomplishments reflect contributions from Greater Sage-Grouse, as well as fuels, riparian, and range management programs. Table ES-1 Rangewide Acres of On-The-Ground Treatment Activity for Fiscal Years 2015 to 2017 and Planned for 2018 Fiscal Year  Conifer Removal  Fuelbreaks  Invasive Species Removal  Habitat Protection  Habitat Restoration  Total  2015  98,876  15,000  63,612  41,003  75,952  294,443  2016  165,963  14,614  66,621  42,305  95,748  385,251  2017  185,032  65,455  124,582  10,428  93,474  479,000  20181  118,384  65,442  68,512  9,240  54,509  316,087  1Planned The BLM is now engaged in a planning effort to further enhance its continued cooperation with western states by ensuring greater consistency between individual state plans and the BLM’s multiple-use mission. This executive summary highlights the major components of this planning document and outlines the potential impacts from the proposed management changes. The BLM’s efforts seek to improve management alignment in ways that will increase management flexibility, maintain access to public resources, and promote conservation outcomes. ES.2 PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION In the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), Congress provided the BLM with discretion and authority to manage public lands for multiple use and sustained yield and declared it the policy of the United States to, consistent with the laws governing the administration of the public lands, coordinate planning with the land use planning and management programs of other federal, state, tribal, and local governments. Further, FLPMA specifically provides that it neither enlarges nor diminishes the authority of the states in managing fish and wildlife. As the sovereign entities with the lead role in managing game species, including Greater Sage-Grouse, states (and on reservations, tribes) play a critical role in conserving the Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat. In addition to FLPMA’s directive to provide for enhanced cooperation and greater consistency with state, tribal and local governments, since 2015 there have been additional Executive and Secretarial Orders that direct the Department of the Interior to prioritize energy independence and greater cooperation with the states specific to the management of Greater Sage-Grouse. In light of these more recent policies (summarized in Section 1.1), the purpose and need for this RMPA/EIS is to modify the approach to Greater Sage-Grouse management in existing land use plans through 1) enhancing cooperation and coordination with Utah and tribes where applicable, 2) align with DOI and BLM policy directives that have been issued since 2015, and 3) incorporate updated local science, research, and information to better align with Utah’s Greater Sage-Grouse conservation plan. ES.3 ISSUES AND RELATED RESOURCE TOPICS IDENTIFIED THROUGH SCOPING When deciding which issues to address related to the purpose and need, the BLM considers points of disagreement, debate, or dispute regarding an anticipated outcome from a proposed action. Issues are based on anticipated environmental impacts; as such, they can help shape the proposal and alternatives. The BLM used internal, agency, and public scoping to identify issues to consider in the environmental analysis. A summary of the scoping process is presented in Potential Amendments to Land Use Plans Regarding Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation Scoping Report (https://goo.gl/FopNgW). The sections below outline how issues raised during scoping are considered in this RMPA/EIS. Generally, they fall into the following categories: • Issues retained for further consideration in this RMPA/EIS—These were issues raised during scoping for which alternatives were developed to address the issues. • Clarification of decisions in the 2015 ROD/ARMPA—These are decisions or frameworks in the 2015 ROD/ARMPA that require clarification as to their application or implementation. No new analysis is required, as the intentions behind the decisions were analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS. • Some issues that were raised during scoping are not carried forward for additional consideration or analysis in this RMPA/EIS—While some of these issues are considered in this RMPA/EIS, they do not require additional analysis because they were analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS. Others are not carried forward in this RMPA/EIS because they do not further the purpose of aligning with the State’s conservation plan. ES.3.1 Issues Retained for Further Consideration in this RMPA/EIS Based on the issues identified in Table ES-2, below, the resource topics that could be affected are as follows: Greater Sage-Grouse, air quality, soil resources, water resources, vegetation (including noxious weeds and riparian and wetlands), other special status species, fish and wildlife, wild horses and burros, cultural resources, visual resources, wildland fire management, lands with wilderness characteristics (not managed for their protection), livestock grazing/rangeland management, recreation, comprehensive travel and transportation management, lands and realty, renewable energy, leasable minerals (fluid, nonenergy, coal, oil shale, and tar sands), locatable minerals, mineral materials, social and economic conditions, and tribal interests. Therefore, these resource topics are carried forward for additional consideration and analysis. Table ES-2 Issues Issues Issue Category Sagebrush Focal Area Designations/Withdrawal Recommendation Administering Disturbance and Density Caps Modifying Mitigation Strategy Modifying Habitat Objectives Waivers, Exceptions, and Modifications for NSO Stipulations General Habitat Management Areas in Utah Retained for further Considering Exceptions to Greater Sage-Grouse Restrictions in PHMA consideration Adaptive Management (focusing responses and reversing trends) Prioritization of Mineral Leasing Land Disposal and Exchanges Managing Habitat to Manage Predation Burial of Transmission Lines Modifying Habitat Management Area Boundaries Clarifying Application of Lek Buffers Clarifying Grazing Systems and Prioritization of Grazing Permits Clarifying Management of Water Developments for Livestock Clarifying the Role of the State of Utah and Counties with Respect to Clarifying 2015 ARMPA Travel Management Planning decisions Clarifying the Role of the BLM, State of Utah, and Counties with Respect to Predator Control Clarifying Management of Surface Coal Mining Decisions that Require Analysis of Specific Alternatives during Implementation Restrictions on rights-of-way (ROWs) and infrastructure ROW avoidance in PHMA and GHMA Varying stipulations applied to oil, gas, and, geothermal development Impacts of NSO stipulations on Greater Sage-Grouse habitat on land not administered by the BLM Numerical noise limitations in PHMA Contribution of disturbance caps toward Greater Sage-Grouse  Analyzed in 2015 Final EIS and no significant new information has emerged  conservation objectives  Required design features (RDFs)  Vegetation treatments and wildfire response  Table ES-2 Issues Issues Issue Category Habitat and plan effectiveness monitoring using tools such as the habitat assessment framework Managing for Target Population Levels Greater Sage-Grouse hunting Not carried forward for analysis– Predator control no jurisdiction Military overflights of PHMA/GHMA Table ES-2 identifies those issues retained for further consideration in this RMPA/EIS, those issues associated with clarification of decisions in the 2015 ROD/ARMPA, and those issues not carried forward for additional consideration or analysis in this RMPA/EIS. ES.4 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED Alternatives development and analysis is the heart of an EIS. The alternatives considered in this document address all the issues brought forward by the public and considered by BLM. The comparative analysis between alternatives establishes a framework for decision makers to understand important trade-offs and identify the most effective way to meet the purpose and need and BLM’s multiple use mission. The alternatives analysis can support the BLM in adapting its management when information and circumstances change. ES.4.1 No-Action Alternative Under the No-Action Alternative, the BLM would not change the management actions from the 2015 Utah Greater Sage-Grouse Approve Resource Management Plan Amendment. Greater Sage-Grouse habitat would continue to be managed under current management direction. Goals and objectives for BLM-administered lands and federal mineral estate would not change. Allowable uses and restrictions pertaining to such activities as mineral leasing and development, lands and realty, and livestock grazing would also remain the same. This alternative includes the designation of Sagebrush Focal Areas (SFAs), PHMA, and GHMA, with corresponding management for each type of area. ES.4.2 Proposed Plan Amendment The Management Alignment Alternative in the 2018 Draft EIS has been modified based on coordination with the State of Utah, input from other cooperating agencies and public comments, and alignment with some changes in BLM regulations, policy and guidance. The Management Alignment Alternative, in its modified state in this Final EIS, is now the Proposed Plan Amendment. The BLM continues to build upon the 2015 planning effort as envisioned in SO 3353 by collaborating with states to improve compatibility between federal management plans and other plans and programs at the state level, while ensuring consistency with the BLM’s multiple use mission. This enhanced cooperation between the BLM and the Utah Governor’s office would lead to improved management and coordination with the state across the range of Greater Sage-Grouse in Utah. The Proposed Plan Amendment prioritizes the importance of management prescriptions on PHMA to protect the seasonal habitats that support over 95 percent of Greater Sage-Grouse populations in Utah, while removing the designation and management of GHMA. Additionally, PHMA management would be more flexible to maintain avoidance protections while allowing site-specific adjustments to account for the unique nature of habitat types and distribution throughout Utah. A summary of the overall changes to the Management Alignment Alternative to develop the Proposed Plan Amendment include the following (see Section 2.5 for the specific changes): • Modifications to how BLM is addressing mitigation. These modifications were made to address the newly released Instruction Memorandum 2018-093, Compensatory Mitigation; • Allowing for consideration of disturbance and density cap exceedances to be evaluated at the entire sage-grouse population, not the just project analysis area; • Including a requirement for a monitoring schedule associated with projects that are included in the disturbance cap; • Clarifying that management of water developments applies to both new and existing projects; • Clarifying that annual monitoring of areas that have met adaptive management triggers is required to determine if applied responses are having the desired effect; and • Adjusting terminology and wording to improve readability, clarify intent, and to better align with terminology in the State of Utah’s revised Sage-Grouse Plan. The Management Alignment Alternative in the Draft RMPA/EIS included a proposed management action for compensatory mitigation based on the mitigation framework the BLM incorporated into its plans in 2015. However, following extensive review of FLPMA, existing regulations, orders, policies, and guidance, the BLM has determined that FLPMA does not explicitly mandate or authorize the BLM to require public land users to implement compensatory mitigation as a condition of obtaining authorization for the use of BLM-administered lands (Instruction Memorandum 2018-093, Compensatory Mitigation, July 24, 2018). Consistent with that determination, compensatory mitigation must be voluntary unless required by other applicable laws, including state authorities which may also require compensatory mitigation. The BLM will not deny a proposed authorization in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat solely on the grounds that the proponent has not proposed or agreed to undertake voluntary compensatory mitigation. To align this planning effort with the BLM’s compensatory mitigation policy (IM 2018-093), the Proposed Plan Amendment clarifies that the BLM will consider compensatory mitigation only as a component of compliance with a state mitigation plan, program, or authority, or when offered voluntarily by a project proponent. In accordance with the State’s goals for managing Greater Sage-Grouse, the Proposed Plan Amendment modifies the net conservation gain standard for compensatory mitigation to clarify that the BLM will pursue improvement of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat only as a broader planning goal and objective. The Proposed Plan Amendment eliminates the “improve the condition of habitat” standard for compensatory mitigation at the project level and clarifies the application of the standard as a planning-level objective for Greater Sage-Grouse conservation. This means that the BLM will continue to require avoidance, minimization, and other onsite mitigation to adequately conserve Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat, while remaining committed to implementing beneficial habitat management actions to reduce the threats of fire and invasive species. In fiscal year 2018, the BLM funded approximately $29 million in sage-grouse management actions rangewide, resulting in approximately 500,000 acres of treated sage-grouse habitat and expects to invest another $17 million of habitat management projects in fiscal year 2019. The BLM would continue to apply the mitigation hierarchy as described in the CEQ regulations at 40 CFR 1508.20; however, the BLM would focus on avoiding, minimizing, rectifying, and reducing impacts over time. Compensation, which involves replacing or providing substitute resources for the impacts (including through payments to fund such work), would be considered only when: voluntarily offered by a proponent; or, when the appropriate state agency, through coordination with the BLM, determines a state regulation, policy, or program requires or recommends compensatory mitigation. The BLM commits to cooperating with the State to analyze applicant-proposed or state-required or recommended compensatory mitigation to offset residual impacts. Because this clarification simply aligns the Proposed Plan Amendment with BLM policy and the scope of compensatory mitigation authority expressly provided by FLPMA, and because any analysis of compensatory mitigation relating to future projects is speculative at this level of land use planning, analysis of compensatory mitigation is more appropriate for future project-specific NEPA. The BLM remains committed to achieving the planning-level management goals and objectives identified in this RMPA by ensuring Greater Sage-Grouse habitat impacts are addressed through implementing mitigating actions consistent with the Proposed Plan Amendment. The BLM recognizes that Greater Sage-Grouse is a State-managed species, and, in accordance with 43 CFR 24.3(a), that State authority regarding fish and resident wildlife species guides how the BLM cooperates with the State in the absence of specific, overriding federal law. Further, the BLM recognizes that state governments have established fish and wildlife agencies that are charged with the responsibility and mandate to implement state statutes for effective, appropriate, and efficient conservation and management of fish and resident wildlife species. Accordingly, the BLM has coordinated with the State to develop a memorandum of agreement to guide the application of the mitigation hierarchy and compensatory mitigation actions for future project authorizations in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat on BLM-administered lands. Consistent with the notice of Cancellation, which canceled the BLM’s application to withdraw SFA from locatable mineral entry (82 Federal Register 195, October 11, 2017, p. 47248), this alternative would remove the recommendation for withdrawal. The effects of such action are included in Chapter 4. ES.5 PUBLIC COMMENT RESPONSE The Draft RMPA/EIS was issued for a 90-day public review and comment in May 2018. The BLM assessed and considered public comments, received both individually and collectively, during the public review period of the Draft RMPA/EIS. BLM responded to all substantive comments received on the Draft RMPA/EIS (Appendix 2). ES.6 SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES This section summarizes and compares environmental consequences anticipated from implementing the No-Action Alternative and the Proposed Plan Amendment. This table groups the impact summaries into five main categories: Greater Sage-Grouse, resources, resource uses, Social and Economic Conditions, and Tribal Interests. A detailed description of environmental consequences is included in Chapter 4, and a description of changes between alternatives is found in Chapter 2, Table 2-1. No-Action Alternative  Management Alignment Alternative  Greater Sage-Grouse  Minerals and lands allocations would avoid most  All of the minerals and lands allocations from the No- impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse and their habitat in  Action Alternative would remain in place, avoiding  PHMA.

This would maintain  and likely accelerate the declining trends in Greater  Sage-Grouse populations and habitat. However, this  loss would be minimal in context of state-wide  populations because 95 percent of Utah’s Greater  Sage-Grouse populations are supported by habitat  located within PHMA.  No-Action Alternative Management Alignment Alternative Resources Summarizes impacts on resources, including air quality, soil resources, water resources, vegetation (including noxious weeds and riparian and wetlands), other special status species, fish and wildlife, wild horses and burros, cultural resources, visual resources, wildland fire management, and lands with wilderness characteristics (not managed for their protection). Protections applied to PHMA and GHMA would generally benefit resources that correspond to Greater Sage-Grouse habitat by either avoiding development or minimizing its effect. These measures would generally keep the existing resources in place, with minimal effects. Managing Greater Sage-Grouse habitat to achieve habitat objectives and maintain or expand the acres that provide for Greater Sage-Grouse habitat would maintain the condition and functionality for most resources. Managing habitat in this fashion would maintain normal wildland fire trends. Resource Uses Changes in management could result in a change in the potential for development to occur in PHMA or former GHMA areas. This could include a change in where the development could occur (e.g., in non-habitat portions of PHMA, in former GHMA area, or anywhere in PHMA due to exceedances in the disturbance or density cap). The change could also include the rate at which it occurs (development in GHMA occurring more quickly under the Proposed Plan Amendment compared to the No-Action Alternative due to removal of some minimization measures and compensation requirements). In all of these instances, the impacts on resources would be substantially similar to the impacts from the No-Action Alternative. Summarizes impacts on resources uses, including livestock grazing/rangeland management, recreation, comprehensive travel and transportation management, lands and realty, renewable energy, leasable minerals (fluid, non-energy, coal, oil shale and tar sands), locatable minerals, and mineral materials. Allocations could preclude development of some mineral and renewable energy resources. New non-energy leasable mines in new areas of PHMA would be precluded, as would new mineral material sites. However, the most common mineral material site – free-use sites – would continue to be allowed. No surface occupancy stipulations could limit interest in leasing or development in PHMA, though areas with high mineral potential do not generally align with PHMA. In addition to these allocations, other measures to minimize impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat (seasonal limitations, noise and tall structure restrictions, net conservation gain requirements) would not preclude development in PHMA or GHMA, but could affect the economic feasibility of some mineral developments and lands projects by potentially increased costs and development delays. Application of the 3 percent disturbance cap and the energy and minerals density cap could preclude new developments, if the cap limits are met. PHMA and GHMA are available for livestock grazing. Conservation measures that limit loss of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat (e.g., allocations, 3 percent disturbance cap in PHMA, lek buffers) could result in decreased disturbance and loss of forage, though given estimated anticipated levels of disturbance, this effect would be Impacts from allocations would generally be the same as the No-Action Alternative, except that adding waivers, exceptions, and modifications to the No Surface Occupancy fluid minerals stipulation would increase flexibility for leaseholders to find areas within PHMA where development does not result in impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse. Allowing development in non-habitat portions of PHMA would increase development opportunities, but generally for smaller types of disturbances and developments to avoid impacts on adjacent areas of habitat. This provision could also potentially open up additional opportunities for siting of energy and mining facilities and small rights-of-way. Allowing projects to exceed the 3 percent disturbance cap and minerals/energy density caps could increase opportunities for development within PHMA if an area was close to meeting one of the caps. However, there would be an increase in mitigation costs associated with achieving the criteria outlined before exceeding the caps. Removal of GHMA and its management from the 2015 amendment could reduce costs of exploration and development of multiple types of energy, mineral, and other land use resources. This could result in an No-Action Alternative Management Alignment Alternative minimal. Requiring mineral projects to achieve a net conservation gain could improve rangeland conditions by managing areas of conifer encroachment for Greater Sage-Grouse. Recreation use and development would continue, though siting and design of some facilities could change to avoid impacts on PHMA. Social and Economic Conditions As noted in the 2015 Final EIS, impact on employment and earnings would be a reduction of an estimated 0.1 percent of employment and earnings when compared to pre-2015 levels. Tribal Interests increase in rates of development, though this result is anticipated to be marginal. All lands currently available for livestock grazing would continue to be available. Though there is a potential for more development, mitigation requirements would replace lost forage resources. In former GHMA, however, mitigation for development would occur in PHMA, which could result in a long-term decrease in available forage in former GHMA, but an increase of available forage in PHMA. Impacts on recreation are not different from the No-Action Alternative. Increasing flexibility by allowing exceedances to the disturbance and density caps could result in increased economic activity and, possibly, positive economic impacts at the local, regional, state, and/or national level. Similarly, allowing for development in non-habitat portions of PHMA could potentially increase development activities in the future and, in turn, could result in positive economic impacts. This provision could also potentially open up additional opportunities for siting of energy and/or mining facilities, resulting in positive changes in economic indicators. Removing GHMA and its management could reduce costs of exploration and development of multiple types of energy, mineral, and other land use resources in these areas, although this result would be expected to be marginal. Changes in the disposal limitations could possibly expand economic opportunities in the affected location. The specific economic impact in each case would depend on the type of development that would occur as a result of the change in land ownership. Impacts could be from development (e.g., mineral developments, transmission lines, road construction, etc.), conservation actions (e.g., habitat improvement or landscape reclamation, etc.), or future implementation actions. Both alternatives provide for appropriate tribal governments to consult on a case-by-case basis on undertakings on BLM-administered lands that could affect Native American concerns. The BLM would continue to identify, protect, and preserve tribal assets, treaty rights, sacred/religious sites, or special use areas through site-and project-specific modification or mitigation on a project-by-project consultation basis. This page intentionally left blank. Chapter 1. Purpose of and Need for Action 1.1 INTRODUCTION Greater Sage-Grouse is a state-managed species that depends on sagebrush steppe ecosystems. These ecosystems are managed in partnership across its range by federal, state, tribal, local, and private authorities and input. State agencies responsible for fish and wildlife management possess broad responsibility for protecting and managing fish, wildlife, and plants within their borders, except where preempted by federal law. Similarly, the DOI has broad responsibilities to manage federal lands and resources for the public’s benefit. On reservations, Native American tribes manage wildlife and their associated habitat. Approximately half of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat is managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and United States Forest Service (Forest Service). State agencies are at the forefront of efforts to maintain healthy fish and wildlife populations and to conserve at-risk species. State-led efforts to conserve Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat date back to the 1950s. For the past two decades, state wildlife agencies, federal agencies, state governments, nongovernmental organizations, and many others in the range of the species have been collaborating to conserve Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat. In 2010, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) determined that listing the Greater Sage-Grouse under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 was “warranted but precluded” due to higher listing priority species. In part, the USFWS’s 2010 determination was based on a review of the five ESA factors, wherein the USFWS concluded that a lack of regulatory mechanisms was a threat to the Greater Sage-Grouse. In response, the BLM, in coordination with the United States Department of Agriculture, developed a management strategy that included targeted Greater Sage-Grouse management actions. In September 2015, the agencies adopted land use plan amendments (LUPAs) and revisions to 98 BLM and Forest Service land use plans (LUPs) across ten western states. These LUPAs addressed, in part, threats to the Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat. The amended LUPs govern the management of 67 million acres of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat on federally administered lands. In September 2015, the USFWS determined that the Greater Sage-Grouse did not warrant listing under the Endangered Species Act. The USFWS attributed its 2010 “warranted but precluded” determination primarily to “inadequate regulatory mechanisms.” In its 2015 conclusion of “not warranted,” the USFWS based its decision in part on regulatory certainty from the conservation commitments and management actions in the federal land use plan amendments (LUPAs) and revisions, as well as on other private, state, and federal conservation efforts. The BLM continues to prioritize efforts to conserve GRSG and restore sagebrush habitat and increase the number of acres treated in every Fiscal Year. In Fiscal Year 2018 approximately 530,000 acres were treated and BLM is currently working on more detailed metrics and data for these acres treated. Also, in Fiscal Year 2017 the BLM treated approximately 480,000 acres, for an increase of almost 100,000 acres over 2016 accomplishments. The Fiscal Year 2017 treatments included 185,000 acres of conifer removal; 65,000 acres of fuel breaks; 125,000 acres with invasive species treatments; 10,000 acres of habitat protection; and restored habitat on 94,000 acres of uplands and another 600 acres of riparian habitat. 1. Purpose of and Need for Action The BLM is committed to working directly with local communities on sagebrush conservation efforts and to emulate the successes demonstrated by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) through the Sage-Grouse Initiative on private lands. These efforts include: • an agreement with the Intermountain West Joint Venture to work with local cattlemen associations to improve sagebrush rangeland conditions through actions such as controlling invasive species, improving mesic areas, and removing invasive conifers; • a Memorandum of Understanding between the BLM, NRCS, and the Forest Service resulting in development of a map that identifies areas where the agencies have ongoing restoration projects and opportunities for additional collaboration across land ownerships and associated landscapes; • promoting a locally led collaborative conservation, the BLM, the USFWS, and the Geological Survey are collaborating with the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies as they lead the development and implementation of the Sagebrush Conservation Strategy; • working with livestock permittees and stakeholders on “targeted grazing” to utilize grazing as a tool to create and maintain fuel breaks to manage the threats of wildfire and invasive species in or to Greater Sage-Grouse habitats; and, • working to develop “outcome-based grazing” to provide greater flexibility for livestock permittees and land managers to meet habitat objectives as conditions on-the-ground change. The plans recommended that sagebrush focal areas (SFAs) be proposed for withdrawal; however, the proposed withdrawal was cancelled on October 11, 2017, pursuant to 82 Federal Register 47248. On March 29, 2017, the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) issued Secretarial Order (SO) 3349, American Energy Independence. It ordered DOI agencies to reexamine practices “to better balance conservation strategies and policies with the equally legitimate need of creating jobs for hard-working American families.” On June 7, 2017, the Secretary issued SO 3353 for the purpose of enhancing cooperation among 11 western states and the BLM in managing and conserving Greater Sage-Grouse. SO 3353 directed an Interior Review Team, consisting of the BLM, the USFWS, and United States Geological Survey (USGS), to coordinate with the Sage-grouse Task Force, which is comprised of representatives of the governors of each of the 11 states. They also were directed to review the 2015 Greater Sage-Grouse plans and associated policies to identify provisions that may require modification to make the plans more consistent with the individual state plans and better balance the BLM’s multiple-use mission as directed by SO 3349. On August 4, 2017, the Interior Review Team submitted its Report in Response to Secretarial Order 3353. In this report, the team recommended modifying the Greater Sage-Grouse plans and associated policies to better align with the individual state plans and to meet the purpose of SO 3353. On August 4, 2017, the Secretary issued a memorandum to the Deputy Secretary directing the BLM to implement the recommendations found in the report. On October 11, 2017, the BLM published the Notice of Intent to Amend Land Use Plans Regarding Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation and Prepare Associated Environment Impact Statements or Environmental Assessments in the Federal Register (82 Federal Register 47248). 1. Purpose of and Need for Action During the public scoping period, the BLM sought public comments on whether all, some, or none of the 2015 Greater Sage-Grouse plans should be amended, what issues should be considered, and if plans should be completed at the state level rather than at the national level. In addition, the BLM recognizes that Greater Sage-Grouse is a state-managed species that depends on sagebrush steppe habitat managed in partnership by federal, state, tribal, and local authorities. Input from state governors would weigh heavily when the BLM considers what management changes should be analyzed while ensuring consistency with the BLM’s multiple-use mission and state and local plans, to the maximum extent consistent with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) and the purposes, policies, and programs of federal laws and regulations applicable to public lands. 1.2 PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION In the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), Congress provided the BLM with discretion and authority to manage public lands for multiple use and sustained yield and declared it the policy of the United States to, consistent with the laws governing the administration of the public lands, coordinate planning with the land use planning and management programs of other federal, state, tribal, and local governments. Further, FLPMA specifically provides that it neither enlarges nor diminishes the authority of the states in managing fish and wildlife. As the sovereign entities with the lead role in managing game species, including Greater Sage-Grouse, states (and on reservations, tribes) play a critical role in conserving the Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat. In addition to FLPMA’s directive to provide for enhanced cooperation and greater consistency with state, tribal and local governments, since 2015 there have been additional Executive and Secretarial Orders that direct the Department of the Interior to prioritize energy independence and greater cooperation with the states specific to the management of Greater Sage-Grouse. In light of these more recent policies (summarized in Section 1.1), the purpose and need for this RMPA/EIS is to modify the approach to Greater Sage-Grouse management in existing land use plans through 1) enhancing cooperation and coordination with Utah and tribes where applicable, 2) align with DOI and BLM policy directives that have been issued since 2015, and 3) incorporate updated local science, research, and information to better align with Utah’s Greater Sage-Grouse conservation plan. 1.3 PLANNING AREA AND CURRENT MANAGEMENT The planning area includes all of the State of Utah, regardless of jurisdiction, except lands in Washington and San Juan Counties (see Figure 1-1, Utah Planning Area). Table 1-1, Land Management in the Utah Planning Area, identifies surface acres administered by federal agencies, state, tribal, and local governments and lands that are privately owned in the planning area. Greater Sage-Grouse habitat comprises only a portion of the planning area. Table 1-1 Land Management in the Utah Planning Area Total Surface Land Surface Land Management Management Acres BLM 20,367,500 Forest Service 7,390,200 Private 10,811,700 Indian reservation 1,141,000 USFWS 99,800 State 5,166,500 1.

All decisions apply only to BLM-administered lands, including split-estate lands within Greater Sage-Grouse habitat management areas (the decision area). The Greater Sage-Grouse management areas represent the local ranges of one or more Greater Sage-Grouse populations. These areas are non-contiguous, meaning they are often separated by natural geographic features/barriers or human development (Figure 1-1). In the 2015 Greater Sage-Grouse plan amendments, the decision area is further divided into priority habitat management areas (PHMA) and general habitat management areas (GHMA). PHMA and GHMA are defined as follows: • PHMA—Areas prioritized for managing Greater Sage-Grouse populations (management is only applicable to actions on BLM-administered lands). These management areas include high-quality habitat, and may also include areas with poor or potential habitat, and nonhabitat. PHMA largely coincides with the State of Utah’s Sage-Grouse management areas (SGMA). In the SGMA, the State identified areas of seasonal habitat, nonhabitat, and opportunity areas, though management is focused on the habitat. PHMA are areas that include all the seasonal habitats for the corresponding Greater Sage-Grouse populations, including breeding, late brood-rearing, winter areas, and migration or connectivity corridors. • GHMA—Areas identified in the 2015 Plan with mapped occupied habitat outside of PHMA (management is only applicable to actions on BLM-administered lands). The State of Utah’s plan does not include maps or specific management for occupied habitat outside their SGMA. The BLM’s 2015 Greater Sage-Grouse plan amendments designated PHMA and GHMA as follows: (see Table 1-2). Table 1-2 Acres of PHMA and GHMA in the Decision Area for the RMPA PHMA  GHMA  BLM-administered surface  2,079,900  440,100  BLM-administered mineral estate*  1,319,400  178,000  Source: BLM GIS 2015 *Acreage where the surface and mineral estates are owned or administered by separate entities. These acres show where the surface estate is not BLM administered (e.g., private, state, tribal, and United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service) but that have a federal mineral estate administered by the BLM. 1. Purpose of and Need for Action It is important to note that the State of Utah’s maps used for occupied habitat are broad in nature, and were developed to identify the general areas of potential habitat where Greater Sage-Grouse may be found. The State’s general maps, and by extension the BLM’s PHMA maps, were developed with the intent that as decision-making in the mapped areas moves from broad considerations to application at more specific areas, information that is correspondingly more detailed should be reviewed to determine if a given area actually includes occupied Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. There are 14 land use plans in Utah being considered for amendment as part of this process: • Vernal Resource Management Plan (2008) • Price Resource Management Plan (2008) • Richfield Resource Management Plan (2008) • Kanab Resource Management Plan (2008) • Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument Management Plan (2000) • Cedar/Beaver/Garfield/Antimony Resource Management Plan (1986) • Pinyon Management Framework Plan (1978) • Warm Springs Resource Management Plan (1987) • House Range Resource Management Plan (1987) • Pony Express Resource Management Plan (1990) • Box Elder Resource Management Plan (1986) • Randolph Management Framework Plan (1980) • Park City Management Framework Plan (1975) • Salt Lake District Isolated Tracts Planning Analysis (1985) 1.4 PLANNING CRITERIA Planning criteria establish constraints, guidelines, and standards for the planning process and help the BLM define the scope of planning and analysis. The following criteria are based on the standards prescribed by applicable laws and regulations; agency guidance; results of consultation and coordination with the public and other federal, state, and local agencies; analysis pertinent to the planning area; and professional judgment. The BLM has identified the following planning criteria: • The BLM will comply with all laws, regulations, policies, and guidance related to public lands management and implementing NEPA on BLM-administered lands. • On public lands, Greater Sage-Grouse is a state-managed species that depends on sagebrush steppe habitat managed in partnership by federal, state, and local authorities. In making management determinations on BLM-administered lands, the BLM will use, to the fullest extent practicable, state game and fish agencies’ Greater Sage-Grouse data and expertise. • Lands addressed in the RMPA/EIS will be BLM-administered land in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat, including surface and split-estate lands with federal subsurface mineral rights. Any decisions in the RMPA/EIS will apply only to BLM-administered lands. 1. Purpose of and Need for Action • This RMPA/EIS will comply with orders of the Secretary, including SO 3353 (Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation and Cooperation with Western States), which strives for compatibility with state conservation plans. • This RMPA/EIS will incorporate, as appropriate, information in a USGS report that identified and annotated Greater Sage-Grouse science published since January 2015 (Carter et al. 2018) and a report that synthesized and outlined the potential management implications of this new science (Hanser et al. 2018). • The RMPA will incorporate, as appropriate, local-and state-based science, data, monitoring information, and associated analyses and products. • This RMPA/EIS will comply with BLM Manual 6840, Special Status Species Management. • This RMPA/EIS will recognize valid existing rights, including those associated with the Mineral Leasing Act and the 1872 Mining Law. The BLM recognizes that in some circumstances its discretion to deny or regulate a proposed public land use is limited, such as with existing leases, existing contracts, or mining plans of operations. Accordingly, the BLM will ensure that its implementation of the management actions is consistent with the terms and conditions in existing leases or existing contracts, or with the regulations governing mining plans of operation. • All activities and uses in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat will be managed to achieve land health standards. • This RMPA/EIS will not amend more restrictive land use allocations or decisions for other resources under existing LUPs, such as wilderness study areas, areas of critical environmental concern, cultural resources, and riparian areas. 1.5 ISSUES AND RELATED RESOURCE TOPICS IDENTIFIED THROUGH SCOPING When deciding which issues to address related to the purpose and need, the BLM considers points of disagreement, debate, or dispute regarding an anticipated outcome from a proposed action. Issues are based on anticipated environmental impacts; as such, issues can help shape the proposal and alternatives. The BLM used internal, agency, and public scoping to identify issues to consider in the environmental analysis. A summary of the scoping process is presented in Potential Amendments to Land Use Plans Regarding Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation Scoping Report (https://goo.gl/FopNgW). When determining whether to retain an issue for more detailed analysis in this RMPA/EIS, the interdisciplinary team considered, among other things, the following: • The environmental impacts associated with the issue and the threats to species and habitat associated with the issue are central, or of critical importance, to developing a Greater Sage-Grouse management plan. • A detailed analysis of environmental impacts related to the issue is necessary to make a reasoned choice between alternatives. • The environmental impacts associated with the issue are a significant point of contention among the public and other agencies. • There are potentially significant impacts on resources associated with the issue. Ultimately, it is important for decision-makers and the public to understand the impacts that each of the alternatives would have on specific resources; therefore, the BLM uses resource topics as a heading to indicate which resources would be affected by a management change. Importantly, resource topics will 1. Purpose of and Need for Action help organize the discussions of the affected environment (Chapter 3) and environmental consequences (Chapter 4). The sections below outline how issues raised during scoping, as well as related resource topics, are considered in this RMPA/EIS. Generally, they fall into the following categories: • Issues and related resource topics retained for further consideration in this RMPA/EIS—These were issues raised during scoping for which alternatives were developed to address the issues. In some cases, the resolution in the alternatives were previously analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS. In other cases, additional analysis is needed in this RMPA/EIS. Because the issues are analyzed under resource topics in 2015, the resource topics corresponding with those retained for further analysis are also considered in this RMPA/EIS. Just like issues, they may have been analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS for those decisions being included in this RMPA/EIS. • Clarification of decisions in the 2015 Approved Resource Management Plan Amendments (ARMPA)—These are decisions or frameworks in the 2015 ARMPA that require clarification as to their application or implementation. No new analysis is required, as the intentions behind the decisions were analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS. • Some issues and resource topics that were brought up during scoping were not carried forward for additional consideration or analysis in this RMPA/EIS—While some of these issues are considered in this RMPA/EIS, they do not require additional analysis because they were analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS. Others are not carried forward in this RMPA/EIS because they do not further the purpose of aligning with the State’s conservation plan. Similar to issues, there are resource topics that are not retained for further analysis. This is because either they are not affected by the changes proposed in Chapter 2 or because the impact was analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS. 1.5.1 Issues and Related Resource Topics Retained for Further Consideration in this RMPA/EIS Based on the issues identified in Table 1-3, below, the resource topics that could be affected are as follows: Greater Sage-Grouse, air quality, soil resources, water resources, vegetation (including noxious weeds and riparian and wetlands), other special status species, fish and wildlife, wild horses and burros, cultural resources, visual resources, wildland fire management, lands with wilderness characteristics (not managed for their protection), livestock grazing/rangeland management, recreation, comprehensive travel and transportation management, lands and realty, renewable energy, leasable minerals (fluid, nonenergy, coal, oil shale, and tar sands), locatable minerals, mineral materials, social and economic conditions, and tribal interests. Therefore, these resource topics are carried forward for additional consideration and analysis. Table 1-3 identifies the issues and the corresponding resource topics to which they relate.

These issues require clarification to the ARMPA language but, because they are clarifications and do not change management as intended or analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS, they do not require new analysis. The clarifying language for these planning decisions is displayed in this planning document to communicate how these issues are being addressed. 1. Purpose of and Need for Action Clarifying Process for Modifying Habitat Management Area Boundaries The PHMA boundaries were initially designated to align with the areas mapped as “habitat” within the State’s 2013 SGMA; however, the State’s SGMA boundaries were intended to be adjusted based on site-specific data. Similarly, the PHMA boundaries were intended to be able to be adjusted (increased or decreased) based on site-specific data to adequately capture Greater Sage-Grouse habitat needs to the corresponding Greater Sage-Grouse population, based on best available site-specific science and monitoring data. This was clearly described in language in the 2015 Final EIS, Section 2.7.4. Clarifying Application of Lek Buffers During scoping, an issue was raised questioning whether the lek buffers identified in the 2015 ARMPA were tools to analyze and reduce impacts or to preclude activities in the buffer area. The BLM’s 2015 ARMPA provided direction to apply lek buffer-distances; however, the appendix describing how to apply the buffers is not consistent on whether they are a tool to “evaluate impacts to leks” or to “relocate [projects] outside the applicable lek buffer-distances.” This process clarifies the inconsistency by aligning the buffer strategy with the BLM Utah’s PHMA strategy, which is consistent with the State of Utah’s management approach. Like the state’s SGMA, the BLM’s PHMA was mapped to capture all seasonal habitats used by priority populations of Greater Sage-Grouse in the State, not just focus on breeding or nesting areas that are addressed by lek buffers. Because the clarifications in how lek buffers are applied are consistent with the strategies already contained in the 2015 ROD/ARMPA and analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS, no additional analysis is necessary. The 2015 ARMPA appendix also includes language that “justifiable departures to decrease or increase from [the] distances, based on local data [and] best available science…may be appropriate for determining activity impacts.” Since completion of the 2015 ROD/ARMPA, Utah State University has analyzed the relationships between power lines and nesting and brood-rearing hen data from Utah. Based on their analysis, the tall structures buffer is being decreased from 2.0 miles to 1.7 miles, consistent with the language already in the appendix. Because such adjustments were already provided for in the appendix, no additional analysis is necessary. Clarifying Grazing Systems and Prioritization of Grazing Permits The 2015 ARMPA includes several management actions in the livestock grazing section that duplicate existing agency regulations, policies, or management actions in other sections of the ARMPA. As such, these actions would continue to be implemented whether or not they appear in the land use plan. Additionally, these actions tend to address management on livestock grazing in general, rather than focusing on the threat to Greater Sage-Grouse from improper livestock grazing, which is the focus of the State’s management and strategies. Because removing these actions does not change whether they are implemented via regulation, policy, or other management action, no new analysis is required. Clarifying Management of Water Developments for Livestock The second sentence of management action MA-LG-10 in the 2015 ROD/ARMPA could be interpreted as potentially impinging on the State’s authority to manage water rights; however, the second sentence merely repeats the principle of the first sentence of this action with more specific details to a type of vegetation condition. So long as the first sentence is met, the second sentence’s removal does not change any impacts, and increases alignment with the State’s plans and strategies. 1. Purpose of and Need for Action Clarifying the Role of the State of Utah and Counties with Respect to Travel Management Planning An issue was raised in scoping to clarify the role of governmental parties in subsequent travel management efforts. Clarification of who needs to be included in coordination for implementation-level travel management planning does not have any on-the-ground impact, and therefore does not require new analysis. Clarifying the Role of the BLM, State of Utah, and Counties with Respect to Predator Control An issue was raised in scoping to clarify the role of governmental parties in predator control. Successful predator management requires coordination across a wide variety of state, county, and federal agencies with differing jurisdictions. The importance of such coordination was addressed in this RMPA/EIS as a clarification of language already present in the 2015 ARMPA. Clarification of the importance of such coordination does not have any on-the-ground impact, and therefore does not require new analysis. Clarifying Management of Surface Coal Mining Issues were raised during scoping regarding surface mining of coal in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. Management Action MR-18 in the 2015 ARMPA included language that addressed this issue, but it became apparent through scoping that the language was not sufficiently clear. To address this confusion the language was modified to clarify the intent of the 2015 ARMPA. As this does not include a change in the actual decision, but merely a clarification to align with the intent of the 2015 ARMPA, no new impacts need to be analyzed. Decisions that Require Analysis of Specific Alternatives during Implementation An issue from scoping noted that several of the ARMPA actions did nothing more than direct analysis of specific alternatives during environmental review of site-level projects. Nothing in the State of Utah’s plan directs blanket analysis of a given course of action without consideration of the issues and site-specific resource conditions. As such, requirements to analyze specific alternatives regardless of site-specific issues do not align with the State’s plan or strategies. Because there is no impact associated with simply “considering” a future unknown action, there is no corresponding impact as a result of removing it from required consideration. Therefore no new impacts need to be analyzed. Any actual impacts of a given “considered” action would be determined during the site-specific NEPA effort and be based on the specific conditions in the given planning area. 1.5.3 Issues and Resource Topics not Carried Forward for Additional Analysis (Scoping Issues Outside the Scope and Scoping Issues Previously Analyzed) Issues and Related Resource Topics not Carried Forward for Additional Analysis Comments were raised regarding managing for target Greater Sage-Grouse population levels as an issue for consideration during scoping for this RMPA/EIS. The issue was not carried forward for detailed analysis because the BLM does not manage species populations, an authority that falls under the jurisdiction of the State of Utah and implemented by the Division of Wildlife Resources. Because the following issues were analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS, and no significant new information has emerged, they do not require additional analysis in this RMPA/EIS and these related resource topics are dismissed from additional analysis. The types of impacts on these resources are described in the range of 1. Purpose of and Need for Action alternatives in the 2015 Final EIS. The impacts of implementing the alternatives in this RMPA/EIS are within the range of alternatives previously analyzed: • Restrictions on rights-of-way (ROWs) and infrastructure • ROW avoidance in PHMA and GHMA • Varying stipulations applied to oil, gas, and, geothermal development • Impacts of NSO stipulations on Greater Sage-Grouse habitat on land not administered by the BLM • Numerical noise limitations in PHMA • Contribution of disturbance caps toward Greater Sage-Grouse conservation objectives • Required design features (RDFs) • Vegetation treatments and wildfire response • Habitat and plan effectiveness monitoring using tools such as the habitat assessment framework The BLM evaluated the following issues as part of the 2015 Final EIS. For the same reasons they were dismissed in the 2015 Final EIS, they were not carried forward for detailed analysis in this RMPA/EIS (see Section 1.6.3 in the 2015 Final EIS): • Greater Sage-Grouse hunting • Predator control • Military overflights of PHMA/GHMA Resource Topics Not Carried Forward for Additional Analysis The resource topics below are dismissed from detailed analysis. While these resource topics may have impacts related to Greater Sage-Grouse conservation that were analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS, they are dismissed from detailed analysis because they have no potentially significant impacts from actions proposed in this RMPA/EIS: • Geology • Paleontological resources • Special designations (i.e., areas of critical environmental concern, wilderness, wilderness study areas, wild and scenic rivers, and national trails) • Lands with wilderness characteristics managed for their protection (natural areas) 1.6 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER POLICIES, PLANS, AND PROGRAMS The BLM recognizes the importance of state, tribal, and local plans. The BLM will be consistent with or complementary to the management actions in these plans to the maximum extent consistent with FLPMA. 1.

The Proposed Plan Amendment is a refinement of the Management Alignment Alternative from the Draft RMPA/EIS, with modifications based on coordination with the State of Utah, input from other cooperating agencies and public comments, alignment with BLM policies, and rewording for clarification of purpose and intent. The Draft RMPA/EIS was available for a 90-day comment period, ending on August 2, 2018. A summary of changes to this Proposed RMPA/Final EIS from the Draft RMPA/EIS is as follows: • A summary of the overall changes to the Management Alignment Alternative to develop the Proposed Plan Amendment include follows (see Section 2.5 for the specific changes): – Modifying how the BLM is addressing mitigation; these modifications were made to address the newly released Instruction Memorandum 2018-093, Compensatory Mitigation – Allowing for consideration of disturbance and density cap exceedances to be evaluated for the entire Greater Sage-Grouse population, not just the project analysis area – Including a requirement for a monitoring schedule associated with projects that are named in the disturbance cap – Clarifying that management of water developments applies to both new and existing projects 1.

Purpose of and Need for Action This page intentionally left blank. Chapter 2. Alternatives 2.1 INTRODUCTION This chapter describes the alternatives evaluated as a part of this RMPA/EIS. This RMPA/EIS analyzes in detail the No-Action Alternative and the Management Alignment Alternative, which has been modified to be the Proposed Plan Amendment based on coordination with the State of Utah, input from other cooperating agencies and public comments, and alignment with BLM policies. In addition to the alternatives considered in detail, this chapter includes a description of alternatives considered but eliminated from detailed analysis. The 2015 Final EIS also considered issues and analyzed alternatives for management of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat that are incorporated by reference. Components of Alternatives Goals are broad statements of desired outcomes and are not quantifiable or measurable; objectives are specific measurable desired conditions or outcomes intended to meet goals. Goals and objectives can vary across alternatives, resulting in different allowable uses and management actions for some resources and resource uses. Management actions and allowable uses are designed to achieve goals and objectives. Management actions are measures that guide day-to-day and future activities; allowable uses delineate those that are permitted, restricted, or prohibited and may include stipulations or restrictions. Allowable uses also identify lands where specific uses are excluded to protect resource values, or where certain lands are open or closed in response to legislative, regulatory, or policy requirements. Implementation decisions are site-specific actions and are typically not addressed in RMPs. 2.2 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BUT NOT ANALYZED IN DETAIL 2.2.1 Varying Constraints on Land Uses and Development Activities During scoping, some commenters asked for increased or additional constraints on land uses and ground-disturbing activities to protect Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. These constraints are beyond those in the current management plan.1 Other commenters, in contrast, asked the BLM to consider eliminating or reducing constraints on land uses, or incorporating other flexibilities into the BLM’s implementation of RMPs, in addition to those issues that are already evaluated in the Management Alignment Alternative (now adjusted to be the Proposed Plan Amendment). The BLM considered every scoping comment and, where appropriate, incorporated these issues into the 2018 Draft RMPA/EIS Management Alignment Alternative following coordination with the State. Because the purpose and need for the BLM’s action, building off of the 2015 ROD/ARMPA, is to enhance cooperation with the states by seeking to better align the BLM’s RMPs with individual state plans and/or conservation measures (e.g., Conservation Plan for Greater Sage-Grouse in Utah; Utah Executive Order 1For example, this 2018 planning process builds on the 2015 planning process and will continue to ensure that the BLM complies with its special status species policy, including the commitment to “implement measures to conserve [Special Status] species and their habitats… and promote their conservation and reduce the likelihood and need for such species to be listed pursuant to the ESA.” (BLM Manual 6840, Special Status Species Management) 2. Alternatives EO/2015/002, Utah Sage-Grouse Compensatory Mitigation Program), the BLM carefully evaluated the State’s evaluation of issues. This planning process does not revisit every issue that the BLM evaluated in 2015. Instead, the BLM now addresses refinements to the 2015 ROD/ARMPA decisions, consistent with the BLM’s purpose and need for action. Accordingly, this RMPA/EIS has as its foundation in the comprehensive 2015 Final EIS and ROD/ARMPA, and incorporates those documents by reference—including the entire range of alternatives evaluated through the 2015 planning process: • Alternative A (No-Action Alternative) would have retained the management goals, objectives and direction specified in the BLM RMPs and the Forest Service land and resource management plans effective prior to the 2015 ROD/ARMPA. • Alternative B was based on the conservation measures developed by the National Technical Team planning effort in Washington Office IM 2012-044. As directed in the IM, the conservation measures developed by the National Technical Team must be considered and analyzed, as appropriate, through the land use planning process and NEPA by all BLM state and field offices that contain occupied Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. Most management actions included in Alternative B would have been applied to PHMA. • Alternative C was based on a citizen groups' recommended alternative and was combined with Alternative F considered by Idaho, Nevada and Northeastern California, Montana, and Oregon. This alternative emphasized improvement and protection of habitat for Greater Sage-Grouse and was applied to all occupied Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. Alternative C would have limited commodity development in areas of occupied GRSG habitat and would have closed or designated portions of the planning area as unavailable for some land uses. • Alternative D, which was identified as the Preferred Alternative in the 2015 Utah Greater Sage-Grouse Draft LUPA/EIS, balanced opportunities to use and develop the planning area and protects Greater Sage-Grouse habitat based on scoping comments and input from Cooperating Agencies involved in the alternatives development process. Protective measures would have been applied to Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. • Alternative E was based on management from the State of Utah’s Conservation Plan for Greater Sage-Grouse in Utah. It incorporated guidance from specific State Conservation strategies and limited management to the State of Utah’s Sage-Grouse Management Areas that included all seasonal habitats of the State’s priority Greater Sage-Grouse populations. • The Proposed LUPA in the 2015 Utah Greater Sage-Grouse Proposed LUPA/Final EIS incorporated guidance from specific State Conservation strategies, as well as additional management based on the National Technical Team recommendations. This alternative emphasized management of Greater Sage-Grouse seasonal habitats and maintaining habitat connectivity to support population objectives. The BLM considered the entire range of alternatives from the 2015 Final EIS to identify issues meriting reconsideration, given the BLM’s goal of enhancing alignment with state plans. In this manner, the BLM will continue to appropriately manage Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat through this planning effort in tandem with the 2015 ROD/ARMPA. 2. Alternatives Further, additional constraints on land uses or development without a documented need would not meet the purpose of SO 3353. The BLM did not discover new information that would indicate the agency should increase the level of conservation, management, and protection to achieve its land use plan objective. As part of the consideration of whether to amend the 2015 Greater Sage-Grouse LUPs, the BLM partnered with the USGS to review the best available information published since January 2015, develop an annotated bibliography of that Greater Sage-Grouse science (Carter et al. 2018; see Section 3.1), and incorporate the information into this EIS. In addition, SO 3353 directs the BLM to promote habitat conservation, while contributing to economic growth and energy independence. As analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS, all of the previously analyzed alternatives, including one proposing constraints stricter than the current management plan, were predicted to result in a loss of development opportunities on public lands. 2.2.2 Making Priority Habitat Management Areas Identical to the State’s Sage-Grouse Management Areas During alternatives development, the interdisciplinary team considered strategies to improve alignment between the BLM’s priority habitat management areas (PHMA) and the State of Utah’s Greater Sage-Grouse management areas (SGMA). This included considering aligning PHMA with the 2013 SGMA boundaries, regardless of whether the SGMA was mapped as habitat, non-habitat, or opportunity area. As noted in Chapter 1, Section 1.5.2, PHMA was developed to align with areas mapped as habitat in the 2013 SGMA to the greatest extent possible. If the BLM were to adopt an alternative with identical PHMA and SGMA boundaries, an unintended consequence would be that PHMA would include a significant amount of areas the State plan identified as non-habitat or opportunity areas; consequently, PHMA management prescriptions would apply to these non-habitat and opportunity areas, which would increase inconsistencies in management, compared with the State’s plan. It would also be inconsistent with BLM planning direction that “when applying leasing restrictions, the least restrictive constraint to meet the resource protection objective should be used” (BLM-H-1601-1 -Land Use Planning Handbook, Appendix C, page 24). This alternative was eliminated from detailed analysis for reasons similar to those discussed in Section 2.2.1 above. In particular, the BLM’s resource management plans are the primary location for management actions to avoid or minimize impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. This includes land use allocations and stipulations for activities such as oil and gas leasing (e.g., no surface occupancy, controlled surface use) and consideration of rights-of-way (e.g., avoidance, exclusion). These allocations are necessary to align with the State’s Greater Sage-Grouse management protocol that “avoidance of disturbance to habitat or birds by an activity is the preferred option” and to “avoid surface disturbance to the greatest degree possible” while “balancing the economic and social needs of the residents of Utah.” The interdisciplinary team determined the approach of matching PHMA and SGMA boundaries would not be consistent with BLM policies or increase alignment with the State’s strategies, compared with other potential adjustments considered in this chapter (e.g., exceptions for PHMA with areas of non-habitat and providing for boundary adjustments). Due to this, the approach was not analyzed in detail. 2.2.3 Use of Other Habitat Maps for PHMA Designation During the scoping, some commenters included requests that the BLM use different habitat maps for use in designating PHMA. Some commenters requested expanding current PHMA to include all areas within 2. Alternatives 5 miles of any occupied lek, while some requested contracting it to only include areas that currently have sagebrush. An approach based on these comments was considered but eliminated from detailed analysis for the reasons discussed below. • The request that any area within 5 miles of a lek be included as PHMA relied on one piece of literature that suggested that impacts from development may extend for 5 miles from occupied leks; however, based on a substantial review of literature regarding lek buffers, the USGS recognized “that because of variation in populations, habitats, development patterns, social context, and other factors, for a particular disturbance type, there is no single distance that is an appropriate buffer for all populations and habitats across the Greater Sage-Grouse range” (Manier et al. 2014). Additionally, making areas within 5 miles of occupied leks PHMA would increase disparity with the State’s plan and strategies, which is not consistent with the purpose and need. Because of this, an alternative that automatically makes any area within 5 miles of occupied leks PHMA was not analyzed in detail. • Some commenters requested that PHMA boundaries be adjusted to include only areas with sagebrush, including omitting areas that could be habitat with treatment. Mapping areas for PHMA as broader polygons is intended to encompass Greater Sage-Grouse habitats used throughout the year by known Greater Sage-Grouse populations. Peer-reviewed literature notes that Greater Sage-Grouse habitat can be described at four scales: a broad geographic range that defines the species distribution, populations/sub-populations, mosaics of seasonal habitats utilized by individuals, and the food and cover attributes at particular sites (see Appendix K of the 2015 ROD/ARMPA). • PHMA are areas that meet some stage of the Greater Sage-Grouse life-cycle requirements, based on best available science. These broad habitat maps are necessary at the resource management plan-scale of planning in order to include a variety of important seasonal habitats and movement corridors that are spread across geographically diverse and naturally fragmented areas. Greater Sage-Grouse use multiple areas to meet seasonal habitat needs throughout the year and the resulting mosaic of habitats (e.g., winter, breeding, nesting, early brood-rearing, late brood-rearing, transitional, and movement corridor habitats) can encompass large areas. Broad habitat maps increase the likelihood that all seasonal habitats (including transition and movement corridors) are included. While areas of non-habitat, in and of themselves, may not provide direct habitat value for Greater Sage-Grouse (e.g., canyons, water bodies, and human disturbances), these areas may be crossed by birds when moving between seasonal habitats. Further, the State of Utah has statutory responsibility to manage Greater Sage-Grouse. Where submitted information and strategies are inconsistent with those used by the State, the BLM has chosen to use the State of Utah’s information based on their knowledge of and responsibility for the management of Greater Sage-Grouse. Using maps that limit PHMA to just sagebrush would increase disparity from the State’s plan and strategies, which is not consistent with the purpose and need. For these reasons, an alternative that shrinks PHMA to just areas with sagebrush was not analyzed in detail. 2.2.4 County Sage-Grouse Management Plans During scoping, some counties requested that Greater Sage-Grouse management be developed on a county-by-county basis to accommodate the differences in habitat and land uses. After review of the various county plans, it was determined an alternative specifically based on these plans not be analyzed in detail for two general reasons: 2. Alternatives 1) Aspects of some county plans are substantially similar to the State’s plans and strategies. Consideration of a separate alternative for these aspects is unnecessary since alignment with the State’s strategies is the purpose of this effort. 2) Some aspects of the county plans are substantially different from the State’s plan and strategies. To the extent that the plans diverge, following those aspects of the county plans would not meet the purpose and need. Since the purpose of this planning effort is to increase alignment with the State strategies, aligning with different approaches would not be consistent with the purpose and need. Additionally, the BLM’s planning regulations note that “where state and local government policies, plans, and programs differ, those of the higher authority will normally be followed” (43 CFR 1610.32(d)). 2.3 DESCRIPTION OF ALTERNATIVES 2.3.1 No-Action Alternative Under the No-Action Alternative, the BLM would not change the management actions from the 2015 Utah Greater Sage-Grouse ROD/ARMPA. Greater Sage-Grouse habitat would continue to be managed under current management direction. Goals and objectives for BLM-administered lands and federal mineral estate would not change. Allowable uses and restrictions pertaining to such activities as mineral leasing and development, lands and realty, and livestock grazing would also remain the same. This alternative includes the designation of Sagebrush Focal Areas (SFAs), PHMA, and GHMA, with corresponding management for each type of area. 2.3.2 Proposed Plan Amendment The Proposed Plan Amendment was developed by modifying the 2018 Draft RMPA/EIS Management Alignment Alternative based on clarifications and modifications that resulted from coordination with the State of Utah, input from other cooperating agencies and public comments, and alignment with BLM policies. It was developed through coordination with the State of Utah and cooperating agencies to increase alignment with the State of Utah’s Greater Sage-Grouse conservation plan and strategies and to support conservation outcomes for Greater Sage-Grouse. The BLM continues to build upon the 2015 planning effort as envisioned in SO 3353 by collaborating with states to improve compatibility between federal management plans and other plans and programs at the state level, while ensuring consistency with the BLM’s multiple use mission. This enhanced cooperation between the BLM and the Utah Governor’s office would lead to improved management and coordination with the State across the range of Greater Sage-Grouse in Utah. The Proposed Plan Amendment focuses management on PHMA to protect the seasonal habitats that support over 95 percent of Greater Sage-Grouse populations in Utah, while removing the designation and management of GHMA. Additionally, PHMA management would be adjusted to maintain avoidance protections while allowing site-specific adjustments to account for the unique nature of habitat types and distribution throughout Utah. Consistent with the notice of Cancellation, which canceled the BLM’s application to withdraw SFA from locatable mineral entry (82 Federal Register 195, October 11, 2017, p. 47248), this alternative would remove the recommendation for withdrawal. The effects of such action are included in Chapter 4. Specific changes between the 2018 Draft RMPA/EIS Management Alignment Alternative and the Final EIS Proposed Plan Amendment are highlighted in gray in Section 2.5 for ease of reference. 2. Alternatives 2.4 COMPARATIVE SUMMARY OF ALTERNATIVES Table 2-1 summarizes and compares how management associated with issues changes between the No-Action Alternative and the Proposed Plan Amendment. In comparing these it is important to clarify that the land use allocations have not changed from those in the 2015 effort (e.g., right-of-way open/avoidance/exclusion, oil and gas open/controlled surface use/no surface occupancy/closed, and salable open/closed). Those allocations are the BLM’s mechanism to avoid disturbance, consistent with the direction in the State’s strategies to first avoid development; rather, the differences are the degree to which local information can be taken into account to determine if a more flexible approach can be applied that to consider development while not impacting Greater Sage-Grouse populations. It is also critical to note that information in this table can be useful in helping the reader understand differences between the No-Action Alternative and the Proposed Plan Amendment; however, there are limitations. The reader is urged to use the information in this table as a quick reference but to read the detailed alternatives and analyses (Section 2.5 and Chapter 4) to understand specific differences. Table 2-1 Comparative Summary of Alternatives Issue No-Action Alternative Proposed Plan Amendment Sagebrush Focal Area • 181,100 acres of SFA • 0 acres of SFA Designations/Withdrawal • Recommended for withdrawal and • Return to underlying management Recommendation prioritized for treatments/livestock (usually PHMA) – no withdrawal permits Administering the  •  No additional disturbance if an area  •  If project design and site conditions  Disturbance and Density  has >3% disturbance or an average  indicate a project will improve  Caps  of >1 facility/640 acres  habitat, exceedances of disturbance  and density caps are allowed  Modifying Habitat Objectives • Values based on standard vegetation • Objective values based on micro-site data, differentiated by populations. vegetation data combined with broad • Adjustments can be made at the vegetation, climatic, and elevation local level based on local science data. • Adjustments can be made at the local level based on local science Waivers, Exceptions, and Modifications (WEMs) for NSO Stipulations • In SFA, no WEMs • In PHMA, only one lease exception and no waivers or modifications. • To grant the exception, the state, BLM, and Fish and Wildlife Service must all agree it will benefit Greater Sage-Grouse • No SFA • Exception and modification in PHMA if the development is in non-habitat and doesn’t indirectly impact habitat • Would still need to apply minimization measures (3%, noise, etc.) • Waiver if the area is no longer PHMA General Habitat Management Areas in Utah • 448,600 acres of GHMA • Includes lek buffers, required design features, net conservation gain, habitat objectives, leasing prioritization • Management in place prior to the 2015 Plan Amendment would remain • 0 acres of GHMA, and removing associated management • Management in place prior to the 2015 Plan Amendment would remain • Avoid indirect impacts on PHMA • Replace seasonal habitat developed outside PHMA by improving habitat in PHMA 2.

If it is determined that the decline is related to a natural population variation, no specific management actions will be required. However, if BLM management actions are determined to cause or contribute to the decline, the BLM manager will apply measures within their implementation-level discretion to mitigate the decline of populations and/or habitats to the area where the trigger has been met. These measures will apply more conservative or restrictive implementation conservation conditions, terms, or decisions within the agencies’ discretion to mitigate the decline of populations and/or habitats. If monitoring indicates the hard trigger is met, a set of specific management actions from the BLM Proposed Plan will immediately be replaced with or adjusted by different management actions in the area where the trigger has been met. Table I.1 of Appendix I identifies the management actions from the BLM Proposed Plan, and the corresponding new management actions that will be immediately implemented to the specific area in the event a hard trigger is met. In addition to these specific changes, the BLM will review available and pertinent data for the area, in coordination Greater Sage-Grouse biologists from multiple agencies including the appropriate State of Utah agency, USFWS, and NRCS, to determine the causal factor(s) and implement a corrective strategy.

The BLM will cooperate with the State to determine appropriate project design and alignment with State policies and requirements, including those regarding compensatory mitigation. The BLM will defer to the appropriate State authority to quantify habitat offsets, durability, and other aspects used to determine the recommended compensatory mitigation action. The BLM will not deny a proposed authorization in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat solely on the grounds that the proponent has not proposed or agreed to undertake voluntary compensatory mitigation.  In cases where waivers, exceptions, or modification may be granted for projects with a residual impact, voluntary compensatory mitigation consistent with the State’s management goals can be one mechanism by which a proponent achieves the RMPA goals, objectives, and waiver, exception, or modification criteria. When a proponent volunteers compensatory mitigation as their chosen approach to address residual impacts, the BLM can incorporate those actions into the rationale used to grant a waiver, exception, or modification. The final decision to grant a waiver, exception, or modification will be based, in part, on criteria consistent with the State’s Greater Sage-Grouse management plans and policies. Issue: Changing Grazing Systems and Prioritization of Grazing Permits Objective SSS-4  Within PHMA, increase the amount and functionality of  Within PHMA, increase the amount and functionality of  seasonal habitats by: Reducing the extent of annual grasslands.  seasonal habitats by: Reducing the extent of invasive annual  grasslands.  2-38 Utah Greater Sage-Grouse Proposed RMPA/Final EIS November 2018 2.

Alternatives 2.6 DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPOSED PLAN AMENDMENT The Proposed Plan Amendment is the Management Alignment Alternative with changes based on a review of public comments received on the Draft RMPA/EIS and special expertise input and comments received from cooperating agencies. Changes in BLM regulations, policy, and guidance were another factor taken into consideration in its development. The Proposed Plan Amendment represents the BLM’s proposed approach for meeting the purpose and need consistent with the agencies’ legal and policy mandates. One change in the Proposed Plan Amendment relates to the modification of the mitigation strategy. The BLM has concluded that FLPMA does not explicitly mandate or authorize the BLM to require public land users to implement compensatory mitigation as a condition of obtaining authorization for the use of BLM-administered lands (see IM 2018-093, Compensatory Mitigation, July 24, 2018). Consistent with that determination, compensatory mitigation must be voluntary unless required by other applicable laws, but the BLM recognizes that state authorities may also require compensatory mitigation. The BLM will consider voluntary compensatory mitigation actions only as a component of compliance with the State of Utah Executive Order 2015/002 (Implementing the Utah Conservation Plan for Greater Sage-Grouse), the Conservation Plan for Sage-Grouse in Utah (as amended), or the State’s Compensatory Mitigation Program, or when offered voluntarily by a project proponent. The BLM will not deny a proposed authorization in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat solely on the grounds that the proponent has not proposed or agreed to undertake voluntary compensatory mitigation. Cooperating with the State The BLM recognizes that Greater Sage-Grouse is a State-managed species, and, in accordance with 43 CFR 24.3(a), that State authority regarding fish and resident wildlife guides how the BLM cooperates with the State in the absence of specific, overriding federal law. Further, the BLM recognizes that state governments have established fish and wildlife agencies that are charged with the responsibility and mandate to implement state statutes for effective, appropriate, and efficient conservation and management of fish and resident wildlife species. Accordingly, the BLM has coordinated with the State to develop a memorandum of agreement (MOA) to guide the application of the mitigation hierarchy and compensatory mitigation actions for future project authorizations in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat on BLM-administered lands. The MOA describes the State’s policies, authorities, and programs for Greater Sage-Grouse conservation and the process regarding how the BLM will incorporate avoidance, minimization, and other recommendations from the State necessary to improve the condition of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat consistent with RMPA goals and objectives, in one or more of the NEPA analysis alternatives. The MOA will be implemented to provide an improvement to Greater Sage-Grouse habitat at a State level (as opposed to a WAFWA Management Zone or a Field Office), in collaboration with applicable partners (e.g., federal, tribal, and state agencies). Generally, and as described in the MOA, when the BLM receives applications for projects in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat, the BLM will notify the State to determine if the State requires or recommends any additional mitigation—including compensatory mitigation—under State regulations, policies, or programs related to the conservation of Greater Sage-Grouse. 2. Alternatives 2.7 PLAN EVALUATION, MONITORING, AND ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT Plan evaluation is the process by which the plan and monitoring data are reviewed to determine if management goals and objectives are being met and if management direction is sound. Land use plan evaluations determine if decisions are being implemented, if mitigation measures are satisfactory, if there are significant changes in the related plans of other entities, if there are new data of significance to the plan, and if decisions should be amended or revised. Monitoring data gathered over time is examined and used to draw conclusions on whether management actions are meeting stated objectives, and if not, why not. Conclusions are then used to recommend whether to continue current management or to identify what changes need to be made in management to meet objectives. The BLM would use land use plan evaluations to determine if the decisions in the RMPA, supported by the accompanying NEPA analysis, are still valid in light of new information and monitoring data. Its evaluations would follow the protocols established by the BLM Land Use Planning Handbook (H-1601-1) or other appropriate guidance in effect at the time the evaluation is initiated. The ARMPA also includes an adaptive management strategy that includes soft and hard triggers and responses. These triggers are not specific to any particular project but identify habitat and population thresholds. Triggers are based on the two key metrics that are being monitored during the life of the RMPA: habitat loss and population declines. Soft triggers represent an intermediate threshold, indicating that management changes are needed at the implementation level to address habitat or population losses. If a soft trigger is tripped during the life of the plans, the BLM’s response would be to apply more conservative or restrictive conservation measures to mitigate for the specific cause in the decline of populations or habitats, with consideration of local knowledge and conditions. The BLM would make these adjustments to prevent tripping a hard trigger, which would signal more severe habitat loss or population declines. Hard triggers represent a threshold indicating that more direct and refined actions are quickly needed to stop a severe deviation from Greater Sage-Grouse conservation objectives set forth in the RMPA. New scientific information could become available, demonstrating that the corrective strategy implemented in response to the hard trigger could be insufficient to stop the severe deviation from Greater Sage-Grouse conservation objectives set forth in the RMPA. If this occurs, the BLM and its partners will review the new scientific information to determine how it may change the causal factor analysis and corrective strategy. If the BLM, in coordination with its partners, concludes that the responses would be insufficient, the BLM will implement necessary management to protect Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat and to ensure that conservation options are not foreclosed in the area where the trigger has been met (e.g., a formal directive akin to BLM Instruction Memorandum 2012043). The BLM would also undertake any appropriate plan amendments or revisions, if necessary. More information regarding the RMPA’s adaptive management strategy can be found in Appendix I. Chapter 3. Affected Environment 3.1 INTRODUCTION The purpose of this chapter is to describe the existing biological, physical, and socioeconomic characteristics of the planning area, including human uses that could be affected by implementing the alternatives described in Chapter 2. The affected environment provides the context for assessing the potential impacts described in Chapter 4. The resource topics in this chapter reflect those that are identified in Table 1-1, Issues and Related Resource Topics, as corresponding to an issue carried forward for detailed analysis in this RMPA/EIS. The BLM analyzed the management situation in full compliance with its regulations and policies. The BLM evaluated inventory and other data and information, partnering with USGS and coordinating extensively with States, to help provide a basis for formulating reasonable alternatives. The BLM described this process in its Report to the Secretary in response to SO 3353 (Aug. 4, 2017). Among other things, the Report describes how the BLM coordinated “with each State to gather information related to the [Secretary’s] Order, including State-specific issues and potential options for actions with respect to the 2015 GRSG Plans and Instruction Memorandums (IMs) to identify opportunities to promote consistency with State plans.” (Report to the Secretary at 3.) This process overlapped to some degree with the BLM’s scoping process, which also assisted the BLM in identifying the scope of issues to be addressed and significant issues, and with coordination with the States occurring after the Report. The geographic extent of this environmental analysis is substantially similar to that in the 2015 Final EIS, with the exception of the portions of the 2015 planning area that were in Wyoming. Approximately 54,800 acres administered by the Ashley National Forest and 22,000 acres administered by the Uinta/Wasatch/Cache National Forest that extended into Wyoming are not part of the planning area for this process. Additionally, approximately 71,900 acres administered by the Sawtooth National Forest in Box Elder County are included in the planning area for this process that were part of the Idaho planning area in 2015. The BLM acknowledges that there have been changes to the landscape since 2015; however, since the context of this analysis covers 2,520,000 acres of BLM-administered lands and 1,497,400 acres of federal mineral estate, the data collected consistently across the range indicate that the extent of these changes is relatively minimal. For example, BLM monitoring data collected using nationally available datasets and analyzed annually at the biologically significant unit (BSU) scale, as outlined in the Greater Sage-Grouse Monitoring Framework (Appendix D of the 2015 ROD/ARMPA), indicate that there has been a less than 1 percent range-wide overall increase in estimated disturbance from 2015 through 2017 on PHMA and IHMA (Idaho Important Habitat Management Area). Moreover, there has been a range-wide overall decrease of less than 1 percent range-wide from 2012 through 2015 in sagebrush availability in PHMA within BSUs. The estimates of habitat management areas burned in 2016 and 2017 indicate an increase in potential habitat availability loss in portions of the range (largely outside of Utah) compared with previous fire seasons; however, the acres lost do not necessarily affect monitored PHMA in BSUs. For this reason, burned acres are most influential at scales below which the environmental analysis has been conducted. 3. Affected Environment Based on available information, including the USGS reports described below, the BLM has concluded that the existing condition is not substantially different from that of 2015; therefore, the data and information presented in the 2015 Final EIS are incorporated into this RMPA/EIS. Actions that have been authorized since the 2015 plan were consistent with the 2015 Final EIS. The BLM would continue to implement the decisions in the 2015 plan unless those decisions are amended. Acreage figures and other numbers were approximated using geographic information systems (GIS) technology; they do not reflect exact measurements or precise calculations. USGS Reports As part of the consideration of whether to amend some, all, or none of the 2015 Greater Sage-Grouse land use plans, the BLM requested the USGS to develop an annotated bibliography of Greater Sage-Grouse science published since January 2015 (Carter et al. 2018)1 and a report that synthesizes and outlines the potential management implications of this new science (Hanser et al. 2018). Following the 2015 plans, the scientific community has continued to improve the knowledge available to inform management actions and an overall understanding of Greater Sage-Grouse populations, habitat requirements, and their response to human activity. The review discussed the science related to six major topics identified by USGS and BLM, as follows: • Multiscale habitat suitability and mapping tools • Discrete human activities • Diffuse activities • Fire and invasive species • Restoration effectiveness • Population estimation and genetics Multiscale Habitat Suitability and Mapping Tools The science developed since 2015 corroborates previous knowledge about Greater Sage-Grouse habitat selection. Advances in modeling and mapping techniques at the landscape scale can help inform allocations and targeting of land management resources to benefit Greater Sage-Grouse conservation. Similar improvements at the site scale facilitate a better understanding of the relationship of grass height to nest success, which indicates the potential need for a reevaluation of the existing habitat objectives (Hanser et al. 2018, p. 2). The BLM has completed a plan maintenance action whereby the agency has clarified its ability to modify the habitat objective indicator values based upon local, site-specific information. Discrete Human Activities The science developed since 2015 corroborates prior knowledge about the impact of discrete human activities on Greater Sage-Grouse. New science suggests that strategies to limit surface disturbance may be successful at limiting range-wide population declines; however, it is not expected to reverse the 1 Internet website: https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr20181008 3. Affected Environment declines, particularly in areas of active oil and gas operations (Hanser et al. 2018, p. 2). This information may have relevance when considering the impact of changes to management actions designed to limit discrete disturbances. Diffuse Activities The science developed since 2015 does not appreciably change prior knowledge about diffuse activities, such as livestock grazing, predation, hunting, wild horses and burros, fences, recreation, and noise; however, some study authors questioned current assumptions, provided refinements, or corroborated existing understanding. Studies have shown that the impacts of livestock grazing vary with grazing intensity and season. Predation from ravens can limit Greater Sage-Grouse populations in areas with overabundant predator numbers or degraded habitats. Applying predator control has potential short-term benefits in small, declining populations; however, reducing human subsidies (i.e., food sources resulting from human activities) may be necessary to generate long-term changes in raven numbers. This is because raven control has produced only short-term declines in local raven populations. Finally, no new insights into the impacts of wild horses and burros, fence collision, recreation, or noise on Greater Sage-Grouse have been developed (Hanser et al. 2018, p. 2). Fire and Invasive Species Science since 2015 indicates that wildfire will continue to threaten Greater Sage-Grouse through loss of available habitat, reductions in multiple vital rates, and declining population trends, especially in the western part of its range. The concepts of resilience after wildfire and resistance to invasion by nonnative annual grasses have been mapped across the sagebrush ecosystem. These concepts inform restoration and management strategies and help prioritize application of Greater Sage-Grouse management resources (Hanser et al. 2018, p. 2). Restoration Effectiveness Since 2015, tools have been developed to help managers strategically place and design restoration treatments where they will have the greatest benefit for Greater Sage-Grouse. Studies conducted in Utah demonstrated that conifer removal benefited Greater Sage-Grouse through increased female survival and nest and brood success. Treatment method and site potential can affect posttreatment vegetation characteristics. Sagebrush manipulation treatments seemed to benefit Greater Sage-Grouse populations and brood-rearing habitat availability, but benefits may be limited to areas with high sagebrush cover at higher elevations and in mountain big sagebrush (A. tridentata vaseyana) communities. Studies indicate that Greater Sage-Grouse populations did not benefit from, or were negatively affected by, prescribed fire and mechanical sagebrush removal. (Hanser et al. 2018, p. 3) Population Estimation and Genetics The accuracy of estimating Greater Sage-Grouse populations has increased. This is because of improved sampling procedures used to complete count surveys at leks and the development of correction factors for potential bias in lek count data. In addition, techniques have also improved to map Greater Sage-Grouse genetic structure at multiple spatial scales. These genetic data are used in statistical models to increase understanding of how landscape features and configuration affect gene flow. This understanding 3. Affected Environment emphasizes the importance of maintaining connectivity between populations to ensure genetic diversity and distribution (Hanser et al. 2018, p. 3). 3.2 RESOURCES AFFECTED In accordance with Chapter 1, Section 1.5, Issues and Related Resource Topics Identified Through Scoping, the following resources may experience potential impacts based on the alternatives considered in Chapter 2.

Affected Environment 3.3 GREATER SAGE-GROUSE Existing conditions for Greater Sage-Grouse in the planning area are described in the 2015 Final EIS in Section 3.3 (Special Status Species – Greater Sage-Grouse, pages 3-4 through 3-44), as well as in the 2016 Sagebrush Focal Areas Withdrawal Draft EIS in Section 3.7.1 (Special Status Species -pages 3-156 through 3-165). This section identifies additions or changes in research and data, specific to the planning area, which has become available in the last 3 years. Based on the Fish and Wildlife Service’s 2015 listing determination, Greater Sage-Grouse is no longer a candidate species for listing; it remains, however, a BLM Utah sensitive species and under Utah law it is classified as an upland game species managed by the UDWR. The State of Utah’s 2015 Wildlife Action Plan identifies the Greater Sage-Grouse as an S3 (on a 1–5 scale). 3.3.1 Greater Sage-Grouse Population Trends As of 2017, there are 366 occupied Greater Sage-Grouse leks in Utah. Long-term population trends were calculated for the 12 population areas using the past 20 years of data in coordination with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources and are presented in Table 3-2, Greater Sage-Grouse Population Trends for Areas in Utah. These trends were calculated for PHMA and General Habitat Management Areas (GHMA) (as identified in the 2015 Approved RMP Amendment) to allow comparisons between the two types of management area designations statewide. Natural fluctuations over time are known to occur in Greater Sage-Grouse populations. In Utah, the populations tend to show a cyclic pattern over a roughly 10-year time frame. As such, short-term population trends are less important than long-term population trends; however, the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, the BLM, and the Forest Service also monitor short-term trends using the adaptive management triggers identified in Appendix I. These triggers include monitoring trends in males per lek on key “trend leks,” as well as comparing very short-term year-to-year population fluctuations. The triggers are designed to identify emerging trends at their earliest stages and include monitoring for potentially different population trends (e.g., long-term gradual declines, sharp drops larger than natural levels, and substantial drops multiple years in a row with little to no increase between). Based on population monitoring data for the 2015–2016 and 2016–2017 years, only the Sheeprocks area has met any of the soft or hard adaptive management triggers. Analysis of the adaptive management data for 2017–2018 was not completed by publication date of this Proposed RMPA/Final EIS. Monitoring associated with the adaptive management triggers demonstrates that short-term trends (between 1 and 10 years) are within the range of anticipated natural variability for all Greater Sage-Grouse populations throughout the state. The exception is the Sheeprocks area, where corrective management has been applied. Table 3-2 demonstrates that, when looking beyond the short-term variability associated with natural population fluctuations, long-term trends indicate that the known population of Greater Sage-Grouse in Utah has been increasing over the last 20 years (approximately two complete population cycles). 3.

F Sheeprocks leks identified as in GHMA are currently in PHMA because of an adaptive management response. The Sheeprocks leks noted in this table as PHMA were in PHMA in the 2015 ROD/ARMPA. Monitoring on those leks met the criteria for a hard trigger, resulting in the leks in portions of the Sheeprocks GHMA being changed to PHMA. Numbers are presented separately to track potentially different trends. G See Appendix 3 for maps depicting how leks are distributed in GHMA, including in relation to land ownership and administration. 3.3.2 Adaptive Management The 2015 Approved RMP Amendment establishes soft and hard triggers for Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and populations (see MA-SSS-7). After evaluating the triggers for 2016 and 2017, eleven of the twelve Greater Sage-Grouse population areas have not met any of the triggers. The Sheeprocks area met the hard trigger and a soft trigger in 2016. The soft trigger criteria met was a population Lambda of less than 1 in 4 consecutive years (2013–2016). The hard trigger criteria met was a population Lambda of less than 1 in 8 of a 10-year period (2008–2017). Both triggers reflect a long-term population decline in the Sheeprocks PHMA. A state-led collaborative effort by the West Desert GRSG Local Working Group identified the potential causes of the population declines as predation and reductions in habitat availability due to fire, conifer encroachment, and invasive annual weeds. In addition, the BLM, in coordination with an interagency team of biologists and the local working group, is evaluating data to 3. Affected Environment document if there are other causes that may be contributing to the decline. Preliminary actions by state and federal agencies have sought to address these threats, including the BLM applying the measures identified in the 2015 Approved RMP Amendment. The major difference in management when meeting the adaptive management trigger was the change to the Sheeprock’s PHMA to align with the boundaries mapped in Alternative B in the 2015 Final EIS. This resulted in 111,900 acres that were mapped as GHMA in the Proposed Plan being changed to be managed as PHMA, with all the corresponding management. Of the changed acres, only 53,900 (48 percent) are BLM-administered lands. The remainder are private (39,300 acres) or state (18,700 acres) lands. 3.3.3 GRSG Interim Seasonal Habitat Models In 2017, an interagency effort to prepare maps of seasonal Greater Sage-Grouse habitat in Utah produced three maps of modeled seasonal habitats. These habitat maps were developed using a database of hundreds of lek locations paired with over 20,000 very high frequency (VHF) radio telemetry locations from Greater Sage-Grouse statewide. The resulting models were created using a method where 85 percent of the Greater Sage-Grouse VHF seasonal locations were captured within the habitat management areas, then the habitat conditions associated with those locations were identified throughout the state. It is important to note that these maps do not reflect occupied seasonal habitats (as identified by UDWR), but areas with vegetation characteristics similar to areas where the VHF locations were located; therefore, these models may not reflect every acre of seasonal habitat used by a given population, but they do identify areas of potential seasonal habitats. The results of this modeling are presented in Figure 3-2, Utah Greater Sage-Grouse Breeding Habitat, Figure 3-3, Utah Greater Sage-Grouse Summer Habitat, and Figure 3-4, Utah Greater Sage-Grouse Winter Habitat. Acreages for these seasonal habitats are presented for PHMA and GHMA in Table 3-3. Breeding habitat is defined as areas used for lekking, nesting, and early brood-rearing from March 1 – June 14. Summer habitat is defined as areas used for brood-rearing from June 15 – August 31. Winter habitat is defined as areas used from November 1–February 29. For additional information on modeling methods, outcomes, and future efforts refer to the 2017 Annual Report for Utah’s GRSG Local Working Groups (Messmer et al. 2018). The models and their associated maps are a preliminary step in a process to improve seasonal mapping throughout Utah. These preliminary models and maps will be updated as additional location data is collected. Currently, an interagency state-wide data collection effort is underway to increase knowledge of how Greater Sage-Grouse populations use the fragmented landscapes throughout Utah; data from this effort will be used to refine the seasonal habitat models and maps. The 2017 seasonal models will be updated using data from global positioning system (GPS) transmitters that are fitted onto individual birds. To date, nearly 350 GPS transmitters have been deployed on Greater Sage-Grouse individuals statewide. Compared to the labor-intensive process of collecting location data from VHF transmitters, the GPS transmitters collect 5 to 10 locations per day throughout the year eliminating the need for staff to physically locate the signal. This will result in over 1 million data points by 2019 that depict how Greater Sage-Grouse move and use different areas on a seasonal basis. This collaborative data collection effort will allow for increased information on seasonal habitat types used by Greater Sage-Grouse and will be used to refine seasonal habitat models and maps for Utah (Messmer et al. 2018). 3.

See Appendix 3 for maps of where the overlapping seasonal habitats intersect with GHMA. 3.3.4 Greater Sage-Grouse Seasonal Habitat Guidelines A study by Dahlgren et al. (2018, In review) develops habitat guidelines for Greater Sage-Grouse in Utah based on local Greater Sage-Grouse locations, differentiated by environmental variations. Their study pairs micro-site vegetation data (percent shrub cover, shrub height, forb cover, forb height, grass cover, grass height, and percent sagebrush composition) and Greater Sage-Grouse presence to spatial data such as climate, landscape vegetation maps, and elevation to formulate empirically-based habitat guidelines for Utah. The results of this study identified three distinct zones of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat conditions named Low, Mid, and High (see Figure 3-1, Utah Greater Sage-Grouse Habitat Objective Zones). For each zone they provide habitat guidelines for percent cover and heights of: sagebrush, shrub, grass, and forbs. According to Dahlgren et al., Greater Sage-Grouse “in Utah selected sites with sparser and lower vegetation conditions than Connelly et al.’s (2000) guidelines.” 3.3.5 Anthropogenic Disturbance Anthropogenic disturbance was discussed in relation to Greater Sage-Grouse populations in the 2015 Final EIS (Section 3.3.5 – Conditions in Population Areas) and in Appendix L (Baseline Disturbance Inventory) of that document. That baseline inventory used a combination of data sources collected at multiple scales, from national-scale data sets to digitized disturbance of mining sites using aerial imagery. Since 2015, the disturbance inventory has been refined in several areas, specifically focusing on PHMA and areas where activities that needed to align with the disturbance cap were proposed. Anthropogenic disturbance has incrementally increased in some areas as a result of updating data sources and implementing projects; however, the more common effect over the last 3 years was that as disturbance data was refined with on-the-ground knowledge, the actual amount of disturbance using site-specific information was less than the amount identified from the coarser-scale data due to the removal of disturbances that were being double counted or not accounting for restored areas. Another common correction during field verification was that the standard buffer-distance associated with linear features (e.g., roads) was usually larger in the estimated calculation than the actual 3. Affected Environment disturbance footprint. Based on the current disturbance inventory maintained by the BLM Utah, no PHMA in any of the population areas has disturbance that is greater than 1.5 percent (see Table 3-4). In addition to refining the disturbance inventory in portions of the planning area, implementing the disturbance cap over the last 3 years has provided valuable information related to its on-the-ground effect of protecting Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. As noted in Section 1.3, PHMA in Utah were specifically designed to include more than just the areas of high-quality sagebrush types. Because of the interspersed nature of habitat, non-habitat, and potential habitat in Utah’s PHMA, it became evident that applying a static disturbance cap was resulting in missed opportunities to improve habitat conditions for local populations. While calculating disturbance for some projects, the BLM determined that after applying avoidance and minimization measures, remaining disturbance to habitat could have been offset by well-designed habitat improvement projects. Such projects could have created habitat for local Greater Sage-Grouse populations, replacing habitat that would have been lost to the proposed disturbances. Lessons learned from these on-the-ground experiences have been incorporated into the development of the Proposed Plan Amendment. Table 3-4 Inventoried Disturbance in Greater Sage-Grouse Habitat Management Areas. Population Area  Total Acres  PHMA Disturbance Acres  Percent Disturbance  Total Acres  GHMA* Disturbance Acres  Percent Disturbance  Bald Hills  326,400  3,765  1.2%  21,200  427  2.0%  Box Elder  1,227,800  4,059  0.3%  0  0  - Carbon  259,400  3,548  1.4%  198,600  3,238  1.6%  Emery  80,500  358  0.4%  11,400  126  1.1%  Hamlin Valley  143,700  1,071  0.7%  0  0  - Ibapah  88,800  455  0.5%  10,800  81  0.8%  Panguitch  343,900  3,953  1.1%  37,500  144  0.4%  Parker Mountain  741,300  5,757  0.8%  0  62  - Rich  1,015,400  6,039  0.6%  197,900  1,485  0.8%  Sheeprocks  646,600  4,322  0.7%  184,500  1,940  1.1%  Strawberry  161,500  646  0.4%  20,600  52  0.3%  Uintah  565,600  5,403  1.0%  989,400  12,529  1.3%  Statewide  5,600,900  39,376  0.7%  1,671,900  20,084  1.2%  3.4 AIR QUALITY Existing conditions for air quality in the planning area are described in the 2015 Final EIS in Section 3.4 (Air Quality, page 3-44). This section identifies additions or changes which are applicable to the analysis and decision-making process. On October 26, 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a Final Rule adjusting the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone (O3) from 75 parts per million to 70 parts per million. This results in a change in the cited NAAQS noted on page 3-45 and 3-48 (Table 3.5) in the 2015 Final EIS. This does not change whether there were exceedances, as presented in Table 3.5 of the 2015 Final EIS, nor does it change the conclusions of the impact analysis for air quality. Table 3.5 of the 2015 Final EIS has been updated with data from 2014–2017, and is included below as Table 3-5. 3.

Affected Environment On December 20, 2017, the EPA sent Utah Governor Gary Herbert a letter responding to the state’s recommendations in relation to designating Nonattainment areas for ozone in the state. In their letter, the EPA noted the following: “After considering Utah’s September 29, 2016 ozone designation recommendations, which were based on 2013-2015 air quality data, as well as other relevant technical information (including 2014-2016 air quality data), the EPA intends to designate Salt Lake and Davis Counties as Nonattainment for ozone. Additionally, the EPA intends to designate portions of Weber, Tooele, Utah, Uintah, and Duchesne, Counties (including both state and tribal land) as Nonattainment for ozone.” In August 2018 the EPA designated portions of Duchesne and Uintah Counties as nonattainment for ozone. Additionally, all federal actions in nonattainment areas, including those on BLM-administered lands, must comply with General Conformity Rules under the Clean Air Act to demonstrate that the action conforms with state or federal implementation plans. A 1-year grace period for conformity determinations is allowed for newly designated nonattainment areas, beginning August 2019 for the Uinta Basin nonattainment area. Air regulatory agencies have 36 months to meet the NAAQS or to develop an implementation plan to bring the area back into compliance with the standard. The BLM is participating in the Uinta Basin Ozone Working Group, which includes tribal and government decision-makers, stakeholders, and other experts. The mission of the Uinta Basin Ozone Working Group is to prevent a moderate nonattainment designation in 2021, by identifying economically and effective measures at reducing ozone pollution in the Uinta Basin. Over time the problem-solving efforts of the Uinta Basin Ozone Working Group and implementation plans will help improve air quality in the nonattainment areas. 3.5 VEGETATION (INCLUDING NOXIOUS WEEDS, RIPARIAN AND WETLANDS) Existing conditions for vegetation in the planning area are described in the 2015 Final EIS in Section 3.8 (Vegetation, page 3-64), as well as in the 2016 Draft EIS (BLM 2016), Chapter 3, Sections 3.6.2 (Vegetation Communities – page 3-133) and Section 3.6.3 (Invasive and Noxious Species – page 3-138). This section identifies additions or changes which are applicable to the analysis and decision-making process. In the 2015 Greater Sage-Grouse ARMPA the BLM committed to “increase the amount and functionality of seasonal habitats” (Objective SSS-4) by implementing vegetation and fuels treatments (see also MASSS-VEG-1, MA-SSS-VEG-2, MA-SSS-VEG-3, MA-SSS-VEG-4, and MA-FIRE-3). Consistent with this management, the BLM has continued to implement projects to restore or improve Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. Table 3-6 identifies the treatments conducted in the past 5 years in Utah specifically to manage for Greater Sage-Grouse. These projects are developed at the local level and are designed to improve the resistance and resilience of sagebrush habitats. Many of these projects are implemented through the State of Utah’s Watershed Restoration Initiative partnership. As the BLM has implemented its 2015 ROD/ARMPA, project proponents have contributed funds to the Watershed Restoration Initiative to help complete portions of some of these projects to be able to document that their individual projects meet the net conservation gain mitigation strategy. While important, none of those inputs have been a deciding factor for whether a project could be implemented 3. Affected Environment or not; the largest financial contributors to completion of these habitat improvement projects has been the BLM and the State of Utah. Table 3-6 Acres of Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation Actions Fiscal Year  Conifer Removal  Fuel Breaks  Invasive Species Removal  Habitat Protection  Habitat Restoration  Total  2013  8,463  805  1,502  538  5,073  16,381  2014  32,255  2,902  0  2,439  19,626  57,222  2015  16,505  4,150  1,494  10,148  32,297  2016  53,566  0  480  3,108  16,617  73,771  2017  51,219  2,001  10,391  24,991  1,800  90,402  Total  162,008  9,858  12,373  32,570  53,264  270,073  Source: National Fuels Reporting Operations Reporting System (NFPORS) It is also critical to note that the acreages noted in Table 3-6 are applicable only to BLM-administered lands. Additional treatments are conducted by private landowners on their own lands, either through their own means or through contacts with the Natural Resources Conservation Service, by the State of Utah on State and SITLA lands, and by the Forest Service. Treatments on the other lands are often coordinated through the State-run Watershed Restoration Initiative and Local Working Groups. As noted in the table, the majority of treated acres relate to removal of encroaching conifer and restoring habitat. These treatments are intended to improve the condition of and connectivity between habitat patches. There are approximately 7.3 million acres mapped as PHMA and GHMA in Utah. According to state-wide LANDFIRE vegetation data reflecting existing vegetation, there are 3.1 million acres (approximately 41 percent) of these areas that are associated with vegetation communities that do not include sagebrush as either the dominant vegetation type or as a primary component species. The PHMA boundaries were drawn at a broad scale; thus, they include interspersed areas of habitat and non-habitat (see Appendix K). Most of the areas of non-habitat are predominantly small tracts of vegetation that could be used for transitional zones or that could be affected by public land uses, in concert with adjacent tracts of habitat. However, some of these non-habitat areas in PHMA are so large that they are unlikely to provide habitat for Greater Sage-Grouse populations. 3.6 OTHER SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES Existing conditions for other special status species in the planning area are described in the 2015 Final EIS in Section 3.9 (Other Special Status Species, page 3-99), as well as in the 2016 Draft EIS (BLM 2016), Chapter 3, Sections 3.6.1 (Special Status Species -page 3-128). This section identifies changes which are applicable to the analysis and decision-making process. Table 3.33 in the 2015 Final EIS, the following species are no longer federally listed as threatened, endangered, proposed, petitioned, and candidate plant and animal species in the planning area: • Greater Sage-Grouse • Coral Pink Sand Dunes tiger beetle • Least chub • Boreal toad 3.

This section identifies changes which are applicable to the analysis and decision-making process. The acreage associated with the 19 herd management areas presented in Table 3.42 in the 2015 Final EIS are still accurate, however, the current size estimates have changed. Table 3-7 displays the 2018 population estimates in comparison to appropriate management level by each herd management area. In addition, the table shows the last date a gather was conducted on the given herd management areas. Table 3-7 Wild Horses and Burros Population Levels Herd Management Area  Upper Appropriate Management Level Horses Burros  Current Herd Size (2018 Estimate) Horses Burros  Last Gather (month/year)  Sage-Grouse Population Area  Bible Spring  60  0  154  0  Feb-18  Hamlin Valley  Canyon Lands  0  100  0  210  N/A  Cedar Mountain  390  0  784  0  Feb-17  N/A  Chloride Canyon  30  0  133  0  Jul-17  N/A  Chokecherry  30  0  229  0  Jan-11  Hamlin Valley  Confusion  115  0  465  0  Sep-10  N/A  Conger  80  0  158  0  May-17  N/A  Four Mile  60  0  49  0  Feb-18  Hamlin Valley  Frisco  60  0  166  0  Jan-17  N/A  Kingtop  40  0  12  0  N/A  Mount Elinor  25  0  128  0  Jan-11  N/A  Muddy Creek  125  0  189  0  Jul-09  N/A  North Hills  36  0  232  0  Dec-10  N/A  Onaqui Mountain  210  0  457  0  Feb-12  Sheeprocks  Range Creek  125  0  378  0  Jul-06  Carbon  Sinbad  0  70  0  150  Apr-16  N/A  Sulphur  250  0  974  0  Jan-17  Hamlin Valley  Swasey  100  0  372  0  Feb-13  N/A  Tilly Creek  50  0  59  0  Feb-18  Hamlin Valley  Total  1,786  170  4,939  360  N/A  N/A  3.8 WILDLAND FIRE MANAGEMENT Existing conditions associated with wildland fire in the planning area are described in the 2015 Final EIS in Section 3.14 (Wildland Fire Management, page 3-154). This section identifies changes which are applicable to the analysis and decision-making process. The geographic extent of fire and fuels analysis is the same as that of the 2015 Final EIS. The BLM acknowledges that there have been changes in vegetation modified by fires and fuels since the 2015 Final 3. Affected Environment EIS. Habitat loss to fire and fuels was covered in the 2015 EIS. Fire and fuels reductions have and continue to occur. From 2015-2017 there have been 192 additional wildfires that have burned approximately 61,300 acres of Greater Sage-Grouse PHMA and GHMA (see Table 3-8 and Table 3-9). Nearly 86 percent of the wildfires were fully suppressed before they reached 10 acres in size. Table 3-8 Wildfires in Greater Sage-Grouse Habitat Management Areas (2015–2017) PHMA GHMA Size Class Number Number Population Population Areas Affected of Fires of Fires Areas Affected A -0 to .25 acres 80 Bald Hills, Box Elder, Carbon, Emery, 32 Carbon, Rich, Hamlin, Panguitch, Parker, Rich, Sheeprocks, Sheeprocks, Strawberry, Uintah Strawberry, Uintah B -.26 to 9.9 acres 34 Bald Hills, Box Elder, Emery, Panguitch, 19 Carbon, Rich, Parker, Rich, Sheeprocks, Strawberry, Sheeprocks, Uintah Uintah C – 10 to 99 acres 11 Bald Hills, Box Elder, Carbon, Rich, 4 Carbon, Sheeprocks, Uintah Sheeprocks, Uintah D – 100 to 299 acres 6 Box Elder, Rich, Sheeprocks 0 N/A E – 300 to 999 acres 2 Parker, Rich 0 N/A F – 1000 to 4999 acres 3 Parker, Sheeprocks 0 N/A G – 5000+ acres 1 Box Elder 0 N/A Total 137 55 Source: BLM GIS Data Table 3-9 Acres of Wildfire in PHMA and GHMA (2015–2017) Population Area PHMA GHMA Total Bald Hills 14 0 14 Box Elder 32,456 0 32,456 Carbon 0 43 43 Emery 325 23 348 Hamlin Valley 0 0 0 Ibapah 0 00 Panguitch 9,192 0 9,192 Parker Mountain 3,526 0 3,526 Rich 725 0 725 Sheeprocks 11,764 11 11,776 Strawberry 0 0 0 Uintah 417 2,765 3,182 Total 58,419 2,842 61,262 Source: BLM GIS Data 3. Affected Environment In the same time period, approximately 173,100 acres in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat management areas have been treated to improve habitat for the species. Since the BLM’s 2015 plan amendment was completed for Utah, more acres in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat management areas have been treated with the goal of improving/creating habitat than has been lost to wildfire. Based on published accounts in Utah, treated areas can be quickly used by Greater Sage-Grouse as habitat, and can improve Greater Sage-Grouse vital rates (Sandford et al. 2017; Sandford et al. 2015). 3.9 WILDERNESS CHARACTERISTICS Inventories for wilderness characteristics noted below were conducted between 1999 and the present and reflect the most up-to-date lands with wilderness characteristics baseline information for this planning area. In addition to the inventories conducted for the purposes of land use planning, lands with wilderness characteristics inventories will be updated for site-specific project environmental analyses that are conducted in the planning area to determine if a project will have impacts on lands with wilderness characteristics identified through previous or updated inventory efforts. There are 52 units totaling 197,240 acres of BLM-administered lands in PHMA or GHMA outside of wilderness and WSAs that have been inventoried and found to have wilderness characteristics. Of those, 13 units totaling 52,240 acres are natural areas2 managed for wilderness characteristics protection in the Greater Sage-Grouse Uintah Population Area (e.g., some land uses are restricted or prohibited under the Vernal RMP). The remaining 145,000 acres in 39 units are lands with wilderness characteristics where the BLM has made a determination not to apply specific management to protect the wilderness characteristics or are areas where no determination has yet been made in an RMP (see 2015 Final EIS Map 3.15-1). Table 3-10 summarizes natural areas that overlap mapped PHMA habitat. GHMA habitat does not overlap any identified lands with wilderness characteristics that are managed to protect those characteristics (natural areas). Tables 3-11 and 3-12 summarize lands with wilderness characteristics that overlap PHMA and GHMA, respectively. Table 3-10 Natural Areas Overlapping PHMA Acres Overlapping Population Natural Area PHMA Area Bourdette Draw  6,231  Uintah  Bull Canyon  2,473  Uintah  Cold Spring Mountain  4,553  Uintah  Daniels Canyon  2,115  Uintah  Dead Horse Pass  886  Uintah  Diamond Breaks  507  Uintah  Diamond Mountain  24,469  Uintah  Lower Flaming Gorge  1,812  Uintah  Moonshine Draw  3,679  Uintah  2 In Utah, natural areas are lands with wilderness characteristics outside of WSAs that are identified in approved RMPs to be managed to maintain, preserve and protect those characteristics. This is an effort to recognize these discretionary decisions with a better, simpler reference. Wilderness Areas and WSAs are formal designations that are managed in a prescribed manner. To avoid confusing these official designations with discretionary decisions, the BLM Utah uses this term to distinguish between formal designations (e.g., Wilderness Areas) and a discretionary management category (i.e., natural areas). 3.

Since 2015, BLM has continued to manage livestock according to the grazing regulations (C.F.R. 4100) and the direction in the various RMPs. In general, the existing conditions of livestock grazing in Utah remain the same as described in the 2015 Final EIS. BLM has continued to issue grazing permit renewals consistent with the regulation and in conformance with the RMPs, including the management in the 2015 ROD/ARMPA. 3.11 RECREATION The existing condition of recreation in the planning area is described in the 2015 Final EIS in Section 3.17 (pgs. 3-171 through 3-177). In general, recreation activities and levels in Utah remains the same as described in the 2015 EIS. BLM Utah has continued to issue special recreation permits at levels commensurate with the 2015 numbers. Special recreation permits authorized since 2015 have been in conformance with the actions in the 2015 amendment, resulting in neutral effects on Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat. 3. Affected Environment Panguitch Population Area On December 4, 2017, portions of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument were modified by Proclamation 9682. Prior to the modification, approximately 5,860 acres of PHMA in the Panguitch Population Area overlapped the monument. After the modification, approximately 1,900 acres of PHMA overlap the monument boundaries. Given the dispersed nature of the recreation in the area of overlap it is not anticipated that the reduction will substantively change the nature or level of recreation on the acres of PHMA that no longer overlap the monument. Sheeprocks Population Area Due to the broad-scale nature of the state-wide habitat mapping efforts, portions of the GHMA identified in 2015 overlapped areas previously designated as open for cross-country OHV use. Portions of the Five Mile Pass area were designated as open to cross-country OHV use through a land use plan amendment that was completed in 1992. Since that time, the Five Mile Pass area has provided an important destination for motorized recreation. A portion of the designated open area was changed to limited as part of the 2015 amendment, creating a managerial conflict with an area recognized as a destination recreation resource for over 20 years. Similarly, the Little Sahara Recreation Area was designated as open to cross-country OHV use in the sandy areas associated with the large dune complex. Like Five Mile Pass, this area is a recognized and well-known destination for motorized recreation and has been since before completion of the House Range Resource Area Resource Management Plan in 1987. Due to mapping in the 2015 Greater Sage-Grouse effort, small portions around the periphery of the designated recreation area were mapped as GHMA and OHV use was limited to existing routes. The 2015 amendment that changed the OHV area designation to “limited to existing routes” created a managerial conflict for this designated recreation area. 3.12 COMPREHENSIVE TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT The existing condition of the travel and transportation network in the planning area is described in the 2015 Final EIS in Section 3.18 (pgs. 3-177 through 3-180). The language in the 2015 Final EIS is still applicable, with the following changes and information available since 2015. Table 3.62 of the 2015 Final EIS displays OHV designations; those were changed as part of the September 2015 ROD/ARMPA. The updated acres are in MA-TTM-1 in the 2015 ROD/ARMPA, and are also shown in Chapter 2 of this RMPA/EIS under MA-TTM-1 for the No Action Alternative. These area designations related to the conflicts identified in the recreation section above for the Five Mile Pass and Little Sahara areas. Another change since the 2015 Final EIS was initiation of several travel management processes throughout the State of Utah, including several that overlap portions of both PHMA and GHMA in the Carbon, Uintah, and Sheeprocks areas. These implementation-level planning processes will address route designations and consideration of the travel network in areas that overlaps PHMA and some GHMA. 3.13 LANDS AND REALTY The existing condition of Lands and Realty in the planning area is described in the 2015 Final EIS in Section 3.19 (Lands and Realty, pgs. 3-180 thru 3-190). The lands and realty program is essentially the 3. Affected Environment same as was described in the 2015 Final EIS and the program’s impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse are also essentially the same. Land use authorization requests are customer driven. Within the planning area most authorizations processed are primarily for roads, electric distribution lines, small buried fiber optic lines, and communications sites. Occasionally ROWs are sought for major transmission lines (e.g., 500 kV electric transmission), large-scale pipeline projects, and other similar infrastructure to transport resources through the state. Since 2015, several site-specific lands and realty actions have been completed while conforming to the avoidance, minimization (e.g., disturbance cap, tall structure, required design features, etc.), and compensation management in the 2015 ROD/ARMPA. This has included installing new local distribution power lines, adding new communication infrastructure to existing developed communication sites, development of pipelines that are aligned with existing disturbance and development of fiber-optic lines. Additionally, two large interstate transmission line projects have been approved, both of which transverse a portion of both PHMA and GHMA. Construction has not yet begun on the TransWest Express Transmission Project. A description of the impacts of these projects on Greater Sage-Grouse is available in the associated environmental documents for each project. A smaller (138 kV) intrastate transmission line in southern Utah was approved during development of the 2015 ROD/ARMPA and construction is nearing completion. Several sections of the 2015 Final EIS Chapter 3 for lands and realty displays land management decisions that predated completion of the 2015 ROD/ARMPA (e.g., avoidance and exclusion areas, number and acres of designated right-of-way corridors). Those numbers were changed as part of the September 2015 ROD/ARMPA. The updated acres are in the corresponding sections of the 2015 ROD/ARMPA. 3.14 RENEWABLE ENERGY The existing condition of renewable energy in the planning area is described in the 2015 Final EIS in Section 3.20 (Renewable Energy, pgs. 3-190 thru 3-199). Similar to lands and realty, land use authorization requests for renewable energy projects are generally customer driven. The renewable energy program is essentially the same as was described in the 2015 Final EIS based on the generally low potential for renewable energy development on Greater Sage-Grouse habitat in the state. One new project since 2015 relates to a potential lease of an area north of the Bald Hills population for solar development. The consideration of that project is concurrent with this planning effort. 3.15 LEASABLE MINERALS (OIL AND GAS, NONENERGY LEASABLE MINERALS, COAL, AND OIL SHALE AND TAR SANDS) Development of mineral resources has continued since 2015, largely focusing on maintaining existing operations while in some instances beginning the exploratory studies for expansion of existing operations. As a resource whose development is largely controlled by market demand, there has not been substantial changes in demand for leasable minerals since 2015. Based on these minimal changes, the existing conditions are essentially the same as described in the 2015 EIS. 3.15.1 Oil and Gas Information related to mineral potential has not changed since the 2015 Final EIS. That information can be found in the 2015 Final EIS in Chapter 3, Section 3.21.1 in a series of tables applicable to the decision area, as well as four Greater Sage-Grouse population areas with high oil and gas development potential. 3. Affected Environment Tables that include oil and gas leasing categories and the acres of existing leases, leases held by production, and number of wells are updated below (Tables 3-13 through 3-22). The text surrounding the various tables is either repetitive of the table’s content, or still describes the area’s situation. Table 3-13 Oil and Gas Federal Activity in the Decision Area (as of March 2018) PHMA GHMA Decision Area Existing Oil and Gas Leases (acres) 127,949 245,981 373,930 Leases Held by Production (acres) 33,224 188,164 221,388 Percent Held by Production 26% 77% 59% Number of Existing Wells 234 931 1,165 Source: BLM 2018 Table 3-14 Oil and Gas Leasing Categories in the Decision Area Category PHMA GHMA Decision Area Open to leasing, subject to standard terms 0 188,600 188,600 and conditions CSU and/or TL 0 261,300 261,300 NSO 3,023,700 28,600 3,052,300 Closed to Leasing 100,400 27,800 128,200 Source: BLM 2015 (ARMPA data sets) Table 3-15 Oil and Gas Federal Leases and Wells in the Uintah Population Area (as of March 2018) PHMA GHMA Decision Area Existing Oil and Gas Leases (acres) 50,683 197,418 248,101 Leases Held by Production (acres) 9,503 153,381 162,884 Percent Held by Production 19% 78% 66% Number of Existing Wells 55 606 661 Source: BLM 2018 Table 3-16 Oil and Gas Leasing Categories in the Uintah Population Area Category PHMA GHMA Decision Area Open to leasing, subject to standard terms 0 104,000 104,000 and conditions CSU and/or TL 0 206,200 206,200 NSO 341,100 6,300 347,400 Closed to Leasing 56,400 12,400 68,800 Source: BLM 2015 (ARMPA data sets) 3.

Because Alternative A (no action) was not selected in 2015, those numbers do not reflect the reasonably foreseeable development scenario given existing management in the 2015 ROD/ARMPA. The correct reasonably foreseeable development scenario for the 2015 Final EIS Proposed Plan is in Appendix R of that document. For this planning process, the reader is referred to Table R.1, Table R.2, and Table R.7 in the 2015 Final EIS Appendix R. 3.15.2 Nonenergy Leasable Minerals Information related to mineral potential has generally not changed since completion of the 2015 Final EIS and can be found in Section 3.21.2 on page 3-208. A reference to a current leaseholder for a phosphate mine in PHMA is no longer accurate, since the company JR Simplot has changed its name to Simplot Phosphates LLC. This change, while making the document more accurate, does not change the existing environment and its relationship to the impact analysis. Two aspects related to phosphate leasing were not specifically addressed in the 2015 Final EIS that have been raised during public comment on the 2018 Draft RMPA/EIS: fringe acreage leases and prospecting permits. Page 3-208 of the 2015 Final EIS defines a fringe acreage lease, but the language stops short of noting the regulatory rights the holder of existing federal leases or mineral rights on adjacent private lands has to obtain the rights to such lands via a fringe acreage lease or a lease modification (43 CFR 3510.11). Such regulations would be considered in combination with management in the 2015 ROD/ARMPA, as amended by this planning process, when considering future requests for leases. 3. Affected Environment Page 3-208 of the 2015 Final EIS also addresses a preference right lease as a variety of a noncompetitive lease associated with a prospecting permit. As noted in the Mineral Leasing Act, Section 9(b), if the results of a prospecting permit are able to demonstrate that “valuable deposits of phosphate have been discovered within the area covered by his permit, the permittee shall be entitled to a lease for any or all of the land embraced in the prospecting permit.” As noted on page 3-211 of the 2015 Final EIS, there are pending prospecting permit applications in PHMA. All these prospecting permits are outside the Ashley-Brush Creek Known Phosphate Leasing Area, and most of the acreage is east of and beyond the areas with mapped high, moderate, or low phosphate development potential. In addition, the areas with pending prospecting permits overlap or are within 1 mile of 12 occupied Greater Sage-Grouse leks (approximately 39 percent of occupied leks in the Diamond Mountain proper area). The pending permits also bisect areas with nine occupied leks to the south and 10 occupied leks to the north or east. Finally, the prospecting permits are in an area where mining techniques (surface vs. underground) that would be used are unclear, based on the amount of overburden and considering the existing phosphate mining methods in the region and more broadly in the United States. 3.15.3 Coal Information related to mineral potential has generally not changed since completion of the 2015 Final EIS, and can be found in Section 3.21.3 on page 3-212. One change since the 2015 Final EIS is the removal of portions of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. The 2015 Final EIS notes that coal inside the monument boundaries is unacceptable for coal leasing. While the December 2017 proclamation may reduce the size of the monument’s boundaries, the specific management of those areas has not been determined and can therefore not be reported here. 3.15.4 Oil Shale and Tar Sands Information related to mineral potential has not changed substantively since completion of the 2015 Final EIS, and can be found in Section 3.21.6 on page 3-217. An environmental document has been prepared to consider various rights-of-way across BLM-administered land in association with a potential oil shale project on private property. 3.15.5 Locatable Minerals Existing conditions were described in the 2015 Final EIS in section 3.21.4 pages 3-215 through 3-216. Since FY2016 there has been an increase in the number of mining claims located in the State of Utah. The majority of those mining claims are located outside PHMA and GHMA, though there were two concentrations of new claims in the Sheeprocks area, with one concentration in the northeast GHMA portion and one in the southwest PHMA portion. In addition, since the completion of the 2015 Final EIS, thirteen locatable mineral notices have been accepted and four plans of operations authorized; however, only one notice is within either PHMA or GHMA, situated on the eastern edge PHMA in the Sheeprocks area. 3.16 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS The Socioeconomic conditions within the planning area are described in the 2015 Final EIS in Section 3.23(Social and Economic Conditions (Including Environmental Justice), pgs. 3-321 through thru 3-267). Social and economic conditions are further identified in the Draft EIS for the Sagebrush Focal Area 3. Affected Environment withdrawal in 2016, Chapter 3, Section 3.5 (Social and Economic Conditions), page 3-9, and specifically Section 3.5.17, Section 3.5.18, and Section 3.5.19. BLM-administered lands provide a range of goods and services that benefit society in a variety of ways. Some of these goods and services, such as timber and minerals, are bought and sold in markets, and hence have a readily observed economic value (as documented in the sections above); others have a less clear connection to market activity, even though society derives benefits from them. In some cases, goods and services have both a market and a nonmarket component value to society. The socioeconomic conditions in Utah are essentially the same as described in the 2015 EIS, with the following changes. Since 2015, all counties in Utah have prepared county-specific RMPs to identify the county’s vision for management of public lands within their borders. This updates information on page 3-241 of the 2015 Final EIS Chapter 3. These plans are recognized and named in Chapter 1. The 2015 Final EIS assumed that the federal portion of the Alton coalfield would start production on federal minerals in 2016 (see page 3-255). This did not occur and the environmental review of the lease nomination is not complete. Since 2015, there have been some changes in market conditions with respect to demand and prices of major mineral commodities that are commonly extracted in Utah. Prices for crude oil have risen to some degree, although prices for natural gas have remained fairly steady at a low level. In addition to these market factors, normal fluctuations in the prices of other commodities such as gold and other minerals will continue to play a role in the degree to which new exploration, development, and production will occur in Utah. The most up-to-date, detailed statistics and trends have been published in the 2018 Economic Report to the Governor, prepared by the Utah Economic Council (this report is available online at http://gardner.utah.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018-ERG-Report.pdf). 3. Affected Environment This page intentionally left blank. Chapter 4. Environmental Consequences 4.1 INTRODUCTION This chapter presents the anticipated direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on the environment from implementing the alternatives in Chapter 2. The purpose of this chapter is to describe to the decision-maker and the public how the environment could change if either of the alternatives are implemented. It is meant to aid in the decision of which RMPA, if any, to adopt. This chapter is organized by topic, based on the affected resources identified in Chapters 1 and 3. Only those issues listed in Table 1-3 are carried forward for analysis in this chapter. Impact analysis is a cause-and-effect process. The detailed impact analyses are based on the following: • The BLM planning team’s knowledge of resources and the planning area • Literature reviews • Information provided by experts in the BLM, other agencies, cooperating agencies, interest groups, and concerned citizens The baseline used for the impact analysis is the current condition or situation, as described in Chapter 3. Impacts on resources and resource uses are analyzed and discussed commensurate with resource issues and concerns identified through the NEPA process. At times, impacts are described in qualitative terms or using ranges of potential impacts. 4.2 ANALYTICAL ASSUMPTIONS Several overarching assumptions have been made in order to facilitate the analysis of the potential impacts. These assumptions set guidelines and provide reasonably foreseeable projected levels of development that would occur in the planning area during the planning period. These assumptions should not be interpreted as constraining or redefining the management objectives and actions proposed for each alternative, as described in Chapter 2. The following general assumptions apply to all resource categories: • Sufficient funding and personnel would be available for implementing the final decision • Implementation-level actions necessary to execute the RMP-level decisions in this RMPA/EIS would be subject to further environmental review, including that under NEPA • Direct and indirect impacts of implementing the RMPA would primarily occur on public lands administered by the BLM in the planning area, though environmental effects may also affect adjacent non-BLM-administered lands; as noted in Chapter 1, the management actions apply only to BLM-administered public lands and mineral estates (minerals-related actions only) • The BLM would carry out appropriate maintenance for the functional capability of all developments 4.Environmental Consequences • The discussion of impacts is based on best available data; Knowledge of the planning area and decision area and professional judgment, based on observation and analysis of conditions and responses in similar areas, are used for environmental impacts where data are limited • Restrictions, such as siting and design features, would apply, where appropriate, to surface-disturbing activities associated with land use authorizations and permits issued on BLM-administered lands and federal mineral estate • GIS data have been used in developing acreage calculations and to generate the figures in Appendix A – Calculations depend on the quality and availability of data – Acreage figures and other numbers are approximate projections for comparison and analysis only; readers should not infer that they reflect exact measurements or precise calculations – In the absence of quantitative data, best professional judgment was used • Impacts were sometimes described using ranges of potential impacts, or they were described qualitatively, when appropriate Analytical assumptions and indicators specific to individual resources and resource uses are the same as those identified in the methods of analysis section for each resource/use in the 2015 Final EIS. Assumptions or indicators specific to this analysis, if any, are presented under the applicable resources/resource uses sections below. 4.3 GENERAL METHOD FOR ANALYZING IMPACTS Potential impacts are described in terms of type, context, duration, and intensity, which are generally defined below. Type of impact—Impacts are characterized using the indicators described at the beginning of each resource impact section. The presentation of impacts for key planning issues is intended to provide the BLM decision-maker and reader with an understanding of the multiple use trade-offs associated with each alternative. Unless otherwise noted, the indicators used in this analysis correspond to the same indicators identified for resources and uses in the 2015 Final EIS. Context—This describes the area or site-specific, local, planning area-wide, or regional location where the impact would occur. Site-specific impacts would occur at the location of the action; local impacts would occur in the general vicinity of the action area; planning area-wide impacts would affect a greater portion of decision area lands in Utah; and regional impacts would extend beyond the planning area boundaries. The geographic extent of this environmental analysis is substantially similar to that in the 2015 Final EIS, with the exception of the portions of the 2015 planning area that were in Wyoming. Approximately 54,800 acres administered by the Ashely National Forest and 22,000 acres administered by the Uinta/Wasatch/Cache National Forest that extended into Wyoming are not part of the planning area for this process. Additionally, approximately 71,900 acres administered by the Sawtooth National Forest in Box Elder County are included in the planning area for this process that were part of the Idaho planning area in 2015. This is a net decrease of approximately 4,900 acres (less than 0.01 percent of the planning area, and 0.12 percent of the decision area). 4.Environmental Consequences Additionally, as a result of implementing the adaptive management triggers, 111,900 acres (2 percent of all PHMA) changed from GHMA to PHMA compared with the 2015 Final EIS. Of this, only 53,900 acres are administered by the BLM (1.6 percent of PHMA on BLM-administered lands). Because of these changes, acreage presented in this Draft EIS may not align with those in the 2015 Final EIS; however, given the small degree of change, the planning and decision area impacts described in the 2015 Final EIS are not different. Differences in potential site-level impacts will be called out as necessary. Duration—This describes the associated time period of an impact, either short term or long term. Unless otherwise noted, short term is defined as anticipated to begin and end within the first 5 years after the action is implemented; long term is defined as lasting beyond 5 years to the end of or beyond the life of this RMPA/EIS. Intensity—Rather than categorizing impacts with qualitative statements (e.g., major, moderate, or minor), this analysis describe the impact and its anticipated duration and context. Quantitative data is used to provide additional detail where possible. Direct and indirect impacts—Direct impacts are caused by an action or implementation of an alternative and occur at the same time and place; indirect impacts result from implementing an action or alternative but usually occur later in time or are removed in distance and are reasonably certain to occur. For ease of reading, the impacts of the management actions for a particular alternative on a specific resource are generally compared with the status quo or baseline for that resource; however, in order to properly and meaningfully evaluate the impacts under each alternative, its expected impacts should be measured against those projected to occur under the No-Action Alternative. This alternative is the baseline for comparing the alternatives to one another. This is because it represents what is anticipated to occur should the RMPAs not take place. Irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources is discussed in Section 4.7, Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitment of Resources. Irreversible commitments of resources result from actions in which resources are considered permanently changed; irretrievable commitments of resources result from actions in which resources are considered permanently lost. 4.4 INCOMPLETE OR UNAVAILABLE INFORMATION The CEQ established implementing regulations for NEPA, requiring that a federal agency identify relevant information that may be incomplete or unavailable for evaluating reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts in an EIS (40 CFR 1502.22). If the information is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives, it must be included or addressed in an EIS, unless the cost of obtaining such information is exorbitant. Knowledge and information is, and would always be, incomplete, particularly with infinitely complex ecosystems considered at various scales. The best available information pertinent to the decisions to be made was used in developing the RMPA/EIS. The BLM and Forest Service have made a considerable effort to acquire and convert resource data into digital format for use in the RMPA/EIS, both from the BLM and Forest Service themselves and from outside sources. 4.Environmental Consequences Under the FLPMA, the inventory of public land resources is ongoing and continuously updated; however, certain information was unavailable for use in developing the RMPA/EIS. This was because inventories either had not been conducted or were not complete. Some of the major types of data that are incomplete or unavailable are the following: • Comprehensive planning area-wide inventory of wildlife and special status species occurrence and condition • GIS data used for disturbance calculations on private lands • A comprehensive inventory of sagebrush lands, which meet the guidelines as recommended by the scientific community. This information is not monitored on a statewide level. • Site-specific surveys of cultural and paleontological resources For these resources, estimates were made concerning their number, type, and significance, based on previous surveys and existing knowledge. In addition, some impacts could not be quantified, given the proposed management actions. Where there was this gap, impacts were projected in qualitative terms or, in some instances, were described as unknown. Subsequent site-specific project-level analyses would provide the opportunity to collect and examine site-specific inventory data to determine appropriate application of LUP-level guidance. In addition, the BLM and other agencies in the planning area continue to update and refine information used to implement this plan. 4.5 IMPACTS FROM THE NO-ACTION ALTERNATIVE The impacts of the No-Action Alternative, or current management, of this RMPA/EIS were analyzed as the Proposed Plan in the 2015 Final EIS, and no new information has been identified that would invalidate or change the results of the existing analysis; therefore, impacts from implementing the No-Action Alternative are substantially the same as those analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS, and are incorporated into this RMPA/EIS by reference. Table 4-1 shows where the description of the impacts of the No-Action Alternative can be found in the 2015 Final EIS, as well as the 2016 Sagebrush Focal Area Draft EIS (BLM 2016). The table is organized by issue, with rows for each resource topic related to the issue. Table 4-1 Environmental Consequences for the No-Action Alternative, Incorporated by Reference Issue  Related Resource Topic  Location  Sagebrush Focal Area  Greater Sage-Grouse  Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7 (Special Status Species –  Designations/Withdrawal  Greater Sage-Grouse, Proposed Plans), page 4-113  Recommendation  Soil Resources  Chapter 4, Section 4.6.2 (Soil Resources, Alternatives  Analysis), page 4-147  Water Resources Chapter 4, Section 4.7.2 (Water Resources, Alternatives Analysis), page 4-151 Vegetation (including Chapter 4, Section 4.8.7 (Vegetation, Proposed Plans), Noxious weeds; page 4-168 Riparian and Wetlands) 4.Environmental Consequences Table 4-1 Environmental Consequences for the No-Action Alternative, Incorporated by Reference Issue  Related Resource Topic  Location  Sagebrush Focal Area  Other Special Status  Chapter 4, Section 4.9.2 (Other Special Status  Designations/Withdrawal  Species  Species, Alternatives Analysis), page 4-172  Recommendation (cont’d)  Fish and Wildlife  Chapter 4, Section 4.10.2 (Fish and Wildlife,  Alternatives Analysis), page 4-184  Cultural Resources  Chapter 4, Section 4.12.2 (Cultural Resources, Alternatives Analysis), page 4-200  Wildland Fire Management  Chapter 4, Section 4.14.7 (Wildland Fire Management, Proposed Plans), page 4-218  Livestock Grazing/ Range Management  Chapter 4, Section 4.16.7 (Livestock Grazing/Range Management, Proposed Plans), page 4-246  Leasable Minerals Locatable Minerals Social and Economic Conditions Tribal Interests  Chapter 4, Section 4.21.1 (Oil and Gas, Proposed Plans), page 4-313 Chapter 4, Section 4.21.4 (Locatable Minerals, Proposed Plans), page 4-352 Further, based on analysis presented in Section 4.2 (Geology and Mineral Resources) of the 2016 Sagebrush Focal Area Draft EIS, withdrawal would not lead to any reduction of mining opportunities compared with not withdrawing.

IMPACTS FROM THE PROPOSED PLAN AMENDMENT Table 4-2, below, is organized by issue, like Table 4-1, and summarizes if and how an action in the Proposed Plan Amendment was previously analyzed in either the 2015 Final EIS or 2016 Draft EIS. The table also identifies if any issue was not sufficiently analyzed and needs further analysis in this RMPA/EIS. If issues require further analysis, the remainder of Section 4.6, below, provides that additional information. Table 4-2 Proposed Plan Amendment Issues Already Analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS and 2016 Draft EIS Proposed Plan Amendment  How Considered in 2015 Final EIS and 2016 Draft EIS  Sagebrush Focal Area Designations/Withdrawal Recommendations  Neither Alternative D nor Alternative E1 included the presence of SFAs with the corresponding management (recommendation for withdrawal, no exceptions to NSO, prioritization; see page 2-206, and 2-217). In addition, both Alternative D and Alternative E1 considered exceptions beyond what was considered for SFAs or under the Proposed Plan, allowing consideration of development if there were no impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse or if impacts were minimized (see 2015 Final EIS Appendix H).  Further, the 2016 Sagebrush Focal Area Draft EIS included analysis for not moving forward with a withdrawal. As noted on page 4-53 of the 2016 Draft EIS, “no future mines are projected to be developed in the proposed Utah withdrawal areas during the 20-year period of the proposed withdrawal if a withdrawal is not implemented. Based on the projection that there would not be any future mines developed in the Utah withdrawal area, even if a withdrawal is not implemented, there would not be any economic or tangible social impacts from future mining operations in the Utah socioeconomic analysis area.”  Applicable analyses from the 2015 Final EIS and 2016 Draft EIS explain the impacts from these actions, and are incorporated by reference. No additional analysis is needed.  Administering Disturbance and Density Caps  The 2015 Final EIS Alternatives B, C (page 2-95) and Proposed Plan analyze the 3 percent disturbance cap (page 2-17 and 2-18), and Alternative E1 considers a 5 percent disturbance cap (page 2-95). While the potential protective effects of the cap from the 2015 Final EIS will continue in the Management Alignment Alternative, the exception language present in this RMPA/EIS was not considered in the 2015 Final EIS.  None of the 2015 Final EIS alternatives considered including an exception that allows for development to exceed the cap if the project, based on location and design features, improves the condition of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat.  4.Environmental Consequences Table 4-2 Proposed Plan Amendment Issues Already Analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS and 2016 Draft EIS Proposed Plan Amendment How Considered in 2015 Final EIS and 2016 Draft EIS Modifying Mitigation Strategy The 2015 Final EIS discloses impacts on a variety of resources from applying a mitigation strategy designed to achieve a net conservation gain; it mentions that phrase over 64 times when describing impacts from the 2015 Proposed Plan. The 2015 Final EIS analysis for Alternative E1 discloses impacts from applying a mitigation ratio of 4:1. The 2015 Final EIS analysis for the No-Action Alternative also discloses impacts from not requiring any mitigation. Finally, the 2015 Final EIS includes substantial modeling and analysis of the BLM’s commitment to implement vegetation treatments and their effect on Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and the habitat of other species. The effects of vegetation/habitat treatments on Greater Sage-Grouse, vegetation, fish and wildlife, or other special status species would not vary based on why a treatment was conducted. There is no difference in effect if those treatments were completed as a proactive effort as committed to by the BLM in the 2015 ARMPA or in response to the requirement for projects to demonstrate a net conservation gain. The changes to the mitigation strategy in the Proposed Plan Amendment do not adjust whether habitat will be improved, but it changes who is responsible for habitat improvement (the BLM, rather than project proponent). The principles associated with the mitigation strategy (habitat improvement) and the corresponding impacts are consistent with the language in the No-Action Alternative (net conservation gain); therefore, the effects are sufficiently described and incorporated from the 2015 Final EIS. The analysis for the Proposed Plan Amendment below focuses on the effects of changing how Greater Sage-Grouse habitat will be improved. Modifying Habitat Objectives Alternative D includes an objective to “maintain or restore vegetation to provide habitat for lekking, nesting, brood rearing, winter, and transition areas” and specifies that the “desired cover percentages and heights for sagebrush, grasses, and forbs in seasonal habitats will be managed to meet habitat guidelines from scientific literature (e.g., Connelly et al. 2000 and Hagen et al. 2007), where such standards can be met” (page 2-85 and 286). It goes on to note that “adjustments from the guidelines may be made, but must be based on documented regional variation of habitat characteristics (e.g., sagebrush type, ecological site potential), quantitative data from population and habitat monitoring, and evaluation of local research” (page 2-86). Applicable analyses from the 2015 Final EIS explain the impacts from these actions (see 2015 Final EIS at 4-115 and 4-132 – 4-133), and are incorporated by reference. No additional analysis is needed. Waivers, Exceptions, and Modifications for NSO Stipulations In the 2015 Final EIS, Alternatives A, D, E and the Proposed Plan analyzed waivers, exceptions, and modifications on NSO stipulations. In these instances, it is disclosed that oil and gas may be developed if it would reduce impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse. Applicable analyses from the 2015 Final EIS explain the impacts from these actions, and are incorporated by reference. Specific changes in management related to removal of GHMA under the Proposed Plan Amendment may warrant analysis for specific resources/resource uses. As applicable, such impacts are considered in detail in this chapter. 4.Environmental Consequences Table 4-2 Proposed Plan Amendment Issues Already Analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS and 2016 Draft EIS Proposed Plan Amendment How Considered in 2015 Final EIS and 2016 Draft EIS General Habitat Management Areas in Utah In the 2015 Final EIS neither Alternative A nor Alternative E1 included management for areas that are GHMA in the current No-Action Alternative. Under both alternatives the areas would be managed by the land use plan actions that pre-date the 2015 amendments, and included analysis to that effect. Additionally, while Alternative D considered some minimization measures, it also included an exception that no management would apply to GHMA if “off-site mitigation is successfully completed in PHMA, following discussion with the BLM and Forest Service and the State of Utah” (2015 Final EIS page 2-113). Applicable analyses from the 2015 Final EIS explain the impacts from these actions, and are incorporated by reference. Specific changes in management related to removal of GHMA under the Proposed Plan Amendment may warrant analysis for specific resources/resource uses. As applicable, such impacts are considered in detail in this chapter. Considering Exceptions to Greater Sage-Grouse Restrictions in PHMA The 2015 Final EIS, as part of the Proposed Plan, analyzed this management action, which allowed for exceptions to the application of the Greater Sage-Grouse objectives and actions in areas that lack the “principle habitat components necessary for Greater Sage-Grouse” (page 2-17); however, in the Record of Decision the PHMA component of this action was removed, which is why the No-Action Alternative does not include this exception for PHMA. Nonetheless, the 2015 Final EIS analysis associated with this action is still applicable to consideration of this issue in the Proposed Plan Amendment. Similarly, Alternative D in 2015 considered an action to except decisions associated with PHMA if it were demonstrated that the action was in non-habitat and met specific criteria (page 2-90). Finally, Alternative E1 in 2015 included language that “effort has been made to minimize the amount of non-habitat within the Sage-Grouse Management Areas (SGMAs), but given the topographic, physiographic and land cover features within Utah and the scale and detail of mapping, the inclusion of some non-habitat was unavoidable.” It went on to note that “no specific management provisions are proposed for non-habitat areas within the SGMAs, except to consider noise and permanent structure stipulations around a lek, and to note that, birds may fly over the non-habitat as they connect to other populations or seasonal habitat areas” (p. 2-90). The 2015 Final EIS analysis included the effects of this language, which is similar to that being considered in the Proposed Plan Amendment. The analysis from the 2015 Final EIS explains the impacts from these actions, and is incorporated by reference. No additional analysis is needed. Adaptive Management Management changes as a result of meeting an adaptive management hard trigger were considered and analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS. While management to remove these “hard wired” changes from adaptive management were not considered in 2015, the impacts from such were analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS:  4-14 Utah Greater Sage-Grouse Proposed RMPA/Final EIS November 2018  4.Environmental Consequences Table 4-2 Proposed Plan Amendment Issues Already Analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS and 2016 Draft EIS Proposed Plan Amendment How Considered in 2015 Final EIS and 2016 Draft EIS If the 10-year population trend for an area that has met a hard trigger reflects the natural fluctuations of a self-sustaining population, hard trigger management would be removed and the RMPA actions would be restored. Existing RMPA actions have already been analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS and this RMPA/EIS; therefore, no additional analysis is necessary. If all the leks in an area that have met a hard trigger are not active for 10 years, indicating no occupied leks, the PHMA designation and all its associated management would be removed since there is no longer a Greater Sage-Grouse population for which management should be prioritized. In this instance, the removal of PHMA would revert management to Alternative A, as considered and analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS; therefore, no additional analysis is necessary. Because all impacts from the adaptive management actions considered in this process were already considered in one of the alternatives already analyzed, no additional analysis is necessary to describe impacts from the potential “un-triggers.” Prioritization of Mineral Leasing In 2015, Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E (including the State’s plan, Alternative E1) did not evaluate an objective that prioritized leasing and development outside of PHMA and GHMA; therefore, the change proposed in the Proposed Plan Amendment of this effort was considered in 2015, and the analysis can be found in Chapter 4 of that EIS. No additional analysis is necessary. Land Disposal and Exchanges The BLM develops most RMPs to guide management of land over 20 or more years. The Secretary’s policy is, generally, not to dispose of public lands. However, for long term planning purposes, the situation may arise, especially in areas where public land tracts are isolated and difficult to manage, where it is useful for BLM to identify these areas as suitable for leaving public ownership. Any decision regarding whether or not to dispose of a particular parcel under any particular authority, whether by sale under section 203 of FLPMA; exchange under section 206 of FLPMA; or patent under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act of 1926, as amended, for instance, would require site-specific consideration and analysis, including, but not limited to considerations of access, popular recreational uses, the existence of cultural resources or habitat for species, and whether or not such a parcel, isolated from the rest of the public lands, might be better suited for private ownership. Section 203 of FLPMA specifies that BLM may only sell a tract of public land under section 203 if the tract is identified through the land use planning process, pursuant to section 202 of FLPMA, as meeting one or more of the disposal criteria listed in section 203. The RMP determination that a particular tract meets one or more of the criteria for disposal through sale does not necessarily mean the BLM will sell or dispose of the land by another means. Rather, the process for disposing of public lands under FLPMA Section 203 (Sales) or Section 206 (Exchanges) or any other authority is a lengthy multi-decisional process requiring comprehensive site-specific analysis, and cadastral, cultural and other resource surveys, when necessary, prior to the sale or disposition of a tract of public land. The BLM bases the determination whether a 4.Environmental Consequences Table 4-2 Proposed Plan Amendment Issues Already Analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS and 2016 Draft EIS Proposed Plan Amendment How Considered in 2015 Final EIS and 2016 Draft EIS tract meets one or more of the section 203 disposal criteria on its ongoing inventory of all public lands and their resources conducted pursuant to section 201 of FLPMA. The requirement under section 203 that this determination be made through land use planning is consistent with the section 202 requirement to manage public lands under land use plans, where these represent a broader scope, longer-term approach to management of public lands in an entire planning area that takes into account a wide variety of possible uses of the public lands. The 2015 Final EIS Alternative A includes management that “in order to be considered for any form of land tenure adjustment, all lands not specifically identified for disposal must meet criteria included in FLPMA and in each LUP” (page 2-186). It also included analysis that “lands with sensitive species (including Greater Sage-Grouse) would not be disposed of unless there was a net benefit for Greater Sage-Grouse” (4-54). This management is substantially similar to that considered in the Proposed Plan Amendment, and the effects would not differ from those already identified in the 2015 Final EIS for Alternative A. While the impacts from the proposed changes to land disposal and exchanges are addressed, specific impacts on resources/resource uses, as applicable, will be considered in detail in this chapter. Managing Habitat to Manage Allowing the removal of corvid nests was not considered in 2015, Predation although Alternative A was silent on the issue. This chapter analyses the impacts of this action. Burial of Transmission Lines Alternative E1 (based on the State’s Plan) did not include requirements for burial of transmission lines. The proposal in the Proposed Plan Amendment to not require burial of power lines was considered within the range of the 2015 Final EIS and analysis can be found in the Chapter 4 analysis of that document. 4.6.1 Impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse The methods and assumptions regarding analysis of impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse are the same as those used in the 2015 Final EIS, Section 4.3.1 (pages 4-6 through 4-10). The resulting analysis describes impacts from the range of alternatives in the 2015 Final EIS, inclusive of Sections 4.3.2 through 4.3.7 (pages 4-10 through 4-135). This establishes a substantial baseline of impacts from the breadth of issues considered in the 2015 Final EIS, including most of the issues addressed in this RMPA/EIS. The assumption, indicators, and analyses are incorporated by reference and will serve as the base of analytical descriptions from which this analysis is drawn. Administering Disturbance and Density Caps The Proposed Plan Amendment includes a cap on disturbance and on density of energy/mining facilities in PHMA, similar to the No-Action Alternative (see Table E.1, Appendix E). In both alternatives, disturbance at the project and BSU scales must be managed to stay under 3 percent, as well as the density of energy and mining facilities must remain under one facility per 640 acres, on average. These caps would minimize disturbance in PHMA, managing for a habitat with levels of development that research supports is necessary to maintain Greater Sage-Grouse leks. 4.Environmental Consequences However, the Proposed Plan Amendment builds flexibility into the analysis by allowing exceedances of caps if certain conditions are met. For example, if site-specific information (e.g., habitat condition, Greater Sage-Grouse use of the area) combined with project design information (i.e., project siting, minimization measures, or voluntary mitigation) indicate the project will improve the condition of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat, the caps can be exceeded. The ability to exceed the disturbance and density caps could result in loss and degradation of site-specific Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and impacts on local grouse populations. Projects that would likely be precluded under the No-Action Alternative could proceed under the Proposed Plan Amendment; however, exceedances to the caps would only be allowed if site-level analysis indicates the project, in combination with all voluntary and required design features, will improve the condition of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. There is a risk that allowing this exceedance could result in the loss of a specific type of habitat that mitigation may not address because it does not require compensation for the exact same habitat value. Consequently, under the Proposed Plan Amendment it is possible that while the required habitat improvement will occur, it may not address the loss of a specific habitat type. This may result in a longterm impact on Greater Sage-Grouse in the project area. In summary, allowing exceedances to the caps may result in local impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse if a specific limiting habitat type is disproportionately affected; however, project design features, which may include voluntary mitigation, would need to fully replace the value of the impacted area. The determination of what design features would be necessary to achieve that exception criteria depends on site-specific issues that would be analyzed in project-specific environmental reviews. The interspersed nature of habitat, non-habitat, and potential habitat in Utah results in instances where voluntary habitat improvements could benefit a specific population more than staying under the 3 percent cap. Such improvements could be a component of design features applied to allow for more disturbance, meeting the exception criteria contained in the Proposed Plan Amendment. Greater Sage-Grouse in Utah are limited by habitat availability, and increasing habitat could provide a population-level benefit to Greater Sage-Grouse use of an area. Modifying Mitigation Strategy The BLM has determined that FLPMA does not explicitly mandate or authorize the BLM to require public land users to implement compensatory mitigation as a condition of obtaining authorization for the use of the public lands. Consistent with that determination and with BLM IM 2018-093, Compensatory Mitigation, the Proposed Plan Amendment clarifies how voluntary compensatory mitigation or a state mitigation requirement or recommendation should be considered in the management of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. This clarification simply aligns the Proposed Plan Amendment with BLM policy and the scope of compensatory mitigation authority expressly provided by FLPMA. Any analysis of compensatory mitigation relating to future projects is speculative at this level of land use planning; therefore, analysis of compensatory mitigation is more appropriate for future project-specific NEPA. In other words, it is speculative to assume the impacts from voluntary compensatory mitigation at the planning level without knowing the frequency with which project proponents will proffer voluntary actions. The applicability and overall effectiveness of voluntary actions cannot be fully assessed until the project level when the specific location, design and impacts are known. 4.Environmental Consequences However, the effects of the changes to compensatory mitigation in the Proposed Plan will be nominal, in part, because the BLM will continue to ensure consistency of its actions and authorizations with the land use planning level goals and objectives of the Proposed Plans. In the 2015 Greater Sage-Grouse ARMPA the BLM committed to “increase the amount and functionality of seasonal habitats” (Objective SSS-4) by implementing vegetation and fuels treatments (see also MA-SSS-VEG-1, 2, 3 and 4, and MA-FIRE-3). The implementation of compensatory mitigation actions, if applied, will be directed by MOAs that describe how the BLM will align with State authorities and incorporated in the appropriate NEPA analysis during implementation. While the conservation benefit of compensatory mitigation may be limited when weighed against the threats to Greater Sage-Grouse, particularly in the Great Basin portion of the planning area where wildland fire remains a key threat, the BLM is committed to implementing state mitigation requirement or recommendation to help minimize the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance and habitat fragmentation throughout the planning area and the range of Greater Sage-Grouse. Further, as noted in Section 3.5, the BLM committed to implementing beneficial habitat management actions to reduce the threats of fire and invasive species to Greater Sage-Grouse as part of the 2015 ARMPA. Because those actions were consistent with the State’s management approach, no changes to them are considered in this effort as, as noted in Chapter 2, they are not shown in this EIS. However, the effect of those actions is evident in the habitat treatments described in Table 3-6. The BLM has committed resources to habitat restoration and has treated 1.4 million acres of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat range-wide over the past 5 years. In the federal government’s fiscal year 2018 specifically, the BLM funded approximately $29 million in Greater Sage-Grouse management actions resulting in approximately 500,000 acres of treated habitat rangewide. The BLM expects to invest nearly $17 million in fiscal year 2019 through the implementation of habitat management projects. In 2015, the USFWS determined Greater Sage-Grouse was “not warranted” for listing under the Endangered Species Act. The USFWS found that BLM’s 2015 land use plans were adequate regulatory mechanisms and that the species no longer warranted listing under the Act. At the time of that decision, USFWS acknowledged the RMP requirements that compensatory mitigation achieve a net gain standard. The BLM is not proposing any action that would preclude proponents from offering compensatory mitigation; it is clarifying the BLM’s reliance on voluntary compensatory mitigation consistent with federal law. In PHMA, when undertaking BLM management actions, and consistent with valid existing rights and applicable law, when authorizing third-party actions that result in habitat loss and degradation, the BLM will achieve the planning-level Greater Sage-Grouse management goals and objectives through implementation of mitigation and management actions identified in this RMPA. This includes the BLM’s planning objective to improve habitat conditions and connectivity through implementation of vegetation treatments. Under this Proposed Plan Amendment, management would be consistent with the Greater Sage-Grouse goals and objectives that are unchanged from the 2015 ARMPA, and in conformance with BLM Manual 6840, Special Status Species Management. In accordance with BLM Manual 6840, the BLM will undertake planning decisions, actions and authorizations “to minimize or eliminate threats affecting the status of [Greater Sage-Grouse] or to improve the condition of [Greater Sage-Grouse] habitat” across the planning area. Based on the existing levels of habitat loss from wildfire and development throughout the planning area, the level of habitat improvements identified in Chapter 3 since 2015 have resulted in an improvement 4.Environmental Consequences to Greater Sage-Grouse habitat throughout the planning area. This trend is anticipated to continue, due to the combination of monitoring, treatment success and plan evaluations, the continued application of habitat improvements by the BLM, and likely some improvements voluntarily conducted by third parties. While individual project proponents will no longer be personally responsible to improve habitat in order to obtain an authorization for use of public lands, the effects of habitat improvements that were described in the 2015 Final EIS would continue to increase the quantity and quality of habitat and improve population distribution and vital rates. Modifying Habitat Objectives Changes in the habitat objectives table found in Objective SSS-3 are based on an evaluation of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat preferences informed by data collected throughout Utah. The proposed changes to the desired conditions in the habitat objectives table are outlined to better reflect vegetation structure and composition found in vegetation communities that support Greater Sage-Grouse habitat in Utah, as well as adjust the indicators and values to reflect a starting point that is based on the best available data based on local habitat conditions. The resulting three zones (Low, Mid, and High; see Chapter 3, Section 3.3.4 and Map 3-1) provide a starting point for Greater Sage-Grouse habitat management that is more attuned to the varied vegetation communities providing Greater Sage-Grouse habitat throughout Utah. These changes will have beneficial impacts on management and Greater Sage-Grouse habitat because the indicators and values more accurately reflect vegetation characteristics in Utah as informed by site-specific information that has been updated using local science. Waivers, Exceptions, and Modifications for NSO Stipulations As noted in Table 4-2, multiple alternatives considered exceptions to oil and gas stipulations. The Proposed Plan Amendment alters the exception from the No-Action Alternative in two ways: first it applies it to areas without habitat (site-scale documentation), and second, it does not require that the State of Utah and the USFWS concur to its use. While exception of the NSO stipulation in PHMA would allow surface development, the BLM is required by regulation to either document that the factors leading to the stipulation have changed (e.g., no Greater Sage-Grouse habitat) or that the proposed operations would not cause unacceptable impacts (43 CFR 3101.1-4). In areas with site-scale habitat, such an exception would only be allowed if it was to prevent damage to higher value Greater Sage-Grouse habitat on adjacent non-public lands. In areas with site-scale non-habitat, the exception could only be approved if the primary disturbance (e.g., well pad, compressor station) did not impair adjacent seasonal habitats from direct and indirect impacts from the project. While allowing the possibility for an exception introduces the potential for an impact not present in the No-Action Alternative, the criteria that must be met prior to approving an exception would either result in the exception not being granted, or in subsequent development having a low potential for impacts. Further, if the exception to the NSO stipulation is granted, and subsequent development would be subject to other minimization measures contained in MA-SSS-3, more assurances would be provided that resulting developments would not likely impact Greater Sage-Grouse or their habitats. The Proposed Plan Amendment also adds a modification to the NSO stipulation that could result in some site-specific impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse or their habitat. The modification would allow operators to place infrastructure (e.g., roads, pipelines, and power lines) associated with their primary disturbance (e.g., well pad and compressor station) in PHMA without adhering to the NSO stipulation, but applying the minimization and mitigation measures in MA-SSS-3 (e.g., disturbance cap, tall structures, 4.Environmental Consequences noise, seasonal, buffers, etc.). The construction of such associated infrastructure would remove vegetation associated with habitat, increase predation opportunities on Greater Sage-Grouse and potentially displace birds. The modification was added to the Proposed Plan Amendment because in its absence, an operator could still obtain rights-of-way for such infrastructure. To avoid inconsistency in management (i.e., avoiding ROWs but precluding supporting oil and gas infrastructure), the modification was included, but only if the primary disturbance (e.g., well pad, compressor station, etc.) was granted an exception. The Proposed Plan Amendment also included a waiver for the NSO stipulation; however, there would be no impact on Greater Sage-Grouse from the waiver, as it would be applied only if the area was removed from PHMA management, based on evaluation of site-specific data. General Habitat Management Areas in Utah As noted on Figure 2-1a, there are several areas of GHMA throughout Utah in the No-Action Alternative. The GHMA in the Morgan and Summit County areas is predominantly on private lands; the GHMA between Vernal and Strawberry Reservoir (noted as South Slope Uintah in the 2015 Final EIS Chapter 3) is tribal and private lands. The areas of GHMA in the Uintah Population Area are separated into three small subpopulations, described in Chapter 3 of the 2015 Final EIS as Deadman’s Bench, East Bench and Book Cliffs, and Halfway Hollow. None of the other GHMA in Utah includes any leks, and is generally comprised of poor quality habitat on the periphery of larger PHMA. See Appendix 3 for a summary of each GHMA in Utah, the composition of its ownership (BLM-administered versus non-BLMadministered), the presence of disturbances, and connectivity issues. Under the Proposed Plan Amendment, the GHMA designation would be removed with all its corresponding management actions from the 2015 plan amendments. These management actions, including lek buffers, required design features, fluid mineral leasing prioritization, and habitat objectives, provide a hierarchy of potential conditions to minimize effects while still allowing for development in GHMA. Notably, however, under the No-Action Alternative, where GHMA remain, development would still be allowed following this hierarchy of conditions. Under the Proposed Plan Amendment, the removal of GHMA and their associated management actions would likely incentivize development in areas formally identified as GHMA. The long-term effect of incentivizing under the Proposed Plan Amendment is not anticipated to be different than the development that would eventually be allowed under the No-Action Alternative, as noted below. Under the No-Action Alternative development could still occur in GHMA. As analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS, “despite the…[Greater Sage-Grouse] conservation measures, leasing and development in these areas could result in human alteration, direct loss, and fragmentation of seasonal [Greater Sage-Grouse] habitats, which, in most cases, have already been fragmented by mineral development activities. Fragmentation could further limit the amount of usable habitat available for the small and declining population of [Greater Sage-Grouse] that occupy this area [GHMA]” (2015 Final EIS, page 4-119). Although GHMA remains a part of the No-Action Alternative, the potential decline of Greater Sage-Grouse in GHMA exists; thus, whether or not GHMA and its associated management is present, the impacts from the two alternatives would be the same in the long term, though the Proposed Plan Amendment could likely accelerate the effect on resources in the former GHMA. This is because it incentivizes development in these areas over PHMA. Because 95 percent of Utah’s Greater Sage-Grouse 4.Environmental Consequences populations are supported by habitat in PHMA, there would be no significant effect of accelerating the impacts on the small populations in former GHMA that contain 5 percent of Utah’s Greater Sage-Grouse populations and just 0.25 percent of the populations range-wide. In addition, the Proposed Plan Amendment provides that the BLM would replace occupied habitat outside PHMA that is lost to development by creating or improving habitat inside PHMA. Conversely, under the No-Action Alternative, mitigation is required to demonstrate a net conservation gain to compensate for development in GHMA, whether inside or outside GHMA. Comparing 20-year trends, PHMA adds 79.5 more birds every year on average than what is added in GHMA. Assuming stable long-term trends statewide, it would take approximately 2.5 years for the population growth in PHMA to replace the potential loss of Greater Sage-Grouse populations in GHMA. In short, PHMA provides better habitat and better opportunity for the Greater Sage-Grouse; thus, while it appears that the loss of GHMA protections would have impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse, due to the Proposed Plan Amendment’s focus on PHMA, and the BLM’s commitment to create/improve habitat within PHMA, these factors likely minimize the potential harms from removing the GHMA classification. It is important to note that it is not anticipated that Greater Sage-Grouse populations in GHMA would be eliminated, but this demonstrates that Greater Sage-Grouse populations in Utah would not result in a long-term decline due to the removal of GHMA. The BLM’s commitment to replacing lost occupied Greater Sage-Grouse habitat in former GHMA by creating or improving PHMA could collectively increase or improve the quality of the PHMA over time. As the amount of development increases in former GHMA, the lack of local mitigation could accelerate the declines in Greater Sage-Grouse populations as available habitat that is not affected by disturbance shrinks. Of the 366 known occupied leks in Utah, 94 percent of these leks are in PHMA. Only 8 of the 22 leks in GHMA are in areas affected by BLM management, with the other 14 in areas predominantly owned by tribal or private entities. With this alignment, the BLM would prioritize habitat management areas that encompass nearly 96 percent of the actual Greater Sage-Grouse, based on 2017 data. As described in the analysis for Alternative E in the 2015 Final EIS, not including specific management for GHMA could result in localized Greater Sage-Grouse habitat loss, and continued population decreases. These areas on public lands are naturally fragmented, and various human developments (e.g., roads, transmission lines, and oil and gas development) have further isolated and impacted these habitats and their associated populations. The changes in management in the Proposed Plan Amendment would continue, if not accelerate these effects; however, as described above, the conservation value of these areas to the persistence and growth of Greater Sage-Grouse populations in Utah is marginal when compared with the habitat values and growth trends of populations in PHMA. The overall Greater Sage-Grouse goal to “maintain and/or increase Greater Sage-Grouse abundance and distribution by conserving, enhancing or restoring the sagebrush ecosystem upon which populations depend in collaboration with other conservation partners” would be met under the Proposed Plan Amendment (Goal SSS-1 – 2015 ROD/ARMPA). While some areas outside of PHMA would likely see continued population decreases, the BLM’s commitment to replace habitat in PHMA as compensation for development in former GHMA will meet the goal of “maintaining and/or increasing Greater Sage-Grouse abundance” because PHMA growth trends are more than 11 times higher than GHMA. 4.Environmental Consequences Finally, with the removal of GHMA, two small areas in the Sheeprocks area would be managed as available for cross-country OHV use. Approximately 6,320 acres in the 5 Mile Pass area in GHMA on the northeastern portion of Sheeprocks, and 7,900 acres in the Little Sahara Sand Dunes area in GHMA on the southern portion of the Sheeprocks population and would be managed as available for cross-country OHV use. As noted in Chapter 3, both these areas are destination-based OHV riding areas, and both were open for more than 25 years prior to the 2015 ROD/ARMPA action to limit use in these areas to existing routes. The acres in both areas are directly adjacent to other areas that are also available to cross-country OHV use, and were originally part of the same open areas prior to 2015. The 2015 Final EIS notes that “habitat loss could occur associated with cross-country OHV use” (2015 Final EIS page 4-52). However, a review of GPS tracking data for Greater Sage-Grouse in the Sheeprocks area indicates that none of the collared birds (a sub-sample of the total population) used the areas proposed to be made available to cross-country use again (Chelak and Messmer 2017). Due to the long-term use in both of these areas prior to 2015, these areas have likely already experienced the habitat losses, so this change is not anticipated to result in impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse or its habitat. Prioritization of Mineral Leasing The Proposed Plan Amendment proposes to remove the fluid mineral leasing prioritization objective that prioritizes leasing outside of PHMA and GHMA. This was considered in Alternatives A, B, C, D, and E in the 2015 Final EIS where no similar objective was included; however, the 2015 Final EIS, where mineral leasing prioritization was part of the Proposed Plan (what is now the No-Action Alternative), focused its analysis on the no surface occupancy allocation decision that resulted from the objective. It determined that prioritizing leasing outside of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat would not preclude leasing in PHMA. At most, the prioritization objective could potentially result in temporarily deferring a parcel in PHMA from leasing to a later sale, but only in instances of large lease sales where staff capacity would be incapable of analyzing all the nominated parcels. Because the mineral leasing prioritization objective provides no certain or durable protection to PHMA, its removal would not increase threats, since the no surface occupancy stipulation is still in effect. Land Disposal and Exchanges The No-Action Alternative would retain both PHMA and GHMA unless a net gain to Greater Sage-Grouse could be documented. The Proposed Plan Amendment also manages PHMA for retention, but former GHMA would be available for disposal according to the local land use plans. Additionally, prior to a disposal of public lands in PHMA, the environmental review would need to document that the land tenure adjustment would not compromise the persistence of the Greater Sage-Grouse population in the PHMA. This change could result in areas of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat in both PHMA and former GHMA no longer being administered according to the management actions from this amendment. The impact of this change could affect smaller pieces of habitat within a PHMA, but would maintain enough of the seasonal habitats to maintain population persistence. Land disposals and exchanges within PHMA that would compromise the persistence of the PHMA’s population would not be authorized. While there could be site-specific impacts, the likelihood for population-level impacts in PHMA would be low due to requirement to not dispose of lands that would threaten the persistence of the population. Former GHMA could be affected to a greater degree, as no limitation on size or impact would exist regarding their potential disposal. 4.Environmental Consequences Managing Habitat to Manage Predation Removing corvid nests during habitat treatments in PHMA, including removing the trees on which they are built and adjacent trees, could reduce predation pressures by reducing corvid nesting opportunities. While breeding corvids will simply seek new nesting opportunities in the next nesting season, reducing existing nests and adjacent nesting opportunities in PHMA could reduce opportunities for corvids to have easy access to Greater Sage-Grouse nesting habitat. While generally applicable statewide, the magnitude of this impact would depend on predation rates at the local Greater Sage-Grouse population level. Burial of Transmission Lines The No-Action Alternative requires that new transmission lines be buried where technically feasible. The 2015 Final EIS notes that “burying power lines in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat would avoid Greater Sage-Grouse predator perching or nesting opportunities, Greater Sage-Grouse avoidance of aboveground power lines, and Greater Sage-Grouse collisions with power lines” (2015 Final EIS page 432). It goes on to note that burying transmission lines would also result in ground disturbance during construction and maintenance and may result in large, permanent displacement of excavated soil and subsequent issues with reestablishing native vegetation. The Proposed Plan Amendment proposes to remove the requirement to bury transmission lines where technically feasible and provides increased flexibility to consider site-specific impacts and minimization options. This change in management could result in both positive and negative impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse, depending on threats in local populations. Constructing transmission lines above-ground could increase predator perches, which may lead to increased take of Greater Sage-Grouse and their nests; however, impacts of predator perches would be minimized by conforming with right-of-way avoidance allocations, application of tall structure restrictions in PHMA, use of perch deterrents on poles, and micro-siting lines to avoid important Greater Sage-Grouse leks and adjacent seasonal habitats. Constructing transmission lines above the ground could also maintain more habitat than the burial of lines because it offers more protection for sensitive habitat areas. Removal of sagebrush and associated vegetation would be avoided with placement of surface lines, which minimizes habitat disturbance and the potential for invasive/noxious weeds. The specific impacts of this change in management would depend on site-specific conditions, but the removal of the requirement would allow interdisciplinary teams and local managers to evaluate site-scale impacts and minimize impacts at the project level, providing the flexibility to make the best decision for the local Greater Sage-Grouse population and their habitat. 4.6.2 Impacts on Air Quality Impacts on air quality are described in the 2015 Final EIS in Section 4.4 (pages 4-135 to 4-137). Air quality is identified as a resource that would primarily have indirect, beneficial impacts from the implementation of most Greater Sage-Grouse conservation measures, although some adverse impacts from the different plan alternatives were discussed. As protective measures increase for Greater Sage-Grouse, related reductions in development would help maintain air quality. The 2015 Final EIS discussed positive and negative impacts from livestock grazing, travel, mineral extraction, wildland fires, and construction activities. No changes are expected to the air impacts analysis contained in the 2015 Final EIS; however, some discussion related to the potential new ozone non-attainment areas and reverting OHV areas back to open for cross-country use as they relate to air quality is provided. 4.Environmental Consequences In 2018 the EPA officially designated Salt Lake and Davis Counties, as well as portions of Weber, Tooele, Uintah and Duchesne Counties, as non-attainment for ozone. BLM-managed Greater Sage-Grouse areas are included in the Uintah County non-attainment area, while non-attainment areas in other counties do not overlap BLM-managed Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. Monitoring data found in Table 3.5 and in the 2015 Final EIS (page 3-48) show that ozone measurements have frequently exceeded the current ozone NAAQS value, and changes from attainment to non-attainment will likely not change the air impacts analysis described in 2015. General Habitat Management Areas in Utah Two areas in the Sheeprocks Population Area associated with the 5 Mile Pass and Little Sahara Sand Dunes OHV areas would revert to open for cross-country OHV use. Pollution from OHVs includes fugitive dust and NAAQS controlled pollutants. Areas now designated as open to cross-country OHV use are adjacent to existing OHV recreation areas, and no additional air pollution emissions are expected from those that already occur. Additionally, these areas were open to cross-country OHV use before the 2015 Final EIS amendments and impacts on air would be similar to those analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS No-Action Alternative. 4.6.3 Impacts on Soil Resources General Habitat Management Areas in Utah Under the Proposed Plan Amendment, former GHMA would be removed and would revert back to land management objectives as outlined in pre-existing (before 2015) resource management plans. This action would result in two areas (14,220 acres) in former GHMA that were limited to existing routes in the 2015 Final EIS that would return to being available to cross-country OHV use. This action may have some adverse impacts on soils (especially sensitive soils) from increased disturbance and compaction. This action may enable the spread of invasive and nonnative plant species, which may also impact soils negatively. The impacts from soil compaction and disturbance are outlined in the 2015 Final EIS in Chapter 4, Section 4.6. 4.6.4 Impacts on Vegetation (Including Noxious Weeds, Riparian Areas, and Wetlands) Impacts on vegetation resources from anthropogenic activities have been disclosed in detail in the Vegetation section (Chapter 4, Section 4.8) in the 2015 Final EIS; however, the Proposed Plan Amendment includes some additional impacts on vegetation resources that may occur from the proposed changes. General Habitat Management Areas in Utah Removal of approximately 448,600 acres of former GHMA and reverting to pre-2015 management could allow projects in these areas to proceed more quickly without Greater Sage-Grouse specific conservation measures and management objectives for vegetation. Proposed projects in former GHMA would be allowed by the BLM as long as the project has no indirect impacts on vegetation in PHMA. The BLM would mitigate for disturbance in former GHMA by improving habitat inside of PHMA for Greater Sage-Grouse. Vegetation resources may be affected on various levels by allowing more disturbance and anthropogenic activities in former GHMA. More disturbance could lead to increased amounts of invasive and noxious vegetation as well as degraded shrub and herbaceous vegetation communities. Indirect impacts from 4.Environmental Consequences increases in invasive and noxious vegetation may lead to loss of energy flow, hydrologic function, and soil stability which could lead to further degradation of vegetation communities. As the amount of development increases in former GHMA, the consecutive effects of mitigating disturbances in PHMA could mount and could possibly affect the functionality of some vegetation communities. Site-specific planning and other management from local resource management plans, and adhering to the land health standards, would reduce negative impacts on vegetation resources in former GHMA with the use of best management practices and other project mitigation design features. Waivers, Exceptions, and Modifications for NSO Stipulations The Proposed Plan Amendment would allow exceptions to surface occupancy restrictions in mapped PHMA. Areas in PHMA where this would be allowed would lack the principle habitat components necessary (e.g., a combination of sagebrush, grasses, and forbs) for Greater Sage-Grouse. These areas could also be areas that have crossed ecological threshold(s) to non-Sage-Grouse habitat vegetation communities (e.g., monoculture cheatgrass and pinyon/juniper woodlands). Impacts from projects in PHMA non-habitat areas would likely have minimal impacts on vegetation resources, as the vegetation would already be in a non-desirable condition and would likely be unoccupied by Greater Sage-Grouse. Minimization measures would still be applied to projects in PHMA to limit the effects of disturbances (e.g., 3 percent disturbance cap and noise). Disturbance Caps The 2015 Final EIS analyzed the impacts from the BLM prohibiting discrete anthropogenic activities that cause disturbance beyond the 3 percent cap in PHMA. The Proposed Plan Amendment would allow the 3 percent cap to be exceeded if a technical team determines the project, in concert with all its design features, will improve the condition of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. This action would allow projects to exceed the disturbance cap; however, in so doing, it could result in voluntary habitat improvement projects that could change vegetation conditions in the project area to shift away from a vegetation community more dominated by trees to one more dominated by grasses and shrubs, which is conducive to Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. If the exception is voluntarily sought, it would likely result in treatments that would shift vegetation communities to earlier seral classes. This would come about by meeting habitat objectives designed for Greater Sage-Grouse habitat at the project site scale even though the 3 percent cap would be exceeded. Modifying Mitigation Strategy Maintaining a mitigation strategy in PHMA that leads to a planning area-wide improvement of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat would manage for vegetation communities that are generally more dominated by grasses and shrubs than by trees. While each individual project proponent would no longer be required to increase habitat in order to obtain an authorization for use of public lands, the effects of habitat improvements that were described in the 2015 Final EIS would continue to be achieved: namely, increasing the quantity and quality of sage-steppe vegetation communities in early-to mid-seral condition. Prioritization of Mineral Leasing Removing the prioritization objective for PHMA and GHMA would not directly impact vegetation because prioritization doesn’t permit or preclude leasing in PHMA. The no surface occupancy stipulations and conservation measures in place for PHMA would protect the continuity of sagebrush 4.Environmental Consequences communities; however, the prioritization objective could potentially result in temporarily deferring a parcel in PHMA from leasing to a later sale, but only in instances of large lease sales where staff capacity would be incapable to analyzing all the nominated parcels. In an area with poor vegetation conditions or high levels of disturbance, such a delay could provide time for vegetation conditions to improve before new developments are implemented. 4.6.5 Impacts on Other Special Status Species Administering Disturbance and Density Caps Allowing exceedances to the disturbance and density caps in PHMA could affect special status species by a reduced level of protection of habitat from disturbance. These disturbance impacts may increase by allowing exceptions to the disturbance cap, especially within areas of non-sagebrush, therefore impacting habitat for special status species that use these non-sagebrush habitat types; however, exceptions to the disturbance and density cap may also benefit some species with habitats that overlap Greater Sage-Grouse. This would be due to the increased potential for voluntary habitat projects, which could improve habitat conditions through vegetation treatments. Modifying Mitigation Strategy Maintaining a mitigation strategy in PHMA that leads to a planning area-wide improvement of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat would manage for vegetation communities that are generally more dominated by grasses and shrubs than by trees. While each individual project proponent would no longer be required to increase habitat in order to obtain an authorization for use of public lands, the effects of habitat improvements that were described in the 2015 Final EIS would continue to be achieved: namely, increasing the quantity and quality of sage-steppe vegetation communities in early-to mid-seral condition. This would increase habitats for special status species with habitats that overlap that of Greater Sage-Grouse; however, it would also generally decrease habitat availability for special status species that are not sage dependent. Considering Exceptions to Greater Sage-Grouse Restrictions in PHMA Development in non-habitat portions of PHMA may increase impacts on certain special status species whose habitat requirements do not overlap sagebrush areas. Adjacent non-sagebrush habitats could see an increase in development and disturbance when trying to avoid and minimize disturbance to sagebrush habitats. Species that use sagebrush systems would see no change to impacts compared with the No-Action Alternative because no exception would be granted, as sagebrush within PHMA is habitat. Prioritization of Mineral Leasing Removing the prioritization objective for PHMA and GHMA would not directly impact special status species because prioritization doesn’t permit or preclude leasing in PHMA. The no surface occupancy stipulations and conservation measures in place for PHMA would protect sagebrush habitats, which could also maintain special status species using these habitat types; however, the prioritization objective could potentially result in temporarily deferring a parcel in PHMA from leasing to a later sale, but only in instances of large lease sales where staff capacity would be incapable to analyzing all the nominated parcels. In an area with poor habitat conditions or high levels of disturbance, such a delay could provide time for habitat improvement before new developments are implemented. 4.Environmental Consequences Managing Habitat to Manage Predation The Proposed Plan Amendment provides opportunity to remove trees that have corvid nests that could impact PHMA nesting habitat. Special status wildlife that may experience predation and harassment by corvids would benefit from removal of trees with corvid nests that overlap PHMA nesting habitat. Ravens have been observed in association with Utah prairie dog colonies. Young prairie dogs are likely an opportunistic food source for ravens and crows as they emerge from the burrows. Young prairie dogs are likely easier to carry away and also do not run as fast as adults or respond to alarm calls as quickly (Hoogland et al. 2006). Efforts by other agencies to minimize impacts from predators on Greater Sage-Grouse would also likely benefit other special status animals, such as Utah prairie dog and black-footed ferret, that overlap Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. The 2012 Revised Utah Prairie Dog Recovery Plan states that normal levels of predation are not considered a threat for healthy Utah prairie dogs and that healthy populations can likely sustain normal predator pressures without adverse impacts on population structures. Predation is more likely to have adverse impacts on Utah prairie dogs in unnaturally fragmented colonies or at new translocation sites (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2012). 4.6.6 Impacts on Fish and Wildlife Wildlife habitat conditions within the decision area are directly linked to vegetation conditions, water quality and quantity, and progression toward land health standards as described in Section 4.10.2 of the 2015 EIS (BLM 2015, page 4-184). General Habitat Management Areas in Utah Removal of GHMA acres would result in management returning to that described under Alternative A in the 2015 Final EIS. Removal of the GHMA and associated management may reduce some indirect protection for big game habitat, including crucial winter and fawning/calving habitat that occur within mapped GHMA. Impacts on big game are considered negligible because big game use a variety of habitat types beyond sagebrush. Additionally, the GHMA is not the only management for these areas, but is merely complimentary to management of habitat under applicable RMPs and according to BLM Rangeland Health Standards. Removing the GHMA minimization measures that, as noted above would not preclude development, would not likely result in additional impacts that are not already addressed by management of crucial habitats in existing land use plans. The offsite mitigation in PHMA to replace impacted habitat in occupied Greater Sage-Grouse habitat outside of PHMA may not always benefit the same other wildlife species that were impacted at the disturbed site. While it could lead to a local improvement for species in the area of treatment, especially those that rely on sagebrush habitats, it could also result in an unmitigated loss in the quantity and quality of habitat at the location of the impact. As the amount of development increases in the Greater Sage-Grouse habitat outside PHMA, the impact from disturbances mitigated in PHMA would mount and could affect the use patterns of wildlife in those areas. Administering Disturbance and Density Caps Allowing exceedances to the disturbance and density caps in PHMA could affect wildlife by a reduced level of protection for habitat from disturbance. These disturbance impacts may increase by allowing exceptions to the disturbance cap, especially within areas of non-sagebrush, therefore impacting wildlife species that use these other habitat types (e.g., pinyon-juniper woodlands and pinyon jays); however, 4.Environmental Consequences exceptions to the disturbance and density cap may also benefit some wildlife species with habitats that overlap with Greater Sage-Grouse. This would come about by improving habitat conditions through the increased potential for voluntary vegetation treatments. Modifying Mitigation Strategy Maintaining a mitigation strategy in PHMA that leads to a planning area-wide improvement of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat would manage for vegetation communities that are generally more dominated by grasses and shrubs than by trees. While each individual project proponent would no longer be required to increase habitat in order to obtain an authorization for use of public lands, the effects of habitat improvements that were described in the 2015 Final EIS would continue to be achieved: namely, increasing the quantity and quality of sage-steppe vegetation communities in early-to mid-seral condition. This would increase habitats for wildlife species with habitats that overlap that of Greater Sage-Grouse; however, it would also generally decrease habitat availability for wildlife species or seasonal habitats of species that are not sage dependent. Considering Exceptions to Greater Sage-Grouse Restrictions in PHMA Allowing placement of developments in non-habitat portions of PHMA may increase impacts on certain wildlife and migratory birds whose habitat requirements do not overlap sagebrush areas. Adjacent non-sagebrush habitats could see an increase in development and disturbance when trying to avoid and minimize disturbance to sagebrush communities. Managing Habitat to Manage Predation The removal of corvid nest structures, including their trees, in PHMA habitat treatments may impact migratory birds by directly removing nesting structures and cover. Although this may negatively impact tree nesting migratory birds, there could be a benefit to ground and shrub nesting migratory birds due to reduced predation potential from corvids and raptors. These impacts, however, are site specific and would be analyzed in detail at the project scale. Prioritization of Mineral Leasing Removing the prioritization objective for PHMA and GHMA would not directly impact wildlife because prioritization doesn’t permit or preclude leasing in PHMA. The no surface occupancy stipulations and conservation measures in place for PHMA would protect sagebrush habitats, which could also benefit wildlife species using these habitat types; however, the prioritization could possibly delay when a given parcel is offered for lease or subsequently developed. In an area with poor habitat conditions or high levels of disturbance, such a delay could provide time for vegetation conditions to improve before new developments are implemented. Burial of Transmission Lines The Proposed Plan Amendment proposes to remove the requirement to consider burying transmission lines (except when not technically feasible) and allow increased flexibility to consider site-specific impacts and minimization options. This action could lead to a minor negative effect on migratory birds by increasing predator perches from unburied lines that may lead to increased take of migratory birds and their nests by raptors and corvids; however, impacts of predator perches could be minimized on a site-scale by use of perch deterrents on poles. There could be beneficial impacts on big game and migratory bird habitat by not burying transmission lines because it offers more protection for sensitive 4.Environmental Consequences habitat areas. Removal of sagebrush and associated vegetation can be avoided with placement of surface lines, which minimizes habitat disturbance and potential for weeds. 4.6.7 Impacts on Cultural Resources Modifying General Habitat Management Areas The Proposed Plan Amendment would remove GHMA and its management. In the 2015 amendments, OHV area designations in GHMA were changed from cross-country use for OHVs to “limited” to existing routes. In the Proposed Plan Amendment, two areas (14,220 acres) outside of PHMA at 5 Mile Pass and Little Sahara Sand Dunes areas would revert back to being available to cross-country use for OHVs. All other GHMA that switched from available to cross-country use to being limited to existing routes would remain as limited. The previous analysis in the 2015 Final EIS is clear that restrictions on surface and vehicle use would protect cultural resources from impacts due to surface disturbance, erosion, effects on setting and access leading to vandalism, inadvertent damage, and unauthorized collection of cultural resources; however, the impacts from returning to an open OHV use area may cause impacts on cultural resources, as described in Chapter 4 in the 2015 Final EIS (see Section 4.12, page 4-199 to 4-202). 4.6.8 Impacts on Lands and Realty Administering Disturbance and Density Caps The Proposed Plan Amendment could decrease impacts on lands and realty projects by allowing site-specific Greater Sage-Grouse habitat analysis and population information, as well as proponent-developed project design elements, to be considered on a project-specific basis. If those voluntary measures were to improve Greater Sage-Grouse habitat, both the disturbance and density caps could be exceeded, allowing for more flexibility to allow consideration of infrastructure projects. Rather than lands and realty projects being precluded entirely if the cap is met, there is an option to exceed the cap by proponents developing measures that improve Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. This would provide more opportunities for lands and realty projects to move forward within PHMA. Modifying Mitigation Strategy The mitigation strategy in the Proposed Plan Amendment would no longer require proponents to provide for compensatory mitigation on a project-by-project basis to show a net conservation gain. While the strategy is still substantially similar (“improve the condition of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat”), it would be achieved by the totality of Greater Sage-Grouse management actions applied by the BLM. Not requiring proponents to pay for vegetation and habitat treatments could decrease project costs, providing more opportunities for lands and realty projects to move forward in PHMA; however, during project design, the BLM would consider voluntary compensatory mitigation actions as a component of compliance with the State of Utah law, statute, or policy or when offered voluntarily by a project proponent. If such mitigation were volunteered, impacts would be the same as those described under the No-Action Alternative; however, determining which projects would apply such measures would be made on a project-by-project basis. Considering Exceptions to Greater Sage-Grouse Restrictions in PHMA Allowing exceptions to avoidance and minimization measures in PHMA if the area is non-habitat and indirect impacts wouldn’t occur could decrease impacts on lands and realty. Allowing development in areas of non-habitat inside the PHMA could allow for more flexibility to allow consideration of projects 4.Environmental Consequences if they meet the described criteria. Rather than lands and realty projects being precluded due to minimization measures, projects could seek locations within PHMA that would avoid habitat, thereby enabling development if documentation of no indirect impacts could be completed. This would provide more opportunities for lands and realty projects to move forward within PHMA. Modifying General Habitat Management Areas Removing GHMA would also lessen impacts on lands and realty as the area requiring Greater Sage-Grouse plan compliance for infrastructure projects will be reduced accordingly. This may allow some projects to move forward with fewer permitting restrictions as compared with the No-Action Alternative, however the change in impacts would likely be minor since the area that will be relieved of permitting restrictions is minimal. Land Disposal and Exchanges The changes in criteria for disposal and exchange of federal land would allow more lands to be considered for disposal without net conservation gain or requirements not to impact any Greater Sage-Grouse or its habitat. This would result in greater management flexibility to consider disposal and exchange of lands that may already have limited manageability due to being isolated tracts with limited access or control. The increased flexibility may also benefit other resources as additional lands with limited benefit to Greater Sage-Grouse could now be exchanged for lands that may have a higher benefit to other resources; however, the overall change in impacts would likely be minimal since the amount of lands affected by the change in criteria is minor. 4.6.9 Impacts on Renewable Energy Administering Disturbance and Density Caps The Proposed Plan Amendment, specifically changes in MA SSS-3B that allow site-specific Greater Sage-Grouse habitat analysis and population information and project design elements to be considered on a project-specific basis, could potentially lessen impacts on renewable energy as it would allow for more flexibility to allow infrastructure projects that exceed the disturbance cap if they meet the described criteria. This would have little impact on renewable energy development because PHMA would still be closed to commercial wind and solar development unless the project meets the exception criteria identified in MA-SSS-1. Considering Exceptions to Greater Sage-Grouse Restrictions in PHMA Allowing exceptions to avoidance and minimization measures in PHMA if the area is non-habitat and indirect impacts wouldn’t occur could decrease impacts on renewable energy projects. Allowing development in areas of non-habitat inside the PHMA would allow for more flexibility to allow consideration of projects if they meet the described criteria. Rather than renewable energy projects being precluded due to closures, projects could seek locations within PHMA that would avoid habitat and indirect impacts, thereby enabling development if documentation of no indirect impacts could be completed. The likelihood that commercial renewable energy development could find an area large enough in PHMA to avoid all habitat as well as indirect impacts would be low. Modifying General Habitat Management Areas Removing GHMA would also likely reduce impacts on renewable energy as the area requiring Greater Sage-Grouse plan compliance for infrastructure projects will be reduced accordingly. This may allow 4.Environmental Consequences some projects to move forward with fewer permitting restrictions as compared with the No-Action Alternative; however, the change in impacts would likely be minor since the area of high potential renewable energy resources that will be relieved of permitting restrictions is minimal. 4.6.10 Impacts on Fluid Minerals The BLM Utah reviewed the reasonably foreseeable development scenario, Appendix R of the 2015 Final EIS, and addressed changes in potential oil and gas exploration and development. The assumptions used in this section to adequately project future development take into account both direct and indirect impacts of removing minimization measures that may limit development desirability of former GHMA. The direct factors include increasing exceptions for no surface occupancy stipulations on new leases for oil and gas development, while the indirect included the removal of minimization measures that were applied as lease notices, such as disturbance caps, buffers, required design features, and net conservation gain mitigation requirements in both PHMA and GHMA. This section will briefly cover previous assumptions and methods used for projecting future oil and gas activity in Greater Sage-Grouse occupied habitat in the 13 population areas, and how new modifications will alter these previous projections. All baseline data from the reasonably foreseeable development scenarios by population areas in the reasonably foreseeable development scenario are assumed to remain the same. Baseline scenarios were based on criteria including past and present oil and gas exploration and development activity within and near Greater Sage-Grouse occupied habitat, existing oil and gas leases, expressions of interest submitted by industry, exploration and development trends, locations of seismic surveys, existing infrastructure, and commodity prices. Of the 13 population areas, 8 were projected to have minimal or no future oil and gas development, “minimal” meaning equivalent or less than four projected wells by 2030. These population areas were Ibapah, Box Elder, Lucerne, Hamlin Valley, Bald Hills, Panguitch, Parker Mountain, and Sheeprocks. Of the remaining five population areas, three (Rich, Emery, and Strawberry) were projected to have moderate development, and only two (Carbon and Uintah) were anticipated to have significant development on federal minerals. The baseline for these population areas (2015 Final EIS, Appendix R) has been kept the same in assumptions for the following reasons: • Less than 2 years have passed since the reasonably foreseeable development scenario, meaning minimal changes would factor into the historical data. • Only three (Carbon, Uintah, and Rich) of the population areas would have oil and gas development, if any, that would significantly change projections. • This review is meant to be a supplement to the previous reasonably foreseeable development scenario and not a complete revision; it makes projections only to 2030. The 2015 Final EIS reasonably foreseeable development scenario reviewed the development of Alternatives B, C, D, and E and a Proposed Plan, each with different stipulations on oil and gas development. These stipulations took into account PHMA and GHMA and the requirements applicable to these areas, such as no surface occupancy (NSO), controlled surface use (CSU), and timing limitations (TL). The current changes being considered in this RMPA/EIS include removing all minimization measures and compensatory mitigation requirements applicable to GHMA as identified in the 2015 4.Environmental Consequences Proposed Plan. In the 2015 RMP, PHMA and GHMA management was anticipated to deter future oil and gas development for the following reasons: • Minimization measures such as required design features (RDFs), application of lek buffers that encouraged development beyond 3.1 miles (both in PHMA and GHMA), mitigation requirements (both in PHMA and GHMA), noise and structure restrictions (in PHMA), surface disturbance caps (in PHMA), and density and seasonal restrictions (in PHMA) that were expected to discourage future development due to implementation cost; however, in the 2015 Final EIS reasonably foreseeable development scenario it is assumed that any cost of the RDFs for wells outside of the PHMA were already included in the estimated drilling and completion; therefore, removing these measures from application in former GHMA would have no change on the projected costs for oil and gas development in the RMP. • PHMA and GHMA are categorized as either closed or open with stipulations. In the 2015 Proposed Plan there were approximately 30,000 acres in GHMA that are closed to fluid mineral leasing due to reasons other than Greater Sage-Grouse. As such, all closed GHMA were also closed under the 2015 Alternative A; therefore, the closed lands would remain closed to oil and gas leasing. • Areas that are open with major stipulations (no surface occupancy) in GHMA are required to have buffer zones from leks. Areas within the vicinity of leks either have major (no surface occupancy), moderate (controlled surface use or timing limitation), or standard stipulations. These areas are minimal and are still open to oil and gas leasing under certain circumstances. The factor affecting future development in these areas is the cost associated with design features. These costs have already been addressed in the first bulleted item, above. PHMA will remain closed or open, with major stipulations. The eight population areas with minimal or no future fluid mineral development potential will not be affected by the changes in GHMA because their historical development and production has been so low that no additional leases will cause significant development or impact. Furthermore, most restricted areas within these population areas are PHMA, rather than GHMA. Emery and Rich population areas, which have moderate development potential, contain PHMA and minimal GHMA with standard stipulations, and will therefore have the same projected development potential. The Strawberry, Carbon, and Uintah population areas contain lands closed, open with major stipulations, open with moderate stipulations, and open with standard stipulations; however, Strawberry and Carbon areas contain much lower amounts of these lands than Uintah. The effects of development that could be factored into these areas would be minimal due to factors addressed in the previous paragraph. Although the Uintah population area will no longer have GHMA, most of this area remains open with moderate to standard stipulations. Since this land is mostly open to leasing already (even with GHMA), it would only be the cost of minimization measures and net conservation gain requirements that may deter development operations; however, as previously stated, it is assumed that any cost of the RDFs for wells outside of the PHMA are already included in the estimated drilling and completion costs. The assumption taken in this section for all population areas in the Proposed Plan Amendment is that minimal or no development impact through the opening of GHMA is expected. This assumption takes into account both direct and indirect impacts of removing minimization measures that may limit 4.Environmental Consequences development desirability of GHMA. It is concluded that minimal development change would occur for the following reasons: • Most of the restricted area is PHMA, and is still applicable in the current assumptions. • Most GHMA is still open for leasing with moderate to standard stipulations. • All costs that could have been applicable to stipulations were not factored into GHMA in the original reasonably foreseeable development scenario. • The 30,000 acres that are currently closed to new leasing within GHMA would remain closed to leasing. Although there would be minimal development change throughout all of the population areas, removing GHMA and its minimization measures, as well as adding waivers, exceptions, and modifications to the NSO stipulation in PHMA, would possibly allow operators access to more acreage within Greater Sage-Grouse population areas and reduce administrative impediments to development. The only change may be that operators could find a location within PHMA but not within Greater Sage-Grouse habitat (that meets the exception, modification or waiver criteria) to drill a well that is closer to target and would not have to horizontally or laterally drill to reach their target. This would save time and resources for the operator and decrease well pad sizes, in most cases, which is better for other resources. The allowance for proponents to voluntarily seek an exception to the density and disturbance caps would be assessed on a site-and project-specific basis. Obtaining the exception requires showing the project design features, combined with local topographic conditions and Greater Sage-Grouse use patterns, indicate that despite the increased disturbance there would be a benefit to the Greater Sage-Grouse population. Because of the number of site-and project-dependent issues, the effect of this action, aside from added flexibility for project proponents to explore, would be based on site-specific details and project proposals. The BLM commits to cooperating with the State of Utah to analyze applicant-proposed or state required or recommended compensatory mitigation to offset residual impacts. The BLM may authorize such actions consistent with NEPA analysis and the governing RMP. Additionally, not requiring lessees to pay for vegetation and habitat treatments to achieve a net conservation gain could decrease project costs, providing more opportunities for fluid mineral projects to move forward; however, during project design, the BLM would consider voluntary compensatory mitigation actions as a component of compliance with the State of Utah law, statute, or policy, or when offered voluntarily by a project proponent. If such mitigation were volunteered, impacts would be the same as those described under the No-Action Alternative; however, determining which projects would have such measures applied would be made on a project-by-project basis. Given the above, impacts on oil and gas from the Proposed Plan Amendment on the number of oil and gas well pads anticipated would be the same as the 2015 Final EIS Proposed Plan. The Oil and Gas Reasonably Foreseeable Development Scenario for Greater Sage-Grouse Occupied Habitat in Utah Sub-Region (Appendix R of the 2015 Final EIS) is incorporated by reference. Specifically, Table R.1 (Predicted Number of Wells Drilled by Alternative in Each Population Area and County), R.2 (Predicted Number of Producing Wells by Alternative in Each Population Area and County), and R.7 (Estimated Surface Disturbance: Proposed Plan) describe anticipated levels and development and the related estimated amount of disturbance from the Proposed Plan Amendment. 4.Environmental Consequences 4.6.11 Impacts on Nonenergy Leasable Minerals, Coal, Locatable Minerals, Mineral Materials, and Oil Shale and Tar Sands For the purpose of clarifying impact analysis in this document, the status of a fringe acreage lease in relation to the 2015 ARMPA allocations is addressed here. While the PHMA land use allocation for nonenergy minerals remains closed, there is a consideration that leases could be considered next to existing operations (see 2015 ROD/ARMPA MA-MR-15). Though PHMA is noted as closed, unmined nonenergy mineral leases, including phosphate leases, have valid existing rights to which this allocation does not apply. Specifically, as noted in the 2015 Final EIS, page 4-385, there would be sufficient reserves on private lands and on existing federal phosphate leases to keep the current operation in production through the analysis horizon. In addition, the nonenergy mineral allocation itself specifically provides for alignment with the BLM’s minerals regulations. These regulations note that those lands adjoining federal phosphate leases or the mineral rights on adjacent private lands may be leased noncompetitively through a fringe acreage lease or be added to the existing federal lease via a lease modification (43 CFR 3510.11). Such additions could be considered under existing management for MA-MR-15 that provides for leasing nonenergy leasable minerals “contiguous with an existing operation” if the new lease “applies the pertinent management for discretionary activities in PHMA identified in MA-SSS-3.” As such, fringe leases and modifications to existing leases would be allowed under both the No-Action Alternative and the Proposed Plan Amendment in alignment with federal regulations; however, management necessary to meet the goals of maintaining or increasing Greater Sage-Grouse abundance and distribution (see 2015 ROD/ARMPA, Goal SSS-1) would not allow new leases or developments that are not contiguous with existing operations. Administering Disturbance and Density Caps While the No-Action Alternative provides for development next to existing operations for nonenergy leasable minerals and mineral materials, the analysis determined that PHMA minimization measures, such as mitigation, disturbance cap, density cap, buffers, seasonal restrictions, and RDFs, would preclude most development. The primary measure that was anticipated to preclude development of nonenergy minerals, mineral materials, and coal in PHMA was the disturbance and density caps applied at the project scale. Because there is no exception to the caps under the No-Action Alternative, no new or expanded mineral operations are anticipated. Allowing an exceedance to the disturbance and density caps based on site-specific habitat condition, population information, and proponent-volunteered project design elements could allow mineral development to proceed in areas that might otherwise have been precluded by the No-Action Alternative. Allowing consideration or proposed developments that could exceed the 3 percent disturbance cap or density cap provides the ability to potentially avoid precluding leasing/permitting, development, or consideration of associated infrastructure. However, authorizing the exceedances to the disturbance and density caps would only be allowed if voluntarily developed minimization or mitigation improves Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. As such, while there is more flexibility and projects may no longer be precluded by the caps, proponents with potential developments may still need to evaluate Greater Sage-Grouse conditions or propose habitat improvement projects. While projects may not be precluded by the caps, voluntarily applying the criteria could result in additional costs to implement mitigating measures. This could increase project costs and could make a proposed project uneconomical. 4.Environmental Consequences Under the Proposed Plan Amendment, to the extent consistent with the rights of a mining claimant under existing laws and regulations, the BLM would work with locatable minerals claimants to apply the disturbance cap and minerals/energy density cap in PHMA; however, under the Mining Law of 1872, as amended, the BLM does not have authority to require such mitigation measures. As such, impacts on existing locatable mineral operations from these additional mitigation measures would be minimal. Modifying Mitigation Strategy The mitigation strategy in the Proposed Plan Amendment would no longer require proponents to provide for compensatory mitigation on a project-by-project basis to show a net conservation gain. To align this planning effort with the BLM’s compensatory mitigation policy (IM 2018-093), the Proposed Plan Amendment clarifies that BLM will consider compensatory mitigation only as a component of compliance with a state mitigation plan, program, or authority, or when offered voluntarily by a project proponent. While the strategy is still substantially similar (“improve the condition of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat”), it would be achieved by the totality of Greater Sage-Grouse management actions applied by the BLM. The BLM commits to cooperating with the State of Utah to analyze applicant-proposed or state required or recommended compensatory mitigation to offset residual impacts. BLM may authorize such actions consistent with NEPA analysis and the governing RMP. Not requiring proponents to pay for vegetation and habitat treatments could decrease project costs, providing more opportunities for mineral development projects to move forward in PHMA and former GHMA; however, during project design, the BLM would consider voluntary, compensatory, mitigation actions as a component of compliance with the State of Utah law, statute, or policy, or when offered voluntarily by a project proponent. If such mitigation were volunteered, impacts would be the same as those described under the No-Action Alternative. Determining which projects will apply such measures would be made on a project-by-project basis. Considering Exceptions to Greater Sage-Grouse Restrictions in PHMA Allowing exceptions to avoidance and minimization measures in PHMA if the area is non-habitat and indirect impacts would not occur could allow consideration of leasing/permitting and development for mineral operations. Allowing development in areas of non-habitat inside the PHMA could allow for more flexibility to allow consideration of projects if they meet the described criteria. The potential for this exception to allow larger mineral developments would be low given the small likelihood that a large development would fit entirely within an area of non-habitat in PHMA and still not have any indirect impacts would be low. For large projects in this situation, the potential effect of this added flexibility is likely low. Modifying General Habitat Management Areas Removing GHMA would decrease impediments to mineral development, as the area requiring Greater Sage-Grouse plan compliance for infrastructure projects would be reduced accordingly. This would allow some projects to move forward with fewer restrictions as compared with the No-Action Alternative. Land Disposal and Exchanges The changes in criteria for disposal and exchange of federal land would allow more lands to be considered for disposal without net conservation gain or requirements not to impact any Greater Sage-4.Environmental Consequences Grouse or its habitat. This could improve management flexibility to consider disposal and exchange of lands that may already have limited manageability due to being isolated tracts with limited access or control. The increased flexibility may also benefit other resources as additional lands with limited benefit to Greater Sage-Grouse could now be exchanged for lands that may have a higher benefit to other resources; however, the overall change in impacts would likely be minimal since the amount of lands affected by the change in criteria is minor. 4.6.12 Impacts on Social and Economic Conditions Implementation of the Proposed Plan Amendment would be expected to result in the following socioeconomic impacts, which are secondary to changes in resource and management conditions. Administering Disturbance and Density Caps Allowing an exceedance of the 3 percent disturbance and density caps could increase opportunities for development within PHMA if an area was close to meeting one of the caps. Should this occur, it is anticipated that there could be increased economic activity and, possibly, positive economic impacts at the local, regional, state, or national level. Exclusion of non-occupied PHMA from this classification could potentially result in increased development activities in the future and, in turn could result in positive economic impacts. This provision could also potentially open up additional opportunities for siting of energy or mining facilities, resulting in positive changes in economic indicators. Modifying Mitigation Strategy The BLM commits to cooperating with the State of Utah to analyze applicant-proposed or state required or recommended compensatory mitigation to offset residual impacts. BLM may authorize such actions consistent with NEPA analysis and the governing RMP. No longer requiring proponents to provide for compensatory mitigation on a project-by-project basis to show a net conservation gain could decrease project costs, providing more opportunities for lands and mineral development projects to move forward in PHMA and former GHMA; however, during project design, the BLM would consider voluntary compensatory mitigation actions as a component of compliance with the State of Utah law, statute, or policy, or when offered voluntarily by a project proponent. If such mitigation were volunteered, impacts would be the same as those described under the No-Action Alternative; however, determining which projects would apply such measures would be made on a project-by-project basis. General Habitat Management Areas in Utah Changes in Greater Sage-Grouse management outside of PHMA have the potential to reduce costs of exploration and development of multiple types of energy, mineral, and other land use resources. These include solid, fluid, locatable, saleable, and leasable (both energy- and nonenergy-related) minerals. To the extent that such costs are reduced, entities operating within the affected area could see an increase in competitiveness and profitability over time, although this result would be expected to be marginal. No social or economic impact is anticipated as a secondary impact resulting from changes in opening areas to cross-country OHV use. The areas proposed to be made available for cross-country use are components of larger areas where such use is already available. In addition, the areas proposed to be made available were available for over 20 years prior to the 2015 change to limited. As such, no change in overall OHV-related and other recreation-related spending patterns or social and economic activity are expected to occur by making the areas available to cross-country use again. 4.Environmental Consequences Land Disposal and Exchanges Increased potential for disposal and/or exchange of BLM-managed federal lands in PHMA and Greater Sage-Grouse habitat outside of PHMA could possibly result in expanded economic opportunities in the affected location. The specific economic impact in each case would depend on the type of development that would occur as a result of the change in land ownership. Possible land uses include use for county and municipal physical facilities, commercial or residential development, and/or recreational use. 4.6.13 Impacts on Other Resources After reviewing the proposed changes in the Proposed Plan Amendment, interdisciplinary team members identified which actions could affect each resource or resource use. After identifying potential impacts, team members reviewed the 2015 Final EIS to determine if the potentially significant impacts from the proposed changes were already addressed in the existing analysis. As described above, impacts associated with most of the changes were already analyzed. For the following resources and uses, there were no new significant impacts from the actions considered in Chapter 2 beyond those already addressed in the 2015 Final EIS: • Water Resources • Wild Horses and Burros • Visual Resources • Wildland Fire Management • Lands with Wilderness Characteristics • Livestock Grazing/Range Management • Recreation • Comprehensive Travel and Transportation Management • Tribal Interests Management changes associated with the following issues could result in development being moved around on the landscape (into areas of non-Greater Sage-Grouse habitat) or expedited in its implementation (not increased, but implemented more quickly): • General Habitat Management Areas in Utah • Considering Exceptions to Greater Sage-Grouse Restrictions in PHMA • Waivers, Exceptions, and Modifications for NSO Stipulations • Sagebrush Focal Areas Designations/Withdrawal Recommendations • Administering the Disturbance and Density Caps • Burial of Transmission Lines Changes in management resulting from consideration of the above list of issues could result in a change in the potential for development to occur in PHMA or former GHMA. This could include a change in where the development could occur (e.g., in non-habitat portions of PHMA, in former GHMA, or anywhere in PHMA due to exceedances in the disturbance or density cap). The change could also include the rate at which it occurs (development in GHMA occurring more quickly under the Proposed Plan Amendment, compared with the No-Action Alternative, due to removal of some minimization 4.Environmental Consequences measures and compensation requirements). In all of these instances, the impact analysis in the 2015 Final EIS addressed the effects of similar actions on the list of resources above. Those effects are substantially similar to the impacts from the changes considered in the Proposed Plan Amendment. At the state-wide context, the fact that impacts could occur is what the analyses addresses, not the more site-specific context of when or where development may occur. The conclusion of the interdisciplinary team member’s evaluation of the recommended changes was that the existing 2015 Final EIS accurately described the anticipated impacts for the resources listed above. For these resources, there would be no additional impacts from the proposed changes in the Proposed Plan Amendment than what is described in the corresponding section of the 2015 Final EIS. For these resources, analysis is incorporated by reference as there will be no new impacts that haven’t already been addressed in the 2015 Final EIS. 4.7 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS This section presents the anticipated cumulative impacts on the environment that could occur from implementing the alternatives presented in Chapter 2. A cumulative impact is the impact on the environment that results from the incremental impact of the action, when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions, regardless of what agency (federal or nonfederal) or person undertakes such actions. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor, but collectively significant actions taking place over time. The cumulative impacts resulting from the implementation of the alternatives in this RMPA/EIS may be influenced by other actions, as well as activities and conditions on other public and private lands, including those beyond the planning area boundary. These include the concurrent Forest Service planning effort to amend land management plans for National Forests in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming, which were previously amended in September 2015 to incorporate conservation measures to support the continued existence of the Greater Sage-Grouse. As a result, the sum of the effects of these incremental impacts involves determinations that often are complex, limited by the availability of information, and, to some degree, subjective. This RMPA/EIS incorporates by reference the analysis in the 2015 Final EISs and the 2016 SFA Withdrawal Draft EIS, which comprehensively analyzed the cumulative impacts associated with these planning decisions under consideration in that process. The 2015 EISs, and to some degree the 2016 SFA EIS evaluated the cumulative impacts associated with the No-Action Alternative in this RMPA/EIS. The Proposed Plan Amendment’s effects are effectively within the range of effects analyzed by the 2015 and 2016 EISs. The 2015 Final EISs are quite recent, and the BLM has determined that conditions in the Utah planning area have not changed significantly based, in part, on the USGS science review (see Chapter 3), as well as the BLM’s review of additional past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions in 2018. Conditions on public land also have changed little since the 2015 Final EISs, and to the extent that there have been new actions or developments, the impacts associated with those actions or developments are in line with the projections in the 2015 Final EISs regarding reasonably foreseeable actions and effects. Additionally, changes that have occurred on a smaller level, like wildfires, received prompt responses. Since the nature and context of the cumulative effects scenario has not appreciably changed since 2015, and the 2015 analysis covered the entire range of the Greater Sage-Grouse, the BLM’s consideration of 4.Environmental Consequences cumulative effects in the 2015 Final EISs adequately addresses most, if not all, of the planning decisions to be made through this planning effort. While the cumulative impacts analysis in the 2015 Final EISs thus offers a comprehensive foundation for this planning effort, the BLM is improving upon that analysis by integrating additional quantitative analysis specific to this planning effort. The purpose of this additional analysis is to facilitate a comparison of allocation decisions between the No-Action Alternative and Proposed Plan Amendment at scales beyond the individual planning areas associated with the 2018 amendment process. Our analysis focuses on the relevant changes in habitat delineations and allocation decisions each BLM state office is proposing and how those changes may impact our understanding of cumulative effects at the Management Zone (MZ) scale. Conservation and management partners sought to work in advance of the 2015 USFWS listing decision to develop conservation objectives for the Greater Sage-Grouse that could help direct conservation and management actions for the species. Upon further review of the best available science and commercial information, the USFWS concluded in 2010 that the Greater Sage-Grouse warranted protection under the Endangered Species Act. Two factors leading to the decision to list the species as “warranted but precluded” were threats to habitat and the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. In 2012, at the request of Utah’s Sage-Grouse Task Force (SGTF), state and federal representatives produced a report that identified the most significant areas for Greater Sage-Grouse conservation, the principal threats within those areas, and the degree to which such threats need to be reduced or ameliorated to conserve the Greater Sage-Grouse so that it would not be in danger of extinction or likely to become so in the foreseeable future. A principal component of Greater Sage-Grouse management is the implementation of mitigation actions to ameliorate the threats and impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitats. In 2015, the USFWS determined Greater Sage-Grouse was “not warranted” for listing under the ESA. The USFWS found that BLM’s 2015 land use plans were adequate regulatory mechanisms and that the species no longer warranted listing under the Act. At the time of that decision, the USFWS acknowledged the RMP requirements that compensatory mitigation achieve a net gain standard. The BLM is not proposing any action that would preclude proponents from offering compensatory mitigation; it is clarifying the BLM’s reliance on voluntary compensatory mitigation consistent with federal law. While the BLM has more than 90 RMPs, 9 strategies, and 45 agreements in active use that contain or address compensatory mitigation, the BLM has identified only limited implementation of compensatory mitigation consistent with the 2015 Greater Sage-Grouse Plans. Using data gathered in 2017, the BLM identified 13 Greater Sage-Grouse projects across 5 BLM states with a mandatory compensatory mitigation component or net gain standard implemented between October 2008 and June 2017. The most common compensatory actions used by the BLM in those cases were habitat restoration, habitat improvements, rangeland improvements, and invasive species control – actions consistent with the BLM’s own investment in management action described previously. In many cases, it is still too soon in the implementation of these mitigation actions to measure the effectiveness or degree of benefit each action provides. Anecdotally, the existing conservation credit systems, banks, and exchanges designed to offset impacts to Greater Sage-Grouse or its habitat have had mixed success. The BLM is aware of three mitigation banks (one commercial bank agreement in Wyoming and two single-user bank agreements with mining 4.Environmental Consequences companies in Nevada) and one exchange system in Colorado specific to Greater Sage-Grouse currently in operation. However, the BLM does not have access to data or information that would further assess the relative benefit provided by these systems. The BLM has determined that FLPMA does not explicitly mandate or authorize the BLM to require public land users to implement compensatory mitigation as a condition of obtaining authorization for the use of the public lands. Consistent with that determination and with BLM IM 2018-093, Compensatory Mitigation, the Proposed Plan Amendment clarifies how voluntary compensatory mitigation or a state mitigation requirement or recommendation should be considered in the management of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. This clarification aligns the Proposed Plan Amendment with BLM policy and the scope of compensatory mitigation authority expressly provided by FLPMA. Any analysis of compensatory mitigation relating to future projects is speculative at this level of land use planning; therefore, analysis of compensatory mitigation is more appropriate for future project-specific NEPA. In other words, the applicability and overall effectiveness of voluntary actions cannot be fully assessed until the project level when the specific location, design, and impacts are known. In PHMA within the planning area, and in all designated Greater Sage-Grouse habitats outside the planning area, the BLM will ensure both mitigation and management actions that achieve the planning-level management goals and objectives identified in this RMPA. The BLM has a variety of tools available to effectively achieve those management goals such as restoration projects and habitat improvements. The BLM will continue plan effectiveness monitoring to provide the data needed to evaluate BLM actions toward reaching the goals and objectives set forth in the RMPAs. Effectiveness monitoring methods will encompass multiple larger scales, from areas as large as the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA) MZ to the scale of this RMPA. Effectiveness data used for these larger-scale evaluations will include all lands in the area of interest, regardless of surface management, and will help inform where finer-scale evaluations are needed. Currently BLM has six state-specific RMPA efforts that are all aligning mitigation with their relevant State authorities. All of the Proposed Plan Amendments modify the existing standard for compensatory mitigation but maintain that the BLM will pursue conservation efforts as a broader planning goal and objective. Cumulatively, if the BLM is implementing planning decisions across the broader range, such actions would preclude any cumulative impacts from modifying the mitigation standard at the project level. The BLM has updated certain data that it collected and evaluated in the 2015 Final EIS concerning the 2015 plan allocation decisions to reflect maintenance-related changes, adaptive management responses, and refined source data. The BLM used these data to represent the No-Action Alternative for the current plan analysis. The BLM also identified 2015 data which are not subject to change in any alternatives associated with the 2018 planning process. These data were carried forward as the alternative allocation decision data. The BLM was also able to provide allocation decision data representing changes included in the 2018 Draft EIS alternatives, which were then used in the comparative analysis. 4.Environmental Consequences 4.7.1 Range-wide Cumulative Effects Analysis – Greater Sage-Grouse The 2015 ROD/ARMPA is the No-Action Alternative in this RMPA/EIS and was part of the cumulative impact analysis for Greater Sage-Grouse at the WAFWA zone scale in the 2015 Final EIS (see Table 4-3). Additionally, the cumulative impacts anticipated from the Management Alignment Alternative and the Proposed Plan presented in this RMPA/EIS are entirely within the range of effects analyzed by the 2015 Final EIS. While the analysis for the 2015 Final EIS is quite recent, the BLM has reviewed conditions in Utah to verify that they have not changed significantly. Conditions on BLM-administered lands have changed little since the 2015 Final EIS, and to the extent that there have been new actions or developments, the impacts associated with those actions or developments are in line with the projections in the 2015 Final EIS regarding reasonably foreseeable future actions and effects. The BLM’s assessment that conditions and cumulative impacts have not changed significantly is based, in part, on the USGS science review (see Chapter 3) and the BLM’s review of additional past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions in 2018. Since the nature and context of the cumulative effects scenario have not appreciably changed since 2015, and the 2015 plans included analysis by WAFWA MZ across the entire range of the Greater Sage-Grouse, the cumulative effects analysis in the 2015 Final EIS applies to this planning effort and provides a foundation for the BLM to identify any additional cumulative impacts. The remainder of this chapter and related appendices includes additional quantitative analysis using the existing cumulative impacts across the range and integrating additional quantitative analysis specific to this planning effort to provide a comprehensive range-wide view of cumulative impacts. The purpose of this additional analysis is to facilitate a comparison of allocation decisions between the No-Action and Management Alignment (Proposed Plan Amendment) Alternatives at scales beyond the individual planning areas associated with the 2018 amendment process. The analysis focuses on the relevant changes in habitat delineations and allocation decisions each BLM state office is proposing and how those changes may affect the understanding of cumulative effects at the WAFWA MZ scale across the range of Greater Sage-Grouse. Under the Management Alignment Alternative (Proposed Plan Amendment), the recommendation to withdraw sagebrush focal areas (SFA) from location and entry under the Mining Law of 1872 would be removed, as the EIS process considering the proposed withdrawal was canceled on October 11, 2017. In its 2016 SFA Withdrawal EIS, the BLM quantified the possible adverse effects from locatable mineral exploration and mining on the approximately 10 million acres of SFAs proposed for withdrawal, finding that they would be limited to approximately 9,000 acres rangewide of surface disturbance over 20 years, with approximately 0.58 percent of Greater Sage-Grouse male birds possibly affected per year. The other action alternatives evaluated in the 2016 SFA Withdrawal Draft EIS similarly demonstrated negligible benefit of the proposed withdrawal to Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat.1 1Importantly, mining operations that do occur are subject to regulation under the BLM’s surface management regulations at 43 CFR 3809. These regulations ensure that operators comply with environmental standards in conducting exploration, mining, and reclamation. For example, the BLM must approve a plan of operations for locatable mining operations on public lands, which includes compliance with the NEPA, National Historic Preservation Act, and ESA. Plans of operation must also include those measures to meet specific performance standards and to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of the lands (43 CFR 3809.411). 4.Environmental Consequences The cumulative effects of implementing the Management Alignment Alternative (Proposed Plan Amendment) are as described in the 2016 SFA Withdrawal Draft EIS, under the No-Action Alternative, in which SFAs are not carried forward for withdrawal. Greater Sage-Grouse would not be affected as a result of the removal of the recommendation to withdraw SFAs from location and entry under the Mining Law of 1872, as the recommendation itself does not have any on-the-ground effects. Conservation benefits of a future withdrawal would be negligible, as documented in the 2016 SFA Withdrawal DEIS and as explained above; therefore, there would be negligible cumulative impacts associated with the decision to remove the SFA designation. The direct and indirect impact analysis specifically enumerates how each BLM allocation decision to apply NSO stipulations and waivers, exceptions, or modifications overlaps with the SFA designation. 4.7.2 Why use WAFWA Management Zones? The Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA) represents state and provincial fish and wildlife agencies and supports sound resource management and building partnerships to conserve wildlife for the use and benefit of all citizens, now and in the future. The BLM is analyzing habitats and allocation decisions at the scale of the six WAFWA delineated Greater Sage-Grouse MZs within which the plan amendments are occurring to enable the decision maker to understand the impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse at a biologically meaningful scale (see Figure 1 in Appendix 1). The MZs were delineated based on floristic provinces (identified by Connelly et al. 2004) within which the vegetative communities comprising Greater Sage-Grouse habitat as well as the Greater Sage-Grouse populations are responding similarly to environmental factors and management decisions (Stiver et.al. 2006). The cumulative effects analysis area for Greater Sage-Grouse extends beyond a state, political, or planning area boundary to reflect the WAFWA MZs because they encompass areas with similar issues, threats, and vegetative conditions important Greater Sage-Grouse habitat management. Each suite of threats to specific Greater Sage-Grouse populations have been identified in the COT report, 2015 Regional RODs, and the Listing Decision. The 2015 Regional RODs identify how planning level allocation decisions address the identified threats to populations, which are aggregated in this analysis by MZs. The threats vary geographically and may have more or less impact on Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat in some parts of the MZs, depending on such factors as climate, land use patterns, and topography. The map below identifies the WAFWA MZs and Greater Sage-Grouse population areas. Table 4-3 shows the resource and location of applicable cumulative effects analysis from 2015 Final EIS. Unless otherwise addressed in this chapter, the cumulative effects of the alternatives analyzed in this Proposed RMPA/Final EIS are covered by the 2015 Final EIS and the 2016 SFA Withdrawal Draft EIS. This includes the incremental impacts across the range of BLM-and Forest Service-administered lands being amended in concurrent plan amendment efforts. See the 2015 Final EIS for additional information. Table 4-3 Cumulative Effects Analysis Incorporated by Reference Resource Topic Location of Cumulative Effects Analysis Greater Sage-Grouse Chapter 5, Section 5.4 of the 2015 Final EIS and Chapter 4, Section 4.5.9 of the 2016 SFA Withdrawal Draft EIS.

These effects are 4.Environmental Consequences important to consider for future management of the species as a whole and are not solely being analyzed at the local or state level. This section also describes the threats to Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat. The magnitude of change between the No-Action Alternative and Proposed Plan Amendments, by decision, is represented in pie charts and tables within this section and in Appendix 1. Those effects, in addition to synthesizing the plan decisions and comparing the current condition to the condition that will be in effect when the proposed plans are finalized, allow for a comparison of the change in management direction within MZs and across planning regions. The habitat fragmentation and disturbance from energy development and mining, including associated infrastructure (e.g., roads, railroads, power lines, pipelines – see Table E-1 in Appendix E) remain the greatest threat to Greater Sage-Grouse in the Rocky Mountain region; the levels of development are within the range of projected wildland fire analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS. Wildfire threat remains a concern in the area as well and is the greatest threat to Greater Sage-Grouse in the Great Basin region. Between 2008 and 2018, wildfires burned an average of 900,000 acres per year in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat management areas range-wide2; this is within the range of projected wildland fire analyzed in the 2015 Final EIS. The BLM has committed resources to habitat restoration and rangewide has treated 1.4 million acres of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat range-wide over the past five years. The interagency (including BLM) WAFWA-led Wildfire and Invasive Species Working Group reviewed recent information for their May 2018 Gap Report Update to the Wildfire and Invasive Plant Species in the Sagebrush Biome: Challenges that hinder current and future management and protection report. They found that all of the original challenges related to control and reduction of the invasive annual grass/fire cycle were still relevant (policy, fiscal and science challenges) as well as pointing to three new gaps involving program capacity, resource specialists, and developing guidelines on drought and climate adaption to manage sagebrush ecosystems. The increased flexibility proposed in these amendments can allow for responsible development of other uses in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and may reduce costs to proponents but is not expected to result in a large increase in development proposals on public land. Similarly, the increased protections from the 2015 Final EIS have not resulted in a large decrease in ROW applications or an increase in rejected applications; therefore, the changes proposed under the Proposed Plan Amendment are not expected to result in large changes to the rate of development across the range, or in its economy. Some 350 species of plants and wildlife rely on sagebrush steppe ecosystems and coexist with Greater Sage-Grouse and may be similarly affected by development or disturbance; however, nothing in the considered alternatives would lessen the BLM’s authority or responsibility to provide for the needs of special status species, as described in BLM LUPs, Policies, and Laws, including Manual 6840, the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA). Increased flexibility for other uses within Greater Sage-Grouse habitat does not necessarily increase potential 2 Removing 2012 and 2017, which were above-average wildland fire years, the 8-year average is approximately 500,000 acres burned per year. 4.Environmental Consequences impacts on other wildlife or plant species. Site-specific NEPA analysis including an evaluation of impacts on special status species is required for on-the-ground projects within the planning area. 4.7.3 Cumulative Effects on Greater Sage-Grouse: Management Zone I In addition to the analysis in the 2015 Final EIS in Table 4-3, other anticipated incremental impacts are discussed below in association with planning issues being analyzed in this RMPA/EIS. MZ I encompasses portions of Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Montana is currently not undergoing a plan amendment process; therefore, none of the proposed changes described in this section apply to Greater Sage-Grouse in Montana. Under the Proposed Plan Amendment in WAFWA MZ I, PHMA and GHMA designations would not change from those identified in the No-Action Alternative. In addition, no changes in allocations are proposed in either of the planning areas in this MZ. Approximately 16 percent of the planning area across MZ I is designated as PHMA, and 38 percent is GHMA. Future adjustments to PHMA and GHMA in MZ I would be based on best available science and to align with the respective states’ delineations for Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. Wyoming’s current planning effort, and Montana’s existing plans, incorporate management flexibility to allow for site specific adjustments to land use plan authorizations for adaptive management strategies, livestock grazing management, and other proposed land uses. The use and application of compensatory mitigation in the planning area would follow the respective State plans, resulting in greater consistency across the MZ. For these actions, cumulative impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and populations across MZ I would be consistent with those impacts described in the 2015 Final EISs for the then Proposed Plan Amendments. The currently Proposed Plan Amendment changes from the No-Action Alternative are minor, and still maintain prescriptive management for Greater Sage-Grouse habitat across the MZ for surface disturbing activities. Disturbance from energy development, mining, and infrastructure, as well as the resulting habitat fragmentation, remain the greatest threat to Greater Sage-Grouse in the Rocky Mountain Region. Because the land use prescriptions and allocations are not proposed for change in Wyoming’s land use plan amendment, there would be no additional cumulative impact on Greater Sage-Grouse populations or habitat within MZ I. A summary of potential cumulative impacts by proposed management action is presented below. Impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse as a result of surface disturbance would likely be greater where development and disturbance is more intense and in areas where development overlaps sensitive habitats. The degree of impact would depend on the timing of development activities and whether the amount of development activity and disruption outpaces successful reclamation and revegetation efforts in disturbed areas. Increased flexibility for updating Greater Sage-Grouse habitat management areas across MZ I would not result in any additive impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse and could result in beneficial impacts as a result of consistent management across the zone. Any future modifications of habitat management areas would be documented using the appropriate level of NEPA that would, as applicable, provide analysis regarding any potential impacts; however, because the underlying habitat management area allocations and the respective restrictions on those allocations 4.Environmental Consequences put in place to conserve Greater Sage-Grouse would not change, and any proposed updates would reflect the most recent knowledge concerning Greater Sage-Grouse habitat use and distribution, there would be no appreciable additive impact from the implementation of this aspect on Greater Sage-Grouse habitat or population. Under the BLM’s Wyoming Management Alignment Alternative, the recommendation to withdraw SFAs from location and entry under the Mining Law of 1872 would be removed, as the EIS process considering the proposed withdrawal was canceled on October 11, 2017. In its 2016 SFA Withdrawal EIS, the BLM quantified the possible adverse effects from locatable mineral exploration and mining on the approximately 10 million acres of SFAs proposed for withdrawal, finding that they would be limited to approximately 9,000 acres of surface disturbance over 20 years, with approximately 0.58 percent of Greater Sage-Grouse male birds affected per year. Approximately 99 percent of GHMA and PHMA habitat in MZ I is open to livestock grazing, and this is not proposed for change in Wyoming’s proposed land use plan amendment; Montana is also not proposing any changes to livestock management at this time. Therefore, no additional cumulative impacts beyond those identified in the 2015 Final EISs are anticipated. In general, livestock can influence habitat by modifying plant biomass, plant height and cover, and plant species composition. As a result, livestock grazing could cause changes in habitat; changes in plant composition could occur in varying degrees and could change vegetative structure, affecting cover for nesting birds. However, grazing can be used to reduce fuel loads and reduce the risk of wildfire and can also be managed to reduce the spread of invasive grasses. Much of the landscape in MZ I is adapted to withstand grazing disturbance, having been grazed by bison before the West was settled. In addition, the BLM has applied Standards for Rangeland Health since 1997 in order to enhance sustainable livestock grazing and wildlife habitat while protecting watersheds and riparian ecosystems. Under proposed management in MZ I, the BLM would be able to adjust forage levels to meet rangeland health standards based on site-specific information that would inform livestock management decisions. While the Proposed land use plan amendment in Wyoming would remove the Greater Sage-Grouse specific language Management Action 4 (see Table 2-1, Permit Renewals, of the Wyoming Proposed RMPA/Final EIS), the wildlife/special status species standards are emphasized. As Greater Sage-Grouse would continue to be considered at the implementation level with site-specific analysis, following management prescriptions analyzed in the 2014 and 2015 Final EISs, no additive impact of this change is anticipated. Adaptive Management, Mitigation, and Prioritization of Leasing Similarly, no appreciable additive impacts are anticipated from Wyoming establishing a process whereby adaptive management actions are reviewed and reversed once the identified causal factor is resolved. This process would ensure that the BLM is using the best available science and decision support tools to guide management at the appropriate spatial scale, thus improving the BLM’s assessment and response to ever-changing conditions that could affect Greater Sage-Grouse populations and/or habitat, as well as ensuring that once causal factors are resolved, management reverts to pre-adaptive management actions. Because any specific response to tripping a hard or soft trigger would be based on the causal 4.Environmental Consequences factors responsible, presuming a specific response to unknown future conditions would be speculative at best and not reasonably foreseeable. As Montana is not proposing to change any part of its adaptive management process, and Wyoming did not identify any additional direct or indirect impacts as a result of this proposed change, there are no additional cumulative impacts associated with the proposed changes to adaptive management implementation. Under the Proposed Plan Amendment in Wyoming, language would be added to clarify how implementation-level decisions would be guided regarding mitigation and prioritization of fluid mineral leasing to better align with state conservation plans and management strategies. As identified in the direct and indirect effects section of this Final EIS, impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse would be minor as a result of these changes and could include localized detrimental impacts in some areas and beneficial impacts in others, but would not affect Greater Sage-Grouse conservation. As a result, there would be no appreciable additive impact from the implementation of these clarifications on Greater Sage-Grouse habitat or population across MZ I. BLM’s proposed land use plan amendments in MZ I are also unlikely to preclude the reasonably foreseeable actions listed in Appendix 1 from proceeding. Some small, localized populations may be at continued risk due to reasonably foreseeable infrastructure and energy development projects over the next 20 years, when combined with unplanned events such as wildfires, drought, and associated decline in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat quality; however, the proposed plan amendments retain conservation measures that would be applied consistent with State management plans, and continued proactive habitat restoration efforts being completed by private, local, state, and federal partners across the MZ, to adequately conserve and manage Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. 4.7.4 Cumulative Effects on Greater Sage-Grouse: Management Zone II/VII In addition to the analysis in the 2015 Final EIS in Table 4-3, other anticipated incremental impacts are discussed below in association with planning issues being analyzed in this RMPA/EIS. MZ s II/VII encompass portions of Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Montana, and Idaho. Under the Proposed Plan Amendment in this MZ, PHMA would decrease by 1 percent and GHMA would decrease by 1 percent, compared to the acreage values in the No-Action Alternative. The proposed change in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat management area acres reflects changes in Utah, where PHMA would be reduced by approximately 35,000 acres and GHMA (826,000 acres) would be removed in an effort to align with the SGMA identified by the State of Utah. In Idaho, approximately 50,000 acres would change from PHMA to Important Habitat Management Area (IHMA) for population monitoring purposes as a result of a tripped adaptive management trigger; however, the habitat would continue to be managed as PHMA, which results in no net change to overall acreages included in the habitat management areas. Across this MZ, no other modifications to habitat management areas are currently proposed. Montana is currently not undergoing a plan amendment process; therefore, none of the proposed changes described in this section apply to Greater Sage-Grouse in Montana. In Colorado, in the no action alternative, PHMA within one mile of active leks is closed to leasing. The proposed action would open one mile of active leks to leasing, subject to NSO with restrictive criteria 4.Environmental Consequences for waivers, exceptions, and modifications. Although that allocation change would make additional acres available to leasing, the impact on Greater Sage-Grouse is likely to be minimal because surface disturbance, fragmentation, and indirect habitat loss would not be expected to increase due to restrictions on surface disturbance. Additionally, better coordination with the State provides more of an all-lands approach that, due to multiple jurisdictions with regulatory authority over land and mineral ownership, may result in better protections for Greater Sage-Grouse and Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. For the remainder of the planning areas within MZ II/VII, land use plan allocations tied to HMAs did not change between the No-Action Alternative and the Proposed Plan Amendment. The decrease in PHMA and GHMA as a result of better alignment with the State of Utah’s Greater Sage-Grouse management plan between the No-Action Alternative and the Proposed Plan Amendment would have negligible to minimal impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat in the context of the entire MZ. The reduction of PHMA was associated with timbered mountains that do not include Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. The removal of GHMA in MZ II/VII effects populations where the BLM has very little decision space (surface or mineral estates) or areas with very small populations that are already heavily impacted by existing oil and gas development resulting in infrastructure at a density above what science has indicated Greater Sage-Grouse will persist. Additionally, the relevant distribution of land use plan allocations associated with these HMA changes would not significantly change (0–3 percent; see Appendix 1). Additionally, because Utah provides habitat for approximately 5 percent of the Greater Sage-Grouse population range-wide, and GHMA in Utah comprises only approximately 5 percent of the birds in Utah, removal of GHMA in Utah would only affect 0.25 percent of the range-wide Greater Sage-Grouse population. Given the small number of birds affected and the existing habitat conditions in GHMA (not administered by the BLM, already impacted by existing development, or small and isolated patches with little history of occupancy by local biologists), removing GHMA in Utah will not result in cumulative effects to Greater Sage-Grouse populations range-wide. The planning efforts being undertaken in this MZ would incorporate management flexibility in Colorado, Utah, and Idaho plans that would allow exceptions to allocation decisions similar to flexibility already in the Wyoming and Montana plans. These changes would allow for site-specific adjustments for land use authorizations based on site conditions. In addition, there would be adjustments to existing adaptive management strategies for all plans in this MZ. Within this MZ, all plans would remove the recommendation to withdraw SFAs from location and entry under the 1872 Mining Law would make slight adjustments to habitat objectives, and Colorado and Idaho plans would identify new exceptions to seasonal timing restrictions to provide for consideration of site-specific conditions already present in the Utah, Wyoming and Montana plans. Despite these actions, cumulative impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse populations and habitat across MZ II/VII would be consistent with those impacts identified in the 2015 Final EISs for the then proposed plan amendments. The currently Proposed Plan Amendments changes from the No-Action Alternative would be minor. Disturbance from energy development, mining, and infrastructure, as well as the resulting habitat fragmentation, remain the greatest threat to Greater Sage-Grouse in the Rocky Mountain Region. Because the land use prescriptions within designated habitat management areas and the allocations associated with those habitat management areas are not being proposed for change in any plan in MZ II/VII, there would be no additional cumulative impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse across this MZ. 4.Environmental Consequences A summary of potential cumulative impacts by proposed management action is presented below. Impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse as a result of surface disturbance would likely be greater where development and disturbance is more intense and in areas where development overlaps sensitive habitats. The degree of impact would depend on the timing of development activities and whether the amount of development activity and disruption outpaces successful reclamation and revegetation efforts in disturbed areas. Increased flexibility for updating habitat management areas across MZ II/VII would not result in any additive impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse and could result in beneficial impacts as a result of consistent management across the zone. Future modifications of habitat management areas would be documented using the appropriate level of NEPA that would, as applicable, provide analysis regarding any potential impacts; however, because the underlying habitat management area allocations and the respective restrictions on those allocations put in place to conserve Greater Sage-Grouse would not change, and any proposed updates would reflect the most recent knowledge concerning Greater Sage-Grouse habitat use and distribution, there would be no appreciable additive impact from the implementation of this aspect on Greater Sage-Grouse habitat or population. The allocation exception process would be updated in Colorado, Utah, and Idaho to simplify the various exemptions contained in the 2015 Final EIS. While the availability of exceptions to land use plan allocations attached to PHMA and GHMA could increase the possibility of leasing, permitting, or ground-disturbing activities within a given habitat management area, the established criteria would ensure that projects are either in unsuitable Greater Sage-Grouse habitat; do not result in direct, indirect, or cumulative impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse; benefit Greater Sage-Grouse or its habitat; or can be offset, with the exception of those needed for public health and safety; therefore, there would be no appreciable additive impact from the implementation of this action on Greater Sage-Grouse or the resources/uses analyzed herein, as compared with the No-Action Alternative. In MZ II/VII, approximately 216,000 acres of PHMA in Wyoming and 164,000 acres of PHMA in Utah were recommended for withdrawal from location and entry under the 1872 Mining Law in the current RMPs. This recommendation, if implemented through a future separate withdrawal action supported by its own NEPA, would apply to approximately 3 percent of the MZ. The proposed change to the withdrawal recommendation itself would not have any on-the-ground effects, and the conservation benefits of a future withdrawal would be minimal, as documented in the 2016 SFA Withdrawal Draft EIS and as explained above. Approximately 99 percent of GHMA and PHMA in MZ II/VII is open to livestock grazing; this is not proposed for change in any states’ land use plan amendments; therefore, no additional cumulative impacts beyond those identified in the 2015 Final EISs are anticipated. In general, livestock can influence habitat by modifying plant biomass, plant height and cover, and plant species composition. Improper livestock grazing could cause changes in habitat; changes in plant composition could occur in varying degrees and could change vegetative structure, affecting cover for nesting birds; however, proper grazing can be used to reduce fuel loads and reduce the risk of wildfire and can also be managed to reduce the spread of invasive grasses. Specific impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse habitat from livestock grazing are incorporated by reference from the 2015 Final EIS. All ongoing planning efforts in MZ II/VII would make slight adjustments to habitat objectives, and, in Wyoming and Utah, would provide for more flexibility 4.Environmental Consequences for making site-specific adjustments to livestock grazing management if the site-specific monitoring indicated adjustments were necessary. Under the proposed land use plan amendments, language would be added to clarify how some implementation level decisions, including mitigation, prioritization of fluid mineral leasing, disturbance caps, and clarification of RDFs would be guided to better align with state conservation plans and management strategies. As identified in the direct and indirect effects section of this Final EIS, impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse would be minor as a result of these changes and could include localized detrimental impacts in some areas and beneficial impacts in others, but would not cumulatively compromise Greater Sage-Grouse conservation efforts throughout the individual states. As a result, there would be no appreciable additive impact from the implementation of these clarifications on Greater Sage-Grouse habitat or population across this MZ. Similarly, no appreciable additive impacts are anticipated from updating the adaptive management process as described in the Proposed Plan Amendments. In Wyoming and Utah, this process would be updated at the implementation level to ensure that adaptive management actions are reviewed and reversed once the identified causal factor is resolved. In all states in this MZ, this update would ensure that the BLM is using the best available science and decision support tools to guide management at the appropriate spatial scale, thus improving the BLM’s assessment and response to ever-changing conditions that could affect Greater Sage-Grouse populations and/or habitat. Because any specific response to tripping a hard or soft trigger would be based on the causal factors responsible, presuming a specific response to unknown future conditions would be speculative and not reasonably foreseeable. In Idaho, removal of the project disturbance cap would not result in any changes to allocation decisions; rather, it would allow the BLM to cluster development in PHMA and IHMA only after meeting the anthropogenic disturbance screening criteria and the disturbance development criteria. Lek buffer modifications would also not result in any allocation changes. Some lek buffers would be increased as a result of the proposed land use plan amendment, but, in some cases, the lek buffers may be smaller than those identified in the No-Action Alternative; however, the existing disturbance screening criteria and the disturbance development criteria would highly restrict development activities in both PHMA and IHMA; therefore, the changes in lek buffers sizes would have no additive effect. BLM’s proposed land use plan amendments in MZ II/VII are also unlikely to preclude the reasonably foreseeable actions listed in Appendix 1 from proceeding. Some small, localized populations may be at continued risk due to reasonably foreseeable infrastructure and energy development projects over the next 20 years, when combined with unplanned events such as wildfires, drought, and associated decline in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat quality; however, the proposed plan amendments retain conservation measures that would be applied consistent with State management plans, and continued proactive habitat restoration efforts being completed by private, local, state, and federal partners across the MZ, to adequately conserve and maintain Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. 4.7.5 Cumulative Effects on Greater Sage-Grouse: Management Zone III In addition to the analysis in the 2015 Final EIS in Table 4-3, other anticipated incremental impacts are discussed below in association with planning issues being analyzed in this RMPA/EIS. This area encompasses portions of California, Nevada, and Utah. Under the Proposed Plan Amendments in Nevada and Northeastern California and Utah, PHMA would decrease by 1 percent, GHMA would 4.Environmental Consequences decrease by 2 percent, and for Nevada and Northeastern California only, Occupied Habitat Management Area (OHMA) would decrease by 2 percent, as compared to the acreages identified in the No-Action Alternative. The proposed change in habitat management area acres between the No-Action Alternative and the Proposed Plan Amendment in Nevada and Northeastern California is based on adjustments made to habitat modeling used to delineate habitat management areas and improve alignment with the State of Nevada’s delineations for habitat management areas, which the State of Nevada adopted by in December 2015. In Utah, GHMA (approximately 860,000 acres) was removed in the Proposed Plan Amendment in an effort to align with the SGMAs identified by the State of Utah. None of the GHMA removed in MZ III includes any leks, and is largely comprised of areas not administered by the BLM, areas already impacted by existing development, or areas that contain small and isolated patches of habitat with little to no history of recent occupancy by local biologists. Additionally, because Utah provides habitat for approximately 5 percent of the Greater Sage-Grouse population range-wide, and GHMA in Utah comprises only approximately 5 percent of the birds in Utah, removal of GHMA in Utah would only affect 0.25 percent of the range-wide Greater Sage-Grouse population. Given the small number of birds affected and the existing habitat conditions in the GHMA, removing GHMA in Utah will not result in cumulative effects to Greater Sage-Grouse populations range-wide. Following this habitat management area modification, planning-level allocation decisions have also been adjusted in the Proposed Plan Amendments to reflect the distribution of habitat in Nevada/Northeastern California. In both planning areas within this MZ, land use plan allocations tied to habitat management areas did not change between the alternatives. The decrease in PHMA, GHMA, and OHMA within WAFWA MZ III between the No-Action Alternative and the Proposed Plan Amendment would therefore have negligibleto-minimal impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat in the context of the entire MZ, as the relevant distribution of land use plan allocations associated with these habitat management areas is not significantly changing (only an overall 0-3 percent decrease, see Appendix 1). Both planning efforts’ Proposed Plan Amendments in MZ III incorporate management flexibility that would allow exceptions to allocation decisions within PHMA, GHMA, OHMA in Nevada and Northeastern California, and in both planning areas, would allow for site specific adjustments for land use authorizations and adjustments to existing adaptive management strategies. Under both sets of Proposed Plan Amendments, the BLM would remove the recommendation to withdraw SFAs from location and entry under the Mining Law of 1872, make slight adjustments to habitat objectives, and identify new exceptions to seasonal timing restrictions. The cumulative impacts of these proposed changes to Greater Sage-Grouse populations across MZ III would be consistent with the cumulative impacts analyzed and disclosed in the 2015 Final EISs. Moreover, these proposed changes, which focus on anthropogenic disturbances, would have only a minor or limited effect on efforts to manage and conserve Greater Sage-Grouse in this MZ, where wildfire, invasive plants, and conifer encroachment are the greater threats to the Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat. BLM’s Proposed Plan Amendments in the MZ are also unlikely to preclude the reasonably foreseeable actions listed in Appendix 1 from proceeding. Some small, localized populations may be at continued risk due to the reasonably foreseeable future infrastructure and energy development projects over the next 20 years, when combined with unplanned events such as wildfires, drought, and associated decline 4.Environmental Consequences in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat quality; however, the Proposed Plan Amendments retain conservation measures in combination with continued proactive habitat restoration efforts being completed by private, local, state, and federal partners across the MZ to adequately conserve and maintain Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. A summary of potential cumulative impacts by proposed management action is presented below. Under the Management Alignment Alternative, habitat management area boundaries in Nevada would be adopted or revised to incorporate the best available science (Coates et al. 2016). Because the underlying habitat management area allocations put in place to conserve Greater Sage-Grouse would not change, and these updates reflect the most recent knowledge concerning Greater Sage-Grouse habitat use and distribution, there would be no appreciable additive impact from the implementation of this aspect on Greater Sage-Grouse or the resources/uses analyzed herein. Similarly, no appreciable additive impacts are anticipated from updating the adaptive management process as described in the Proposed Plan Amendments. This update would ensure that the BLM is utilizing the best available science and decision support tools to guide management at the appropriate spatial scale, thus improving the BLM’s assessment and response to ever-changing conditions that could affect Greater Sage-Grouse populations or habitat. Because any specific response to tripping a hard or soft trigger would be based on the causal factors responsible, presuming a specific response to unknown future conditions would be speculative at best and not reasonably foreseeable. Under the Proposed Plan Amendment, the allocation exception process would be updated to simplify the various exemptions contained in the 2015 Final EIS. While the availability of exceptions to land use plan allocations attached to PHMA and GHMA could increase the possibility of leasing, permitting, or ground-disturbing activities within a given habitat management area, the established criteria would ensure that projects are either in unsuitable Greater Sage-Grouse habitat; do not result in direct, indirect, or cumulative impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse; or can be offset, with the exception of those needed for public health and safety; therefore, there would be no appreciable additive impact from the implementation of this action on Greater Sage-Grouse or the resources and uses analyzed herein, as compared with the No-Action Alternative. Under the Proposed Plan Amendments, language would be added to clarify how implementation-level decisions would be guided regarding mitigation, seasonal timing restrictions, and modifying habitat objectives to better align with state conservation plans and management strategies. As these updates did not result in any new identifiable direct or indirect impacts, there would be no appreciable additive impact from the implementation of this aspect on Greater Sage-Grouse or the resources/uses analyzed herein, as compared with the No-Action Alternative. 4.7.6 Cumulative Effects on Greater Sage-Grouse: Management Zone IV In addition to the analysis in the 2015 Final EIS in Table 4-3, other anticipated incremental impacts are discussed below in association with planning issues being analyzed in this RMPA/EIS. MZ IV encompasses portions of Idaho, Nevada, Montana, Oregon, Utah, and a small portion of Wyoming. Under the Proposed Plan Amendment PHMA would decrease by 2 percent, IHMA would decrease by 0 percent, GHMA would decrease by 0 percent, and OHMA would decrease by 1 percent, 4.Environmental Consequences as compared to the acreage identified in the No-Action Alternative. The proposed change in habitat management area acres between the No-Action Alternative and the Proposed Plan Amendment in Nevada is based on adjustments made to habitat modeling used to delineate the habitat management areas and to improve alignment with the State of Nevada’s delineations for habitat management areas. In Idaho, minor proposed changes in habitat management areas are based on cleaning up habitat mapping errors, removing non-Greater Sage-Grouse habitat that is being managed as PHMA as a result of SFA designation in the 2015 ARMPA, and reallocating an area of PHMA to IHMA because there was no historic lek routes in the PHMA polygon. This made it impossible to apply the adaptive management framework in that polygon. Habitat management areas are not proposed to change in Wyoming, Utah, or Oregon in MZ IV. The direct and indirect effects of proposed management changes in the Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, and Oregon are disclosed in each state’s Final EIS. Change in allocation decisions is a better indicator to determine how changes across a MZ will affect Greater Sage-Grouse populations; therefore, this cumulative effects analysis relied on changes in planning allocations as the metric to measure cumulative effects in MZ IV. In all planning areas within MZ IV, land use plan allocations tied to habitat management areas would not change between the No-Action Alternative and Proposed Plan Amendments. The decrease in PHMA, GHMA, and OHMA within WAFWA MZ IV between the No-Action Alternative and the Proposed Plan Amendment would therefore have negligible to minimal impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat in the context of the entire MZ, as the relevant distribution of land use plan allocations associated with these habitat management areas is not significantly changing (0–2 percent, see Appendix 1). Each planning efforts’ Proposed Plan Amendment MZ MZ IV incorporates management flexibility that would allow exceptions to allocation decisions within habitat management areas and would allow for site specific adjustments for land use authorizations and adjustments to existing adaptive management strategies. Under all Proposed Plan Amendments, the BLM would remove the recommendation to withdraw SFAs from location and entry under the Mining Law of 1872, make slight adjustments to habitat objectives, and identify new exceptions to seasonal timing restrictions. The cumulative impacts of these proposed changes to Greater Sage-Grouse populations across MZ IV would be consistent with cumulative impacts described in the 2015 Final EIS. Moreover, these proposed changes, which focus on anthropogenic disturbances, would have only a minor or limited effect on efforts to manage and conserve Greater Sage-Grouse in these MZ s, where wildfire, invasive plants, and conifer encroachment are greater threats to the grouse and its habitats. BLM’s Proposed Plan Amendments in the MZ are also unlikely to preclude the reasonably foreseeable actions listed in Appendix 1 from proceeding. Some small, localized populations may be at continued risk due to reasonably foreseeable future infrastructure and energy development projects over the next 20 years, when combined with unplanned events such as wildfires, drought, and associated decline in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat quality; however, the Proposed Plan Amendments retain conservation measures in combination with continued proactive habitat restoration efforts being completed by private, local, state, and federal partners across the MZ to adequately conserve and manage Greater Sage-Grouse habitats. 4.Environmental Consequences A summary of potential cumulative impacts by proposed management action is presented below. The proposed plans vary from state to state as does each state contribution to MZ IV. Montana is not engaging in an amendment process therefore they will not be contributing to any cumulative effects. Wyoming only has approximately 4,000 acres of PHMA and ~20,000 Acres of GHMA within MZ IV making their potential contribution to cumulative effects within the ~80 million acre MZ IV negligible. The portion of Utah that is within MZ IV is an isolated area with little or no development potential for fluid minerals and is predominantly used for livestock grazing. The reasonably foreseeable development scenario for the area predicts zero wells. The changes proposed in Utah’s proposed plan would have no additive effect Greater Sage-Grouse habitats within MZ IV. The Oregon RMPA would change access on 21,959 acres in all or portions of key Research Natural Areas from unavailable to grazing to available for grazing. No other States within MZ IV are proposing changes to grazing allocation decisions. This change would not add measurably to other actions occurring within the approximately 80 million-acre MZ IV. The area of MZ that includes Utah is extremely isolated. The dominate use is grazing. Grazing management will follow rangeland health standards and changes to Table 2-2 that incorporate local science that will benefit Greater Sage-Grouse and ensure that grazing management is conducted properly and would not add cumulatively to Greater Sage-Grouse effects. The area continues to be a ROW avoidance area and is closed to wind energy development. The reasonably foreseeable development scenario for the area predicts zero wells so the change to limited exceptions, waivers, and modifications are moot. The changes proposed in Utah’s proposed plan would not add measurably to other actions occurring within the approximately 80 million-acre MZ IV. Nevada’s proposed plan would revise the habitat management area boundaries to incorporate the best available science (Coates et al. 2016),,but would not change the allocations associated with each habitat management area. Nevada would also update their adaptive management process to ensure that the BLM is utilizing the best available science and decision support tools to guide management at the appropriate spatial scale. These changes would not measurably to other actions occurring in MZ IV. In Idaho, removal of the project disturbance cap would not result in any changes to allocation decisions; rather, it would allow the BLM to cluster development in PHMA and IHMA only after meeting the anthropogenic disturbance screening criteria and the disturbance development criteria. Lek buffer modifications would also not result in any allocation changes. Some lek buffers would be increased as a result of the proposed land use plan amendment, but, in some cases, the lek buffers may be smaller than those identified in the No-Action Alternative; however, the existing disturbance screening criteria and the disturbance development criteria would ensure that impacts from development activities in both PHMA and IHMA would not result in a net loss to Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. Within MZ IV Oregon would retain their SFA designations while Idaho and Nevada would remove SFA designations. Under the proposed plan in Idaho and Nevada the NSO without waivers, modifications, and exceptions (WEMs) would change to NSO with limited exceptions. The exception criteria could ensure that projects are either in unsuitable Greater Sage-Grouse habitat; do not result in direct, indirect, or cumulative impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse; or can be offset, with the exception of those 4.Environmental Consequences needed for public health and safety; therefore, there would be no appreciable additive impact from the implementation of this action on GRSG or the resources/uses analyzed herein, as compared with the No-Action Alternative. Under the proposed plan, language would be added to clarify how implementation-level decisions would be guided regarding mitigation, seasonal timing restrictions, and modifying habitat objectives to better align with state conservation plans and management strategies. As these updates did not result in any new identifiable direct or indirect impacts, there would be no appreciable additive impact from the implementation of this aspect on Greater Sage-Grouse or the resources/uses analyzed herein, as compared with the No-Action Alternative. 4.7.7 Cumulative Effects on Greater Sage-Grouse: Management Zone V In addition to the analysis in the 2015 Final EIS in Table 4-3, other anticipated incremental impacts are discussed below in association with planning issues being analyzed in this RMPA/EIS. All changes in the extent of habitat management areas and areas recommended for withdrawal within the MZ occur under the Nevada/Northeastern California amendment. The Oregon amendment did not propose any changes in the extent of habitat management areas (PHMA and GHMA). Oregon removed the recommendation for a withdrawal in the SFA under a plan maintenance action in May 2018, prior to the start of this amendment process. That action resulted in no difference between the No-Action Alternative and the Management Alignment alternatives in terms of withdrawals. Under the Proposed Plan Amendments in Nevada and Northeastern California and Oregon PHMA would decrease by 1 percent, GHMA would decrease by 2 percent, and for Nevada and Northeastern California only, OHMA would decrease by 2 percent, as compared to the acreages identified in the No-Action Alternative. The proposed change in habitat management area acres between the No-Action Alternative and the Proposed Plan Amendment in Nevada and Northeastern California is based on adjustments made to habitat modeling used to delineate habitat management areas and improve alignment with the State of Nevada’s delineations for habitat management areas, which the State of Nevada adopted by in December 2015. Following this habitat management area modification, planning level allocation decisions have also been adjusted to reflect the distribution of habitat in Nevada/Northeastern California. Future adjustments to habitat management areas in Nevada/Northeastern California would be based on best available science and to align with the respective states’ delineations for Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. In Oregon, the only proposed decision under the Management Alignment Alternative (Proposed Plan Amendment) would retain livestock grazing within key Research Natural Areas. The Management Alignment Alternative would result in allowing livestock grazing on 21,959 acres within the State of Oregon/project area. In the context of the entire MZ, this change would have negligible to no effects on sage grouse populations. Well-managed grazing practices are compatible with sagebrush ecosystems and Greater Sage-Grouse persistence. A summary of potential cumulative impacts by proposed management action is presented below. Under the Nevada/Northeastern California amendment, the Management Alignment alternative (Proposed Plan Amendment) would increase PHMA by less than 1 percent, decrease GHMA by 1 4.Environmental Consequences percent and decrease OHMA by 2 percent. This change in habitat management area acres between the No-Action Alternative and Proposed Plan Amendments would be the result of improved habitat modeling used to delineate habitat management areas (best available science) and to align with the State of Nevada’s delineations for habitat management areas (adopted by the State of Nevada in December 2015). Following this habitat area modification, planning level allocation decisions have also been adjusted to reflect the distribution of habitat in Nevada/Northeastern California. The Management Alignment alternative (Proposed Plan Amendment) for Nevada/Northeastern California would also remove the recommendation for a withdrawal in the SFAs; allow exceptions to allocation decisions within PHMA, GHMA, OHMA; modify the existing adaptive management strategy; make slight adjustments to habitat objectives; and identify new exceptions to seasonal timing restrictions. Removing the recommendation to withdraw SFAs from mineral development would result in a 3 percent decrease of acres recommended for withdrawal (see Appendix 1), the largest percent allocation change between the alternatives within the MZ. From these actions, cumulative impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse populations across MZ V would be consistent with those impacts described in the 2015 Final EIS for the then Proposed Plan Amendments because the Management Alignment Alternatives (Proposed Plan Amendments) changes from the No-Action Alternative are minor and deal largely with anthropogenic disturbances. The greatest threats to populations in this MZ would remain wildfire, invasive plants, and conifer encroachment. The decreases in GHMA and OHMA within WAFWA MZ V between the No-Action Alternative and Management Alignment Alternative (Proposed Plan Amendment) would therefore have negligible to no effect on Greater Sage-Grouse populations and their habitat in the context of the entire MZ, as the relevant distribution of land use plan allocations associated with these habitat management areas would result in an estimated 2.5 to 3 percent decrease, all from Nevada and Northeastern California (see Appendix 1). BLM’s Proposed Plan Amendments in MZ V are unlikely to preclude the reasonably foreseeable actions listed in Appendix 1 from proceeding. Overall, the Proposed Plan Amendments retain conservation measures in combination with continued proactive habitat restoration efforts being completed by private, local, state, and federal partners across the MZ; however, smaller populations, particularly those at the edge of the species range, would remain at highest risk of extirpation (Aldridge et al. 2008; Garton et al. 2011), which the reasonably foreseeable actions may exacerbate as unplanned events such as wildfires, drought, and other natural disturbances lead to declines in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat quality. Under the Management Alignment Alternative, habitat management area boundaries in NV/CA would be adopted or revised to incorporate the best available science (Coates et al. 2016). Because the underlying habitat management area allocations put in place to conserve Greater Sage-Grouse would not change, and these updates reflect the most recent knowledge concerning Greater Sage-Grouse habitat use and distribution, there would be no appreciable additive impact from the implementation of this aspect on Greater Sage-Grouse or the resources/uses analyzed herein. Similarly, no appreciable additive impacts are anticipated from updating the adaptive management process as described in the Management Alignment Alternative. This update would ensure that the BLM is utilizing the best available science and decision support tools to guide management at the appropriate spatial scale, thus improving the BLM’s assessment and response to ever-changing conditions that could 4.Environmental Consequences affect Greater Sage-Grouse populations and/or habitat. Because any specific response to tripping a hard or soft trigger would be based on the causal factors responsible, presuming a specific response to unknown future conditions would be speculative at best and not reasonably foreseeable. Under the Management Alignment Alternative, the allocation exception process would be updated to simplify the various exemptions contained in the 2015 Final EIS. While the availability of exceptions to land use plan allocations attached to PHMA and GHMA could increase the possibility of leasing, permitting, or ground-disturbing activities within a given habitat management area, the established criteria would ensure that projects are either in unsuitable Greater Sage-Grouse habitat; do not result in direct, indirect, or cumulative impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse; or can be offset, with the exception of those needed for public health and safety; therefore, there would be no appreciable additive impact from the implementation of this action on Greater Sage-Grouse or the resources/uses analyzed herein, as compared with the No-Action Alternative. Under the Management Alignment Alternative, language would be added to clarify how implementation-level decisions would be guided regarding mitigation, seasonal timing restrictions, and modifying habitat objectives to better align with state conservation plans and management strategies. As these updates did not result in any new identifiable direct or indirect impacts, there would be no appreciable additive impact from the implementation of this aspect on Greater Sage-Grouse or the resources/uses analyzed herein, as compared with the No-Action Alternative. 4.8 IRREVERSIBLE AND IRRETRIEVABLE COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES Section 102(2)(C) of NEPA requires a discussion of any irreversible or irretrievable commitments of resources from an alternative, should it be implemented. An irreversible commitment of a resource is one that cannot be reversed, such as the extinction of a species or loss of a cultural resource site without proper documentation. An irretrievable commitment of a resource is one in which the resource or its use is lost for a period of time, such as extraction of oil and gas. Should oil and gas deposits underlying Greater Sage-Grouse habitat be extracted, that oil and gas resource would be lost. 4.9 UNAVOIDABLE ADVERSE IMPACTS Section 102(C) of the NEPA requires disclosure of any adverse environmental impacts that could not be avoided should the proposal be implemented. Unavoidable adverse impacts are those that remain following the implementation of mitigation measures, or impacts for which there are no mitigation measures. Some unavoidable adverse impacts happen from implementing the RMPA/EIS; others are a result of public use of BLM-administered lands in the planning area. This section summarizes major unavoidable impacts discussions of the impacts of each management action (in the discussion of alternatives) and provides greater information on specific unavoidable impacts. Surface-disturbing activities would result in unavoidable adverse impacts. Although these impacts would be mitigated to the extent possible, unavoidable damage would be inevitable under both the No-Action Alternative and the Proposed Plan Amendment. 4.Environmental Consequences Impacts from permanent conversion of areas to other uses, such as transportation and mineral and energy development or Off Highway Vehicle (OHV) use, would be greater under the Proposed Plan Amendment, but overall minimal for both alternatives. Both the No-Action Alternative and the Proposed Plan Amendment would place restrictions on many types of development, which would most likely result in fewer visual intrusions and fewer instances of unavoidable wildlife habitat loss. Wildlife, livestock, wild horses and burros, and other herbivores consume vegetation and affect soils through hoof action and possible compaction. When these impacts are kept at appropriate levels, natural processes such as plant growth and recovery, freeze-thaw periods, and microbial activity in the soil surface result in recovery from these impacts and maintain site stability and health. Vegetation treatments promoting recovery of Greater Sage-Grouse habitats would result in the destruction of the target species, be it annual grass, noxious weed, or encroachment of juniper. Some level of competition for forage between wildlife, livestock, and wild horses would occur. Instances of displacement, harassment, and injury to these species could also occur. Both the No-Action Alternative and the Proposed Plan Amendment would place restrictions on development and surface-disturbing activities, which would minimize the likelihood of displacement, harassment, and/or injury. Development of mineral resources and general use of the decision area would introduce additional ignition sources into the planning area, which would increase the probability of wildland fire and the need for its suppression. These activities, combined with continued fire suppression, would also affect the overall composition and structure of vegetation communities; this could increase the potential for high-intensity wildland fires. Restrictions on development under both alternatives would be expected to decrease the potential for ignitions in the decision area; however, impacts would be greater under the No-Action Alternative. Numerous land use restrictions imposed throughout the decision area to protect Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and other important values, by their nature, affect the ability of operators, individuals, and groups who use the public lands to do so without limitations. Although attempts would be made to minimize these impacts, unavoidable adverse impacts could occur under the No-Action Alternative or the Proposed Plan Amendment. 4.10 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL SHORT-TERM USES AND LONG-TERM PRODUCTIVITY Section 102(C) of NEPA requires a discussion of the relationship between local, short-term uses of human environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity of resources. As described in the introduction to this chapter, short term is defined as anticipated to occur within the first 5 years of implementation of the activity and long term as lasting beyond 5 years to the end of or beyond the life of this RMPA/EIS. Surface-disturbing activities, including transportation and utility corridor construction, and mineral resource development would result in the greatest potential for impacts on long-term productivity. Management prescriptions and RDFs are intended to minimize the effect of short-term commitments and to reverse change over the long term. These prescriptions and the associated reduction of impacts would be greater under the No-Action Alternative for resources such as vegetation and wildlife habitat; however, some impacts on long-term productivity might occur, despite the prescriptions intended to reduce impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat. 4.Environmental Consequences ROWs and short-term use of an area to foster energy and mineral development would result in longterm loss of soil productivity and vegetation diversity. Impacts would persist as long as surface disturbance and vegetation loss continue. In general, the loss of soil productivity would be directly at the point of disturbance; even so, long-term vegetation diversity and habitat value could be reduced due to fragmentation and the increased potential for invasive species to spread from the developments or disturbances. Both the No-Action Alternative and the Proposed Plan Amendment would provide for long-term productivity through restrictive allocations that limit development in many areas and through the application of other restrictions on development, such as disturbance caps, RDFs, and other management prescriptions. ROWs and the short-term use of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat for energy and mineral development could impair the long-term productivity of Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat and that of other species. This would occur by displacing species from primary habitats and removing components of these habitats that might not be restored for 20 years or longer. These short-term uses could also affect the long-term sustainability of some special status species. The potential for these impacts, however, would be minimal under both the No-Action Alternative and the Proposed Plan Amendment. The short-term resource uses associated with mineral development (oil and gas seismic exploration, natural gas test well drilling, and the noise associated with these activities) would have adverse impacts on the long-term productivity of Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat. This would be the case if these resource uses were to infringe on Greater Sage-Grouse seasonal habitats such as nesting, brood-rearing, and winter habitats. These activities, though short-term individually, could have collective long-term impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat if they were to increase in the long term. 4.Environmental Consequences This page intentionally left blank. Chapter 5. Consultation and Coordination This chapter describes the efforts undertaken by the BLM throughout the process of developing the RMPA/EIS to ensure the process remained open and inclusive to the extent possible. This chapter also describes efforts taken to comply with legal requirements to consult and coordinate with various government agencies. These efforts include public scoping; identifying and designating cooperating agencies; consulting with applicable federal, state, and tribal governments; and identifying “any known inconsistencies with State or local plans, policies or programs” (43 CFR 1610.3-2[e]). 5.1 PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT 5.1.1 Public Scoping The scoping period began with the publication of the NOI in the Federal Register on October 11, 2017. The NOI was titled Notice of Intent to Amend Land Use Plans Regarding Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation and Prepare Associated Environmental Impact Statements or Environmental Assessments. During the scoping period, the BLM sought public comments on whether all, some, or none of the 2015 Greater Sage-Grouse plans should be amended, what issues should be considered, and whether the BLM should pursue a state-by-state amendment process or structure its planning effort differently, for example by completing a national programmatic process. Representatives of the BLM engaged with the Western Governors’ Association Sage Grouse Task Force in October of 2017 and January of 2018 to discuss the progress of scoping efforts. In addition, the DOI Deputy Secretary has emphasized that input from state governors would weigh heavily when considering what changes should be made and ensuring consistency with the BLM’s multiple-use mission. Information about scoping meetings, comments received, comment analysis, and issue development can be found in the scoping report available online here: https://goo.gl/FopNgW. 5.1.2 Public Input on the Draft RMPA/EIS A Notice of Availability (NOA) for the Draft RMPA/EIS was published in the Federal Register on May 4, 2018. The NOA initiated a 90-day public comment period, which ended on August 2, 2018. During the comment period, the BLM held three open house public meetings in Utah (Cedar City – June 26; Vernal – June 27; Randolph – June 28). The BLM notified the public of these meetings via the project website and a news release. Each meeting was held from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. for the purpose of informing the public about the Draft RMPA/EIS and to obtain further public input on the alternatives that were developed and analyzed. At the open houses, displays presented the planning issues and the alternatives addressing the issues. Other displays explained the NEPA process and how to submit comments. By the close of the 90-day comment period, the BLM received 31,276 copies of form letters and 63 unique letters. Comments were read to identify substantive comments, which were grouped by topic. They were summarized, and a response was developed for each summarized comment. Comment responses can be found in the Proposed RMPA/Final EIS Appendix 2. 5. Consultation and Coordination 5.1.3 Future Public Involvement The NOA and Dear Reader Letter for this Proposed RMPA and Final EIS outlines procedures to protest the Proposed RMPA during the 30-day period after the NOA is published in the Federal Register. A 60day Governor’s consistency review will occur concurrent with this protest period. A ROD will be issued following the Governor’s consistency review period and resolution of protests on the Proposed RMPA/Final EIS. 5.2 COOPERATING AGENCIES The BLM invites eligible federal agencies, state and local governments, and federally recognized Indian tribes to participate as cooperating agencies when amending RMPs (43 CFR 1610.3-1[b]). Cooperating agencies “work with the BLM, sharing knowledge and resources, to achieve desired outcomes for public lands and communities within statutory and regulatory frameworks” (BLM Land Use Planning Handbook H-1601-1). These agencies are invited to participate because they have jurisdiction by law or can offer special expertise. Cooperating agency status provides a formal framework for these government units to engage in active collaboration with a lead federal agency in the planning process. The following agencies were either invited or requested to be cooperating agencies to participate in preparation of this RMPA/EIS. Those marked with an asterisk participated in some aspect of the process up to preparation of the Proposed RMPA/Final EIS. This included participation in some or all of the following activities: scoping comments, input on preliminary drafts, comments on the Draft RMPA/EIS, and/or participation in briefings, meetings, or work sessions. • State of Utah* • Confederated Tribe of the Goshute Indian Reservation* • Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah* • Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians • Ute Indian Tribe* • Department of Defense* • US Fish and Wildlife Service* • US Forest Service* • Natural Resources Conservation Service* • Beaver County* • Box Elder County* • Cache County • Carbon County* • Daggett County • Duchesne County* • Emery County • Garfield County* • Grand County • Iron County* • Juab County • Kane County* • Millard County • Morgan County • Piute County* • Rich County* • Sanpete County • Sevier County* • Summit County • Tooele County* • Uintah County* • Utah County • Wasatch County • Wayne County* • Weber County • Lincoln County, Wyoming* • Lincoln County Conservation District, Wyoming* • Sublette County, Wyoming • Sublette County Conservation District, Wyoming • Sweetwater County, Wyoming* • Sweetwater County Conservation District, Wyoming* • Uinta County, Wyoming • Uinta County Conservation District, Wyoming* 5. Consultation and Coordination The BLM worked closely with the State of Utah and cooperating agencies to develop an alternative that would improve alignment between the BLM’s RMPs and the state’s plans and strategies for managing Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat. This began with a review of all the issues raised during scoping to identify issues where adjustments to the federal plans could complement state efforts. Alternatives were developed, and preparation of this Draft RMPA/EIS began. Coordination efforts included more than 24 meetings with cooperators that included representatives from the State of Utah, counties, tribes, or other federal agencies from January through October. These meetings did not include the myriad oneon-one coordination contacts with representatives regarding issues specific to the given agency. 5.3 FORMAL CONSULTATION EFFORTS Various federal laws require the BLM and Forest Service to consult with American Indian tribes, the State Historic Preservation Office, and the USFWS during the planning/NEPA decision-making process. This section documents the specific consultation and coordination efforts undertaken throughout the process of developing the Proposed Plan Amendment. 5.3.1 American Indian Tribal Consultation Various federal laws require the BLM to consult with American Indian tribes during the planning/NEPA decision-making process. The BLM reached out to these potentially affected Native American tribes and organizations with interests in the planning area by mail requesting government-to-government consultation. • White Mesa Ute Tribe • Navajo Utah Commission • Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians • Kaibab Band of Paiute Indians • Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah • Navajo Nation • Southern Ute • Hopi Tribe • Ute Indian Tribe • Shoshone -Bannock Tribes • Northwest Band of Shoshone • Te-Moak Western Shoshone • Ute Mountain Ute Tribe • Eastern Shoshone • Confederated Tribe of the Goshute Indian Reservation The BLM also reached out directly to those tribes that expressed interest in the 2015 Greater Sage-Grouse planning process, since this effort is associated with the 2015 effort. The BLM Utah met with representatives from the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah in December 2017 and April and June 2018 to invite them to consult with the BLM and to keep them updated on the status of the plan amendment. Similarly, the BLM met with the Ute Indian Tribe in January, April, and October 2018 for the same purposes. In March 2018, the BLM Idaho met with the Shoshone Bannock Tribe’s resource staff to invite them to consult and to update them on the status of the plan amendment, including the Utah effort. In March and May 2018, the BLM met with representatives from the Confederated Tribe of the Goshute Indian Reservation. Beyond these formal communications, no other written comments were received from tribal agencies. Tribal concerns or issues have been typically presented in oral format. Formal consultation efforts will continue throughout the remainder of the planning process. 5.3.2 Utah State Historic Preservation Officer Consultation The National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 and regulations at 36 CFR 800 govern the BLM’s cultural resource management programs. The regulations provide specific procedures for consultation 5. Consultation and Coordination between the BLM and the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). The SHPO is included in this process through the overarching relationship with the State of Utah. The State of Utah’s comments on the Draft RMPA/EIS did not include comments from the SHPO. The Proposed RMPA/Final EIS was specifically sent to the State of Utah SHPO for review and comment, formally initiating consultation regarding the Proposed Plan Amendment’s potential effects on cultural resources. The BLM will finalize consultation with the SHPO before the ROD is signed. 5.3.3 US Fish and Wildlife Service Consultation Consultation with the USFWS is required under Section 7(c) of the ESA prior to initiation of any project by the BLM that may affect any federally listed or endangered species or its habitat. For this RMPA/EIS effort, the BLM and USFWS have coordinated to determine if the changes in the Proposed Plan Amendment would result in different effects than were referenced in Section 1.3 of the USFWS 2015 Biological Opinion. These consultation efforts will be finalized with the USFWS before the ROD is signed. 5.4 COORDINATION AND CONSISTENCY Section 6.5 of the 2015 Final EIS identifies areas where the BLM’s plan was inconsistent with state, county, and tribal plans. As described in the Purpose and Need (see Section 1.2), through this effort the BLM has sought to “better align with individual state plans and/or conservation measures.” This section addresses how the Proposed Plan Amendment affects the inconsistencies identified in Section 6.5 of the 2015 Final EIS. 5.4.1 Inconsistencies with State Plans, Policies, and Procedures The purpose of this planning is to “enhance cooperation with the state” by “modifying the approach to Greater Sage-Grouse management…to better align with individual state plans” (see Section 1.2). The State of Utah approached this planning effort from a similar position, noting in its scoping letter that its identified issues and proposed changes would “better align the 2015 Sage-Grouse Plan with the State’s conservation goals and interests.” The State of Utah finalized the Conservation Plan for Greater Sage-Grouse in Utah in February 2013. Since completion of that plan, the State of Utah has also developed a Compensatory Mitigation Program, and is currently in the process of revising the 2013 plan. The State of Utah and local BLM staff and leadership have met frequently to coordinate on the State’s efforts in preparing their Compensatory Mitigation Program and on development of their plan revision. These efforts to enhance cooperation have provided opportunities for the BLM to be aware of the emerging changes to the state’s management and conservation of the Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat in Utah. Similarly, BLM and State of Utah staff and leadership coordinated on development of the BLM’s EIS to minimize inconsistencies between the state plans and policies and the BLM’s Proposed Plan Amendment. In general, the State’s plan and the BLM’s Proposed Plan Amendment are conceptually consistent. The BLM’s Proposed Plan Amendment may not use the specific language from the State’s plan, but that is largely due to differences in regulatory requirements and audiences. In addition, the State does not have the same legal and regulatory requirements as the BLM, and its management addresses issues associated with private land ownership, SITLA, and hunting, which are outside the BLM’s jurisdiction. 5. Consultation and Coordination Section 6.5 of the 2015 Final EIS and the 2015 Governor’s consistency review identified several inconsistencies between the BLM’s 2015 ARMPA and the State’s plan. The Proposed Plan Amendment addresses those inconsistencies as follows: • Differences between BLM PHMA and State SGMA boundaries: The Proposed Plan Amendment does not change BLM PHMA boundaries; however, such an alternative was considered early in the process, and the BLM, with input from the State, dismissed such an alternative from detailed analysis. While the boundaries are inconsistent in places, making them identical would have created greater inconsistencies in management. See Section 2.2.2 for additional details. • Identifying, mapping, and applying management to GHMA: The Proposed Plan Amendment would remove GHMA and its management, making the BLM consistent with the State plan. • Identifying SFAs and their management (recommended withdrawal and prioritization): The Proposed Plan Amendment would remove the two SFAs and its management, making the BLM consistent with the State plan. • Boundary adjustments: Given its planning and NEPA regulations, the BLM cannot exercise the same flexibility adjusting boundaries as the State; however, changes have been made to the Proposed Plan and Appendix K to clarify the nature of PHMA and the importance to base decisions on site-specific information. It was clarified that boundary adjustments could occur, but they would need to comply with the appropriate regulations and policies. • Flexibility for management actions that could preclude development: The BLM must comply with federal laws and regulations when making and implementing various planning actions. Some of these reduce the BLM’s flexibility, compared with the State. The Proposed Plan Amendment includes language that allows local managers to consider site-specific conditions when applying some of the management actions. While the State’s authorities provide it greater flexibility than the BLM, the language in the Proposed Plan Amendment increases the BLM’s flexibility, creating more alignment with the State’s plan. • Disturbance cap: The Proposed Plan Amendment would have some inconsistencies with the State’s 2013 plan in relation to the disturbance cap. The State’s cap is 5 percent but includes indirect impacts, and more items would be included as disturbance compared with the BLM’s cap. The BLM’s cap is 3 percent, but it is limited to the direct disturbance of an explicit list of activities. While the actual percentage is inconsistent, the differences in tracking disturbance makes these concepts fairly consistent. Additionally, the Proposed Plan Amendment would allow for exceptions to the cap and some monitoring requirements. This proposed adjustment would increase alignment between the two plans. • Habitat objectives: The State’s plan does not have a habitat objectives table. While the table itself may be inconsistent, the BLM’s regulations for land health standards are informed by the “appropriate amount, type, and distribution of vegetation…where identified in a land use plan…” While the table was retained to help inform Land Health Standard number three, the BLM coordinated very closely with the State of Utah and local universities to identify the indicators and values most applicable to Utah based on local science and ecological conditions. • Density cap: The State’s plan does not have a density cap. While this inconsistency remains in the Proposed Plan Amendment, alignment with the State’s plan was increased by providing for an exception to the density cap. 5. Consultation and Coordination • Management of OHV use: The State’s 2013 plan limits OHV use routes in nesting and winter habitat, but not other seasonal habitats. The BLM’s Proposed Plan limits OHV use to routes in all PHMA and GHMA. Language in drafts of the State’s revised plan would eliminate the inconsistency. In addition, alignment was increased by adding two open areas that were incorrectly made limited in 2015, removal of management actions that duplicate the NEPA process, and clear requirements to coordinate with state and local agencies during implementation planning. • Focusing management on improper livestock grazing: The Proposed Plan Amendment increases alignment with the State’s plan by removing actions that were not directly related to the identified threat of overgrazing. • Restrictions on land tenure adjustments: The Proposed Plan Amendment increased alignment through adjustments to language regarding land tenure adjustments in PHMA. While other inconsistencies may exist between the BLM and State plans, the State’s scoping letter defined their strategy for this planning effort as a “surgical approach” to remove or modify “only those parts of the plan that are overly burdensome, illegal, unnecessary or unsupported by local science.” As described above, the BLM’s Proposed Plan Amendment addresses some aspect of the previously identified inconsistencies and increases alignment between the BLM and State plans. 5.4.2 Inconsistencies with County Plans, Policies, and Procedures Since the 2015 Final EIS, all counties in Utah have developed County Resource Management Plans (see Section 1.6.3). In relation to Greater Sage-Grouse, some of the county plans incorporate the State’s plan entirely. Some counties included additional management specific to their county. Some counties included actions more detailed than what is directed for a BLM resource management plan (see BLM planning regulations at 43 CFR 1600 and the BLM planning handbook – BLM-H-1610). As described in Section 2.2.4, the Proposed Plan Amendment has increased alignment with those county plans that were substantially similar to the State’s plan, as noted above in Section 5.4.1; however, for those plans that differed from the State’s plan, inconsistencies may remain since the purpose of this effort was to increase alignment with the State’s plan, and the BLM’s planning regulations note that “where state and local government policies, plans, and programs differ, those of the higher authority will normally be followed” (43 CFR 1610.3-2[d]). 5.4.3 Inconsistencies with Tribal Plans, Policies, and Procedures The Ute Indian Tribe—Uintah and Ouray Reservation is the only tribe that has provided the BLM a Greater Sage-Grouse management document to consider for inconsistencies. Adopted by ordinance in May 2013, the Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation Ordinance was developed to preclude a listing while protecting the economic well-being of the tribe. The ordinance includes requirements for oil and gas and other surface-disturbing operations to minimize direct impacts on leks during breeding and nesting season. Known inconsistencies between the BLM’s Proposed Plan and the Ute Indian Tribe Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation Ordinance include the following: • The Proposed Plan Amendment includes management that addresses threats beyond fluid mineral leasing and development (e.g., nonenergy leasable minerals, mineral materials, wildfire, transmission lines and pipelines, juniper encroachment, invasive species, and improper livestock grazing). In addition, the Proposed Plan Amendment is more detailed and is generally more restrictive than the Tribe’s ordinance. 5. Consultation and Coordination • Sections 303 and 304 provide for variances and exceptions to the ordinance’s restrictions. The BLM’s Proposed Plan Amendment has included language that increases the opportunities to consider adjustments based on local topography, habitat conditions, and project design features. These additions have increased alignment with the Tribe’s ordinance. 5.5 LIST OF PREPARERS This RMPA/EIS was prepared by an interdisciplinary team of staff from the BLM, in collaboration with Environmental Management and Planning Solutions, Inc. Name Role/Responsibility Quincy Bahr  Project Manager  Jared Reese  Wildlife/Greater Sage-Grouse  Tyler Nelson  GIS  Erik Vernon  Air/Climate  Casey Addy  Vegetation, Soil, Water  Christine Fletcher  Special Status Species  Leah Lewis  Fish and Wildlife  Gus Warr  Wild Horse and Burro  Nate Thomas  Cultural Resources  Vicki Tyler  Wildland Fire  Allison Ginn  Wilderness Characteristics, Special Designations  Alan Bass  Livestock Grazing  Matt Blocker  Recreation, Visual Resources  Evan Glen  Travel Management  Brandon Johnson  Lands and Realty, Renewable Energy  Jeff McKenzie  Minerals Specialist (coal)  Stan Perkes  Minerals Specialist (solid leasables, saleables)  Robin Naeve  Fluid Minerals  Kahindo Kamau  Fluid Minerals Reasonably Foreseeable Development Scenario  Tyler Ashcroft  Fluid Minerals Reasonably Foreseeable Development Scenario  Terry Snyder  Locatable Minerals  Julie Sur-Pierce  Socioeconomics  5.

Adaptive management involves testing, monitoring, and evaluating applied strategies, and incorporating new knowledge into management approaches that are based on scientific findings and the needs of society. Results are used to modify management policy, strategies, and practices. Amendment. The process for considering or making changes in the terms, conditions, and decisions of approved Resource Management Plans or management framework plans. Usually only one or two issues are considered that involve only a portion of the planning area. Avoidance/avoidance area. These terms usually address mitigation of some activity (i.e., resource use). Paraphrasing the CEQ Regulations (40 CFR 1508.20), avoidance means to circumvent, or bypass, an impact altogether by not taking a certain action, or parts of an action. Therefore, the term “avoidance” does not necessarily prohibit a proposed activity, but it may require the relocation of an action, or the total redesign of an action to eliminate any potential impacts resulting from it. Also see “right-of-way avoidance area” definition. Best management practices (BMPs). A suite of techniques that guide or may be applied to management actions to aide in achieving desired outcomes. BMPs are often developed in conjunction with land use plans, but they are not considered a planning decision unless the plans specify that they are mandatory. Biologically significant unit (BSU). A geographical/spatial area that includes Greater Sage-Grouse priority habitat management areas that is used as the basis for comparative calculations to support evaluation of changes to habitat. In Utah, each BSU correlates to the priority habitat management area within a population area. Compensatory mitigation. Compensating for the residual impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments (40 CFR 1508.20). Controlled surface used (CSU). CSU areas are open to fluid mineral leasing, but the stipulation allows the BLM to require special operational constraints, or the activity can be shifted more than 200 meters (656 feet) to protect the specified resource or value. Cooperating agency. Assists the lead federal agency in developing an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement. These can be any agency with jurisdiction by law or special expertise for proposals covered by NEPA (40 CFR 1501.6). Any tribe or federal, state, or local government jurisdiction with such qualifications may become a cooperating agency by agreement with the lead agency. Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). An advisory council to the President of the US established by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. It reviews federal programs to analyze and interpret environmental trends and information. Cumulative effects. The direct and indirect effects of a proposed project alternative’s incremental impacts when they are added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions, regardless of who carries out the action. Decision area. Public lands and mineral estate managed by the US Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management that are within the planning area and are encompassed by all designated habitat. Direct impacts. Direct impacts are caused by an action or implementation of an alternative and occur at the same time and place. Environmental impact statement (EIS). A detailed statement prepared by the responsible official in which a major federal action that significantly affects the quality of the human environment is described, alternatives to the proposed action are provided, and effects are analyzed. Fluid minerals. Oil, gas, coal bed natural gas, and geothermal resources. Geographic Information System (GIS). A system of computer hardware, software, data, people, and applications that capture, store, edit, analyze, and display a potentially wide array of geospatial information. Habitat. An environment that meets a specific set of physical, biological, temporal, or spatial characteristics that satisfy the requirements of a plant or animal species or group of species for part or all of their life cycle. Impact. The effect, influence, alteration, or imprint caused by an action. Indirect impacts. Indirect impacts result from implementing an action or alternative but usually occur later in time or are removed in distance and are reasonably certain to occur. Leasable minerals. Those minerals or materials designated as leasable under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. These include energy-related mineral resources such as oil, natural gas, coal, and geothermal, and some nonenergy minerals, such as phosphate, sodium, potassium, and sulfur. Geothermal resources are also leasable under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970. Lease stipulation. A modification of the terms and conditions on a standard lease form at the time of the lease sale. Lek. An arena where male Greater Sage-Grouse display for the purpose of gaining breeding territories and attracting females. These arenas are usually open areas with short vegetation within sagebrush habitats, usually on broad ridges, benches, or valley floors where visibility and hearing acuity are excellent. Long-term effect. The effect could occur for an extended period after implementation of the alternative. The effect could last several years or more. Management decision. A decision made by the BLM to manage public lands. Management decisions include both land use plan decisions and implementation decisions. Minimization mitigation. Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation (40 CFR 1508.20 [b]). Mitigation. Includes specific means, measures, or practices that could reduce, avoid, or eliminate adverse impacts. Mitigation can include avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action; minimizing the impact by limiting the degree of magnitude of the action and its implementation; rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitation, or restoring the affected environment; reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action; and compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments. Modification. A change to the provisions of a lease stipulation, either temporarily or for the term of the lease. Depending on the specific modification, the stipulation may or may not apply to all sites within the leasehold to which the restrictive criteria are applied. No surface occupancy (NSO). A major constraint where use or occupancy of the land surface for fluid mineral exploration or development and all activities associated with fluid mineral leasing (e.g., truck-mounted drilling and geophysical exploration equipment off designated routes, construction of wells and/or pads) are prohibited to protect identified resource values. Areas identified as NSO are open to fluid mineral leasing, but surface occupancy or surface-disturbing activities associated with fluid mineral leasing cannot be conducted on the surface of the land. Access to fluid mineral deposits would require horizontal drilling from outside the boundaries of the NSO area. Planning area. The geographical area for which resource management plans are developed and maintained regardless of jurisdiction. Planning criteria. The standards, rules, and other factors developed by managers and interdisciplinary teams for their use in forming judgments about decision-making, analysis, and data collection during planning. Planning criteria streamlines and simplifies the resource management planning actions. Planning issues. Concerns, conflicts, and problems with the existing management of public lands. Frequently, issues are based on how land uses affect resources. Some issues are concerned with how land uses can affect other land uses, or how the protection of resources affects land uses. Policy. This is a statement of guiding principles, or procedures, designed and intended to influence planning decisions, operating actions, or other affairs of the BLM. Policies are established interpretations of legislation, executive orders, regulations, or other presidential, secretarial, or management directives. Priority habitat management areas (PHMA). Areas prioritized for managing Greater Sage-Grouse populations (management is only applicable to actions on BLM-administered lands). These management areas include high-quality habitat, and may also include areas with poor or potential habitat, and nonhabitat. PHMA largely coincides with the State of Utah’s Sage-Grouse management areas (SGMA). Within the SGMA, the State identified areas of seasonal habitat, nonhabitat, and opportunity areas, though management is focused on the habitat. PHMA include areas that include all the seasonal habitats for the corresponding Greater Sage-Grouse populations, including breeding, late brood-rearing, winter areas, and migration or connectivity corridors. Required design features (RDFs). Means, measures, or practices intended to reduce or avoid adverse environmental impacts. A suite of features that would establish the minimum specifications for certain activities (i.e., water developments, mineral development, and fire and fuels management) and mitigate adverse impacts. These design features would be required to provide a greater level of regulatory certainty than through implementation of best management practices. In general, the design features are accepted practices that are known to be effective when implemented properly at the project level. Resource management plan (RMP). A land use plan as prescribed by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act that establishes, for a given area of land, land-use allocations, coordination guidelines for multiple-use, objectives, and actions to be achieved. Short-term effect. The effect occurs only during or immediately after implementation of the alternative. Stipulation (general). A term or condition in an agreement or contract. Stipulation (oil and gas). A provision that modifies standard oil and gas lease terms and conditions in order to protect other resource values or land uses and is attached to and made a part of the lease. Typical lease stipulations include no surface occupancy, timing limitations, and controlled surface use. Lease stipulations are developed through the land use planning process. Timing limitation (TL). Areas identified for timing limitations, a moderate constraint, are closed to fluid mineral exploration and development, surface-disturbing activities, and intensive human activity during identified time frames. This stipulation does not apply to operation and basic maintenance activities, including associated vehicle travel, unless otherwise specified. Construction, drilling, completions, and other operations considered to be intensive are not allowed. Intensive maintenance, such as workover wells, is not permitted. TLs can overlap spatially with no surface occupancy and controlled surface use, as well as with areas that have no other restrictions. Index Controlled Surface Use (CSU), 2-3, 2-6, 2-19, 2-19, 2-24, 2-23, 2-25, 3-21, 3-22, 3-23, 4-31, 4-32 Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), ES-6, 4-3 Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), ES-2, ES-5, ES-6, 1-3, 1-12, 2-23, 2-35, 2-36, 2-47, 4-4, 4-15, 4-16, 4-17, 4-40, 4-44 General Habitat Management Area (GHMA), ES-3, ES-4, ES-7, ES-8, ES-9, 1-4, 1-8, 1-9, 1-12, 1-15, 2-5, 2-6, 2-7, 2-20, 2-21, 2-21, 2-22, 2-21, 2-22, 2-24, 2-25, 2-25, 2-26, 2-26, 2-27, 2-26, 2-27, 2-28, 2-29, 2-33, 2-35, 2-39, 2-40, 3-6, 3-7, 3-8, 3-9, 3-10, 3-13, 3-15, 3-16, 3-18, 3-19, 3-20, 3-21, 3-22, 3-23, 3-24, 4-3, 4-8, 4-13, 4-14, 4-15, 4-20, 4-21, 4-22, 4-24, 4-25, 4-26, 4-27, 4-28, 4-29, 4-30, 4-31, 4-32, 4-33, 4-35, 4-36, 4-37, 4-45, 4-46, 4-47, 4-48, 4-49, 4-50, 4-51, 4-52, 4-53, 4-54, 4-55, 4-56, 4-57, 5-5, 5-6 Lease, ES-3, ES-4, ES-8, 1-6, 1-8, 1-9, 2-3, 2-5, 2-6, 2-7, 2-8, 2-10, 2-13, 2-18, 2-19, 2-18, 2-19, 2-24, 2-23, 2-25, 2-26, 2-27, 2-33, 2-39, 2-40, 2-42, 2-44, 3-20, 3-21, 3-22, 3-23, 3-24, 3-25, 4-10, 4-15, 4-20, 4-22, 4-25, 4-26, 4-28, 4-31, 4-32, 4-33, 4-34, 4-35, 4-46, 4-47, 4-49, 4-50, 4-52, 4-57, 5-6 Lek, ES-3, ES-8, 1-10, 2-3, 2-4, 2-6, 2-7, 2-14, 2-19, 2-19, 2-21, 2-23, 2-24, 2-23, 2-30, 2-32, 3-3, 3-6, 3-7, 3-8, 3-24, 4-14, 4-15, 4-16, 4-20, 4-21, 4-23, 4-32, 4-47, 4-50, 4-51, 4-53, 4-54, 5-6 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), ES-6, 1-5, 1-11, 2-2, 2-7, 2-8, 2-10, 2-12, 2-12, 2-18, 2-22, 2-23, 2-29, 2-29, 2-37, 2-40, 2-47, 2-48, 4-1, 4-3, 4-17, 4-18, 4-33, 4-35, 4-36, 4-40, 4-41, 4-45, 4-49, 4-57, 4-58, 5-1, 5-3, 5-5, 5-6 No Surface Occupancy (NSO), ES-3, ES-8, 1-8, 1-12, 2-3, 2-6, 2-7, 2-10, 2-18, 2-19, 2-25, 3-21, 3-22, 3-23, 4-7, 4-12, 4-13, 4-19, 4-20, 4-22, 4-25, 4-26, 4-28, 4-31, 4-32, 4-33, 4-37, 4-42, 4-47, 4-54 Priority Habitat Management Area (PHMA), ES-3, ES-4, ES-7, ES-8, ES-9, 1-4, 1-5, 1-8, 1-9, 1-10, 1-12, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6, 2-7, 2-8, 2-10, 2-11, 2-13, 2-18, 2-19, 2-18, 2-19, 2-20, 2-21, 2-20, 2-21, 2-22, 2-23, 2-24, 2-22, 2-23, 2-24, 2-25, 2-24, 2-25, 2-26, 2-27, 2-28, 2-29, 2-28, 2-29, 2-30, 2-32, 2-33, 2-34, 2-35, 2-36, 2-37, 2-38, 2-39, 2-40, 2-41, 2-42, 2-43, 2-44, 2-46, 3-1, 3-6, 3-7, 3-8, 3-9, 3-10, 3-13, 3-15, 3-16, 3-17, 3-19, 3-20, 3-21, 3-22, 3-23, 3-24, 4-3, 4-8, 4-9, 4-14, 4-15, 4-16, 4-18, 4-19, 4-20, 4-21, 4-22, 4-23, 4-24, 4-25, 4-26, 4-27, 4-28, 4-29, 4-30, 4-31, 4-32, 4-33, 4-34, 4-35, 4-36, 4-37, 4-40, 4-45, 4-46, 4-47, 4-48, 4-49, 4-50, 4-51, 4-52, 4-53, 4-54, 4-55, 4-56, 4-57, 5-5, 5-6 Timing Limitation (TL), 2-25, 3-21, 3-22, 3-23, 4-31, 4-32 Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, 2-32, 3-6, 3-7, 3-8 This page intentionally left blank. Appendix A Maps Nevda Idaho CACHE RICH BOX ELDER WEBER Wyoming MORGAN DAVIS DAGGETT SUMMIT SALT LAKE TOOELE WASATCH DUCHESNE UINTAH UTAH JUAB CARBON SANPETE MILLARD EMERY GRAND Figure 1-1 SEVIER  BEAVER  PIUTE  WAYNE  IRON  GARFIELD  SAN JUAN  WASHINGTON  KANE  Arizona  New Mexico  Figure 1-1: Utah Planning/Habitat Areas, Surface Management and Sub-Surface Estate Bureau of Land Management Department of Defense Anthro Mountain (AM) National Park Service Other Federal General Habitat Management US Forest Service State/Local Priority Habitat Management µ Indian Reservation Private/Other Planning Area Non Federal Surface, Federal Sub-US Fish & Wildlife State Boundary Miles surface 0 20 40 County Boundary Map Area WA MT ND OR ID SD WY NE NV UT CO CA KS OK AZ NM TX No warranty is made by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

Applying Lek Buffer Distances BUFFER-DISTANCES AND EVALUATION OF IMPACTS ON LEKS Evaluate impacts on leks during the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analysis process. In addition to any other relevant information determined to be appropriate (e.g., State wildlife agency plans), and consistent with valid existing rights, the BLM, through project-specific analysis for NEPA documentation, will assess and address impacts from the following activities using the lek buffer-distances as identified in the US Geological Survey (USGS) Report Conservation Buffer-distance Estimates for Greater Sage-Grouse – A Review (Open File Report 2014-1239) and local-based science. The BLM will assess and address impacts within the lek buffer-distances specified unless justifiable departures are determined to be appropriate (see below). The starting point for lek buffer-distances is as follows: • linear features (roads) within 3.1 miles of leks • infrastructure related to energy development within 3.1 miles of leks • tall structures (e.g., communication or transmission towers and transmission lines) within 1.7 miles of leks • low structures (e.g., fences and rangeland structures) within 1.2 miles of leks • surface disturbance (continuing human activities that alter or remove the natural vegetation – see Table C.2 in Appendix C) within 3.1 miles of leks • noise and related disruptive activities, including those that do not result in habitat loss (e.g., motorized recreational events), at least 0.25 miles from leks Justifiable departures will be considered to decrease or increase these distances from the lek where variability is anticipated, based on local data, best available science, landscape features, and other existing protections (e.g., land use allocations and state regulations). The USGS report recognized “that because of variation in populations, habitats, development patterns, social context, and other factors, for a particular disturbance type, there is no single distance that is an appropriate buffer for all populations and habitats across the sage-grouse range.” The distances noted above are starting points, from which local information should be applied to determine if local variations in distances are necessary to address lek persistence. The USGS report also states that “various protection measures have been developed and implemented… [which have] the ability (alone or in concert with others) to protect important habitats, sustain populations, and support multiple-use demands for public lands”. All variations in lek buffer-distances will require appropriate analysis and disclosure as part of activity authorization. The BLM will use the most recent occupied lek data available from the state wildlife agency to assess and address project-specific impacts on leks. ACTIONS IN PHMA In undertaking BLM management actions, and consistent with valid and existing rights and applicable law in authorizing third-party actions, the BLM, through NEPA analysis, will assess and address impacts within the lek buffer-distances identified above to document that conservation measures address the impacts on leks (e.g., land use allocations, minimization measures, state regulations, and site-specific conditions of approval) to the degree that the activity will not directly or indirectly threaten the continued use of the occupied lek by Greater Sage-Grouse (i.e., lek persistence). The BLM may approve actions in PHMA within the applicable lek buffer-distance identified above if: • The BLM, with input from the state fish and wildlife agency, determines, based on best available science, landscape features, and other existing protections, that a lek buffer-distance other than the applicable distance identified above offers equivalent protection to the Greater Sage-Grouse lek and its adjacent nesting habitat; or • The BLM determines that impacts on leks and associated nesting habitats are minimized such that the project will cause minor or no new loss of habitat; or • Other mitigation measures have been developed and implemented that will, alone or in concert with other minimization actions, maintain lek persistence and the use of adjacent nesting habitat. If analysis determines impacts could affect lek persistence (i.e., result in a lek no longer being occupied) after application of the above, additional conservation measures should be assessed and applied to address impacts (e.g., locating the action outside of the applicable lek buffer-distance(s) identified above). Range improvements that do not affect Greater Sage-Grouse or range improvements that provide a conservation benefit to Greater Sage-Grouse, such as fences for protecting important seasonal habitats, are exempt from the lek buffer requirement. Appendix E Greater Sage-Grouse Disturbance Cap Guidance Appendix E. Greater Sage-Grouse Disturbance Cap Guidance INTRODUCTION In the US Fish and Wildlife Service’s (USFWS) 2010 listing decision for Greater Sage-Grouse (GRSG), the USFWS identified 18 threats contributing to the destruction, modification, or curtailment of the GRSG’s habitat or range (75 Federal Register 13910 2010). The 18 threats have been aggregated into three measures. The three measures are: • Sagebrush availability (percent of sagebrush per unit area) • Habitat degradation (percent of human activity per unit area) • Density of energy and mining (facilities and locations per unit area) Habitat Degradation and Density of Energy and Mining will be evaluated under the Disturbance Cap and Density Cap respectively and are further described in this appendix. The three measures, in conjunction with other information, will be considered during the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) process for projects authorized or undertaken by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). DISTURBANCE CAP This land use plan has incorporated a 3 percent disturbance cap, applicable only within GRSG priority habitat management areas (PHMA). The disturbance cap applies to PHMA within 1) PHMA associated with a GRSG population area (referred to as biologically significant units {BSU} when coordinating across state lines), and 2) the project authorization scale. For the Utah Sub-region, a “BSU” is the total PHMA acreage associated with a GRSG population area. At this scale, the total PHMA acreage in a population area is the denominator portion of the percentage calculation. At the project scale, the denominator is determined by identifying PHMA that is nearby or affected by the proposed project that is also located in PHMA. The project scale denominator should include the portions of PHMA used by the local population of GRSG, including all seasonal habitats and transition zones, associated with where the project is proposed. If sufficient monitoring information is not available to identify the portions of the PHMA used by a local population of GRSG, project level boundaries should be identified as described in steps 2-4 below. Steps 1and 5-9 are applicable to either approach of identifying the project scale denominator. The denominator in the disturbance calculation formula consists of all acres of lands classified as PHMA within the analysis area (BSU or project scale). Areas that are not GRSG seasonal habitats, or are not currently supporting sagebrush cover (e.g., due to wildfire), are not excluded from the acres of PHMA in the denominator of the formula. Information regarding GRSG seasonal habitats, sagebrush availability, and areas with the potential to support GRSG populations will be considered along with other local conditions that may affect GRSG during the analysis of the proposed project area. The numerator portion of the percentage calculation is limited to specific activities associated with specific GRSG threats. At both the BSU and project scale, this includes the 12 items identified in the “Habitat Degradation” column of Table E-1, Relationship between the 18 Threats and the Three Habitat Disturbance Measures for Monitoring and Disturbance Calculations. At the project scale, seven additional site scale features are included in the cap, identified and defined in Table E-2, Seven Site Scale Features Considered Threats to GRSG Included in the Disturbance Calculation for Project Authorizations. No other activities, actions, or threats are included in the numerator when calculating the cap. At both the BSU and project scale, the best available information should be used to map existing disturbance. At the BSU scale, the west-wide habitat degradation (disturbance) data layers and associated areas of direct influence identified in Table E-3, Anthropogenic Disturbance Types for Disturbance Calculations, will be used, at a minimum, to calculate the amount of disturbance and to determine if the disturbance cap has been exceeded as the land use plans are being implemented. Locally collected disturbance data will be used to determine if the disturbance cap has been exceeded for project authorizations, and, as available, may also be used to calculate the amount of disturbance in the BSUs. Locally collected disturbance data should identify the actual areas of disturbance to the extent possible, and are not required to rely on the “Direct Area of Influence” estimates in Table E-3. Although locatable mine sites are included in the degradation calculation, mining activities under the Mining Law of 1872, as amended, may not be subject to the 3 percent disturbance cap. Details about locatable mining activities will be fully disclosed and analyzed in the NEPA process to assess impacts to GRSG and their habitat as well as to goals and objectives, and other agency programs and activities. DISTURBANCE FORMULAS Formulas for calculations of the amount of disturbance in PHMA in a Population Area (BSU) and in a proposed project area are as follows: • For PHMA within a Population Area (BSUs): % Degradation Disturbance = (combined acres of the 12 degradation threats1) (acres of all lands within PHMA in a Population Area {BSU}) x 100. • For the Project Analysis Area: % Degradation Disturbance = (combined acres of the 12 degradation threats2 plus the 7 site scale threats and acres of habitat loss3)  (acres of all lands within PHMA in the project analysis area) x 100. PROJECT ANALYSIS AREA METHOD FOR PERMITTING SURFACE DISTURBANCE ACTIVITIES 1. Identify the portions of the proposed area of physical disturbance within PHMA. In other words, in GIS, “clip” the proposed project to PHMA. 1 See Table E-1. 2 See Table E-1. 3 See Table E-2. 2. Determine potentially affected occupied leks by placing a 4 mile boundary around the proposed area of physical disturbance related to the project. All occupied leks located within the 4 mile project boundary and within PHMA will be considered affected by the project. 3. Next, place a 4 mile boundary around each of the affected occupied leks. 4. PHMA within the 4 mile project boundary as well as the 4 mile lek boundary creates the project analysis area for each individual project. If there are no occupied leks within the 4 mile project boundary, the project analysis area will be that portion of the 4 mile project boundary within PHMA. 5. Map disturbances or use locally available data. Use of NAIP imagery is recommended. 6. Calculate percent existing disturbance using the formula above. If existing disturbance is less than 3 percent, proceed to next step. If existing disturbance is greater than 3 percent, defer the project unless a technical team, in coordination with the appropriate State of Utah agency, determines the project will improve the condition of GRSG habitat through analysis of site-specific GRSG habitat and population information and project design elements (see MA-SSS-3B). 7. Add proposed project disturbance footprint area and recalculate the percent disturbance. If disturbance is less than 3 percent, proceed to next step. If disturbance is greater than 3 percent, defer project unless a technical team, in coordination with the appropriate State of Utah agency, determines the project will improve the condition of GRSG habitat through analysis of site-specific GRSG habitat and population information and project design elements (see MA-SSS-3B). 8. For disturbance from proposed energy or mining facilities, calculate the disturbance density (listed below under Density Cap). If the disturbance density is less than 1 facility per 640 acres, averaged across the project analysis area, proceed to the NEPA analysis incorporating mitigation measures into an alternative. If the disturbance density is greater than 1 facility per 640 acres, averaged across the project analysis area, either defer the proposed energy or mining project or co-locate it into existing disturbed area. Discrete disturbances should be consolidated and localized as much as possible; this could result in small areas where density exceeds 1 facility per 640 acres, but average density in the project analysis area remains beneath the cap. 9. If a project that would exceed the degradation cap or density cap (for energy or mining facilities) cannot be deferred due to valid existing rights or other existing laws and regulations, fully disclose the local and regional impacts of the proposed action in the associated NEPA. TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION FEATURES IN THE DISTURBANCE CAP When locally collecting disturbance inventories, travel and transportation features would be included or not included as disturbance based on the characteristics of the feature. The following would count as disturbance (see Attachment I for definitions): • Linear transportation features identified as roads that have a maintenance intensity of 3 or 5 • Linear transportation features identified as primitive roads, temporary routes, or administrative routes that have a functional classification and a maintenance intensity of level 3 or 5 The following items would not count as disturbance: • Linear transportation features identified as trails. • Linear transportation features identified as primitive roads, temporary routes, or administrative routes that have a maintenance intensity of either level 0 or 1. • Linear transportation features identified as primitive routes. • Linear disturbances. DENSITY CAP This land use plan has also incorporated a cap on the density of energy and mining facilities at an average of 1 facility per 640 acres in PHMA in a project authorization area. If the disturbance density from energy or mining facilities in PHMA in a proposed project area is on average less than 1 facility per 640 acres, the analysis will proceed through the NEPA process incorporating mitigation measures into an alternative. If the disturbance density from energy or mining facilities is greater than an average of 1 facility per 640 acres, the proposed project will either be deferred (1) until the density of energy and mining facilities is less than the cap, or (2) the energy or mining facility is co-located into existing disturbed area (subject to applicable laws and regulations, such as the Mining Law of 1872, as amended, valid existing rights, etc.). However, the density cap may be exceeded if a project is located in non-habitat (see MA-SSS-1 language related to placement of development in non-habitat portions of PHMA), or, if the process identified in MA-SSS-3B determines the project will improve the condition of GRSG habitat through analysis of site-specific GRSG habitat and population information and project design elements. Facilities affected by the density calculation (Table E-3) are: • Energy (oil and gas wells and development facilities) • Energy (coal mines) • Energy (wind towers) • Energy (solar fields) • Energy (geothermal) • Mining (active locatable, leasable, and saleable developments) Appendix E.

They do not normally meet any design standards. Trails are linear routes managed for human-powered, stock, or off-highway vehicle forms of transportation or for historical or heritage values. Trails are not generally managed for use by four-wheel drive or high-clearance vehicles. Linear Disturbances are human-made linear features that are not part of the designated transportation network are identified as “Transportation Linear Disturbances.” These may include engineered (planned) as well as unplanned single and two-track linear features that are not part of the BLM’s transportation system. Primitive Routes are any transportation linear feature located within a wilderness study area or lands with wilderness characteristics identified for protection by a land use plan and not meeting the wilderness inventory road definition. Temporary Routes are short-term overland roads, primitive roads or trails which are authorized or acquired for the development, construction or staging of a project or event that has a finite lifespan. Temporary routes are not intended to be part of the permanent or designated transportation network and must be reclaimed when their intended purpose(s) has been fulfilled. Temporary routes should be constructed to minimum standards necessary to accommodate the intended use; the intent is that the project proponent (or their representative) will reclaim the route once the original project purpose or need has been completed. Temporary routes are considered emergency, single use or permitted activity access. Unless they are specifically intended to accommodate public use, they should not be made available for that use. A temporary route will be authorized or acquired for the specific time period and duration specified in the written authorization (e.g., permit, ROW, lease, or contract) and will be scheduled and budgeted for reclamation to prevent further vehicle use and soil erosion from occurring by providing adequate drainage and re-vegetation. Administrative Routes are those that are limited to authorized users (typically motorized access). These are existing routes that lead to developments that have an administrative purpose, where the agency or permitted user must have access for regular maintenance or operation. These authorized developments could include such items as power lines, cabins, weather stations, communication sites, spring. Maintenance Intensities Level 0 Maintenance Description Existing routes that will no longer be maintained and no longer be declared a route. Routes identified as Level 0 are identified for removal from the Transportation System entirely. Maintenance Objectives • No planned annual maintenance. • Meet identified environmental needs. • No preventative maintenance or planned annual maintenance activities. Level 1 Maintenance Description Routes where minimum (low intensity) maintenance is required to protect adjacent lands and resource values. These roads may be impassable for extended periods of time. Maintenance Objectives • Low (Minimal) maintenance intensity. • Emphasis is given to maintaining drainage and runoff patterns as needed to protect adjacent lands. Grading, brushing, or slide removal is not performed unless route bed drainage is being adversely affected, causing erosion. • Meet identified resource management objectives. • Perform maintenance as necessary to protect adjacent lands and resource values. • No preventative maintenance. • Planned maintenance activities limited to environmental and resource protection. • Route surface and other physical features are not maintained for regular traffic. Level 3 Maintenance Description Routes requiring moderate maintenance due to low volume use (for example, seasonally or year-round for commercial, recreational, or administrative access). Maintenance Intensities may not provide year-round access but are intended to generally provide resources appropriate to keep the route in use for the majority of the year. Maintenance Objectives • Medium (Moderate) maintenance intensity. • Drainage structures will be maintained as needed. Surface maintenance will be conducted to provide a reasonable level of riding comfort at prudent speeds for the route conditions and intended use. Brushing is conducted as needed to improve sight distance when appropriate for management uses. Landslides adversely affecting drainage receive high priority for removal; otherwise, they will be removed on a scheduled basis. • Meet identified environmental needs. • Generally maintained for year-round traffic. • Perform annual maintenance necessary to protect adjacent lands and resource values. • Perform preventative maintenance as required to generally keep the route in acceptable condition. • Planned maintenance activities should include environmental and resource protection efforts, annual route surface. • Route surface and other physical features are maintained for regular traffic. Level 5 Maintenance Description Route for high (maximum) maintenance due to year-round needs, high volume of traffic, or significant use. Also may include route identified through management objectives as requiring high intensities of maintenance or to be maintained open on a year-round basis. Maintenance Objectives • High (Maximum) maintenance intensity. • The entire route will be maintained at least annually. Problems will be repaired as discovered. These routes may be closed or have limited access due to weather conditions but are generally intended for year-round use. • Meet identified environmental needs. • Generally maintained for year-round traffic. • Perform annual maintenance necessary to protect adjacent lands and resource values. • Perform preventative maintenance as required to generally keep the route in acceptable condition. • Planned maintenance activities should include environmental and resource protection efforts, annual route surface. Route surface and other physical features are maintained for regular traffic. Appendix G Stipulations Associated with Fluid Mineral Leasing Appendix G. Stipulations Associated with Fluid Mineral Leasing – Proposed Plan Amendment This appendix lists stipulations for new fluid minerals leases referred to under the Proposed Plan Amendment. DESCRIPTION OF SURFACE STIPULATIONS Table G-1 shows the fluid mineral leasing stipulations for the Proposed Plan Amendment, including exceptions, modifications, and waivers. Three types of surface stipulations could be applied to fluid mineral leases: (1) no surface occupancy (NSO), (2) timing limitations (TL), and (3) controlled surface use (CSU). All stipulations for other resources, besides Greater Sage-Grouse, included in the existing land use plans would still be applicable. Areas identified as NSO would be closed to surface-disturbing activities associated with fluid mineral development. Areas identified as TL would be closed to surface-disturbing activities associated with fluid mineral development during identified time frames. TL areas would be open to operational and maintenance activities, including associated vehicle travel, during the closed period unless otherwise specified in the stipulation. Areas identified as CSU would require proposals to be authorized only according to the controls or constraints specified. The controls would be applicable to activities associated with fluid mineral development. RELIEF FROM STIPULATIONS With regard to fluid minerals, surface stipulations could be excepted, modified, or waived by the Authorized Officer, but only as specifically identified below. An exception exempts the holder of the land use authorization document from the stipulation on a one-time (or case-by-case) basis. A modification changes the language or provisions of a surface stipulation, either temporarily or permanently. A waiver permanently removes the stipulation from the lease. The environmental analysis document prepared for site-specific proposals such as fluid minerals development (i.e., master development plans applications for permit to drill or sundry notices) also would need to address proposals to exempt, modify, or waive a surface stipulation. On BLM-administered lands, to exempt, modify, or waive a stipulation, the environmental analysis document would have to show that (1) the circumstances or relative resource values in the area had changed following issuance of the lease, (2) less restrictive requirements could be developed to protect the resource of concern, and (3) operations could be conducted without causing unacceptable impacts. In cases where waivers, exceptions, or modification are granted for projects with a residual impact, voluntary compensatory mitigation consistent with the State’s management goals can be one mechanism by which a proponent achieves the RMPA goals, objectives, and waiver, exception, or modification criteria.  When a proponent volunteers compensatory mitigation as their chosen approach to address residual impacts, the BLM can incorporate those actions into the rationale used to grant a waiver, exception, or modification. The final decision to grant a waiver, exception, or modification will be based, in part, on criteria consistent with the State’s Greater Sage-Grouse management plans and policies. Table G-1 BLM Proposed Plan Amendment Fluid Minerals Stipulations and Exception, Modification, and Waiver Criteria Stipulation Stipulation Description No surface occupancy within PHMA. Purpose: To protect Greater Sage-Grouse habitat from activity in PHMA. Exception: The Authorized Officer may grant an exception where the proposed action: i. Occurs in non-habitat that does not provide important connectivity between habitat areas and the development would not cause indirect disturbance to or disruption of adjacent seasonal habitats that would impair their biological function of providing the life-history or behavioral needs of the Greater Sage-Grouse population due to project design (e.g., minimize sound, preclude tall structures, require perch deterrents), as demonstrated in the project’s NEPA document; OR ii.

Adaptive Management Adaptive management is a decision process that promotes flexible resource management decision making that can be adjusted in the face of uncertainties as outcomes from management actions and other events become better understood. Careful monitoring of these outcomes both advances scientific understanding and helps with adjusting resource management directions as part of an iterative management process. Adaptive management also recognizes the importance of natural variability in contributing to ecological resilience and productivity. It is not a “trial and error” process, but rather emphasizes learning while doing. Adaptive management does not represent an end in itself, but rather a means to more effective decisions and enhanced benefits. On February 1, 2008, the Department of the Interior published its Adaptive Management Implementation Policy (522 DM 1). The adaptive management strategy presented within this Resource Management Plan Amendment (RMPA) complies with this policy and direction. In relation to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and US Forest Service (Forest Service) National Greater Sage-Grouse Planning Strategy, adaptive management provides additional certainty for effectiveness of conservation when implemented in concert with the Greater Sage-Grouse conservation measures presented in the plan amendments. This adaptive management strategy is incorporated along with the conservation measures in the plan to ameliorate threats to Greater Sage-Grouse, thereby increasing the likelihood that the combined conservation measures are effective in reducing threats to that species. The following provides the BLM’s adaptive management strategy for the Utah Greater Sage-Grouse RMPA. UTAH SUBREGIONAL ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY The Utah Subregional adaptive management strategy includes the identification of soft and hard triggers and a management approach for responding to those triggers. In the spring of 2014, a multi-agency Utah group coordinated to develop adaptive management triggers for Greater Sage-Grouse populations in Utah. This group includes State of Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (UDWR), Utah Governor’s Public Lands Policy Coordination Office, US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Forest Service, and BLM. A biologist focus group, a subset of the Utah adaptive management group, was tasked with reviewing Greater Sage-Grouse monitoring data and determining what population and habitat triggers are appropriate given the natural cyclic variability observed in all Greater Sage-Grouse populations. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Greater Sage-Grouse Population Change As is discussed in the 2015 Final EIS, Section 3.3, Greater Sage-Grouse populations across the range fluctuate cyclically. In Utah the cycle seems, generally, to follow a 10-year pattern. The exact reason for the cycle is currently unknown. However, various aspects (i.e., vital rates) of the Greater Sage-Grouse’s life cycle have been linked by past research to changes in environment and habitat. Utah’s Greater Sage-Grouse populations will likely continue to fluctuate over the short term and on their historic 10-year cycle. The general direction of the cycles, whether populations are trending up or down, is the critical conservation concern for Greater Sage-Grouse. Connelly et al. (2004) showed that rangewide the trend was decreasing from the 1960s to the mid-1980s, hitting a low in the mid-1990s, but then stabilizing to the present. Certainly, if habitat loss and degradation occur within a population’s habitat base the population would likely decline in succeeding years without habitat restoration and/or other management intervention. However, if the habitat base remains intact it is likely that the population will continue to fluctuate, but remain relatively stable in the long term. Greater Sage-Grouse require large landscapes of contiguous sagebrush habitat to carry out their life-cycle. Securing these large landscapes from further degradation and adding more habitat through restoration is the primary conservation action for Greater Sage-Grouse. Lek Count Data When considering monitoring data there is always uncertainty, error, and statistical noise. Greater Sage-Grouse lek (breeding ground) counts are not comprehensive in nature, but rather represent a sample of and index to the population. This uncertainty carries over into using lek counts to make decisions for implementing management actions. Any metric of population change (e.g., percent annual change, percent above or below 10-year average, etc.) includes the uncertainty that comes from sampling populations. Therefore, creating precise decision triggers based on lek data is inherently problematic, and should include a relatively large range of specific metrics and management options. However, much more certainty exists concerning the effect of habitat loss or degradation, and precise decision triggers would be much more reliable for habitat conservation purposes. For Greater Sage-Grouse, while some production data has been collected in various populations, the only data that have been consistently collected across the range of the species and within Utah for this species has been males attending leks. While male lek attendance has been the primary source of data collected and is used as an index of Greater Sage-Grouse populations, it is critical that the strengths and weaknesses of lek counts be understood to appropriately evaluate how confidence in the data may vary. For instance, the number of males counted on leks can vary depending upon how many times the lek was counted in a spring (at least three times is recommended to increase the chances that the peak male lek attendance was observed), time of day (three counts conducted between 30 minutes before sunrise to 1 hour after sunrise), and the weather conditions (calm). Standardized lek counts have become more common practice recently. The lek count protocol is based on lek attendance research (Jenni and Hartzler 1978; Emmons and Braun 1984; Connelly et al. 2003). In general, lek count protocol has become a priority in the last 15 years and adherence to the protocol increases the confidence in and comparability of the resulting data. Early in the history of collecting lek count data in Utah, the likelihood that leks were known depended on two things: 1) the proximity of the lek to areas frequented by people during dawn (near roads or corrals); and 2) the size of the lek; the larger the lek, the more likely it was noticed. Therefore, the leks counted earliest in the history of Greater Sage-Grouse monitoring in Utah were either large leks and/or easily accessible leks (e.g., near roads). In the last 20 years in Utah and throughout the West, efforts to count and find leks have increased substantially (though there is variation in the number of leks counted, up and down, each year). With these concerted efforts to find new leks, new and generally smaller leks were added to the list of known leks. Consequently, by adding primarily small leks to the overall state “average males per lek”, the state average males per lek decreases even though more birds and more leks are being counted. In addition, where graduate students have studied Greater Sage-Grouse populations, new leks have been found as a result of the amount of time on the landscape and radio-telemetry information. From these increased efforts, the number of leks counted has increased from 14 leks in 1959, 99 leks in 1980, up to 362 leks in 2012 (2,485 percent increase) (UDWR 2009). Similarly, the total number of birds counted in a spring has increased, based on State of Utah data, from 451 males in 1959 to 3,231 males counted in 2012 (616 percent increase). ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT TRIGGERS This overarching adaptive management strategy includes the identification of a two-tiered system of triggers (soft and hard) for both Greater Sage-Grouse populations and habitat. These triggers are not specific to any particular project, but identify population and habitat thresholds which, if exceeded/tripped, would result in a change in how the BLM addresses management of Greater Sage-Grouse in that area. Triggers have been based on the two key metrics that are regularly monitored: population declines and habitat loss. Soft triggers represent an intermediate threshold indicating that management changes are needed to address habitat or population losses before they become severe. They represent a “caution” signal that changes outside the normal range of variation may be occurring. If a soft-trigger is tripped, monitoring data would be evaluated and management would be implemented to stop further declines. Hard triggers represent a threshold indicating that more direct and refined actions are quickly needed to stop a severe deviation from Greater Sage-Grouse conservation objectives set forth in the BLM plan. The intent of a soft-trigger is to identify changes in management at a point where further losses could be avoided; given this, there is no expectation of hitting a hard trigger. If unforeseen circumstances occur that trip either a population or habitat hard trigger, more restrictive management will be required. The changes in management required after a trigger is tripped are included below in the “Management Response” section. The following sections present the adaptive management triggers, organized first by the metric being addressed (population or habitat) and then by the associated soft and hard triggers. Population Triggers When evaluating population-based adaptive management triggers, this adaptive management strategy includes consideration of two aspects of population data to ensure that one set of data, if in error for any reason, would not unnecessarily trigger management changes. Population declines will be evaluated using the following two metrics: • Population trends based on “trend leks,” and • Population growth as indicated by Lambda (λ) (as described below) from one year to the next for monitoring associated with all leks within a priority habitat management area (PHMA). Trend leks are either leks that have been surveyed consistently in the last 20 years or leks that provide spatial representation within PHMA. Twenty years was chosen as the appropriate time period to identify trend leks with consideration of the cyclic nature of Greater Sage-Grouse populations, and to capture monitoring results during the period of time when lek counts were conducted more consistently, and when lek count protocol was more standardized. The Utah Greater Sage-Grouse lek counts appear to have been in a low oscillation in the mid-1990s and again in the last few years (2011). During this same time period, standard lek count protocol use was increasing. Criteria for the trend leks are below: • Starting with 1996, a lek that had > 1 male counted within one of 5 years between 1994-1998, • Lek counts have occurred on 80 percent of the years since 1994 (16 years), AND • Lek counts on 50 percent of the years are > 1 (8 of 16), OR • A lek provides spatial representation (in the case of small populations, all leks may be included). Lambda (λ) is the population change from a given Year 1 to the following Year 2 by dividing the total PHMA males counted in Year 2 by the total males counted in Year 1. If the result equals one (1), there was no change in the population level. A lambda that exceeds one (> 1) means the population is growing. A lambda that is less than one (< 1) indicates a declining population. To generate a consistent and comparable number, lambda can only be calculated on leks that are counted in consecutive years. This is to ensure that the increase in number of leks does not skew population data. This way, lambda can only be calculated for a lek if it is counted in 2 consecutive years. Some examples of calculating lambda are as follows: • Males in Year 2/males counted in Year 1 = Lambda (λ) Example A – No Change in Population: Assuming in 2000, the total males counted on leks in PHMA is 350 and in 2001, on the same leks counted in 2000, the total males counted are 350. • 350/350 = 1; since lambda is 1, the population is unchanged. Example B: Increasing Population: Assuming in 2000, the total males counted on leks in PHMA is 350 males and in 2001, on the same leks counted in 2000, the total males counted are 430. • 430/350 = 1.23; since lambda is > 1, the population is increasing. Example C: Decreasing Population: Assuming in 2000, the total males counted on leks in PHMA is 350 males and in 2001, on the same leks counted in 2000, the total males counted are 280. • 280/350 = 0.8; since lambda is < 1, the population is decreasing. Multiple population triggers were established to account for different potential population trends for which management and monitoring should respond. This includes triggers to address rapid short-term declines in a population, as well as persistent long-term decreases of both trend leks or all monitored leks (using lambda -λ). Population Soft Triggers A population soft trigger would be met in PHMA if any one of 1a, 1b, 1c, or 1d are met, AND number 2 is also met: 1a) 4 consecutive years of 10 percent or greater annual decline in average males per lek in each year, based on “trend leks”; OR 1b) 6 consecutive years of declining average males per lek in each year, based on “trend leks”; OR 1c) 40 percent or greater decline in average males per lek in any single year, based on “trend leks”; OR 1d) 50 percent or greater decline in average males per lek in a 4 consecutive year period, based on “trend leks”; AND 2) Lambda of less than 1 in 4 consecutive years, based on all leks in the PHMA. Using criteria 1c, the 40 percent decline in a single year may occur at any point of the four year lambda monitoring window (year one, two, three or four). For PHMA in the Ibapah and Hamlin Valley population areas, if a Greater Sage-Grouse population adaptive management trigger (hard or soft) from a Nevada land use plan is met on Greater Sage-Grouse habitat in Nevada that is adjacent to the Ibapah or Hamlin Valley PHMA, a soft trigger would be met for the Utah areas, regardless of whether the above criteria have been met or not. The management to be applied if the soft trigger criteria are met is identified below under the Management Response header. The intent of the population soft trigger is to identify changes to population trends and adjust management before a hard trigger is met. Population Hard Triggers A population hard trigger would be met in PHMA if any one of the following criteria (a-d) is identified through monitoring: Short-term Decline a) 4 consecutive years of 20 percent or greater annual decline in average males per lek in each year, based on “trend leks”; OR b) average males per lek, based on trend leks, drops 75 percent below the 10-year rolling average males per lek in any single year (not a 75 percent decrease, but a decline under 75 percent of the 10-year rolling average); OR Long-term Decline c) Lambda of less than 1 in 6 consecutive years, based on all leks within the PHMA; OR d) Lambda of less than 1 in 8 years of a 10-year window, based on all leks within the PHMA. The management to be applied if the hard trigger criteria are met is identified below under the Management Response header. Any change in management would only apply to the PHMA where the trigger is tripped. Habitat Triggers The adaptive management approach also includes triggers based on Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. Habitat quality is addressed by adherence to the objectives contained in the plan amendment. The adaptive management triggers for habitat is based on the availability of habitat within PHMA, measured using a percent of habitat loss from a baseline of available Greater Sage-Grouse habitat at the signing of the final plan amendments. Available habitat will be mapped within each PHMA using available information such as vegetation data from satellite imagery (e.g., reGAP, LANDFIRE), local monitoring, soils data, etc. As additional information is made available in the future it can be used to refine the baseline habitat areas that existed at the point the plan amendments are finalized (e.g., removing areas of high juniper density, cliffs, salt-desert scrublands). However, any such changes should reflect habitat as it occurred at the signing of the plan amendments and not reflect changes to habitat from that time. Changes from the baseline acreage could occur through either the addition of habitat (e.g., juniper reduction projects) or reduction of habitat (e.g., wildfire). In either case, the percentages identified in the triggers are generated by comparing the availability of habitat at a point in time to the acres of habitat available at the signing of the plan amendments. For both soft and hard triggers, nesting areas will be delineated using lek buffers based on published peer-reviewed data, unless local nesting areas have been specifically mapped by BLM and Forest Service and UDWR biologists using telemetry or other methods with appropriate sampling across the population. Wintering areas will be identified using UDWR mapping, in coordination with BLM and Forest Service biologists. Habitat Soft Triggers A habitat soft trigger would be met in PHMA if one of the following criteria is identified through monitoring: a) 10 percent loss of total Greater Sage-Grouse habitat in PHMA; OR b) 10 percent loss of habitat within nesting areas in PHMA; OR c) 5 percent loss of habitat within UDWR mapped wintering areas in PHMA; OR d) any one fire that burns 5 percent of total Greater Sage-Grouse habitat in PHMA. For PHMA in the Ibapah and Hamlin Valley population areas, if a Greater Sage-Grouse habitat adaptive management trigger (hard or soft) from a Nevada land use plan is met on Greater Sage-Grouse habitat in Nevada that is adjacent to the Ibapah or Hamlin Valley PHMA, a soft trigger would be met for the Utah areas, regardless of whether the above criteria have been met or not. The management to be applied if the soft trigger criteria are met is identified below under the Management Response header. The intent of the population soft trigger is to identify decreases in the availability of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and adjust management before a hard trigger is met. Habitat Hard Triggers a) 20 percent loss of total Greater Sage-Grouse habitat in PHMA; OR b) 20 percent loss of habitat within nesting areas in PHMA; OR c) 20 percent loss of habitat within UDWR mapped wintering areas in PHMA. The management to be applied if the hard trigger criteria are met is identified below under the Management Response header. Any change in management would only apply to the PHMA where the trigger is tripped. MANAGEMENT RESPONSE To be successful, an adaptive management strategy couples a change in management direction to an identified change in resource condition (e.g., meeting an identified trigger). The type of management response would vary whether a soft trigger is met versus a hard trigger. The larger deviation from natural variation associated with a hard trigger would necessarily correspond with a greater change in management. The adaptive change in management will be targeted to respond/resolve the cause of the observed change in resource condition, to the extent it can be determined. A causal factor may be associated with one of the threats the USFWS identified in its 2010 listing determination, though additional monitoring information and research may also identify other causes that could result in reaching population or habitat triggers. It is also important to note that while one or more factors may be associated with a habitat or population decline, directly attributing a change to a specific cause or causes may not be possible. The complexity of some interactions may make it difficult to establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship for a specific cause or causes. Many factors have been suggested as affecting Greater Sage-Grouse populations and habitats throughout the species’ range. These factors can interact in numerous potential complex relationships, making the identification of “the” specific cause or causes difficult. It can be difficult to separate proximate factors from ultimate factors leading to population declines. Further, Greater Sage-Grouse populations that use habitat owned or administered by multiple jurisdictions (e.g., private, state, tribal, or other federal) could result in causes of population or habitat declines that are not able to be ameliorated by the BLM. If direct cause or causes cannot be identified, the change in management may need to address multiple threats that were identified in the area where the trigger was been met in order to alter a negative trend. Absence of a clear cause is not justification to not take some action to reverse a trend. Management Response to Meeting Soft Triggers Upon an annual review of monitoring data, if it is apparent that soft trigger criteria have been met for an area (see Spatial Scale discussion below) the BLM will determine if there is a specific cause or causes that are contributing to the decline within six months of identifying that the trigger has been met. In completing this evaluation, the BLM will coordinate with Greater Sage-Grouse biologists from multiple agencies, including UDWR, the Forest Service, USFWS, and/or NRCS. Through this coordination, the BLM will review available national, state-wide, and local data to determine if there is additional information that could identify the cause/causes of the declines. The BLM will also coordinate with field office/district and state agency specialists and local Greater Sage-Grouse working groups to identify additional information that could assist in identifying the cause/causes. If it is determined that the decline is related to a natural population variation, no specific management actions would be required. However, if BLM management actions are determined to cause or contribute to the decline, the BLM will work with the appropriate State of Utah agency and public land users to identify and apply management to slow down or stop the population decline. Such measures would be applied by the BLM manager within their implementation-level discretion to mitigate the decline of populations and/or habitats to the area where the trigger has been met. These measures would apply more conservative or restrictive implementation conservation conditions, terms, or decisions within the agencies’ discretion to mitigate the decline of populations and/or habitats. Such measures could also include other management actions which may require the need to amend the RMP to address the situation and modify management. If able to be identified, the management measures should address the specific causal factor(s) that resulted in the decline, with consideration of local knowledge and conditions. Responses to soft triggers may require the adjustment of future project level/plan implementation activities in the short or long term, as consistent with the individual site-specific NEPA analyses. Soft trigger responses can come in the form of terms, conditions, design features, BMPs, or site-specific mitigation measures. Examples of soft trigger responses could include, but are not limited to: • Extending seasonal restrictions for seasonal surface disturbing activities (provided as stipulations to a right-of-way grant or a condition of approval to an oil and gas lease), • Reprioritizing wild horse and burro gathers; • Applying sequential development after reclamation; • Temporary area closures related to travel management; (2-year maximum); • Modifying seasons of use for livestock grazing through annual permit authorizations; and/or • Applying additional restrictions on discretionary activities, or reject the authorization if mitigation criteria cannot be met. It is expected that monitoring and management in response to soft-triggers should preclude tripping a “hard” trigger, which signals more severe habitat loss or population declines. Management Response to Meeting Hard Triggers Hard triggers represent a threshold indicating that more direct and refined actions are quickly needed to stop a severe deviation from Greater Sage-Grouse conservation objectives set forth in the BLM plan. Upon documenting that a hard trigger has been met the BLM will review available and pertinent data, in coordination with Greater Sage-Grouse biologists from multiple agencies including Forest Service, UDWR, USFWS, and/or NRCS, to determine the causal factor(s) for the declines. The BLM and the team will also identify measures needed to address the causal factors and develop a corrective strategy for the area where the trigger has been met. The corrective strategy would include the applicable changes identified in Table I-1 that address the causal factor, and could also include other management actions, which may require the need to amend or revise the RMP to address the situation and modify management. If determining the causal factor and development of a corrective strategy is not completed within six months of documenting that the trigger has been met, all the plan level responses identified in Table 1-1 will be applied until the causal factor analysis is complete. Upon completion of the causal factor analysis any responses that don’t address the causal factor(s) would be removed. In developing a corrective strategy, managers may select changes in management that are identified in Table I-1, Specific Management Responses that have already been analyzed for implementation.

Unless otherwise noted as a soft trigger response, all Adaptive Management Responses would be implemented where a hard trigger is reached. While implementing the corrective strategy, new scientific information may become available demonstrating that the plan-level response(s) could be insufficient to stop the severe deviation from Greater Sage-Grouse conservation objectives set forth in the BLM plan. If this occurs, the BLM and its partners will review the new scientific information to determine how it may change the causal factor analysis and corrective strategy. If the BLM, in coordination with its partners, concludes that the responses in place would be insufficient, the BLM will implement necessary management to protect Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat and to ensure that conservation options are not foreclosed in the area where the trigger has been met. For those Population Areas (BSUs) that are directly connected to identified BSUs in adjacent states (Box Elder, Hamlin Valley, Uintah, and Rich), if a hard trigger is reached on one of the connected BSUs outside of the Utah sub-region, the applicable state wildlife agencies and BLM staff will convene to determine the causal factor and propose project level responses, as appropriate, and discuss further appropriate actions that could be applied. The team will also investigate the status of the hard triggers in other BSUs within the PAC (in adjacent states) and will recommend the appropriate plan response. Adoption of any further actions at the plan level may require initiating a plan amendment process. The management identified in the corrective strategy would be implemented until ten-year population trends reflect the natural fluctuations of a self-sustaining population. The BLM would determine the area reflects natural fluctuations for a self-sustaining population in coordination with Greater Sage-Grouse biologists from multiple agencies including Forest Service, UDWR, USFWS, and/or NRCS. Upon such a determination, the management would revert to the RMPA. If all the leks in an area that has met a hard trigger are not active for ten years, becoming unoccupied by definition, the PHMA designation and all its associated management would be removed since there is no longer a greater sage-grouse population for which management should be prioritized. MONITORING Monitoring is a critical part of implementing adaptive management. Through monitoring, the agencies determine when a trigger has been met, as well as whether management actions taken, including adaptive responses, are effective in increasing Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and populations. The following image shows how monitoring information will be integrated into implementation of the adaptive management plan. This RMPA contains a Monitoring Framework Plan (Appendix D) that outlines monitoring of several aspects of Greater Sage-Grouse biological criteria and aspects of monitoring RMP effectiveness. The information collected through the Monitoring Framework Plan will be used by the BLM, among other available datasets, to determine when adaptive management hard and soft triggers for habitat are met. The BLM will organize an adaptive management working group, inviting participation from the UDWR, Forest Service, USFWS, and/or local governments. This group will annually review monitoring information related to Greater Sage-Grouse populations and habitat availability to determine if an adaptive management trigger has been met. The working group will evaluate Greater Sage-Grouse population data collected by the UDWR’s lek counts, as well as habitat information available from the BLM’s National Operation Center. Habitat information available from the BLM National Operation Center is based on remotely sensed sagebrush vegetation collected as part of the LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Type layer. Habitat information may be adjusted based on locally available vegetation data, if agreed upon by all adaptive management working group members. However, the baseline for determining the percent loss for the purposes of the adaptive management triggers must remain associated with a consistent vintage, namely the finalization of the RMP-decisions. It is also important that the vegetation data remain at a scale consistent with implementation of the adaptive management plan (BSUs), and remain at such a consistent scale over time. For any area that has met a soft or hard trigger, the BLM, the appropriate State of Utah agency, and other members of the technical team, will annually review monitoring data regarding population and habitat trends to verify that management actions implemented to mitigate declines are being successful. If monitoring indicates continued declines, the causal factor analysis will be reviewed, updated if needed, and applicable additional management would be identified and implemented. 1. Determine causal factor(s) and develop corrective strategy (within six months). 2. Implement corrective strategy to address causal factor(s). 3. Monitor and assess response SPATIAL SCALE Greater Sage-Grouse biologists, assigned to the multi-agency adaptive management working group, will assess population and habitat adaptive management triggers for PHMA within each Population Area (also referred to as BSUs when coordinating with other states). A BSU is a geographical/spatial area that contains the relevant habitats that are used by Greater Sage-Grouse. In Utah, the BLM is applying adaptive management monitoring and management to the total PHMA area associated with a Greater Sage-Grouse population area. When coordinating with adjacent states in regional monitoring and management, these areas will be referred to as BSUs. These areas generally align with habitat areas within the State of Utah’s Sage-Grouse Management Areas (SGMAs) with two adjustments. One adjustment includes some PHMA in the Carbon area that was not identified as an SGMA. Portions of the Anthro Mountain and West Tavaputs areas are combined with Emma Park area for adaptive management purposes. The other adjustment is the Emery population (Wildcat Knoll and Horn Mountain) that is combined with the Parker Mountain SGMA but will be considered separately because the population is small in size and effects to this population would be masked by what is going on in the much larger Parker SGMA. As a result, PHMA in the following areas will be monitored and evaluated for population and habitat adaptive management triggers: Box Elder, Rich, Uinta, Strawberry, Carbon, Emery, Parker, Panguitch, Bald Hills, Hamlin, Sheeprocks, and Ibapah. These areas generally represent population use areas within the sub-region. As described in the Monitoring Framework Plan, habitat data can be collected at these “BSU” scales and can be both aggregated up to the state-wide population, WAFWA Management Zone, or other reporting units. Similarly, more specific habitat delineation may be gathered identifying specific seasonal use patterns and even daily movements and preferences. However, in monitoring landscape changes in habitat and effects on Greater Sage-Grouse populations, the interagency team of Greater Sage-Grouse biologists identified the Population Area/SGMA/BSU scale as best capturing the needed metrics at a meaningful and consistent scale. The boundaries of these and other reporting units may be adjusted over time based on the understanding of local population interactions and climate variation. REFERENCES Connelly, J. W., K. P.

Greater Sage-Grouse Habitat Baseline and Habitat Update Protocol BACKGROUND Habitat for Greater Sage-Grouse is the most critical element in any efforts to manage and conserve the species in its range across the western United States. Consequently, considerable time and expense has been dedicated to identifying current, historical, and potential expansion of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and how it functions to provide the life sustaining elements for the species. Conservation of habitat is the foundation for this resource management plan amendment (RMPA). Any Greater Sage-Grouse conservation effort in Utah, as stated in the Conservation Plan for Greater Sage-Grouse in Utah (State Conservation Plan; UDWR 2013), must be “designed to protect high-quality habitat, enhance impaired habitat and restore converted habitat to support, in Utah, a portion of the range-wide population of Greater Sage-Grouse necessary to eliminate threats to the species.” According to Manier et al. (2013), Greater Sage-Grouse are currently estimated to occupy 165 million acres (668,000 square kilometers) across the western United States and Canada (Knick and Connelly 2011), and this range encompasses tremendous variability in habitat conditions, anthropogenic activities, and Greater Sage-Grouse populations. Development of comprehensive monitoring approaches leads to formal recognition that habitat selection assessments are needed to utilize approaches that address multiple spatial scales to represent selection processes of the animals (Connelly et al. 2003; Stiver et al. 2010). The first-order (1) is the broad geographic range that defines the species distribution Greater Sage-Grouse (2) characterization of the second-order hinges on large, relatively intact regions of habitat identified using populations or subpopulation distributions (for example, geographic connections among leks or regional population connectivity using genetics) to link habitats to Greater Sage-Grouse use. The third-order (3) requires refinement from delineations of populations/subpopulations within the species range in a given area to availability of the seasonal habitats (for example, nesting and winter habitats), and connectivity of seasonal habitats to support migration. Finally, assessment can be made of fourth-order selection (for example, daily site selection and behavioral observations) by (4) quantifying food and cover attributes and foraging behavior at particular sites. In practice, selection of food items is nested within selection of the feeding site because selection of a particular site determines the array of food items available to be selected; importantly, habitat value and use will best be determined using a combination of these characteristics (not one alone). To accurately characterize Greater Sage-Grouse habitat/range selection for a given population at the first-and second-orders, or landscape spatial scales, the migratory nature (seasonal movements) of the population must be well understood (Connelly et al. 2000), and this may include very large areas on an annual basis. It has been suggested that migratory populations may range across hundreds of square miles (Connelly et al. 2003). HABITAT IDENTIFICATION PROCESS The UDWR is the primary entity responsible for management of Greater Sage-Grouse populations in Utah and is also the lead entity in identifying and mapping Greater Sage-Grouse distribution. Information on the distribution identification process followed in Utah was summarized and is included in the Utah Greater Sage-Grouse Management Plan (State Management Plan; UDWR 2009). Although this plan has been superseded by the State Conservation Plan, the now dated Management Plan provides relevant information on the habitat identification process. Following Doherty’s work in Wyoming, Montana, and Colorado (Doherty 2008), core Utah Greater Sage-Grouse breeding habitats were mapped. The mapping was accomplished utilizing occupied lek densities and associated male Greater Sage-Grouse maximum lek attendance data for the period 1999– 2008 (10 years), referred to as the breeding bird density mapping. The breeding bird density mapping identified four density levels or parameters. The first parameter identified areas where 25 percent of the state’s total 10-year average spring breeding Greater Sage-Grouse males (indicator for populations) are located. These areas symbolize the highest statewide density of breeding males on leks and can also be viewed as high-priority leks or those leks and associated habitats that individually contribute the most to the state’s Greater Sage-Grouse total population. The second parameter identified areas where 50 percent of the state’s total breeding Greater Sage-Grouse males are found. This was repeated for the 75 percent and 100 percent of spring breeding Greater Sage-Grouse males until all occupied leks were classified. Viewed from the converse, the total known spring Greater Sage-Grouse statewide population was indicated by the combined area of all parameters. The breeding bird density mapped habitat was further refined over time as additional population and habitat area inventory, studies, and other information were available. This included information provided by other field specialists, other agencies, local and special interest groups, private landowners, and academia. Adjustments to habitat boundaries have been made based on verified information. The mapped seasonal habitat boundaries in each population area are intended to include areas currently used by a population or populations of Greater Sage-Grouse and are based upon the location of occupied leks, the identification of nesting and brood-rearing habitat, and associated winter and other habitat. For decades prior to the current review, the UDWR has been supporting research and community-based conservation efforts to learn more about the ecology of the species. Appendix 8 of the State’s 2013 Conservation Plan contains a listing of research studies and reports on Greater Sage-Grouse conducted in Utah. To facilitate this effort, the UDWR established ten Local Area Working Groups under the general direction of Utah State University, with the first established as far back as 1996. These Local Area Working Groups were composed of private interests and governmental entities, and were tasked to assess the local nature and scope of the threats to the species, and to recommend a course of action to address those threats. Because of this early and ongoing assessment, the State of Utah is fortunate to have a high level of knowledge about many of the populations, including seasonal range, migration routes, and other factors known to be essential to maintenance of the species, all in the context of Utah’s unique conditions. Greater Sage-Grouse distribution in Utah is highly influenced by the geography of Utah, which is characterized by mountainous terrain, separated by broad valleys in the Great Basin, and by deeply incised canyons in the Colorado Plateau. Greater Sage-Grouse habitat may be found in intact blocks in the Great Basin, or in disconnected “islands” of habitat in the Colorado Plateau. The UDWR’s seasonal habitat maps are intended to encompass the range used throughout the year by known Greater Sage-Grouse populations. Broad based maps that identify the Greater Sage-Grouse range are necessary to include a variety of important seasonal habitats and movement corridors that are spread across Utah’s geographically diverse and naturally fragmented landscape. Greater Sage-Grouse, frequently described as “landscape-scale species,” may use multiple areas to meet seasonal habitat needs throughout the year and the resulting patchwork of habitats (e.g., winter, breeding, nesting, early brood-rearing, late brood-rearing, transitional, and movement corridor habitats) can encompass large areas, sometimes ranging between 180,000 and 1.2 million acres. Broad range maps increase the likelihood that all seasonal habitats (including transition and movement corridors) are included, especially where there are information gaps on Greater Sage-Grouse populations’ habitats. Inevitably these Greater Sage-Grouse range maps include a patchwork of Greater Sage-Grouse habitats and non-habitats. Non-habitats, in and of themselves, may not provide direct habitat value for Greater Sage-Grouse (e.g., deep canyons or water bodies), but may be crossed by Greater Sage-Grouse when moving between seasonal habitats. There are approximately 7.3 million acres mapped as Greater Sage-Grouse range throughout Utah. According to state-wide LANDFIRE vegetation data reflecting existing vegetation, there are 3.1 million acres (approximately 41%) of these areas that are associated with vegetation communities that do not include sagebrush as either the dominant vegetation type or as a primary component species of the vegetation community. While areas mapped as Greater Sage-Grouse range encompass seasonal habitats and transition zones for Greater Sage-Grouse, they are also interspersed with areas that do not provide direct habitat at the site-scale (sagebrush) but may provide dispersal options or seasonal migration opportunities. Ninety-nine percent of the data pixels that comprise the 3.1 million acres of non-sagebrush vegetation types are less than 50 acres, reflecting the nature of habitat comprised of multiple interspersed vegetation types that often intermingle; however, the remaining 1 percent of the data pixels that comprise the 3.1 million acres represent areas that are larger than 50 acres and include nearly 86 percent of the area lacking a sagebrush component within the mapped occupied areas. This accounts for nearly 2.6 million acres of vegetation within Utah’s Greater Sage-Grouse range that does not provide the necessary sagebrush components for Greater Sage-Grouse site-scale habitat needs. However, these areas may still provide important contributions to the mid-and fine-scale habitat levels for large, intact areas that are needed to support Greater Sage-Grouse populations. Such a determination would need to be made on a case-bycase basis following a multi-scale habitat assessment. In short, the range boundaries were drawn on a broad scale, thus they include substantial amounts of interspersed areas of habitat and non-habitat. Most of the areas of non-habitat are predominantly small tracts that could be used for transitional zones or that could be affected by public land uses, in concert with adjacent tracts of habitat. However, some of these non-habitat areas are so large that they are unlikely to provide habitat for Greater Sage-Grouse populations. To assist in refining Greater Sage-Grouse seasonal habitat in Utah, telemetry and GPS data have been collected for a portion of the Greater Sage-Grouse populations in the state. Telemetry and GPS data provide the UDWR with site-specific data on how Greater Sage-Grouse use the landscape. Telemetry information provides a snapshot of how Greater Sage-Grouse used the landscape in specific years but does not necessarily represent how those same birds use the landscape every year, or what areas other individual birds may use. In general, maps are refined as additional information on habitat conditions, Greater Sage-Grouse habitat use patterns, population susceptibility to stochastic events, and impacts of vegetation treatment are available. BLM and UDWR biologists would determine habitat availability using information that may include site visits, telemetry data, documented quantitative or qualitative habitat assessments, vegetation and soils mapping, or other inputs that may inform habitat presence/absence. In summary, broad maps are more likely to include all seasonal habitat areas important for each population and can be refined as management agencies gain more information. While occupied habitat maps were used as a baseline for the 2015 RMPA/EIS, through on-the-ground information it is clear those maps include known use areas, as well as areas of potential habitat and areas of non-habitat. PLANNING REQUIREMENTS Though the BLM manages the habitat for wildlife species, the UDWR is the agency primarily responsible for managing Greater Sage-Grouse in Utah. In the past, the UDWR has been the primary repository for information regarding Greater Sage-Grouse habitat in Utah. The range maps represent a broad combination of information sources, including intact sagebrush areas, field observations, radio-telemetry data, historic habitats, professional judgment, and sagebrush areas adjacent to the previously mentioned areas. Since telemetry data have not been collected for every Greater Sage-Grouse population in the state, to refine the broader identified ranges, the aforementioned other sources of information are used in conjunction with telemetry and GPS data to create the Greater Sage-Grouse range maps. For the BLM’s purposes of maintaining and enhancing Greater Sage-Grouse persistence on the landscape, all Greater Sage-Grouse range identified and mapped by the UDWR is included as the baseline for planning to ensure that all habitats that are or may be necessary for long-term Greater Sage-Grouse persistence are including for assessment and evaluation in the planning process. However, the identification and mapping of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat is an ongoing effort. The Greater Sage-Grouse habitat maps used as a baseline for the land use planning process are not intended to represent a survey-grade boundary of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and are not expected to be exclusively used at the project level. In this sub-regional RMPA, the BLM is making broad-scale land use planning decisions that are connected with similarly broad-scale RMPAs across the range of Greater Sage-Grouse (see Section 1.1 of the 2015 Final EIS). Based on the scale of planning (landscape level), baseline habitat represented in this RMPA primarily represents a portion of the first and the second order habitat within Utah discussed in the background section above. Not only is the scale of mapping appropriate given the scale of planning, but it is also appropriate given the stated goals and objectives of this RMPA/EIS. Through this planning process the BLM aims to not only stop the decline of Greater Sage-Grouse populations, but to increase habitat availability and population size and distribution. HABITAT UPDATES As expressed in the 2013 State Conservation Plan for Utah, the implementation of any plan should be accompanied by efforts to refine mapping of habitats, which includes this RMPA/EIS. These efforts should be coordinated among federal, state, and local agencies; private landowners; Greater Sage-Grouse working groups; and academia that may choose to participate. On-the-ground projects should also contribute to this refined habitat mapping effort, at a level commensurate with the decisions to be made. Habitat map updates will be made when agencies with special expertise and legal jurisdiction for Greater Sage-Grouse and their habitat gain more information on the presence/absence of Greater Sage-Grouse; obtain new or additional baseline population data, including information on the distribution and connectivity of Greater Sage-Grouse populations with other populations; identify Greater Sage-Grouse seasonal habitats and movements; and identify and quantify sagebrush habitats, the condition of those habitats, and connectivity within populations. While refinements to habitat maps are necessary and appropriate, the RMPA includes management that gives the agency discretion to authorize actions in non-habitat areas under identified conditions. This eliminates the need to make constant site-specific adjustments to Greater Sage-Grouse habitat management area boundaries through the land use planning processes, which is neither consistent with the landscape nature of management actions in the BLM RMPs, nor consistent with application of conservation measures at a scale and timing needed to protect Greater Sage-Grouse. Prior to considering proposed actions within Priority Habitat Management Areas (PHMA), an evaluation should be conducted by a qualified biologist in collaboration with federal and state biologists, including a field investigation if needed. To this end, additional site-specific information associated with local surveys could result in a more precise delineation of habitat boundaries. If during implementation of the RMPA or evaluation of a proposed action there are discrepancies between the LUP maps and the on-theground conditions, the on-the-ground information should be used to determine where the management included within this RMPA/EIS would apply. A similar site-specific review process has been effectively employed while Greater Sage-Grouse habitats were under interim management, allowing proposed projects in areas identified as non-habitat to proceed. When considering new or local information for application of management actions, the goal is to provide a transparent and consistent scientific-based process for adjusting Greater Sage-Grouse habitat that will promote conservation of Greater Sage-Grouse in Utah. To that end, the following would be considered when updating the Greater Sage-Grouse habitat delineations: Seasonal Habitat • Determination of adjustments in the delineation of mapped seasonal Greater Sage-Grouse habitats would be coordinated among federal, state, and local agencies; academia; and technical specialists through a Greater Sage-Grouse Working Group. • Adjustments in mapped Greater Sage-Grouse seasonal habitats will be based on the best available information, including field observations and inventories, radio-telemetry data, GPS collar data, habitat assessments, site visits, supporting research and science, restoration treatments, disturbance, technical expertise, and accepted modeling (including ground-truthing). • Review of Greater Sage-Grouse mapped seasonal habitats and proposed adjustments could occur anytime there is a need to adjust the habitat baseline. At a minimum, the BLM would evaluate the mapped seasonal habitat boundaries approximately every 5 years in conjunction with land use plan evaluations. • In general, mapped seasonal habitat boundaries would not be adjusted to exclude non-habitat areas if those areas of non-habitat are wholly contained in the mapped seasonal habitat boundaries, considering the level of habitat identification needed commensurate with the level of decision-making. • Habitat altered by fire would not be removed as seasonal habitat. If the BLM, in consultation with other agencies, determines that rehabilitation or restoration of mapped seasonal Greater Sage-Grouse habitat is not feasible and that the area no longer contributes to any part of the Greater Sage-Grouse life cycle, adjustments may be made to exclude the area. • Determinations on adjustments to mapped Greater Sage-Grouse seasonal habitat would be by consensus of the Greater Sage-Grouse Working Group. Priority Habitat Management Areas • Because PHMA boundaries are a land use plan action, adjustments are a BLM responsibility and will comply with the applicable BLM planning regulations and policies. • Adjustments in delineation of PHMA would be coordinated among federal, state, and local agencies and interested parties. • Adjustments in delineation of PHMA would be based on the best available information, including field observations and inventories, radio-telemetry and GPS data, habitat assessments, site visits, supporting research and science, restoration treatments, disturbance, technical expertise, and accepted modeling (including ground-truthing). • Review of PHMA boundaries would generally be done every 5 years (for the BLM, this would be in conjunction with land use plan evaluations), unless more frequent adjustments are needed. • Consistent with landscape-level decision making, PHMA would be identified at a second-order level (Manier et. al. 2013), and as such, boundaries would generally not be adjusted to exclude non-habitat areas if those areas are wholly contained within the LUP-identified boundaries. • Areas within PHMA that are not currently used by Greater Sage-Grouse, but are ecologically capable of supporting Greater Sage-Grouse, would not be removed from PHMA boundaries. • The Greater Sage-Grouse Working Group would make adjustment recommendations to PHMA to the BLM Utah State Director, who will make the final determination on whether the PHMA boundary adjustment is appropriate. • New areas of mapped Greater Sage-Grouse seasonal habitat could be identified as PHMA following the appropriate BLM planning rules and procedures. The administrative process through which boundary adjustments will be made would be determined on a case-by-case basis. REFERENCES Connelly, J. W., M. A. Schroeder, A. R. Sands, and C. E.

Cumulative Effects Supporting Information 1.1 RANGEWIDE IMPACTS FROM PAST, PRESENT, AND REASONABLY FORESEEABLE ACTIONS Table 1 represents the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions across the entire range for Greater Sage-Grouse, which are separated by state. When assessing the cumulative impact of the RMPA/EIS on Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat, there are multiple geographic scales that the BLM has considered, including the appropriate WAFWA MZ. WAFWA MZs have biological significance to Greater Sage-Grouse. Established and delineated in 2004 in the Conservation Assessment of Greater Sage-Grouse and Sagebrush Habitats (Connelly et al. 2004), the WAFWA MZs are based on floristic provinces that reflect ecological and biological issues and similarities, not political boundaries. Table 1 Rangewide Impacts from Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Actions Action Type Effects Habitat Restoration  Great Basin-wide programmatic  Programmatic document effects will be  Programmatic EIS  habitat restoration project  realized when the field implements  projects.

While it requires a 4:1 mitigation ratio in the State’s Sage-Grouse Management Areas (SGMA), there was no established approach to implement that mitigation process to the State’s 11 SGMAs. Effect: The plan establishes the management actions necessary for the State of Utah to continue to enhance and conserve the Greater Sage-Grouse while still allowing for economic opportunities. Future: The State is updating their Greater Sage-Grouse plan and incorporating the compensatory mitigation rule that provides a process to develop a banking system to apply the state’s 4:1 mitigation ratio that is designed to improve habitat for Greater Sage-Grouse. Effect: This effort will help to refine and identify areas to improve management actions and allow for the incorporation of new and local science to better balance Greater Sage-Grouse management across the state. It will also provide an opportunity for economic development to occur while offsetting the impacts to habitat quality. Table 1 Rangewide Impacts from Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Actions Action Type Effects Wildland Fires 2015-2017 BLM: Past – Acres burned on BLM Approximately 137,000 acres of HMA administered land burned between 2015 and 2017.

The BLM used these data to represent the No-Action Alternative for the current plan analysis. The BLM then identified 2015 data which are not subject to change in any alternatives associated with the 2018 planning process. These data were carried forward as the alternative allocation decision data. The BLM was also able to provide allocation decision data representing changes included in the 2018 Proposed RMPAs/Final EISs, which were then used in the comparative analysis. Decision data are summarized by habitat type within each Management Zone (MZ) (see Figure 1) and are presented in this appendix in both approximate acreage of BLM-administered lands within each habitat designation as well as percent of BLM-administered lands within a habitat designation to which an allocation decision applies. For programs where allocation decisions change, information is presented separately. In cases where no change has occurred, both alternatives are presented together. The BLM Montana is currently not undergoing a plan amendment process; however, data were included in this cumulative effects summary. A summary of data submitted for this analysis can be found in Table 1, detailing which areas did not provide data for analysis. In these cases, summaries reflect submitted data only.

The BLM recognizes that not all of these comments apply to all states, but they do apply across multiple states. This section also contains a response to the summaries of comments. The Utah-Specific Comment Responses section contains a summary of comments received specific to Colorado and responses to those comments. The full text of parsed comments received both rangewide and Utah-specific can be found in the respective sections. 2.1 RANGEWIDE COMMENT RESPONSES 2.1.1 Adaptive Management Summary: The “hard” and “soft” triggers identified in the 2015 plan amendments should be maintained in the current planning amendments. Response: BLM is focused on aligning its management with the states. BLM’s stated purpose and need is to promote consistency and alignment with each State’s management for Greater Sage-Grouse. The adaptive management triggers have been maintained. However, they have been modified to align with the State’s management for Greater Sage-Grouse and with consideration for local circumstances. See individual state plans for the modified adaptive management. Summary: Priority Habitat Management Area (PHMA) should be expanded to include additional areas. Response: BLM is focused on aligning its management with the states. BLM’s stated purpose and need is to promote consistency and alignment with each State’s management for Greater Sage-Grouse. The habitat areas identified in the Draft RMPAs are based, in part, on the information provided by the State agencies and the latest available science and information regarding habitat for GRSG. The habitat designations in the plans can be modified based on established criteria to address habitat changes, new information, and site-specific conditions. Core area and winter habitat needs to coordinate response with Wyoming. 2.1.2 Alternatives -Other Summary: West Nile virus is a material threat to sage-grouse, and retention ponds and infiltration ponds contribute to this risk. Response: Where West Nile virus has been identified as a threat, the 2015 plans identified required design features specifically designed to reduce the risk of West Nile Virus. Further analyzing impacts of West Nile are outside the scope and do not meet the purpose and need of the 2018 plan amendment. Summary: The BLM must respect valid existing rights, including those reflected in oil and gas leases issued under the Mineral Leasing Act and the rights of claimants under the 1872 Mining Law. Response: All proposed actions contained in the RMPA will be subject to valid existing rights, including those associated with Mineral Leasing Act and the 1872 Mining Law. The BLM recognizes that in some circumstances its discretion to deny or regulate a proposed public land use is limited, such as with existing leases, existing contracts, or mining plans of operations. Accordingly, the BLM will ensure that its implementation of the management actions in the RMPA is consistent with the terms and conditions in existing leases or existing contracts, or with the regulations governing mining plans of operations. For example, if the BLM previously issued an oil and gas lease with standard lease terms and conditions, and the lessee submits an APD, the BLM will ensure that any management actions from the RMPA will be applied in a manner that is consistent with the terms and conditions of the underlying oil and gas lease. Similarly, if an applicant submits a mining plan of operations under 43 CFR Subpart 3809, the BLM will apply management actions in the RMPA only to the extent that they are consistent with the BLM’s authority to regulate hardrock mining under Subpart 3809, including to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation. 2.1.3 Assumptions and Methodology Summary: The analysis assumes that there are sufficient resources to implement the plan, which is not a supported assumption. The analysis makes unrealistic assumptions about the capacity for restoration. Response: Department workforce reduction actions are speculative at this time and not specific to BLM or GRSG related staff. To date the BLM has treated 1,505,326 acres; 1,159,247 of those acres since 2015. Further, specific Congressional appropriations have provided the funds allowing the BLM to treat more acres every fiscal year, highlighting both Congressional and the BLM’s commitment to GRSG conservation. BLM is committed to the continued implementation of sage-grouse habitat and sagebrush steppe management. Summary: The analysis assumes that project-level activities will undergo additional environmental review, but the use of Categorical Exclusions (CXs) and Determinations of NEPA Adequacy contradicts this assumption. Response: If additional project level analysis is needed the BLM will conduct it at the appropriate stage. If the existing NEPA relevant to future actions is sufficient to support the decision maker, the BLM will document this in a Determination of NEPA Adequacy. If an action is categorically excluded and no extraordinary circumstances are present, the BLM expects to use a Categorical Exclusion. The list of DOI and BLM Categorical Exclusions is included in Appendices 3 and 4 of the BLM NEPA Handbook (H1790-1). In addition, Section 390 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 established five statutory Categorical Exclusions that apply only to oil and gas exploration and development pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act. Summary: The analysis assumes impacts will primarily occur on federal lands, but there is research that suggests otherwise. Response: The decisions in the RMPAs apply only to BLM-administered lands and federal mineral estate. To the extent that these decisions affect non-BLM-administered lands, the effects are disclosed in the EIS. However, much of the direct and indirect effects of the decisions are confined to BLM-administered lands and federal mineral estate. Summary: The analysis assumes use of best available science, but key studies are missing. Response: The BLM coordinated with states, federal agencies and cooperating agencies to identify how the affected environment for sage-grouse management has changed. BLM specifically partnered with USGS to review the best available information published between January 2015 and January 2018 and incorporate the management implications of that information into this EIS. The report1 from USGS is available here and referenced throughout the EIS. Please review the Data and Science response in this section for more information. 2.1.4 Cumulative Impacts Summary: Because the scope of the current amendments isn’t narrower than the 2015 amendments, tiering isn’t appropriate. Incorporation of the Cumulative Effects Analysis (CEA) by reference is allowable, but the summary of the CEA is insufficient as written. Response: BLM is using incorporation by reference, not tiering, to streamline our analysis consistent with Administrative priorities. Incorporation of the 2015 EIS by reference is allowable under BLM regulations and is appropriate in this circumstance because the purpose of this action builds upon the goals and objectives of the 2015 EIS. Summary: The incorporation by reference of the 2015 CEA impedes public review. Response: BLM is adding quantitative analysis of the cumulative impacts from planning decisions for each management zone to the Final EISs to address rangewide issues and trends. Summary: The CEA failed to account for a number of relevant activities, such as oil and gas projects in Wyoming and other scheduled lease sales. Response: The BLM will update the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions as needed to reflect all current projects in the Final EIS. 2.1.5 Data and Science Summary: The public submitted studies for consideration by the BLM. Response: BLM specifically partnered with USGS to review the best available information and incorporate the management implications of that information into this EIS. The report from USGS is available here and referenced throughout the EIS. The BLM places great import on the best available information, including new scientific studies and government reports that indicate a potential change in our assumptions or conditions related to a land use planning effort. The BLM has to balance reviewing new information with determining what information is relevant to a decision in light of the BLM’s purpose and need. Many commenters highlighted information and studies to the BLM to consider, and the BLM has reviewed each source submitted. Further, the BLM asked the USGS to participate in the review, and to verify if information was included in the USGS synthesis report that was developed for the Draft EIS. Many suggested articles were already included for analysis in the USGS report, and may have been missed by commenters in the initial review of the synthesis report and Draft EIS. Both known and new studies were reviewed by BLM staff, including scientists and NEPA specialists, and each BLM State Office reviewed each study specific to how it informed their planning decisions and environmental conditions. The BLM has included, where appropriate, updates to analysis in the appropriate EISs. Overall, submitted studies did not offer information that changed the analysis of the plans/EISs and did not offer any new conditions or other information the BLM had not considered already. The BLM has reviewed all new information and suggested studies from comments received rangewide, and in specific states. Further, the BLM takes new information seriously, and identified 11 articles from the studies suggested in comments. These 11 studies are sorted below by whether they were review by the BLM by being cited in the USGS Report, being references in the bibliography of the USGS Report, or by the BLM considering them during the RMP Amendment development and review of comments. Articles not specifically addressed below were still reviewed during comment response development. Cited in USGS Synthesis Report Baumgardt, J. A., Reese, K. P., Connelly, J. W., & Garton, E. O.

BLM’s goal is to promote consistency and alignment with each State’s management for Greater Sage-Grouse, including the approach to implementing actions to reduce threats to sage-grouse. The analysis and decisions in the RMPs are based on the information provided by the State agencies and are based on the latest available science and information regarding GRSG. Summary: Existing disturbance caps should be maintained Response: BLM is focused on aligning our management with the states. BLM’s goal is to promote consistency and alignment with each State’s management for Greater Sage-Grouse, including the approach to implementing actions to reduce threats to sage-grouse. The analysis and decisions in the RMPs are based on the information provided by the State agencies and are based on the latest available science and information regarding GRSG. Summary: Disturbance caps are inadequate because they permit severe localized impacts Response: The BLM analyzed the impacts of the disturbance cap in 2015 and in 2018, where appropriate, and disclosed the potential for localized impacts. Mitigation is designed to reduce some of these impacts to a level below the thresholds established in the plans. Summary: Disturbance caps don’t account for fragmentation Response: The BLM recognizes the risk that habitat fragmentation poses to greater sage-grouse and its habitats. The BLM analyzed the impacts, including fragmentation, of the disturbance cap in 2015 and in 2018, where appropriate, and disclosed the potential for fragmentation. Disturbance caps are one tool in a broader management strategy that BLM employs to minimize habitat fragmentation. The density cap is designed to reduce some of these impacts to below the thresholds established in the plans. Further, the BLM also addresses fragmentation through mechanisms other than disturbance caps. For example, the conservation measures that apply in PHMA address threats to GRSG, including fragmentation. Those measures include, but are not limited to, disturbance and density caps. 2.1.7 Fire and Invasive Species Summary: The approach to managing noxious and invasive weeds needs to be more specific. The analysis should also include the 2018 Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA) Gap Report. Response: BLM has comprehensive strategies to address invasive species and has been implementing those strategies. Improving invasive species management did not emerge as an issue during scoping to increase management alignment or flexibility. 2.1.8 General Habitat Management Areas Summary: The public submitted studies for consideration by the BLM in support of maintaining protections for General Habitat Management Areas (GHMA). The importance of GHMA to genetic conservation was not given sufficient attention in the analysis Response: Removing GHMA is being evaluated as a potential way to better align federal management with that of the state. The BLM reviewed the best available science and finds that while there is evidence that gene-flow and connectivity is facilitated by GHMA, presents a sufficiently low risk to species persistence that additional analysis of this impact related to GHMA removal, beyond that in the draft EIS, is not warranted. 2.1.9 Guidance and Policy Summary: Discretionary waivers and modifications create uncertainty in the application of protections that was not adequately analyzed. Response: Under the Proposed Plan, waivers, exemptions and modifications would be granted only when meeting specific criteria designed to advance the management goals and objectives in the RMPs. BLM’s proposed plan balances the risk of uncertainty against the benefits of management flexibility when considering whether to grant a wavier, exception, or modification. Planning criteria identified for this amendment include consideration of how planning decisions may impact future listing determinations under the ESA. Summary: BLM should tailor policies closer to state policy rather than providing general discretion. Response: BLM implementation actions must conform with plan goals and objectives. The details of implementation are guided by current policy which are discretionary and open to change based on amendments to RMPs. Summary: Secretarial Orders referenced in the Draft EISs need additional clarifying language for how they are guiding the direction of the Draft EISs. Response: BLM is ensuring this planning effort conforms with the guidance and direction contained in Secretary’s Orders, including SO 3353, Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation and Cooperation with Western States. The Proposed Plan explains the relationship between various SOs and this planning process in greater detail. The BLM will continue to manage public lands in conformance with its approved land use plans, while future policies and Secretary’s Orders may provide guidance and direction about how BLM implements those plans. 2.1.10 Habitat Boundary/Habitat Management Area Designations Summary: BLM should use a strict 3% area threshold on administrative boundary changes. Changes to habitat boundaries exceeding 3% in area should require a new plan amendment. Response: The thresholds for amending plans are defined in BLM’s planning handbook and often depend on specific context. The BLM is committed to streamlined and effective processes using plan maintenance and other measures when appropriate. Habitat boundaries are adjusted according to specific criteria and whether modified via plan maintenance or amendment will be determined at the appropriate time. Public participation will be commensurate with the level of planning and BLM policy. Summary: Discretionary waivers and modifications introduce uncertainty to protections that were not adequately analyzed. Response: Under the Proposed Plan, waivers, exemptions and modifications would be granted only when meeting specific criteria designed to advance the management goals and objectives in the RMPs. BLM’s proposed plan balances the risk of uncertainty against the benefits of management flexibility when considering whether to grant a wavier, exception, or modification. Planning criteria identified for this amendment include consideration of how planning decisions may impact future listing determinations under the ESA. Summary: Secretarial Orders referenced in the Draft EISs need additional clarifying language for how they are guiding the direction of the Draft EISs Response: The BLM is ensuring this planning effort conforms with the guidance and direction contained in Secretary’s Orders, including SO 3353, Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation and Cooperation with Western States. The Proposed Plan explains the relationship between various SOs and this planning process in greater detail. The BLM will continue to manage public lands in conformance with its approved land use plans, while future policies and Secretary’s Orders may provide guidance and direction about how BLM implements those plans 2.1.11 Habitat Management Areas Summary: The spatial extent of habitat management areas should not be modified. Response: HMAs reflect habitat which is mapped based on best available information. If BLM and the state finds that habitat was not reflected correctly in light of new information, plan maintenance or an amendment can be used to update boundaries to reflect the change in information. Summary: The management prescriptions associated with habitat management areas should not be modified. Response: The purpose of these plan amendments is to increase consistency with state management. In some cases that may result in changes to management within the HMAs.. Summary: Restoration targets for Priority Habitat Management Areas (PHMA) should be developed and incorporated into the plans. Response: While BLM has not developed specific restoration targets, the BLM has committed to significant restoration and recovery actions. The BLM spent considerable time and energy on the development of the FIATs that identify specific areas for specific types of actions and used that as a basis for requesting funding from Congress. Some targets have been developed, but are not included in the plans for reasons such as uncertainty of funding to implement the actions to reach the targets. 2.1.12 Habitat Objectives Summary: BLM should more closely align its specific habitat objectives with the 2018 USGS report. Response: BLM’s habitat objectives reflect the best available information defining habitat conditions that sage-grouse preferentially select. The USGS report confirms BLM’s assumption that such understanding may change over time. BLM has developed the flexibility in the plans to modify seasonal habitat objectives based on new science or site-specific information. 2.1.13 Lands and Realty Summary: BLM should not dispose of lands with sage-grouse because transferring lands out of federal ownership introduces regulatory uncertainty and risks reducing habitat connectivity. Response: BLM disposes of lands based on programmatic guidance and policy, and following specific criteria. Land and realty actions are often implementation level decisions that must conform with the sage-grouse goals and objectives identified in these RMP amendments. 2.1.14 Lek Buffers Summary: Lek buffers should be maintained to protect leks. Response: The BLM agrees that lek buffers are one of many important conservation tools available to manage sagebrush habitat and protect Greater Sage-Grouse. The BLM is retaining, and in some instances modifying/clarifying the application of lek buffers as a management tool. Summary: Lek buffers should be larger than prescribed in the plan amendments. Response: As applicable, each RMPA has an appendix that addresses lek buffers and allows the BLM to adjust lek buffers based on the best available science, this would allow the BLM to adjust the buffers based on new information as well. Further, some states are clarifying the approach in this RMPA effort, or adjusting to better align with their individual State’s management. For more specific information, please refer to the individual plans and their associated lek buffer appendix. Summary: The public submitted studies for consideration by the BLM in support of larger lek buffers. Response: The BLM reviewed all submitted studies, and additional information. Please see the response to Data and Science comments for a response to this study. 2.1.15 Mitigation Summary: Mitigation provisions in the 2015 plans were relied on in the USFWS 2015 finding. Mitigation should follow consistent principles. Mitigation could benefit from different strategies in different states. Mitigation provides stronger, faster decisions on project authorizations Response: BLM’s Proposed Plan balances the risk of uncertainty against the benefits of management flexibility when considering mitigation strategies. The BLM is committed to applying and enforcing the mitigation hierarchy of actions to avoid, minimize, and otherwise mitigate impacts to the extent that federal law allows. A principal component of GRSG management is the implementation of mitigation actions to ameliorate the threats and impacts to sage grouse and its habitats. The Proposed Plan clarifies how voluntary compensatory mitigation should be considered in the management of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and how BLM will work with each state management agency to implement its compensatory mitigation strategy. Summary: Mandatory net-gain and compensatory mitigation is supported by some commenters, and objected to by others. Response: BLM’s Proposed Plan balances the risk of uncertainty against the benefits of management flexibility when considering mitigation strategies. Following extensive review of FLPMA, including existing regulations, orders, policies, and guidance, the BLM has concluded that FLPMA does not explicitly mandate or authorize the BLM to require public land users to implement compensatory mitigation as a condition of obtaining authorization for the use of the public lands (Instruction Memorandum No. 2018093, Compensatory Mitigation, July 24, 2018). However, the BLM is committed to applying and enforcing the mitigation hierarchy of actions to avoid, minimize, and otherwise mitigate impacts to the extent that federal law allows. A principal component of GRSG management is the implementation of mitigation actions to ameliorate the threats and impacts to sage grouse and its habitats. The Proposed Plan clarifies how voluntary compensatory mitigation should be considered in the management of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and how BLM will work with each state management agency to implement its compensatory mitigation strategy. Summary: Various commenters argued that the “net conservation gain” standard should be retained, modified or eliminated. Many commenters requested clarification of the BLM’s authority to impose compensatory mitigation. Response: Following extensive review of FLPMA, including existing regulations, orders, policies, and guidance, the BLM has concluded that FLPMA does not explicitly mandate or authorize the BLM to require public land users to implement compensatory mitigation to offset environmental effects beyond the proponents level of impact. The Proposed Plan seeks to clarify that the mitigation standard applies not at the project level, but rather as a planning-level goal and objective unless specifically required under a state management authority. The BLM is pursuing agreements with the States of Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming to clarify how BLM, project proponents, and state management agencies will collaborate to implement a State’s compensatory mitigation plan. Summary: Various commenters argued that recent changes in mitigation policy and the applicability to sage-grouse warrant additional analysis, public review, or a SEIS. Response: Public input on implementing mitigation, “including alternative approaches to requiring compensatory mitigation in BLM land use plans,” was explicitly requested as part of the public comment period on the 2018 Draft EIS (see page ES-8, Section ES.4.2, last sentence of second paragraph). The Proposed Plan clarifies how voluntary compensatory mitigation should be considered in the management of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and how BLM will work with each state management agency to implement its compensatory mitigation strategy. Because this clarification simply aligns the Proposed Plan Amendment with BLM policy and with the scope of compensatory mitigation authority expressly provided by FLPMA, and because any analysis of compensatory mitigation relating to future projects would necessarily be fact-specific and evaluated in project-specific NEPA documents, there is limited value in attempting to do so at the level of land use planning. Summary: Many commenters stated the BLM should clarify how it will implement compensatory mitigation. Response: The BLM is pursuing agreements with the States of Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming to clarify how BLM, project proponents, and state management agencies will collaborate to implement a State’s compensatory mitigation plan. The BLM will defer to a state methodology for habitat quantification if such a tool exists and incorporate the state’s assessment into the appropriate NEPA documentation. The Proposed Plan Amendment clarifies that BLM will consider compensatory mitigation only as a component of compliance with a state mitigation plan, program, or authority, or when offered voluntarily by a project proponent. The Proposed Plan further clarifies the application of the mitigation standard as a planning-level goal and objective for sage-grouse habitat conservation. BLM commits to cooperating with the State to analyze applicant-proffered or state-imposed compensatory mitigation to offset residual impacts. BLM may then authorize such actions consistent with NEPA analysis and the governing Resource Management Plan. 2.1.16 Modifying Waivers, Exceptions, and Modifications of Fluid Minerals Summary: One-time exceptions should be preferred over more expansive exceptions Response: Under the Proposed Plan, waivers, exceptions, and modifications would be granted only when meeting specific criteria designed to advance the management goals and objectives in the RMPs. BLM’s proposed plan balances the risk of uncertainty against the benefits of management flexibility when considering whether to grant a wavier, exception, or modification. Planning criteria identified for this amendment include consideration of how planning decisions may impact future listing determinations under the ESA. Summary: Waivers should be narrowly defined. Response: Under the Proposed Plan, waivers, exceptions, and modifications would be granted only when meeting specific criteria designed to advance the management goals and objectives in the RMPs. BLM’s proposed plan balances the risk of uncertainty against the benefits of management flexibility when considering whether to grant a wavier, exception, or modification. Planning criteria identified for this amendment include consideration of how planning decisions may impact future listing determinations under the ESA. Summary: There should be opportunity for public notice and comment for certain types of waivers, exceptions, or modifications. Response: The BLM will comply with 43 CFR 3101.1-4 regarding public notification of waivers, exceptions, or modifications, which includes a 30-day public notification period. An exception is a limited type of waiver and therefore is subject to 43 CFR 3101.1-4. 2.1.17 Noise Management Outside of PHMA Summary: Noise restrictions should be stronger. The public submitted studies for consideration by the BLM in support of stronger restrictions on noise. The public suggested changes to the noise measurement methods. Response: BLM has determined the noise restrictions are adequate to balance best available information with the goals and objectives of the Proposed Plan and to meet the Purpose and Need. 2.1.18 Preferred Alternative Summary: The preferred alternative should be the No Action Alt because it was relied on for the 2015 listing decisions. Response: The proposed plan was chosen based on the BLM’s stated purpose and need, coordination with cooperating agencies, and public comment. The no action was not the sole factor USFWS relied upon when reaching it’s 2015 listing determination. BLM’s proposed plan balances the risk of uncertainty against the benefits of management flexibility when considering the selection of a proposed lan. Planning criteria identified for this amendment include consideration of how planning decisions may impact future listing determinations under the ESA. 2.1.19 Prioritization of Mineral Leasing Summary: No summary—implementation-level decision 2.1.20 Range of Alternatives Summary: The range of alternatives is unreasonably narrow. Response: The range is adequate to address the agency’s purpose and need for considering these amendments. And by incorporating the 2015 plans by reference, BLM avails itself of a larger range of management options previously analyzed in a broadly distributed EIS. Further, BLM considered a number of alternatives and issues during scoping that the agency determined not to carry forward. Summary: The no-action alternative does not reflect a proper baseline. Response: The No-Action Alternative represents the current management plan as it is implemented on the ground across 11 states and over 90 RMPs, including US Forest Service lands, thereby reflecting a management baseline that is well understood by BLM. 2.1.21 Recreation Summary: Recreation and its socioeconomic benefits are tied to sagebrush ecosystems Response: The BLM agrees and ensures that recreation-related projects and actions in sage-grouse habitats conform with management goals and objectives from the 2015 management plans. 2.1.22 Required Design Features (RDFs) Summary: NSO stipulations should be maintained in priority habitats. Response: BLM is focused on aligning our management with the states. BLM’s goal is to promote consistency and aligment with each State’s management for greater sage-grouse. In most cases, the proposed plan maintains NSO restrictions and other management prescriptions. Where BLM has increased its management flexibility, it has done so to improve alignment with the state plans and based on local information. The impact to sage-grouse from disturbance and habitat fragmentation is well documented in the 2015 EIS. 2.1.23 Sagebrush Focal Areas (SFAs) Summary: Sagebrush focal areas (SFAs) should not be removed. Inconsistency in retention and removal of SFA across states is arbitrary and capricious. BLM is not legally required to remove SFA. Justifications for eliminating SFAs are inadequate. Response: BLM is focused on aligning our management with the states. BLM’s goal is to promote consistency and alignment with each State’s management for greater sage-grouse. Where BLM has increased its management flexibility, it has done so to improve alignment with the state plans and based on local information. BLM has determined that SFA designations provide a redundant layer of resource protection and land use prioritization within PHMA and is acting within its discretion to remove SFA designation. Further, the BLM canceled the proposed withdrawal of SFAs through a publication in the Federal Register on October 11, 2017 (82 Fed. Reg. 47,248) and findings in the Sagebrush Focal Area Draft EIS noted that there was broadly low potential for locatable minerals within the recommended withdrawal area, so the withdrawal would not have provided additional protection to GRSG. 2.1.24 Sage-Grouse Summary: Regulatory changes and regulatory uncertainty increase the likelihood of listing of the species under the ESA. The impacts analysis is deficient. Protections afforded by the plans aren’t sufficient to prevent listing of the species. Response: BLM’s proposed plan balances the risk of uncertainty against the benefits of management flexibility and alignment when considering changes to the 2015 plans. Planning criteria identified for this amendment include consideration of how planning decisions may impact future listing determinations under the ESA. 2.1.25 Statutes and Regulations Summary: The BLM must respect valid existing rights, including those reflected in oil and gas leases issued under the Mineral Leasing Act. The BLM also implements land use planning decisions differently with respect to uses related to the Mining Law of 1872. Response: All proposed actions contained in the RMPA will be subject to valid existing rights, including those associated with leases issued under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. Accordingly, the BLM will ensure that its implementation of the management actions in the RMPA is consistent with the terms and conditions in existing leases or existing contracts. For example, if the BLM previously issued an oil and gas lease with standard lease terms and conditions, and the lessee submits an application for permit to dill, the BLM will ensure that any management actions from the RMPA will be applied in a manner that is consistent with the terms and conditions of the underlying oil and gas lease. The BLM also recognizes that it has limited authority to impose conditions on certain uses related to the Mining Law of 1872 through land use planning decisions. Accordingly, the BLM will apply management actions in the RMPA only to the extent that they are consistent with the Mining Law of 1872 and the BLM’s regulations. Summary: The purpose and need is unreasonably narrow. Response: The agency’s purpose and need for considering these amendments was carefully drawn to promote alignment with the State’s plans and policies while satisfying the BLM’s responsibilities under FLPMA, other applicable laws, and BLM policy. This planning effort also builds off the comprehensive 2015 planning and NEPA process; incorporates the 2015 Final EIS analysis by reference in its entirety, including its alternatives; and has been informed by a scoping process that has identified specific opportunities to improve alignment with state plans. Summary: The purpose and need is driven solely by applicant objectives. Response: The planning and NEPA process does not respond to any applications submitted to the BLM. The BLM’s intention is to build upon the 2015 plans by improving access and management flexibility by better aligning our management plans with the States’ management plans. The purpose and need reflects this intent consistent with the agency’s mission and Administration's priorities. Summary: The BLM inappropriately tiered to a document of equal scope. The BLM failed to summarize and relate applicability of material incorporated by reference to the new plans. Response: BLM is using incorporation by reference to streamline our analysis consistent with Administrative priorities. Incorporation of the 2015 EIS by reference is allowable under BLM regulations and is appropriate in this circumstance because the purpose of this action builds upon the goals and objectives of the 2015 EIS. Further, the CEQ 40 Questions, Question 24c, states that, “Tiering is a procedure which allows an agency to avoid duplication of paperwork through the incorporation by reference of the general discussions and relevant specific discussions from an environmental impact statement of broader scope into one of lesser scope or vice versa.” The BLM has summarized and referenced applicable aspects of the 2015 EIS throughout the 2018 EIS, but especially in Chapters 2 and 4. Summary: The BLM failed to consider and designate Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACECs). Response: BLM properly considered and analyzed the designation of ACECs in 2015. No new information suggests it is necessary to reconsider those decisions and BLM has determined the issue of ACECs to fall outside the scope of this effort to better align federal management with state management plans. Summary: BLM fails to incorporate an appropriate Analysis of Management Situation. Response: . BLM analyzed the management situation in full compliance with its regulations and policies. The BLM evaluated inventory and other data and information, partnering with USGS and coordinating extensively with States, to help provide a basis for formulating reasonable alternatives. The BLM described this process in its Report to the Secretary in response to SO 3353 (Aug. 4, 2017). Among other things, the Report describes how the BLM coordinated “with each State to gather information related to the [Secretary’s] Order, including State-specific issues and potential options for actions with respect to the 2015 GRSG Plans and IMs to identify opportunities to promote consistency with State plans.” (Report to the Secretary at 3.) This process overlapped to some degree with the BLM’s scoping process, which also assisted the BLM in identifying the scope of issues to be addressed and significant issues, and with coordination with the States occurring after the Report. In addition, as described in Draft EIS Chapter 3, the BLM determined that the current management situation is similar in condition to that assessed in 2015. 2.1.26 Travel and Transportation Management Summary: Travel plans should be part of the plan amendments. Response: Travel management planning is a crucial aspect in implementing land use plans. Ongoing travel management decisions in sage-grouse habitat are guided by the 2015 plans, with clarifications in the 2018 plan. Those BLM offices with travel plans in GRSG habitat would also conform with the goals and objectives, and planning decisions in these amendments. 2.1.27 Waivers, Exceptions, and Modifications Summary: The uncertainty with how waivers, exceptions, and modifications will be used introduces uncertainty to protections that aren’t fully analyzed. Criteria for the use of waivers, exceptions, and modifications should be more narrowly prescribed. Response: Under the Proposed Plan, waivers, exemptions and modifications would be granted only when meeting specific criteria designed to advance the management goals and objectives in the RMPs. BLM’s proposed plan balances the risk of uncertainty against the benefits of management flexibility when considering whether to grant a waiver, exception, or modification. Planning criteria identified for this amendment include consideration of how planning decisions may impact future listing determinations under the ESA. Summary: BLM should monitor the use of waivers, exceptions, and modifications. Response: BLM currently monitors and tracks disturbance in Greater Sage-Grouse habitats. Some BLM states, through the fluid minerals program, track waivers, exceptions, and modifications. The BLM is currently reviewing how to apply these best management practices at the national level. 2.2 UTAH-SPECIFIC COMMENT RESPONSES 2.2.1 Purpose and Need Summary: The Purpose and Need of the DEIS should be expanded in order to better align with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's 2015 "not warranted" decision. Response: The agency’s purpose of and need for this planning effort applies to the current situation, not the circumstances that existed in 2011 when greater sage-grouse was warranted for listing. The BLM’s intention is to build upon the 2015 plans by improving access and management flexibility by better aligning our management plans with the States’ management plans. The purpose and need reflects this intent consistent with the agency’s mission and Administration's priorities. Summary: The Purpose and Need Statement should clarify that the DEIS aims to incorporate updated science, research and local information and management practice, and to ensure, not only enhanced cooperation with the States, but also achieve consistency and coordination with State, Tribal and Local Governments' sage-grouse conservation and land use plans. Response: The Purpose and Need of the planning effort cites specifically to the FLPMA-specified roles of State agencies in managing non-listed wildlife species. It does not require complete alignment with state, local and tribal plans, since law and regulation requires consistency to the extent such “are also consistent with the purposes, policies, and programs of Federal laws and regulations” (43 CFR 1610.32). Language has been added to the purpose and need to recognize that some of the changes considered in the Draft EIS correspond to incorporating local research, which is also consistent with the State of Utah’s plans. Summary: The BLM's Purpose and Need for the Draft EIS is unreasonably narrow. Response: The agency’s purpose and need for considering these amendments was carefully drawn to promote alignment with the State’s plans and policies while satisfying the BLM’s responsibilities under FLPMA, other applicable laws, and BLM policy. This planning effort also builds off the comprehensive 2015 planning and NEPA process; incorporates the 2015 FEIS analysis by reference in its entirety, including its alternatives; and has been informed by a scoping process that has identified specific opportunities to improve alignment with state plans. Summary: The BLM has impermissibly defined the Purpose and Need based on project proponent objectives. Response: This planning and NEPA process does not respond to any project application submitted to the BLM. The BLM’s intention is to build upon the 2015 plans by improving access and management flexibility by better aligning our management plans with the States’ management plans. The purpose and need reflects this intent consistent with the agency’s mission and Administration's priorities. Further, there is no project proponent involved in this land use plan amendment. This planning process is in response to direction from the Secretary of the Interior, who, in Secretarial Order 3353, directed the BLM to “enhance cooperation between the Department of the Interior and the [State]...of Utah...in the management and conservation of the Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat.” Summary: BLM must clarify how Secretarial Orders, policy and other guidance relate to implementation of plan decisions. Response: BLM has ensured that this planning effort conforms with BLM policies, including all applicable Secretarial Orders (SOs), including SO 3353, issued on June 7, 2017, titled Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation and Cooperation with Western States. The plan amendment must be consistent with law, regulation, and policy, including the Secretarial Orders. Consistent with the BLM’s planning regulations, “all future resource management authorizations and actions...shall conform to the approved plan” (43 CFR 1610.5-3). 2.2.2 Criteria Summary: The new planning criteria does not include one of the criteria from the 2015 RMP: "maintaining the federal land management planning considerations to protect greater sage-grouse populations and habitats sufficiently so that the species does not warrant listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA)." Response: The determination of whether a species warrants listing under the Endangered Species Act is beyond the BLM’s jurisdiction, which is why that specific language was removed. The Fish and Wildlife Service makes listing determinations. However, the BLM’s 6840 manual identifies the BLM’s policy for Special Status Species Management, noting that “actions authorized by the BLM shall further the...conservation of Bureau sensitive species.” It also notes that BLM sensitive species “will be managed...to promote their conservation and to minimize the likelihood and need for listing under the ESA.” The Draft EIS planning criteria states “the RMPA/EIS will comply with BLM Manual 6840, Special Status Species Management,” thereby addressing this concept within the BLM’s jurisdiction and consistent with its policies. 2.2.3 Issues dismissed from detailed analysis Summary: The BLM should identify wild horses as a threat in the DEIS. Response: The 2015 FEIS evaluates threats from wild horses and corresponding management and impacts. As noted in section 1.2 of the 2018 DEIS, the purpose and need for this effort is to modify greater sage-grouse management “to better align with individual state plans…” Because management from the 2015 ARMPA is consistent with the state’s plan, considering changes to wild horse management is not consistent with the purpose of this effort, and is therefore not analyzed in detail. Summary: The Utah Plan does not provide adequate consideration of the issues and site-specific resource conditions. Response: RMP management actions cannot provide sufficient detail and analysis for every site-specific circumstance that arises during implementation. The proposed RMP actions provide the sufficient management framework to meet the goals and objectives while providing flexibility to account for local project and site-specific variability. Summary: The 2015 Plan and 2018 DEIS fail to address the impacts of predation and hunting. The BLM cannot rely on a narrow set of data to manage sage-grouse with regards to predation. Response: The BLM does not manage greater sage-grouse hunting and the BLM has limited jurisdiction regarding predation. The 2015 FEIS does address predation, to the extent the BLM has jurisdiction (see 2015 FEIS page 4-9 and Appendix M). The 2018 changes do not deviate from this analysis. As such, it is not addressed in detailed analysis. 2.2.4 Modifying Waivers, Exceptions, and Modifications of Fluid Minerals Determinations Summary: The DEIS should only apply the NSO stipulation in areas of occupied habitat within PHMA. Response: Oil and gas stipulations must be identified and mapped in the RMP so applicable stipulations can be appropriately applied to potential future leases. Absent a map that specifically identifies the areas of occupied habitat, the exception language in the RMP would accomplish the same purpose while being consistent with the BLM’s regulatory leasing requirements. While PHMA would be NSO at the lease stage, the exception language could allow for development within PHMA if an area is not habitat and the development would not indirectly affect adjacent greater sage-grouse seasonal habitats. Summary: The DEIS should clarify the criteria for allowing exceptions to NSOs, including adding a criterion to except the NSO if mitigation improves functional habitat. Response: The FEIS has been revised to clarify how the exception criteria would be applied. However, since mitigation would be entirely voluntary, allowing an exception to the NSO without corresponding habitat improvement would not be consistent with 43 CFR 3101.1-4, where an exception (a one-time waiver) can only be issued if “the factors leading to its inclusion in the lease have changed sufficiently to make the protection provided by the stipulation no longer justified or if proposed operations would not cause unacceptable impacts.” Since voluntary mitigation could not ensure such a condition, the regulatory criteria for an exception could not be met, therefore it was not included in the Proposed Plan. Summary: WEMs to lease stipulations should be narrowly applied and granted only under specific circumstances. Response: Under the proposed plan, waivers, exceptions, and modifications would be granted only when meeting specific criteria designed to advance the management goals and objectives in the RMPs. BLM’s proposed plan balances the risk of uncertainty against the benefits of management flexibility when considering whether to grant a WEM. Planning criteria identified for this amendment include consideration of how planning decisions may impact future listing determinations under the ESA. Summary: NSO stipulations must be restored as mandatory in sage-grouse habitat during leasing for energy development. Response: BLM leasing regulations at 43 CFR 3101.1-4 state that that an exception, waiver, or modification can be granted “only if the authorized officer determines that the factors leading to its inclusion in the lease have changed sufficiently to make the protection provided by the stipulation no longer justified or if proposed operations would not cause unacceptable impacts.” Consistent with regulation, the exception criteria provide for consideration of site-specific conditions that must be present at the site-level in order for the exception to be considered while still providing for protection of greater sage-grouse. Summary: The BLM should track boundary adjustments, WEMs requested and those granted, and provide this information to the public. Response: The BLM will comply with 43 CFR 3101.1-4 regarding public notification of waivers, exceptions, or modifications, which includes a 30-day public notification period when applicable. An exception is a limited type of waiver and therefore is subject to 43 CFR 3101.1-4. 2.2.5 Sagebrush Focal Area (SFA) Designations Summary: The BLM should remove SFAs from the EIS as they fail to address the major threats to sage-grouse and do not contribute to the long-term conservation of Utah sage-grouse. The BLM should maintain SFAs in order to achieve conservation goals. SFAs are no longer relevant in Utah due to the cancellation of limiting mineral withdrawal on federal lands. The BLM must evaluate the benefits of maintaining SFAs and maintaining range management measures associated with SFA designations. Response: The Draft EIS considers two alternatives: The No Action alternative, which analyzes impacts if the SFAs remain in the plan, and the Management Alignment Alternative that does not include SFAs. The analysis of impacts of regulatory changes to sage-grouse in Chapter 4 of the EIS describes that management actions in the Management Alignment Alternative would protect the species, and obtain conservation goals, in the absence of SFAs. BLM is focused on aligning our management with the states. BLM’s goal is to achieve promote consistency and alignment with each State’s management for Greater Sage-Grouse. Where BLM has increased its management flexibility, it has done so to improve alignment with the state plans and based on local information. BLM has determined that SFA designations provide a redundant layer of resource protection and land use prioritization within PHMA and is acting within its discretion to remove SFA designation. Further, the BLM canceled the proposed withdrawal of SFAs through a publication in the Federal Register on October 11, 2017 (82 Fed. Reg. 47,248) and findings in the SFA EIS noted that there was broadly low potential for locatable minerals within the recommended withdrawal area, so the withdrawal would not have provided additional protection to Greater Sage-Grouse. Summary: Eliminating SFAs in select states may conflict with the BLM’s goal of maintaining a landscape-scale approach to sage-grouse management. Response: The BLM does not have an overarching goal of maintaining a landscape-scale approach to sage-grouse management. Consistent with the BLM’s Special Status Species Management policy, “Bureau sensitive species will be managed...to promote their conservation and to minimize the likelihood and need for listing under the [Endangered Species Act]” (BLM-M-6840 section .06). This is accomplished through species and habitat management objectives in land use plans. The cumulative effects analysis does consider the effects of the proposed changes to the land use plans by addressing past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future impacts on greater sage-grouse and its habitat at the rangewide scale, as well as at the scale of Management Zone identified by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. Summary: The BLM must reconsider whether the SFA designations were made with sufficient opportunity for public comment, and allow for additional public comment if warranted. Response: As part of this land use planning process, which makes determinations on SFA designations, the BLM provided the public 90 days to review and comment on the analysis in the 2015 Final EIS, as well as the 2018 Draft EIS, consistent with the regulations found at 40 CFR 1506.6 and 6.203. 2.2.6 Disturbance and Density Caps Summary: The BLM’s established date for counting disturbance is arbitrary and capricious. The BLM should not count disturbances from before the plans approval. Response: Extensive research has indicated that greater sage-grouse are sensitive to disturbances (see 2015 Final EIS impact analysis for Greater Sage-Grouse for extensive descriptions). The variable is the presence of disturbance, not the age of disturbance. As such, there is no specific date for when disturbance begins counting or stops counting. Disturbance inventories include existing disturbance regardless of when it was generated. Moreover, the disturbance inventory is not intended to show all areas disturbed throughout history, but rather areas that are currently disturbed and have not yet been restored. Impacts from the disturbance did not begin when the 2015 plans were finalized. As such, in order to meet the goal of maintaining and/or increasing Greater Sage-Grouse abundance and distribution, the existing condition of disturbance on the landscape must be taken into account when considering future actions. Summary: The BLM should disclose uncertainties associated with existing disturbance. Response: Appendix E and Chapter 3 of the 2018 Draft EIS both address the concept of using the best available information when calculating the disturbance cap. Appendix E notes that “locally collected disturbance data will be used to determine if the disturbance cap has been exceeded…” Chapter 3 of the 2018 Draft EIS notes that “since 2015, the disturbance inventory has been refined in several areas…” It also notes that “as disturbance data was refined with on-the-ground knowledge, the amount of disturbance was less than the amount identified from the coarser-scale data due to the removal of disturbances that were being double counted.” As more specific information continues to be collected at the site-level, the disturbance inventory will be maintained to ensure that the best available data will always be used when determining plan conformance. Summary: The BLM should enter into government to government coordination with Garfield County regarding disturbance cap criteria and wildlife habitat value for areas identified in PHMAs. Response: Garfield County is a cooperating agency. The government-to-government relationship is a specific political and legal relationship that the United States Government has with American Indian Tribes, not counties or other local governments. Counties have been involved as cooperating agencies in the NEPA process where they have jurisdiction by law or special expertise, enabling closer consultation and privileged status. Further, BLM has solicited input from the counties during scoping, preparation of the Draft EIS, and in the comment period on the proposed sage-grouse amendments. Local government positions were considered in the development of the proposed action, but are not guaranteed to be consistent with federal management, where state management supersedes local policy (43 CFR 1610.3-2(d)). Summary: The DEIS fails to list a number of disturbances that negatively affect sage grouse populations, and should be modified to include these disturbances. Response: The BLM considered the full array of threats that affect greater sage-grouse, but no one management tool was deemed the only one necessary to address every threat. The 2015 Plans included in the disturbance cap those specific developments identified in the Fish and Wildlife Service’s listing determination as discrete threats to greater sage-grouse to be addressed by the disturbance cap. However, the disturbance cap is not the only management tool to address all threats to greater sage-grouse. Table E-1 in Appendix E lists three categories of threats; the disturbance cap is designed to address only one of those categories. Other threats are addressed through other managerial tools (e.g., noise and tall structure stipulations; fire prevention, suppression and restoration; habitat improvements to reduce conifer encroachment and invasive species). Summary: The BLM’s 3% disturbance cap is inconsistent with the State’s 5% disturbance cap. Response: The BLM plan does currently have an inconsistency with the State’s Conservation Plan in that it has a 3 percent disturbance cap rather than a 5 percent disturbance cap. However, after close coordination with the state over the past three years, the apparent differences are not as simple as two percentage points. While there is a difference in the percentage, there is also a difference in what is counted under each cap. The BLM includes the specific items identified Appendix E in Table E-1 and Table E-2. When considering these, the BLM includes the actual footprint of disturbance. However, the State’s plan includes a 5% disturbance cap in which it includes “any ground disturbing activity, event or action, natural or human-caused, that will either eliminate or render greater sage-grouse habitat not usable” (Conservation Plan for Greater Sage-Grouse in Utah, 2013, section 10.3.1). Further, the State’s plan counts both the footprint of disturbance and the area “where effects of the project...could be expected to cause a disturbance.” As such, while the BLM’s cap is 3 percent, it is limited to a smaller list of activities and is limited to the direct footprint while the State’s 5 percent includes a larger list of potential impacts as well as their indirect effects. As such, while differences exist, during implementation the two approaches are much closer to conditions on the ground. Recognizing this, the BLM has been coordinating with the State of Utah to develop more consistent strategies to improve alignment of the two processes during implementation. Summary: The BLM should specify who is in the technical team. Response: MA-SSS-3B contains language specifically identifying the type of skill-sets that must be on the technical team. Identifying actual personnel in an RMP overlooks the fact that each office would have a different team and over time, staff changes would require further adjustments. The list of positions needed for the team has been clarified in the Final EIS. Summary: The BLM should specify that the disturbance cap MA-SSS-3C can also be exceeded like MASSS-3B. Response: As noted in the Draft EIS on page 2-12, MA-SSS-3C specifically notes that the density cap may be exceeded if “the process identified in MA-SSS-3B determines the project will improve the condition of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat through analysis of site-specific Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and population information and project design elements.” This language has been edited in the Final EIS to more clearly note the exception applies to both the disturbance cap and the density cap. Summary: The BLM should include a time frame requirement for analysis of restoration in disturbed sage-grouse habitat. Response: The request for a time frame requirement for restoration of disturbances is not practical nor ecologically possible. Not every disturbance will have the same project life. For example, a pipeline may be a single year of disturbance followed by restoration where a oil/gas well may have a life of 20 years before it is plugged and restored. Further, areas that are at higher elevations with more precipitation and faster growing mountain sage would have far quicker restoration rates than lower elevation and drier Wyoming sagebrush stands. For these reasons, the RMP amendment cannot set a standard time frame. However, language has been added to the Final EIS that a schedule be included in project authorizations to monitor disturbances and the status of associated restoration efforts. Summary: The BLM should clarify the locations of where density caps may be exceeded. Response: There are not specific portions of PHMA where the density cap may be exceeded compared to other areas where it may not be exceeded. However, as noted in the Draft EIS on page 2-12, MASSS-3C specifically notes that the density cap may be exceeded if “the process identified in MA-SSS-3B determines the project will improve the condition of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat through analysis of site-specific Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and population information and project design elements.” This language has been edited in the Final EIS to more clearly note the exception applies to both the disturbance cap and the density cap. Summary: The BLM should consider landscape-scale conservation needs prior to any reduction of disturbance or density caps. Response: As noted in Final EIS actions MA-SSS-3B and MA-SSS-3C, the disturbance and density caps could only be exceeded where “site-specific Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and population information, combined with project design elements indicates the project will improve the condition of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat within the proposed project analysis area or within the PHMA in the population area where the project is located.” As such, the site-specific documentation necessary before the caps could be exceeded would include either the area of immediate effect (project area) or the broader PHMA associated with the sage-grouse population. Summary: Disturbance and density caps fail to realistically measure actual wildlife habitat. Response: The purpose of the disturbance and density caps is not to measure wildlife habitat, but to manage disturbance in PHMA at a level that will help meet the goal to maintain and/or increase greater sage-grouse abundance and distribution. Appendix E clearly notes that the denominator portion of the percentage calculation consists of “all lands classified as PHMA within the analysis area” and does not exclude areas that are not greater sage-grouse seasonal habitats. As noted in the Appendix, “information regarding [greater sage-grouse] seasonal habitats, sagebrush availability, and areas with the potential to support [greater sage-grouse] populations will be considered along with other local conditions that may affect [greater sage-grouse] during the analysis of the proposed project area.” However, such analysis is separate from application of the disturbance and density caps. Summary: The BLM should allow exceedance of the 3 percent disturbance cap if the project will improve the condition of sage-grouse habitat within the proposed project analysis area or within the PHMA where the project is located. Response: Exceedance of the disturbance and density caps is allowed as described in MA-SSS-3B and MA-SSS-3C. Response: Any technical team should include state technical experts. Response: MA-SSS-3B contains language specifically identifying the type of skill-sets that must be on the technical team. This includes “biologists and other representatives from the appropriate State of Utah agency.” Summary: The BLM should reevaluate the prescriptive recommendations presented in the 2011 NTT. Response: The purpose of this planning effort is not to reevaluate the recommendations from the 2011 NTT Report, COT Report, or even the actions from the 2015 Plan Amendment. As required by Secretarial Order 3353 and as described in Chapter 1 of the Draft EIS, the purpose of this planning effort is to modify “the approach to Greater Sage-Grouse management in existing land use plans to better align with individual state plans.” As such, reevaluating recommendations from the NTT report is outside the scope of this planning effort. Summary: The BLM should clarify what constitutes habitat improvement and how much improvement is required before exceedance of disturbance and density caps will be allowed. Response: The Draft EIS provides sufficient guidance that the proposed project, in combination with siting, minimization measures, and mitigation, will result in an improved condition for greater sage-grouse habitat than prior to the project. Habitat improvements could be made in an area so that it would fall more inline with Objective SSS-3 or so areas that are not habitat due to conifer encroachment become habitat. Habitat improvement is defined in terms of restoration of formerly unsuitable habitat to habitat of similar quality to that being impacted. This improvement would likely be as described in Chapter 4 Section 4.6.4 “that could change vegetation conditions in the project area to shift away from a landscape more dominated by trees to one more dominated by grasses and shrubs that is conducive to Greater Sage-Grouse habitat.” The amount of improvement required is defined on a case-by-case basis based on what is necessary to replace residual impacts after avoidance and minimization measures have been applied. As such, each instance of improvement cannot be fully detailed at the land use planning level. Summary: Disturbance at project locations should not exceed 3% (or 1 well pad per section), to maintain existing habitat functionality. Response: The Management Alignment Alternative retains the 3% disturbance cap, as well as the density cap of 1 facility per section, and only allows for exceedances of these restrictions where there is reasonable evidence that doing so will have, on balance, a benefit to habitat. Although this introduces the potential for localized impacts to the species, functional habitat available to the population will be maintained. 2.2.7 Habitat Objectives Summary: The BLM should revise the habitat objectives tables to better account for local conditions and site variability. Response: BLM has incorporated locally based research from Utah State University to identify GRSG habitat objectives that are specific to Utah. The updated numbers are based on extensive data documenting vegetation conditions where greater sage-grouse are actually using the landscape for various seasonal habitats. The habitat objectives table references levels several times to an objective should be applied “where appropriate, relative to ecological site potential” to incorporate flexibility in the prescription of the objectives that take into account the local conditions and site variability. Summary: Habitat objectives relating to sagebrush cover should be based on adequate scientific support. Response: BLM’s habitat objectives reflect the best available information defining habitat conditions that sage-grouse preferentially select. The USGS report confirms BLM’s assumption that such understanding may change over time. BLM has developed flexibility in the plans to modify seasonal habitat objectives based on new science or site-specific information. Summary: The BLM should incorporate sage grouse habitat objectives and management considerations into all BLM grazing allotments through AMPs or permit renewals within priority sage-grouse habitat. Response: The RMP objectives for greater sage-grouse may inform the wildlife component on the Land Health Standard evaluation process, but they categorically do not replace the rangeland health assessments. The indicators and desired conditions in the habitat objectives table are to only be used to assess habitat suitability for greater sage-grouse, and to evaluate land use plan effectiveness for sage-grouse conservation. Grazing allotments will continue to be managed according to the 43 CFR 4100 regulations. As described in the regulations, if an area is not meeting Land Health Standards then the causal factor(s) will be determined and addressed. Summary: The BLM should rename the different zones of habitat in the EIS to provide clarification to the public. Response: For clarification purposes the BLM has renamed the different zones associated with the habitat objectives to High, Medium and Low in the 2018 FEIS. Summary: The vegetation objectives lack support and are contradictory. Response: The vegetation objectives and associated habitat objectives tables were developed using associated scientific research that more closely aligns to known sage-grouse habitat and habitat requirements for Utah sage-grouse based on local research and data. Summary: The BLM incorrectly uses the habitat objectives in the DEIS as standards. Response: The RMP objectives for greater sage-grouse may inform the wildlife component on the Land Health Standard evaluation process, but they categorically do not replace the rangeland health assessments. The indicators and desired conditions in the habitat objectives table are to only be used to assess habitat suitability for greater sage-grouse, and to evaluate land use plan effectiveness for sage-grouse conservation. Grazing allotments will continue to be managed according to the 43 CFR 4100 regulations. Summary: The BLM should prioritize vegetation management and restoration of sage-grouse habitat. Response: The vegetation management actions from the 2015 Plan Amendment were consistent with the State of Utah’s sage-grouse plans. Because the purpose of this planning effort is to increase alignment with the state plans, no additional changes were needed or proposed in the 2018 Draft EIS, and the vegetation management actions are carried forward, unchanged. Summary: The BLM’s use of HAF and AIM protocols do not address monitoring needs for the RMPA. Response: BLM already has existing policies and regulations outside of this planning effort that address monitoring needs for the RMPA. AIM and HAF are additional tools to help assist BLM managers when making determinations regarding habitat suitability and to evaluate land use plan effectiveness. 2.2.8 Adaptive Management Summary: The BLM should modify triggers in order to better capture significant population changes in sage-grouse numbers. Response: Based on its review of the best available science, the BLM identified the adaptive management triggers in the 2015 Final EIS. As described in Appendix I (see page I-1), these triggers reflect the expertise from a multi-agency team of State and Federal biologists who reviewed decades of monitoring data and determined what “population and habitat triggers are appropriate given the natural cyclic variability observed in greater sage-grouse populations.” These triggers were designed to be sufficiently responsive to population changes to allow for early and effective management response, but not so sensitive as to prompt an undue response to natural fluctuations. Further, because the BLM developed the triggers in close coordination with the State of Utah who has managerial jurisdiction over the species, they are not inconsistent with the State’s plans, and as such do not need to be changed to improve alignment as part of this effort. Finally, the threshold for significant changes were not evaluated in detail in this EIS, but instead the difference in the impacts among alternatives, irrespective of significance, is the central concern of the analysis. The BLM is responsible for making an informed decisions with respect to determining what constitutes a reasonable threshold. The comment does not clearly or convincingly show that BLM failed to consider relevant information or that its conclusion is in error. Summary: The BLM should identify what conservation measures will be applied when soft-triggers are tripped and include a monitoring requirement. Response: In regards to addressing conservation measures for soft-trigger threats, the BLM has purposefully retained flexibility in their ability to respond to threats by not identifying specific management reponses. Because soft triggers may be due to natural fluctuations, establishing set responses is premature until the cause of the trigger is identified. However, pages I-7 and I-8 of Appendix I includes a list of potential management actions that could be applied if a “soft trigger” is identified. Summary: The BLM should maintain, but not limit, hard and soft trigger adaptive management provisions. Response: Because the BLM developed the adaptive management triggers in close coordination with the State of Utah, who has managerial jurisdiction over the species, they are not inconsistent with the State’s plans, and as such do not need to be changed to improve alignment as part of this effort. However, over the process of implementing the 2015 Plan Amendment, several issues were identified in coordination with the State to improve the processes and alignment of monitoring and managing populations that trip a trigger. As described The deviations between adaptive management under the 2015 and the 2018 Amendments are not expected to result in material changes to the overall impacts to the species, as discussed in Chapter 4 (Table 4-2 on page 4-14 and in the Cumulative Impacts section for sage-grouse (Chapter 4, Section 4-7, page 4-50). Summary: The BLM should provide the opportunity for public involvement and engagement in the decision process to modify the adaptive management strategy. Response: The changes to the adaptive management strategy considered in the 2018 Draft EIS were available for a 90-day comment period. In relation to the BLM’s revisions to to IM-2018-022, there is no requirement for public involvement when changing or issuing instruction memorandums. While implementing the RMP, the BLM will comply with all public involvement requirements. Summary: The Final EIS should include a monitoring framework plan, and include the actions to be taken in the event that trigger deadlines are not met. Response: As identified on page I-8 of Appendix I, if a causal factor analysis is not completed within six months of identifying a tripped trigger, then all the plan level responses identified in Table I-1 will be applied until a causal factor analysis can be completed. Additionally, the Monitoring Framework from the 2015 Plan Amendment is not changing as part of this process and is still being implemented. 2.2.9 General Habitat Management Areas Summary: The BLM should include language clarifying what management actions and allocations would result in the event of an “untrigger” in the Sheeprocks area, since the Proposed Plan no longer maintains GHMA. Response: The Draft EIS Appendix I does not define adaptive management of the Sheeprocks area in terms of PHMA or GHMA, just in terms of what areas would be managed as PHMA. In the event of a hard trigger, PHMA would align with the boundaries from Alternative B in the 2015 Final EIS. As noted on page I-11, in the event the area’s sage-grouse population recovers, “management would revert to the RMPA,” meaning PHMA boundaries would return to those identified in the 2015 ARMPA. Management of the areas outside these PHMA boundaries would follow what is in the RMP at that time. Summary: The data promoting GHMAs for the purposes of gene-flow and connectivity is unsupported by the best-available science and local data. Response: The BLM reviewed the best available science and finds that while some research identifies the potential for connectivity through GHMA rangewide, based on state-specific data, the foreseeable gene-flow impact of removing GHMA decisions in Utah does not present an obvious risk to species persistence that warrants additional analysis of GHMA beyond that in the draft EIS. The BLM has added an appendix to the FEIS that summarizes key considerations associated with GHMA areas from the 2015 ARMPA. Of the mapped GHMA in the 2015 ARMPA, the BLM has no jurisdiction over 66% of it, including the areas most likely to provide connectivity between populations (South Slope area of the Uintah population). Other areas of GHMA are on the periphery of populations with extensive geographical or human-barriers impeding movement between populations. For example, approximately 17% of mapped GHMA in the No Action Alternative is in the Sheeprocks population area, less than 23% of which is administered by the BLM. There are no leks in that GHMA. Only 1% of the GHMA has any modeled seasonal habitat. Any natural moving bird would need to cross the Great Salt Lake, West Desert, or Utah Valley and the Wasatch Mountains to connect to another population. The area’s sage-grouse population has been augmented by transplants from other populations in the state. In some areas, the presence of GHMA does nothing to maintain connectivity. The Uintah Population Area includes over 55% of the mapped GHMA in the No Action Alternative, less than 38% of which is administered by the BLM. Most of it is in the South Slope Population of West Tavaputs, which is either privately owned or within the Ute Indian Tribe Reservation. The areas on the east and southeast of the Uintah Basin only have four occupied leks and are heavily impacted by existing oil and gas development, with most of the GHMA in this area already exceeding well density that would maintain a long-term population of sage-grouse. As noted in the Draft EIS, given these various circumstances there is no longterm difference in sage-grouse conservation between retaining or removing GHMA. Summary: Eliminating GHMAs will eliminate habitat connectivity options, and decrease habitat improvement and enhancement opportunities. Response: The BLM reviewed the best available science and finds that while some research identifies the potential for connectivity through GHMA rangewide, based on state-specific data, the foreseeable gene-flow impact of removing GHMA decisions in Utah does not present an obvious risk to species persistence that warrants additional analysis of GHMA beyond that in the draft EIS. The BLM has added an appendix to the FEIS that summarizes key considerations associated with GHMA areas from the 2015 ARMPA. Of the mapped GHMA in the 2015 ARMPA, the BLM has no jurisdiction over 66% of it, including the areas most likely to provide connectivity between populations (South Slope area of the Uintah population). Other areas of GHMA are on the periphery of populations with extensive geographical or human-barriers impeding movement between populations. For example, approximately 17% of mapped GHMA in the No Action Alternative is in the Sheeprocks population area, less than 23% of which is administered by the BLM. There are no leks in that GHMA. Only 1% of the GHMA has any modeled seasonal habitat. Any natural moving bird would need to cross the Great Salt Lake, West Desert, or Utah Valley and the Wasatch Mountains to connect to another population. The area’s sage-grouse population has been augmented by transplants from other populations in the state. In some areas, the presence of GHMA does nothing to maintain connectivity. The Uintah Population Area includes over 55% of the mapped GHMA in the No Action Alternative, less than 38% of which is administered by the BLM. Most of it is in the South Slope Population of West Tavaputs, which is either privately owned or within the Ute Indian Tribe Reservation. The areas on the east and southeast of the Uintah Basin only have four occupied leks and are heavily impacted by existing oil and gas development, with most of the GHMA in this area already exceeding well density that would maintain a long-term population of sage-grouse. As noted in the Draft EIS, given these various circumstances there is no longterm difference in sage-grouse conservation between retaining or removing GHMA. Summary: The BLM should clarify the definition of the term “occupied habitat” and clearly indicate that mitigation of former GHMAs is not required. Response: Despite the managerial and biological problems with GHMA, there are still areas outside of PHMA with existing sage-grouse populations and with mapped seasonal habitats. Given this existing condition, the BLM’s Special Status Species policy, described in BLM Manual 6840, would apply. Section .2-C of the manual notes that “the BLM shall manage Bureau sensitive species and their habitats to minimize or eliminate threats affecting the status of the species or to improve the condition of the species habitat.” The BLM’s planning regulations require that BLM be consistent with state, local and tribal plans so long as they are consistent with the “purposes, policies and programs of Federal laws and regulations…” (43 CFR 1610.3-2). Management of occupied greater sage-grouse habitats outside PHMA has been clarified in the Final EIS has been clarified to be consistent with the BLM’s special status species manual, and mitigation policies. Summary: Seasonal habitats not included in priority areas should receive protection. Response: As noted in the DEIS chapter 3, Figures 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 “do not reflect occupied seasonal habitats, but areas with vegetation characteristics similar to areas where” collared birds have used elsewhere in the state. Reintroducing birds into currently unoccupied habitats has had a very poor success rate. As such, managing areas with potentially suitable, but unoccupied habitat would be of very limited value in long-term sage-grouse conservation efforts. Therefore, protecting unoccupied potentially suitable habitat outside PHMA would not be consistent with either BLM policy or state plans, and is therefore outside of the scope of this analysis. Summary: The BLM should maintain GHMAs, as GHMAs contain a significant amount of sage-grouse breeding, summer, and winter habitat. Response: As noted in the DEIS chapter 3, Figures 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 “do not reflect occupied seasonal habitats, but areas with vegetation characteristics similar to areas where” collared birds have used elsewhere in the state. Reintroducing birds into currently unoccupied habitats has had a very poor success rate. As such, managing areas with potentially suitable, but unoccupied habitat would be of very limited value in long-term sage-grouse conservation efforts. Therefore, protecting unoccupied potentially suitable habitat outside PHMA would not be consistent with either BLM policy or state plans, and is therefore outside of the scope of this analysis. Summary: Elimination of the GHMAs will have a significant and disproportionate impact on Utah. Response: As noted in the Draft EIS, nearly 96% of greater sage-grouse populations are in PHMAs. Of the 4% of sage-grouse populations outside PHMA’s, most use leks that are not affected by BLM management, such as those on Tribal lands in the South Slope area of the Uinta Mountains, or on private lands in the Morgan/Summit area. Based on this context and intensity of analyzed impacts, significant impacts from eliminating the GHMA classification are not anticipated. No new information has been provided by the commenter that would change this determination. Removing GHMA is being evaluated as a potential way to better align federal management with that of the state, consistent with BLM planning law and regulations. Summary: The BLM should evaluate the potential value of GHMAs to contribute to sage-grouse conservation prior to elimination of these areas. Response: The Draft EIS presents information on the best available science and modeling in managing greater sage-grouse in Utah, including management actions for the habitats needed to achieve management goals. With this information, the BLM evaluated the potential impacts of changing management to greater sage-grouse as part of investigating the potential to better align federal management with the state, including retaining or removing GHMA. Most of the GHMA areas are either not administered by the BLM, are isolated patches of habitat surrounded by non-habitat, or are heavily impact by existing development. In all these instances, retaining GHMA would not change the conservation value associated with the conditions currently present on-the-ground. Summary: The BLM can use GHMAs for compensatory mitigation offsets and restoring degraded habitat. Response: The BLM gave GHMA a lower priority than PHMA because GHMA included areas that were poor quality, already highly impacted by resource activity, or isolated, thus not likely to provide areas for habitat improvement or connectivity between greater sage-grouse populations. As noted in the Draft EIS chapter 1, PHMA includes high-quality habitat, but also may include “areas with poor or potential habitat” (see page 1-3). PHMA boundaries do not only include high-quality habitat, but were designed to manage entire populations and the various seasonal habitats. This includes areas where habitat could be improved and created, resulting in ample opportunities to create or improve habitat within PHMA, as indicated by treatment objectives from the 2015 ARMPA (see Objective SSS-4). 2.2.10 Exceptions/Variances from Non-Fluid Mineral Sage-Grouse Restrictions Summary: The BLM should clarify ecological threshold elements in MA-SSS-1. Response: The Final EIS has been modified with citations to clarify for BLM managers considerations to be taken while applying MA-SSS-1. Summary: The BLM should close loopholes and remove exceptions. Response: Under the Proposed Plan, exceptions could be considered only when meeting specific criteria designed to advance the management goals and objectives in the RMPs. BLM’s proposed plan balances the risk of uncertainty against the benefits of management flexibility when considering whether to grant an exception. Prior to granting any exception, the authorized officer must identify that the criteria have been met and that the RMP goal for sage-grouse would still be met. 2.2.11 Prioritization Summary: The removal of mineral leasing prioritization will ensure alignment with the State’s Conservation Plan. Response: As noted in section 1.2 of the DEIS, the purpose for this planning effort is to modify greater sage-grouse management “to better align with individual state plans,” not to maintain range-wide consistency in sage-grouse management. The State of Utah’s sage-grouse plan does not have any similar objective or action prioritizing leasing outside of their Sage-Grouse Management Areas, which is consistent with the Management Alignment Alternative that considered removing the objective that prioritized leasing outside PHMA and GHMA. Summary: Eliminating the prioritization of mineral leasing requirement in select states conflicts with the BLM’s goal of maintaining a rangewide conservation program. Response: As noted in section 1.2 of the DEIS, the purpose for this planning effort is to modify greater sage-grouse management “to better align with individual state plans,” not to maintain range-wide consistency in sage-grouse management. The State of Utah’s sage-grouse plan does not have any similar objective or action prioritizing leasing outside of their Sage-Grouse Management Areas, which is consistent with the Management Alignment Alternative that considered removing the objective that prioritized leasing outside PHMA and GHMA. Summary: The BLM should retain the objective to prioritize leasing outside of PHMA and GHMA, using various criteria to minimize impacts to greater sage-grouse. Response: Appendix C in the BLM’s planning handbook (BLM-1601-1) identifies land use planning decisions for fluid minerals. A land use plan is to identify, “consistent with the goals and objectives for natural resources,” areas that are 1) open to leasing subject to the terms and conditions of the standard lease form; 2) open to leasing subject to moderate constraints such as seasonal and controlled use restrictions; 3) open to leasing subject to major constraints such as no-surface-occupancy (NSO); 4) closed to leasing. The handbook also notes, similar to language from the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, that “when applying leasing restrictions, the least restrictive constraint to meet the resource protection objective should be used” (BLM-1601-1 Appendix C page 24). The 2015 ARMPA identified PHMA as open to leasing, subject to NSO stipulations. However, the combination of the "open to leasing subject to NSO" stipulation and the "prioritize leasing outside PHMA and GHMA" has created a situation that has been confusing to the public over whether PHMA is open for leasing or not, and with what stipulations. Additionally, the analysis in the DEIS Chapters 3 and 4 shows that prioritization can be eliminated while still maintaining sufficient protections for the greater sage-grouse. Finally, prioritization is an implementation-level tool that the BLM uses to manage staff and budget resources. With the removal of the objective, the plan language is more consistent with BLM planning guidance, as well as more consistent with State, local and Tribal plans. Summary: The DEIS does not consider the impacts of the IMs Before the BLM changes the RMPs, they should change the IMs and implement the plans as currently written. Response: BLM instruction memorandum are not RMP decisions and are not subject to revision of analysis in this effort. 2.2.12 Land Disposal and Exchange Summary: It can be difficult under the standards proposed by BLM to determine if land disposal "will compromise" sage-grouse persistence, or have "no direct or indirect impact" on populations. Retaining habitat in federal ownership helps ensure the land will be managed as prescribed in the BLM land use plans, providing certainty. Response: The BLM’s policy for special status species management allows for consideration of land disposals upon determination that such actions are consistent with relevant law and if such actions minimize the likelihood and need for listing under the Endangered Species Act. The BLM’s criteria for land tenure decisions establish a sufficiently clear standard to outline the conditions that must be met before any land tenure/disposal may be approved so as to not materially contribute to declines of sage-grouse populations within PHMA. 2.2.13 Burial of Transmission Lines Summary: Sage-grouse instinctively steer away from tall structures, like above-ground transmission lines. The BLM should allow flexibility in determining whether to bury transmission lines by allowing local managers to evaluate site-scale impacts and minimize sage-grouse habitat impacts at the project level. Response: Regardless of the proposed changes to MA-LR-2 and MA-LR-5, the remaining management in those actions would be unchanged. Nothing in the Draft EIS would change the fact that PHMA is still an avoidance area for rights of way (MA-LR-2), or that the first order of management for transmission lines must be to avoid PHMA, or locate them in designated corridors. Other minimization methods, including tall structure restrictions (MA-SSS-3F), buffers (MA-SSS-3H), required design features (MASSS-3I) would be retained. Additionally, consideration of burial as a minimization tool is still specifically allowed but would no longer be a required under the Management Alignment Alternative, since in some cases requiring burial could result in more impact to sage-grouse habitat than the presence of an aboveground transmission line. These impacts are discussed on page 4-20 of the Draft EIS. 2.2.14 Habitat Management Area Boundaries Summary: BLM fails to recognize the amount of habitat restoration efforts that have occured on the ground in relation to the 2015 FEIS. Response: BLM recognizes that at a site scale or at a PHMA/population level there are areas that have seen an increase in the availability of greater sage-grouse habitat due to restoration efforts that have occurred on the ground. Chapter 3, Table 3-6 notes that conifer has been removed on over 140,000 acres since 2015, in addition to several other treatment types. However, for the purposes of the 2018 DEIS, the extent of those changes when viewed at a landscape level are relatively minor in scope (less than 4% of PHMA/GHMA) and would not significantly affect the results of the analysis completed for the 2018 DEIS. 2.2.15 Mitigation Summary: The full suite of mitigation options, including compensatory mitigation, must be available to conserve sage-grouse habitat and populations necessary to avoid a future listing under the ESA. Response: BLM’s Proposed Plan balances the risk of uncertainty against the benefits of management flexibility when considering mitigation strategies. The BLM is committed to applying and enforcing the mitigation hierarchy of actions to avoid, minimize, and otherwise mitigate impacts to the extent that federal law allows. A principal component of GRSG management is the implementation of mitigation actions to ameliorate the threats and impacts to sage grouse and its habitats. The Proposed Plan clarifies how voluntary compensatory mitigation should be considered in the management of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and how BLM will work with each state management agency to implement its compensatory mitigation strategy. Summary: The net-conservation mitigation standard is an unlawful extension of the BLM’s authority pursuant to FLPMA and should be eliminated. Response: Following extensive review of FLPMA, including existing regulations, orders, policies, and guidance, the BLM has concluded that FLPMA does not explicitly mandate or authorize the BLM to require public land users to implement compensatory mitigation to offset environmental effects beyond the proponents level of impact. The Proposed Plan seeks to clarify that the mitigation standard applies not at the project level, but rather as a planning-level goal and objective unless specifically required under a state management authority. The BLM is pursuing agreements with the States of Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming to clarify how BLM, project proponents, and state management agencies will collaborate to implement a State’s compensatory mitigation plan. Summary: NEPA does not authorize or require mitigation of impacts. Response: BLM’s Proposed Plan balances the risk of uncertainty against the benefits of management flexibility when considering mitigation strategies. Following extensive review of FLPMA, including existing regulations, orders, policies, and guidance, the BLM has concluded that FLPMA does not explicitly mandate or authorize the BLM to require public land users to implement compensatory mitigation as a condition of obtaining authorization for the use of the public lands (IM 2018-093, Compensatory Mitigation, July 24, 2018). However, the BLM is committed to applying and enforcing the mitigation hierarchy of actions to avoid, minimize, and otherwise mitigate impacts to the extent that federal law allows. A principal component of GRSG management is the implementation of mitigation actions to ameliorate the threats and impacts to sage grouse and its habitats. The Proposed Plan clarifies how voluntary compensatory mitigation should be considered in the management of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and how BLM will work with each state management agency to implement its compensatory mitigation strategy. Summary: The BLM cannot rely on Manual 6840 to impose mitigation standards. Response: BLM’s Proposed Plan balances the risk of uncertainty against the benefits of management flexibility when considering mitigation strategies. Following extensive review of FLPMA, including existing regulations, orders, policies, and guidance, the BLM has concluded that FLPMA does not explicitly mandate or authorize the BLM to require public land users to implement compensatory mitigation as a condition of obtaining authorization for the use of the public lands (IM 2018-093, Compensatory Mitigation, July 24, 2018). However, the BLM is committed to applying and enforcing the mitigation hierarchy of actions to avoid, minimize, and otherwise mitigate impacts to the extent that federal law allows. A principal component of GRSG management is the implementation of mitigation actions to ameliorate the threats and impacts to sage grouse and its habitats. The Proposed Plan clarifies how voluntary compensatory mitigation should be considered in the management of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and how BLM will work with each state management agency to implement its compensatory mitigation strategy. The BLM’s Special Status Species Management manual describes the agency’s policy for management sensitive species as follows: “Bureau sensitive species will be managed consistent with species and habitat management objectives in land use and implementation plans to promote their conservation and to minimize the likelihood and need for listing under the ESA” (BLM-M-6840, section .06 -Policy). The manual later notes specifically that “the BLM shall manage Bureau sensitive species and their habitats to minimize or eliminate threats affecting the status of the species or to improve the condition of the species habitat” (Section .2 -Administration of Bureau Sensitive Species, subsection C). Summary: The BLM should maintain the net conservation gain standard; a no net loss of habitat only prevents additional habitat loss and is not adequate to achieve long-term conservation of sage-grouse. Response: The net conservation gain mitigation standard was analyzed as part of the No Action Alternative in the Draft EIS. Following extensive review of FLPMA, including existing regulations, orders, policies, and guidance, the BLM has concluded that FLPMA does not explicitly mandate or authorize the BLM to require public land users to implement compensatory mitigation to offset environmental effects beyond the proponents level of impact. The Proposed Plan seeks to clarify that the mitigation standard applies not at the project level, but rather as a planning-level goal and objective unless specifically required under a state management authority. The BLM is pursuing agreements with the States of Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming to clarify how BLM, project proponents, and state management agencies will collaborate to implement a State’s compensatory mitigation plan. Summary: The EIS should emphasize management of easily controllable land uses, such as livestock grazing. Response: In managing for sensitive species such as greater sage-grouse, the BLM has coordinated with the State of Utah, who has managerial jurisdiction over the species, to address the range of threats affecting the species. Rather than “emphasize management of easily controllable land uses” the BLM has focused on ameliorating identified threats to the species and applying pertinent management to “all future resource management authorizations and actions,” consistent with 43 CFR 1610.5-3(a). Summary: The BLM has the necessary authority to apply the entire mitigation hierarchy, including requiring compensatory mitigation pursuant to FLPMA, the authority to promulgate regulations, relevant case-law, and the specific authorities applicable to land use plans and project-specific authorizations. Response: BLM’s Proposed Plan balances the risk of uncertainty against the benefits of management flexibility when considering mitigation strategies. Following extensive review of FLPMA, including existing regulations, orders, policies, and guidance, the BLM has concluded that FLPMA does not explicitly mandate or authorize the BLM to require public land users to implement compensatory mitigation as a condition of obtaining authorization for the use of the public lands (IM 2018-093, Compensatory Mitigation, July 24, 2018). However, the BLM is committed to applying and enforcing the mitigation hierarchy of actions to avoid, minimize, and otherwise mitigate impacts to the extent that federal law allows. A principal component of Greater Sage-Grouse management is the implementation of mitigation actions to ameliorate the threats and impacts to sage grouse and its habitats. The Proposed Plan clarifies how voluntary compensatory mitigation should be considered in the management of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and how BLM will work with each state management agency to implement its compensatory mitigation strategy. Summary: The BLM should allow for public comment regarding consideration and implementation of mitigation with respect to sage-grouse, including alternative approaches to requiring compensatory mitigation in BLM land use plans. Response: Public input on implementing mitigation, “including alternative approaches to requiring compensatory mitigation in BLM land use plans,” was explicitly requested as part of the public comment period on the 2018 Draft EIS (see page ES-8, Section ES.4.2, last sentence of second paragraph). The Proposed Plan clarifies how voluntary compensatory mitigation should be considered in the management of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and how BLM will work with each state management agency and implement its compensatory mitigation strategy. Because this clarification simply aligns the Proposed Plan Amendment with BLM policy and with the scope of compensatory mitigation authority expressly provided by FLPMA, and because any analysis of compensatory mitigation relating to future projects would necessarily be fact-specific and evaluated in project-specific NEPA documents, there is limited value in attempting to do so at the level of land use planning. Summary: Even if the net conservation gain is not continued as the standard, the BLM should still maintain a "no net loss" mitigation standard. Response: Compensatory mitigation would be applied consistent with BLM policy, when it is proffered by the proponent on a voluntary basis, or as required by the State of Utah. These determinations would be made on a project-specific basis in coordination with the State of Utah. Summary: The BLM’s mitigation strategy should be consistent with the State of Utah’s mitigation plans. Response: The BLM is still required to follow the applicable rules and regulations that apply to federal land management. The BLM must be consistent with federal law and regulation, as well as current policy, as described in Chapter 1 of the DEIS and FEIS. Compensatory mitigation would be applied consistent with BLM policy, when it is proffered by the proponent on a voluntary basis, or as required by the State of Utah. These determinations would be made on a project-specific basis in coordination with the State of Utah. Summary: To the extent the BLM relies on the State of Utah's sage-grouse mitigation policy, the BLM should ensure that the resulting standards ensure it has the authority to incorporate, implement, and enforce state sage-grouse mitigation programs that meet a recognized set of principles. Response: Compensatory mitigation would be applied consistent with BLM policy, when it is proffered by the proponent on a voluntary basis, or as required by the State of Utah. These determinations would be made on a project-specific basis in coordination with the State of Utah. Summary: The BLM should evaluate the “substantial changes" to the Management Alignment Alternative required by IM 2018-093 in a supplemental EIS, specifically with regards to mitigation. Response: Public input on implementing mitigation, “including alternative approaches to requiring compensatory mitigation in BLM land use plans,” was explicitly requested as part of the public comment period on the 2018 Draft EIS (see page ES-8, Section ES.4.2, last sentence of second paragraph). The Proposed Plan clarifies how voluntary compensatory mitigation should be considered in the management of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and how BLM will work with each state management agency to implement its compensatory mitigation strategy. Because this clarification simply aligns the Proposed Plan Amendment with BLM policy and with the scope of compensatory mitigation authority expressly provided by FLPMA, and because any analysis of compensatory mitigation relating to future projects would necessarily be fact-specific and evaluated in project-specific NEPA documents, there is limited value in attempting to do so at the level of land use planning. Summary: The BLM should clarify how the IM allows the continuance of the BLM’s commitment to the states in terms of applying state mitigation plans. Response: The EIS analyzes the effects of the alternatives considered, not the effects of the BLM’s Instruction Memorandum. Summary: The DEIS does not assess whether the revised mitigation standard would result in a net conservation gain to sage-grouse. Response: Following extensive review of FLPMA, including existing regulations, orders, policies, and guidance, the BLM has concluded that FLPMA does not explicitly mandate or authorize the BLM to require public land users to implement compensatory mitigation to offset environmental effects beyond the proponents level of impact. The Proposed Plan seeks to clarify that the mitigation standard applies not at the project level, but rather as a planning-level goal and objective unless specifically required under a state management authority. The BLM is pursuing agreements with the States of Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming to clarify how BLM, project proponents, and state management agencies will collaborate to implement a State’s compensatory mitigation plan. There is no law, regulation or policy that requires the BLM achieve a net conservation gain in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. However, the Draft EIS on page 1-9 clearly notes that the principles of the Proposed Plan’s mitigation standard are consistent with the 2015 Approved Plan, and as such changing “net conservation gain” to “improve the condition of greater sage-grouse habitat” does not require new analysis. Summary: The compensatory mitigation requirements in PHMA habitat should be consistent with existing secretarial orders. Response: BLM’s Proposed Plan balances the risk of uncertainty against the benefits of management flexibility when considering mitigation strategies. The BLM is committed to applying and enforcing the mitigation hierarchy of actions to avoid, minimize and mitigate impacts to the extent that federal law allows. A principal component of Greater Sage-Grouse management is the implementation of mitigation actions to ameliorate the threats and impacts to sage grouse and its habitats. The Proposed Plan clarifies how voluntary compensatory mitigation should be considered in the management of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and how BLM will work with each state management agency to implement its compensatory mitigation strategy. Summary: The RMPA/EIS currently does not provide clarification regarding the "amount" of mitigation required on federal land for disturbance in PHMA. Response: As noted in the 2018 Draft EIS, page 2-33, the BLM and the State of Utah would develop a Mitigation Strategy to guide the application of the mitigation approach and hierarchy. This has been clarified in the 2018 Final EIS in Section 2.6, where it notes that the BLM and the State of Utah will coordinate to develop a memorandum of agreement to guide the mitigation hierarchy and compensatory mitigation actions for future project authorizations in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat on BLM-administered lands. Summary: The mitigation requirement ratio is arbitrary and unconstitutional. The BLM should instead use a Habitat Quantification Tool. Response: The Final EIS does not include a mitigation ratio, or even a requirement for mitigation. To the extent a project proponent voluntarily engages in compensatory mitigation, the BLM would coordinate on a project-specific basis with the State of Utah. As noted in the 2018 Draft EIS, page 2-33, the BLM and the State of Utah would develop a Mitigation Strategy to guide the application of the mitigation approach and hierarchy. This has been clarified in the 2018 Final EIS in Section 2.6, where it notes that the BLM and the State of Utah will coordinate to develop a memorandum of agreement to guide the mitigation hierarchy and compensatory mitigation actions for future project authorizations in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat on BLM-administered lands. Summary: The State and BLM must meet prior to finalizing this EIS to identify the proper Mitigation Strategy moving forward, in-light of IM No. 2018-093. Response: As noted in the 2018 Draft EIS, page 2-33, the BLM and the State of Utah would develop a Mitigation Strategy to guide the application of the mitigation approach and hierarchy. This has been clarified in the 2018 Final EIS in Section 2.6, where it notes that the BLM and the State of Utah will coordinate to develop a memorandum of agreement to guide the mitigation hierarchy and compensatory mitigation actions for future project authorizations in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat on BLM-administered lands. Summary: Commenters requested clarification regarding how the BLM should consider and implement mitigation with respect to the sage-grouse, including alternative approaches to requiring compensatory mitigation in BLM land use plans. Response: The BLM is pursuing agreements with the States of Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming to clarify how BLM, project proponents, and state management agencies will collaborate to implement a State’s compensatory mitigation plan. The BLM will defer to a state methodology for habitat quantification if such a tool exists and incorporate the state’s assessment into the appropriate NEPA documentation. The Proposed Plan Amendment clarifies that BLM will consider compensatory mitigation only as a component of compliance with a state mitigation plan, program, or authority, or when offered voluntarily by a project proponent. The Proposed Plan Amendment further clarifies the application of the mitigation standard as a planning-level goal and objective for Greater Sage-Grouse habitat conservation. BLM commits to cooperating with the State to analyze applicant-proffered or state-imposed compensatory mitigation to offset residual impacts. BLM may then authorize such actions consistent with NEPA analysis and the governing RMP. Summary: Mitigation provisions in the 2015 plans were relied on in the USFWS 2015 finding. Mitigation should follow consistent principles. Mitigation could benefit from different strategies in different states. Mitigation provides stronger, faster decisions on project authorizations. Response: BLM’s Proposed Plan balances the risk of uncertainty against the benefits of management flexibility when considering mitigation strategies. The BLM is committed to applying and enforcing the mitigation hierarchy of actions to avoid, minimize, and otherwise mitigate impacts to the extent that federal law allows. A principal component of Greater Sage-Grouse management is the implementation of mitigation actions to ameliorate the threats and impacts to sage grouse and its habitats. The Proposed Plan clarifies how voluntary compensatory mitigation should be considered in the management of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and how BLM will work with each state management agency to implement its compensatory mitigation strategy. 2.2.16 Lek Buffers Summary: The DEIS fails to address the actions available to address lek persistence or how lek persistence will be measured. Response: The Draft EIS evaluates the difference between current federal management and modifications to management to align with the State of Utah’s management. Unless the “actions available to address lek persistence” simultaneously improve alignment with the State of Utah’s management, then they are outside the scope of this planning effort. However, Appendix B includes several examples of actions that could address impacts to lek persistence. In relation to how lek persistence is measured, the monitoring is simple and already conducted. If the lek has impacts to the degree is no longer occupied, is would have ceased to persist. Summary: The BLM should use a more criteria-driven, site-specific approach to determining lek buffer distances. Response: The BLM , in coordination with the State of Utah, has identified and incorporated local science based data into the 2018 Draft EIS to more accurately reflect GRSG lek buffer distances unique to Utah. Beyond this, Appendix B clearly describes that local data and landscape features should be considered to decrease or increase buffer distances. 2.2.17 Prioritization of Grazing Permits Summary: The BLM should clarify the purposes for removing livestock grazing decisions from the Alternative in order to ensure the action is supported by the Purpose and Need statement. Response: The management actions that were removed from the livestock grazing section are clarifications, not management modifications. They are not motivated by consistency with state plans. The grazing decisions removed from the 2015 management prescriptions under the 2018 Management Alignment Alternative are those that are duplicative with agency regulations, policies, or management actions. Consequently, removing the actions does not change whether they are implemented (see page 1-9). 2.2.18 Water Developments for Livestock Summary: The BLM should clarify the words “critical areas” in order to avoid limiting or eliminating water development within a PHMA. Response: The Final EIS has been revised to remove the example language from the action, therefore the phrase “critical areas” is no longer in the action. Summary: The BLM should modify the DEIS to allow for the authorization of new water developments in PHMA that have a neutral or beneficial effect to sage-grouse habitat. Response: MA-LG-10 and MA-LG-11 have been merged into the following language in the Final EIS: In PHMA, manage water developments to have a neutral effect or a beneficial effect to Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. Summary: The LUPA must clarify that existing water rights will not be impaired or taken. Response: No existing action in the Draft EIS has reference to infringing on existing water rights. Compliance with State water Law is not an RMP decision but a State Law requirement. 2.2.19 Role of States in Transportation and Travel Management Planning Summary: The BLM should clarify that the State’s and counties’ rights-of-ways are preserved and will remain open for public use regardless of any travel management decision, unless the State or counties decide otherwise. Response: The adjudication or management of RS 2477 assertions is outside the scope of this planning process. This amendment does not adjudicate, analyze, or otherwise determine the validity of the claimed ROWs or the responsibilities for route management or maintenance. Summary: The BLM should include language expressly preserving the State’s and counties’ ability to manage and maintain roads within PHMA. Response: The adjudication or management of RS 2477 assertions is outside the scope of this planning process. This amendment does not adjudicate, analyze, or otherwise determine the validity of the claimed ROWs or the responsibilities for route management or maintenance. 2.2.20 Range of Alternatives Summary: The Draft EIS did not consider any alternative that is completely consistent with the county RMP. Response: As noted in section 1.2 of the DEIS, the purpose and need for this effort is to modify greater sage-grouse management “to better align with individual state plans…” BLM’s planning regulations note that “where State and local government policies, plans, and programs differ, those of the higher authority will normally be followed” (43 CFR 1610.3-2). Additionally, sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 of the Draft EIS address alternatives that were considered but were dismissed from detailed analysis, including county sage-grouse management plans. Summary: The range of alternatives is insufficient and does not meet the BLM’s obligations pursuant to NEPA. Response: The range is adequate to address the purpose and need for these amendments. And by incorporating the 2015 plans by reference, BLM avails itself of a larger range of management options previously analyzed in the 2015 EIS. Further, section 2.2 and section 1.5.3 of the Draft EIS describes a number of alternatives and issues identified during scoping that the agency determined not to carry forward. Summary: Because the 2018 Draft EIS states a different Purpose and Need compared to the 2015 EIS, the BLM must necessarily consider and analyze a new range of alternatives to meet that new Purpose and Need. Response: While the purpose of the 2018 planning effort is different than that of the 2015 effort, the alternatives considered in the 2015 Final EIS, which are incorporated by reference, have informed the range of alternatives analyzed in detail in the 2018 Draft EIS. The range of alternatives considered in detail is adequate to address the purpose and need for these amendments. Summary: The BLM should also have considered alternatives to complete additional analysis of key protective provisions that it is proposing to eliminate through the DEISs: net conservation gain and SFAs. Response: As noted in the Draft EIS section 2.2.1, this planning process does not revisit every issue evaluated in 2015, but incorporates the entire range of alternatives evaluated through the 2015 planning process by reference. This includes consideration and analysis of a variety of restrictive provisions in greater sage-grouse habitat. Summary: The BLM should evaluate the impacts of the SFAs without the previously-proposed withdrawal and how application can be better coordinated with the states. Response: The 2015 Final EIS considered an alternative that included the SFAs with the corresponding management that recommended a withdrawal, as well as an alternative that considered no such designation or recommended withdrawal. Similarly, the 2018 Draft EIS considered similar alternatives. Considering a separate alternative that retains the SFA but omits the withdrawal recommendation would be substantially similar in effect to the alternative without an SFA, since it is the management prescription that results in the effect, not the mere presence of an area called an SFA. As such, the Draft EIS has considered alternatives that include and exclude the proposed mineral withdrawal and disclosed the impacts of each. Summary: Because the 2018 Draft EISs are not of "lesser scope" than the 2015 EISs, NEPA prohibits the BLM from "tiering" to the 2015 EISs. Response: BLM is using incorporation by reference to streamline our analysis consistent with Administrative priorities, in compliance with 40 CFR 1502.21. Incorporation of the 2015 Final EIS by reference is allowable under regulations and is appropriate in this circumstance because the purpose of this action builds upon the goals and objectives of the 2015 EIS. Further, the CEQ 40 Questions, Question 24c, states that, “Tiering is a procedure which allows an agency to avoid duplication of paperwork through the incorporation by reference of the general discussions and relevant specific discussions from an environmental impact statement of broader scope into one of lesser scope or vice versa.” The BLM has summarized and referenced applicable aspects of the 2015 EIS throughout the 2018 EIS, but especially in Chapters 2 and 4. 2.2.21 Data and Science Summary: The USGS report on Page 1-5 does not accurately reflect site-specific conditions in Garfield County and does not rely on relevant science. When site-specific analysis is conducted in Garfield County, the BLM should use information developed by the State of Utah and its experts. Response: Although the referenced data may not have been directly incorporated into the USGS report, BLM has made a concerted effort in coordination with the State of Utah to incorporate all local based research and data into Utah’s 2018 Draft EIS in an effort to better align with the State’s plan. Summary: Excepting [sic] broad generalized overviews, the BLM's mapping in the DEIS is insufficient. Response: As described in Appendix K, habitat can be mapped at multiple scales. For RMP-level decision-making, the BLM uses first and second order mapping, which is consistent with the scale and level of detail presented in the 2015 Final EIS and 2018 Draft EIS. As implementation planning proceeds, mapping at the third and, when appropriate, fourth order will occur to reflect conditions at a site specific level. The 2018 Draft EIS also clearly notes that there are opportunities to refine boundaries based on site specific surveys and analysis (see MA-SSS-1 on page 2-31 and 2-32). Summary: The DEIS’s disturbance calculation methods are incorrect. Response: The disturbance cap is not the only tool the BLM uses to manage threats to greater sage-grouse habitat. The commenters recommendation of a “net disturbance cap” that balances improvements from land treatments with habitat loss from disturbance is very similar to the approach proposed in the Management Alignment Alternative. However, the BLM has separate RMP management actions (see Objective SSS-4 and MA-SSS-3B). The commenter’s suggestion to start from a specific baseline for disturbance would create an arbitrary starting date from which to count new disturbance, which would overlook the effect that existing disturbance has on how sage-grouse use the landscape. Extensive research has indicated that greater sage-grouse are sensitive to disturbances (see 2015 Final EIS impact analysis for Greater Sage-Grouse for extensive descriptions). The variable is the presence of disturbance, not the age of disturbance. As such, there is no specific date for when disturbance begins counting or stops counting. Disturbance inventories include existing disturbance regardless of when it was generated. Moreover, the disturbance inventory is not intended to show all areas disturbed throughout history, but rather areas that are currently disturbed and have not yet been restored. Impacts from the disturbance did not begin when the 2015 plans were finalized. As such, in order to meet the goal of maintaining and/or increasing Greater Sage-Grouse abundance and distribution, the existing condition of disturbance on the landscape must be taken into account when considering future actions. As far as accounting for relative habitat value, the BLM’s plan already accounts for habitat of variable value through Objective SSS-3 and Objective VEG-1. The difference is that the BLM doesn’t directly merge habitat value with the disturbance cap management action, since the direct impact from a disturbance would not vary based on habitat condition. Rather, the value of the affected habitat is related to whether or not it is meeting the seasonal habitat objectives. The BLM has developed a process to calculate disturbance that takes into account its effect on sage-grouse, with a separate tool that accounts for the presence and quality of habitat within PHMA. Summary: The BLM’s selection of the number of energy and mining facilities per acre is arbitrary and capricious. The number is inconsistent with Garfield County plans, and the BLM should consider revising it. Response: The density cap that is identified in the 2015 Final EIS and brought forward into the 2018 DEIS is not arbitrary and capricious but is based on scientific research (see 2015 Final EIS pages 4-24 and 4-104 which is incorporated into the 2018 Draft EIS by reference). The commenter has not provided any literature applicable to the Garfield County area that refutes the findings of the peer-reviewed science used in the 2015 Final EIS. Summary: The elevation ranges for various categories on page 2-13 fails to accurately describe site-specific habitat conditions.The BLM should work with Garfield County to better refine habitat objectives for sage-grouse in relevant PHMAs. Response: BLM’s habitat objectives reflect the best available information defining habitat conditions that sage-grouse preferentially select. The USGS report confirms BLM’s assumption that such understanding may change over time. BLM has developed the flexibility in the plans to modify seasonal habitat objectives based on new science or site-specific information. Summary: The BLM should disclose uncertainties associated with its conclusion that existing habitat conditions in Utah are not substantially different from 2015. Response: BLM recognizes that at a site scale or at a PHMA/population level there are areas that have seen an increase in the availability of greater sage-grouse habitat due to restoration efforts that have occurred on the ground. Chapter 3, Table 3-6 notes that conifer has been removed on over 140,000 acres since 2015, in addition to several other treatment types. However, for the purposes of the 2018 DEIS, the extent of those changes when viewed at a landscape level are relatively minor in scope (less than 4% of PHMA/GHMA) and would not significantly affect the results of the analysis completed for the 2018 DEIS. Summary: The BLM should use the best and most recent available data in its analyses. Response: During the preparation of the 2018 DEIS, BLM did consider the findings identified in the 2017 USGS report, as well as recent data, both locally and rangewide, to corroborate the analysis conducted in both the 2015 FEIS and 2018 DEIS and to support the management actions identified in the 2018 DEIS. Summary: The BLM should assess herbaceous and shrub habitat characteristics as they relate to sage-grouse habitat needs. Response: The 2018 DEIS has incorporated research and science from local universities to identify and assess herbaceous and shrub habitat objectives for GRSG habitat (See page 2-13 of the 2018 DEIS). Summary: The plan does not present the results of past HAF monitoring. Response: The use of HAF assessments are outside the scope of this planning effort, as the appropriate use of the HAF should be conducted at the site specific scale. The information from the HAF assessments would not inform the RMP-level of decision-making, since the assessments are an evaluation of how areas are achieving the habitat objectives from the RMP. The HAF, then, is a tool for determining plan conformance, not to inform RMP decision-making. Summary: The DEIS and the 2015 land use plan amendment lacks scientific verification of the success of vegetation removal treatments. Response: BLM considered the availability of data from all sources, adequacy of existing data, data gaps, and the type of data necessary to support informed management decisions at the land-use plan level. BLM has used sufficient scientific research to support the management actions in the 2015 FEIS and 2018 DEIS. Summary: The BLM should include indirect evidence suggesting that excessive grazing during breeding season may have a negative impact on sage-grouse populations. Response: BLM considered the availability of data from all sources, adequacy of existing data, data gaps, and the type of data necessary to support informed management decisions at the land-use plan level. Summary: The BLM should reexamine the research cited in the 2015 Plan, specifically the NTT Report, COT Report, and Monograph. Response: The purpose of this amendment is to better align with the State’s management plans and build upon the efforts that were undertaken in the 2015 FEIS. BLM considered the availability of data from all sources, adequacy of existing data, data gaps, and the type of data necessary to support informed management decisions at the land-use plan level. BLM has used sufficient scientific research to support the management actions in the 2015 FEIS and 2018 DEIS. Summary: The BLM should address the variation in Table 2-2 based on the best available science in all states. Response: BLM has incorporated locally based research from Utah State University to identify GRSG habitat objectives that are specific to Utah. The updated numbers are based on extensive data documenting vegetation conditions where greater sage-grouse are actually using the landscape for various seasonal habitats. The habitat objectives table references levels several times to an objective should be applied “where appropriate, relative to ecological site potential” to incorporate flexibility in the prescription of the objectives that take into account the local conditions and site variability. Summary: Removing protections provided by SFAs contradicts the best available science. Response: The Draft EIS considers two alternatives: The No Action Alternative, which analyzes impacts if the SFA’s remain in the plan, and the Management Alignment Alternative that does not include SFA’s. The analysis of impacts of regulatory changes to sage-grouse in Chapter 4 of the EIS describes that management actions in the Management Alignment Alternative would protect the species, and obtain conservation goals, in the absence of SFAs (see Draft EIS page 4-12). Based on this analysis, the BLM has determined that SFA designations and associated management provide a redundant layer of resource protection and land use prioritization within PHMA and is acting within its discretion to remove SFA designation. Further, the BLM canceled the proposed withdrawal of SFAs through a publication in the Federal Register on October 11, 2017 (82 Fed. Reg. 47,248) and findings in the Sagebrush Focal Area Draft EIS noted that there was broadly low potential for locatable minerals within the recommended withdrawal area, so the withdrawal would not have provided additional protection to GRSG. Summary: The DEIS cites new information from a USGS report that synthesized the best available greater sage-grouse science from 2015-2017, but does not specify how the new science supports each of the changes in the proposed action. Response: The findings within the USGS report were not meant to drive change in management actions identified in the 2018 DEIS. Instead, it was developed to determine if the original analyses in the 2015 FEIS were still applicable and could be incorporated into the 2018 DEIS by reference. Summary: The BLM’s density limitation of one facility per 640 acre lacks scientific support. Response: The density cap that is identified in the 2015 Final EIS and brought forward into the 2018 DEIS is based on scientific research that was already considered in the 2015 Final EIS (see 2015 Final EIS pages 4-24 and 4-104 which is incorporated into the 2018 Draft EIS by reference). Research indicated that as the density of oil and gas facilities increased above one per section then attendance at proximal leks decreased. Summary: Best available science does not support a three or five percent disturbance cap. Response: The disturbance cap that is identified in the 2015 Final EIS and brought forward into the 2018 DEIS is based on scientific research that was already considered in the 2015 Final EIS (see 2015 Final EIS page 4-10 which is incorporated into the 2018 Draft EIS by reference). Analyzing western GRSG populations and factors related to occupied versus extirpated leks, Knick and others (2013) found that almost all occupied leks (99 percent) in the western portion of the range had less than 3 percent disturbance within 3.1 miles of the lek. Similarly, range-wide lek trend analyses suggest that the aggregated human influences on the landscape are associated with negative lek count trends (Johnson et al. 2011) and population persistence (Aldridge et al. 2008, Wisdom et al. 2011). Summary: The BLM should require that local maps be used unless more refined data is available. The BLM should require that maps reflect the most accurate data available. Response: As described in Appendix K, habitat can be mapped at multiple scales. For RMP-level decision-making, the BLM uses first and second order mapping, which is consistent with the scale and level of detail presented in the 2015 Final EIS and 2018 Draft EIS. This scale of mapping is consistent with the level of mapping the State of Utah has applied in designating its Sage-Grouse Management Areas. As implementation planning proceeds, mapping at the third and, when appropriate, fourth order will occur to reflect conditions at a site specific level. The 2018 Draft EIS also clearly notes that there are opportunities to refine boundaries based on site specific surveys and analysis (see MA-SSS-1 on page 2-31 and 2-32). Summary: Commenters requested further explanation and clarification regarding the USGS data referenced in Chapter 3. Response: The findings within the USGS report were not meant to drive change in management actions identified in the 2018 DEIS. Instead, it was developed to determine if the original analyses in the 2015 FEIS were still applicable and could be incorporated into the 2018 DEIS by reference. Summary: Commenters offered scientific literature concluding that discrete anthropogenic activities present in sagebrush have negative effects on sage-grouse. Response: Literature concluding that discrete anthropogenic activities impact greater sage-grouse is not different than the literature and analysis conclusions from the 2015 Final EIS. Adding more citations in support of analysis conclusions already present is unnecessary, moving the EIS to be more encyclopedic, which is inconsistent with NEPA regulations. The BLM considered the availability of data from all sources, adequacy of existing data, data gaps, and the type of data necessary to support informed management decisions at the land-use plan level. BLM has used sufficient scientific research to support the management actions in the 2015 FEIS and 2018 DEIS. 2.2.22 Assumptions and Methods: Summary: The analysis methods are inaccurate for lands in specific locations in Utah. Response: As noted in Chapter 1 the purpose of the planning effort is to increase alignment of sage-grouse management with that of the State of Utah. As such, the planning area includes all of the State of Utah. The alternatives and corresponding analysis was conducted within that context. Several locations throughout the Draft EIS specifically note that management or impacts could vary based on site-specific conditions, which would be determined at the project scale and be based on site-specific information. Summary: The BLM incorrectly based its analysis of sage-grouse population changes on methods that misrepresent sage-grouse population trends. Response: Greater sage-grouse population information in the Draft EIS is based on actual lek counts. The regression trends spanned 20 years to include two natural oscillation cycles and started recently enough to only include lek counts from years after lek counting methods had become standardized (see 2015 Final EIS section 3.3.3). This approach allows for comparing a long-term population trend rather than focusing on sharp increases or decreases associated with natural oscillations. It also avoids comparing early and modern lek counts that used different methods. Further, efforts to find new leks have increased over time, resulting in the identification of more, but often smaller leks that previously evaded detection due to their smaller size. Using a total male trend avoids the bias that such efforts would have on a males per lek trend. Finally, the methodologies for monitoring population trends in Appendix I are specifically intended for use in the adaptive management process to track where populations are in relation to adaptive management triggers. The monitoring appendix, which the 2018 Draft EIS does not propose to change, notes clearly that “state wildlife management agencies are responsible for monitoring [greater sage-grouse] populations. Consistent with their jurisdiction and expertise over wildlife, population information in the Draft EIS was developed in coordination with the State of Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. Summary: The BLM’s reliance on the NTT, COT, and the Monograph fails to address the significant data quality and technical errors, omissions, actual and potential conflicts of interest, and incorrect conclusions regarding sage-grouse status and habitat management. Response: The purpose of this planning effort is not to reevaluate the recommendations from the 2011 NTT Report, COT Report, or even the actions from the 2015 Plan Amendment. As required by Secretarial Order 3353 and as described in Chapter 1 of the Draft EIS, the purpose of this planning effort is to modify “the approach to Greater Sage-Grouse management in existing land use plans to better align with individual state plans.” As such, reevaluating recommendations from the NTT report is outside the scope of this planning effort. However, the information presented in the NTT Report and COT Report, used in the 2015 RMP Amendments, and incorporated by reference into this planning effort is considered by the BLM to include reliable information. The BLM uses the best available science to prepare and analyze the RMP Amendments. The National Technical Team (NTT) was formed as an independent, science-based team to ensure that the best information about how to manage sage-grouse habitat is reviewed, evaluated, and provided to the BLM (and Forest Service) in the planning process. The NTT Report was produced in December 2011 and recommended science-based conservation measures to promote sustainable sage-grouse habitat. However, neither the NTT Report nor the COT Report were the sole source of management decisions for the range or alternatives or Approved RMP Amendments in the 2015 plan amendments and it has also been supplemented in this current effort by the USGS Science Review. Summary: Monitoring schedules should be set and prioritized by the local office level on an annual or periodic bases based upon staff-levels and budgets. Response: The BLM would apply the actions and monitoring identified in the 2015 Approved RMP Amendment Appendix D to the extent possible, conditional on staffing and budget. However, allocation of staff and budget is not an RMP action. Summary: The Environmental Consequences Chapter uses the terms minor, little, low and minimal extensively to characterize impacts when that data could instead be used to quantify the anticipated impact. Response: The analysis in the Final EIS has been revised to minimize the use of qualitative descriptors of intensity. Summary: It is not certain that implementation level actions necessary to execute the LUP-level decisions in the Utah DEIS would be subject to further environmental review. Response: Implementation level actions will be subject to further NEPA review. NEPA requires agencies to consider the effects of all major federal actions. While the necessary level of NEPA analysis may vary (e.g., environmental impact statement, environmental assessment, categorical exclusion, or determination of NEPA adequacy), the appropriate level of analysis will be driven by project-and site-specific conditions. However, additional consideration of impacts is required in each instance. Summary: While the BLM assumes that impacts would primarily occur on public land, recent scientific research indicates the likelihood of impacts to adjoining private or public lands owned by agencies other than the BLM. Response: The area to which the actions considered in the Draft EIS would apply is limited to BLM-administered surface and mineral estates. However, the analysis never concludes that impacts, whether indirect or cumulative, would stop at an administrative boundary. Summary: The Utah DEIS fails to provide a summary of existing scientific evidence relevant to evaluating reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts and the BLM’s evaluation of such impacts. CEQ regulations require, where data is unavailable, a summary of existing scientific evidence relevant to evaluating reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts and the agency’s evaluation of such impacts. Response: The Council on Environmental Quality’s NEPA regulations require that if there is missing or incomplete information, a statement of relevance to evaluating impacts should be made. The Draft EIS notes that, while some information is missing and therefore impacts may not be able to be quantified, impacts could still be projected in qualitative terms. As such, obtaining the missing information is not required to reasonably analyze effects. Summary: The DEIS does not include a stand-alone effects analysis for the Proposed Action's combined components and instead relies primarily on the effects analysis in the 2015 EIS. Response: The analysis in the EIS appropriately focuses on scope of changes associated with the purpose and need and the corresponding issues that were identified during the scoping process conducted in fall of 2017. The 2015 Final EIS did analyze the effects of some of the proposed changes in its range of alternatives. Where such analysis exists, it was incorporated by reference in Table 4-2. Where actions in the 2018 Draft EIS were different than those considered in the 2015 Final EIS, new analysis was conducted, as presented in Section 4.6.1. No new analysis was conducted for actions that were not being proposed to change. The overall impacts to greater sage-grouse from the proposed changes, in combination with past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions are identified in the cumulative analysis portion of chapter 4. 2.2.23 Sage-Grouse Summary: The BLM should disclose and make available to the public the study it relied on to determine habitat objectives for vegetation height and canopy cover standards. Response: A request for information is not a substantive comment on the Draft EIS and as such does not need a response. The BLM is not required to publish with the draft all the literature and citations it used in developing the EIS. Rather, a request for studies should be made through a formal request for information through the Freedom of Information Act process. Summary: The BLM has failed to follow scientific data recommendations relating to population trends. Response: Greater sage-grouse population information in the Draft EIS is based on actual lek counts. The regression trends spanned 20 years to include two natural oscillation cycles and started recently enough to only include lek counts from years after lek counting methods had become standardized (see 2015 Final EIS section 3.3.3). This approach allows for comparing a long-term population trend rather than focusing on sharp increases or decreases associated with natural oscillations. It also avoids comparing early and modern lek counts that used different methods. Further, efforts to find new leks have increased over time, resulting in the identification of more, but often smaller leks that previously evaded detection due to their smaller size. Using a total male trend avoids the bias that such efforts would have on a males per lek trend. Finally, the methodologies for monitoring population trends in Appendix I are specifically intended for use in the adaptive management process to track where populations are in relation to adaptive management triggers. The monitoring appendix, which the 2018 Draft EIS does not propose to change, notes clearly that “state wildlife management agencies are responsible for monitoring [greater sage-grouse] populations. Consistent with their jurisdiction and expertise over wildlife, population information in the Draft EIS was developed in coordination with the State of Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. The BLM considered the availability of data from all sources, adequacy of existing data, data gaps, and the type of data necessary to support informed management decisions at the land-use plan level. Summary: The BLM’s method of counting leks is misleading and inaccurate and there is no scientific support justifying the BLM’s decision to use twenty years as the appropriate time period to identify trend leks. Response: BLM considered the availability of data from all sources, adequacy of existing data, data gaps, and the type of data necessary to support informed management decisions at the land-use plan level. The regression trends spanned 20 years to include two natural oscillation cycles and started recently enough to only include lek counts from years after lek counting methods had become standardized (see 2015 Final EIS section 3.3.3). This approach allows for comparing a long-term population trend rather than focusing on sharp increases or decreases associated with natural oscillations. It also avoids comparing early and modern lek counts that used different methods. Further, efforts to find new leks have increased over time, resulting in the identification of more, but often smaller leks that previously evaded detection due to their smaller size. Using a total male trend avoids the bias that such efforts would have on a males per lek trend. Summary: Where sage-grouse populations continue to decline, conditions that are less than the standard are likely to be one of the reasons for that decline in population. Response: Based on its review of the best available science, the BLM has identified an adaptive management strategy that involves the use of both population and habitat based triggers which are identified in both the 2015 FEIS and 2018 DEIS. These triggers reflect a judgement on a level that is sufficiently responsive to population changes to allow for early and effective management response, but not so sensitive as to prompt an undue response. Once one of these triggers is tripped, the BLM will conduct a thorough analysis of the threats and conditions that may be contributing to the decline of the population and will take the necessary steps to implement management actions to reverse those declines. Summary: It is important, particularly in light of climate change, to set aside areas both where sage-grouse are now and where they will need to go in the future. Response: BLM is focused on aligning its management with the states. BLM’s stated purpose and need is to achieve promote consistency and alignment with each State’s management for Greater Sage-Grouse. The habitat areas identified in the Draft RMPAs are based, in part, on the information provided by the State agencies and the latest available science and information regarding habitat for GRSG. The habitat designations in the plans can be modified based on established criteria to address habitat changes, new information, and site specific conditions. Core area and winter habitat needs to coordinate response with WY. 2.2.24 Non-Sage-Grouse Summary: The DEIS may overstate the impacts to soil resources. Response: BLM recognizes that impacts to soil resources may differ from site to site based on the particular soil types identified in a particular area. However, at this scale BLM believes that Impacts to soil resources were adequately addressed in both the 2015 FEIS and the 2017 DEIS. 2.2.25 Livestock Grazing Summary: The BLM should update the EIS’s data to reflect how many grazing allotments currently fail to meet the Rangeland Health Standards. For those allotments that fail to meet the Standards but are making progress towards meeting them, the BLM should provide a description of what actions led to this progress and the monitoring methods used. Response: The land health status of allotments has the potential to change yearly. Any actions taken to resolve standards not being meet is an implementation level action. An updated snapshot of allotment land health status would not changed the effects analysis in the LUP. Summary: The BLM should require that all permits be assessed prior to renewal to determine whether improper grazing is occurring and allow for public participation. Response: Grazing permits that are being fully processed would consider effects of a proposed actions on land health standard. Actions analyzed pursuant to NEPA will be implemented through the grazing decision process consistent with 43 CFR 4160. Summary: The BLM should analyze grazing practices in PHMAs and report those allotments with improper grazing in the Final EIS using proper GRI methods. Response: Evaluations and associated grazing practice analysis by allotment is outside the scope of this amendment decision. Summary: The BLM should identify allotments with improper grazing and actions taken in the Final EIS. Response: Allotment/grazing permit analysis is beyond the scope of the EIS. The analysis of grazing management is done at the implementation level. Summary: The NTT Report inaccurately describes the impacts of domestic livestock and wild horse grazing. Response: The purpose of this planning effort is not to reevaluate the recommendations from the 2011 NTT Report or the actions from the 2015 Plan Amendment. As required by Secretarial Order 3353 and as described in Chapter 1 of the Draft EIS, the purpose of this planning effort is to modify “the approach to Greater Sage-Grouse management in existing land use plans to better align with individual state plans.” As such, reevaluating recommendations from the NTT report is outside the scope of this planning effort. Summary: The LUPAs improperly elevated livestock grazing to a priority threat. Response: The 2018 Draft EIS made adjustments to the livestock grazing actions to focus livestock grazing management on the threat of improper grazing rather than addressing and/or repeating management that was consistent with management that was already contained in regulation and policy. 2.2.26 Fluid Minerals Summary: Commenters offered research that refutes the NTT Report regarding energy development in sage-grouse habitat. Response: No research, including those referenced by commenters, has indicated that oil and gas development has no impact on local sage-grouse use of breeding and nesting areas. These impacts are described in detail in chapter 4 of the 2015 Final EIS and incorporated by reference into the 2018 Draft EIS. Including additional citations supporting these conclusions is unnecessary. While some models identify questions between oil and gas development and population-level impacts, those studies still acknowledge that increasing development could have consequences for sage-grouse populations (Local and population-level responses of Greater Sage-Grouse to oil and gas and climatic variation in Wyoming -Ramey et. al. 2018). As such, there is no new research that would change the conclusions of the analysis for impacts from oil and gas development on greater sage-grouse. Summary: The NSO stipulation should only apply in areas of occupied habitat within PHMA. Response: Oil and gas stipulations must be identified and mapped in the RMP so applicable stipulations can be appropriately applied to potential future leases. The exception language in the RMP would accomplish the same purpose while being consistent with the BLM’s leasing requirements. Summary: Any technical team must use criteria identified in Garfield County's Sage grouse Conservation and Recovery Plan and must provide an opportunity for the review and input of state and local entities. Response: As noted in section 1.2 of the DEIS, the purpose and need for this effort is to modify greater sage-grouse management “to better align with individual state plans…” The BLM will comply with 43 CFR 3101.1-4 regarding public notification of waivers, exceptions, or modifications, which includes a 30-day public notification period when the waiver or modification is substantial. An exception is a limited type of waiver and therefore is subject to 43 CFR 3101.1-4. 2.2.27 Solid Minerals Summary: Commenters offered studies that indicate that phosphate exploration can be successful in areas of sage grouse habitat with minimal to no impact to nearby sage-grouse populations. Response: The 2015 ARMPA management action MA-MR-1 allows exploration for all minerals that are not closed to leasing. However, exploration under a non-energy mineral prospecting permit includes a right to lease if economical levels of resource are discovered. As such, when determining whether to authorize prospecting permits the BLM must consider both the effects of the exploration activities as well as the potential effects of development associated with a potential lease. Since the existing prospecting permits overlap or are within a mile of 12 greater sage-grouse leks, the potential impacts of leasing and development that could follow exploration would not be consistent with the goal of for sage-grouse to maintain and/or increase greater sage-grouse abundance and distribution. Summary: The 2015 Plan and the Utah EIS inadequately address solid non-energy leasable minerals, specifically lands used to mine phosphate. Response: The 2015 Final EIS included sufficient information on the location, development potential, and existing leases and prospecting permits for phosphate (see Chapter 3, section 3.21.2 and pages 4385 and 4-386). Additional information has been added to the 2018 Final EIS in chapters 3 and 4. Summary: The BLM should reevaluate and remove from consideration measures for solid minerals that do not have a discernible positive effect on sage-grouse or activities that already have adequate existing regulatory mechanisms. Response: The BLM reviewed the phosphate potential map and prospecting permit locations, overlapped with the DWR seasonal habitat maps and 2017 lek locations. There were 12 leks (39% of Diamond Mtn leks) inside of or within a mile of the phosphate prospecting permit areas, with 9 leks (29% of Diamond Mtn leks) south of the permit areas and 10 leks (32% of Diamond Mtn leks) to the north or east (see attached map). Were prospecting permits authorized and if development followed, one of the State’s largest greater sage-grouse populations could be bisected by mining activities, affecting more than a third of the leks in the Diamond Mountain area and effectively splitting the remaining leks. Given the presence of sage-grouse resources in this area, opening PHMA to new, non-contiguous mining of non-energy leasable minerals would not be consistent with the special status species goal for greater sage-grouse. Summary: The DEIS fails to discuss the consequences of prohibiting or limiting access to high potential phosphate areas in PHMAs. The DEIS and supporting analysis fails to discuss the effects on fertilizer availability, fertilizer sources and prices, and implications for national food security. Response: The 2015 Final EIS describes the impact on new phosphate leasing and developments. However, it also noted that lands under existing leases and development associated with these valid existing rights would provide future development opportunities that exceeded the timeframe of the Final EIS’s analysis. The analysis in the 2018 Final EIS has been adjusted to reflect new information and changes to the Management Alignment Alternative. Summary: The DEIS fails to include additional analysis in the RMPA/EIS to quantify the impacts to leasable minerals from implementing the Management Alignment Alternative. Response: The 2015 Final EIS describes the impact on new phosphate leasing and developments. However, it also noted that lands under existing leases and development associated with these valid existing rights would provide future development opportunities that exceeded the timeframe of the Final EIS’s analysis. The analysis in the 2018 Final EIS has been adjusted to reflect new information. Summary: The BLM should clarify why PHMA acreage associated with total surface area and split estate area increased. Response: The 2018 Draft EIS, page 3-7, explains why PHMA acreage increased from the numbers in the 2015 ARMPA. Summary: The BLM must clearly define, identify, and address valid existing rights regarding non-energy leasable minerals in the DEIS. The BLM should recognize fringe leases and the development of existing leases as valid existing rights. Response: One of the planning criteria listed in Chapter 1.4 is to recognize valid existing rights. The Final EIS has been adjusted to include additional information for non-energy leasable minerals. Summary: The BLM should identify strategies for allowing for the development of non-energy mineral leasable in areas of non-habitat, or in areas where siting and minimization techniques can be utilized to continue to conserve sage-grouse habitats within PHMA. Response: The BLM reviewed the phosphate potential map and prospecting permit locations, overlapped with the DWR seasonal habitat maps and 2017 lek locations. There were 12 leks (39% of Diamond Mtn leks) inside of or within a mile of the phosphate prospecting permit areas, with 9 leks (29% of Diamond Mtn leks) south of the permit areas and 10 leks (32% of Diamond Mtn leks) to the north or east (see attached map). Were prospecting permits authorized and if development followed, one of the State’s largest greater sage-grouse populations could be bisected by mining activities, affecting more than a third of the leks in the Diamond Mountain area and effectively splitting the remaining leks. Given the presence of sage-grouse resources in this area, opening PHMA to new, non-contiguous mining of non-energy leasable minerals would not be consistent with the special status species goal for greater sage-grouse. Summary: The Final EIS needs to include additional analysis and disclosure of the entire range of impacts associated with implementing the Management Alignment Alternative and its effect on the development of phosphate resources in Utah. Response: The 2015 Final EIS describes the impact on new phosphate leasing and developments. However, it also noted that lands under existing leases and development associated with these valid existing rights would provide future development opportunities that exceeded the timeframe of the Final EIS’s analysis. The analysis in the 2018 Final EIS has been adjusted to reflect new information. 2.2.28 Lands and Realty Summary: The RMPA/EIS fails to disclose the basis by which private lands can be considered in a federal land management planning document. Response: As noted in chapter 1 of the Draft EIS, PHMA are areas prioritized for the management of greater sage-grouse populations. While the BLM only has jurisdiction to implement management on public lands (surface and mineral estates), sage-grouse populations use areas regardless of ownership. As such, when making management decisions on public lands, the BLM will consider the conditions of habitat on private lands. To this end, private lands are considered so far as relevant to the effects analysis, as required under the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires that cumulative impacts to resources be analyzed irrespective of jurisdiction. The plan’s decision area is limited to just BLM managed lands, as indicated in Figures 2-1a and 2-1b in the Draft EIS, as well as in corresponding figures depicting management. Summary: There is no basis for including private land in density and disturbance calculations. Response: The National Environmental Policy Act requires that federal agencies consider the cumulative effects on a resource, irrespective of jurisdiction. The BLM does not have jurisdiction beyond the public lands it administers, but it is required, as part of its decision-making process, to consider the condition of a resource and how BLM actions could contribute to its condition. BLM’s management of sage-grouse accordingly must consider how actions on non-public lands could affect sage-grouse and, by extension, sage-grouse management on public lands. Summary: Commenters requested clarification on Appendix A’s treatment of the Anthro Mountain area. Response: The area mapped as Anthro Mountain was identified in the 2015 ARMPA as neither PHMA nor GHMA. The area is within the National Forest System, with surface resources managed by the Ashley National Forest and its mineral resources administered by the BLM. It is included in the 2015 Forest Service ROD simply as “Anthro Mountain” with separate labeling and management throughout the Forest Services 2015 amendment. Because of this distinction, the BLM has carried forward the Anthro Mountain nomenclature to be consistent with the current Forest Service management documents. 2.2.29 Wild Horse and Burro Summary: The DEIS fails to account for the impacts caused by growing wild horse populations on sage-grouse habitat. Response: The 2015 Final EIS includes a detailed description of impacts of wild horses on greater sage-grouse on pages 4-47 and 4-48, as well as on page 4-52. Chapter 3 of the 2018 Draft EIS, table 3-7, shows that when compared to table 3.42 in the 2015 Final EIS, six of the seven wild horse HMAs that overlap sage-grouse population areas in Utah have smaller current populations in 2018 than in 2015. Additionally, while current population estimates are important and included, because the period of the analysis for the EIS is 20 years, the analysis is intended to provide anticipated effects of proposed management over that time, which will obviously include wild horse population fluctuations. Summary: The 2015 Plan and NTT Report fail to adequately analyze or describe the effects of wild horses on sage-grouse habitat. Consequently, the BLM’s reliance on AMLs having no adverse impact on sage-grouse habitat is incorrect. Response: The 2015 Final EIS includes a detailed description of impacts of wild horses on greater sage-grouse on pages 4-47 and 4-48, as well as on page 4-52. Chapter 3 of the 2018 Draft EIS, table 3-7, shows that when compared to table 3.42 in the 2015 Final EIS, six of the seven wild horse HMAs that overlap sage-grouse population areas in Utah have smaller current populations in 2018 than in 2015. Additionally, while current population estimates are important and included, because the period of the analysis for the EIS is 20 years, the analysis is intended to provide anticipated effects of proposed management over that time, which will obviously include wild horse population fluctuations. Summary: The BLM should include more effective management tools in the plan to adequately control wild horse and burro populations and meet Land Health Standards. Response: The BLM Planning Handbook identifies decisions to be made at the planning level and at the implementation level. The 2015 ARMPA actions are limited to the planning level. Other actions would be considered at the implementation level, or by Congress. 2.2.30 Fuels and Fire Summary: The LUPAs fail to adequately assess restoration and rehabilitation potential and impacts outside of fire rehabilitation, and prioritizing such efforts in areas with the highest likelihood for success. Response: As noted in section 1.2 of the DEIS, the purpose and need for this effort is to modify greater sage-grouse management “to better align with individual state plans…” Because fire and fuels management from the 2015 ARMPA is largely consistent with the state’s plan, considering changes to this is not consistent with the purpose of this effort. Additionally, Objective SSS-4 in the 2015 ARMPA specifically addresses increasing the amount and functionality of seasonal habitats through a variety of vegetation management tools. Because the 2018 DEIS does not mention this objective or most of the vegetation and fire action from the 2015 ARMPA, these are being carried forward, unchanged. This includes MA-VEG-11 that addresses post-fire Emergency Stabilization and Rehabilitation efforts, and MAVEG-1 that calls for prioritizing projects in areas most likely to benefit greater sage-grouse. 2.2.31 Travel and Transportation Management Summary: The BLM should revise the travel and transportation section to better reflect the BLM’s mandate to engage in meaningful and extensive consultation and coordination with local governments. Response: The BLM is required to comply with all existing laws and regulations when implementing RMP actions. As such, it is not necessary to repeat all the legal and regulatory requirements in the RMP. Summary: BLM needs to operate without impacting County rights of way and in a spirit of cooperation and coordination. Response: The adjudication or management of RS 2477 assertions is outside the scope of this planning process. This amendment does not adjudicate, analyze, or otherwise determine the validity of the claimed ROWs or the responsibilities for route management or maintenance. Summary: The BLM should clarify that any remaining travel management direction would not apply to permitted actions, including the management of livestock grazing permits. Response: As directed in 43 CFR 1610.5-3, “All future resource management authorizations and actions...and subsequent more detailed or specific planning, shall conform to the approved plan.” Asu such, all future permitted actions would need to conform to whatever RMP actions are in place at the time of permitting. 2.2.32 Cumulative Impacts Summary: The BLM improperly relies on the cumulative effects analysis from the 2015 LUPAs. Consequently, the cumulative impacts analysis in the Utah DEIS is insufficient and invalid and should be expanded to fully address the cumulative impacts from the amendments. Response: BLM is using incorporation by reference, not tiering, to streamline our analysis consistent with Administrative priorities. Incorporation of the 2015 EIS by reference is allowable under BLM regulations and is appropriate in this circumstance because the purpose of this action builds upon the goals and objectives of the 2015 EIS. Summary: The list of reasonably foreseeable future projects fails to incorporate many relevant projects that should be considered in the cumulative effects analysis. Response: The BLM will update the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions as needed to reflect applicable projects for the FEIS. Summary: The incorporation by reference of the 2015 CEA impedes public review. Response: BLM is adding quantitative analysis of the cumulative impacts from planning decisions for each management zone to the FEISs to address rangewide issues and trends. Summary: The BLM should modify the cumulative effects assessment by considering the cross-border and population-wide effects of the seven new management plans on the conservation status of the sage-grouse. Response: The cumulative effects analysis has been updated in the Final EIS to analyze cumulative effects across the greater sage-grouse range, organized by each WAFWA management zone. 2.3 RANGEWIDE COMMENTS 2.3.1 Adaptive Management Adaptive management provisions such as "hard" and "soft" triggers must be maintained, along with provisions for public notice and comment when they are triggered, to show that monitoring of effectiveness is ongoing and management is adjusted as needed. In sum, designated PHMAs should be expanded to all lands designated as PACs by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 2013 (COT 2013), and include expansions of Core Areas adopted by the State of Wyoming in 2015. In turn, SFA status and management parameters should be expanded to all lands designated as PHMA if the BLM truly wants to protect and conserve sage-grouse throughout its range and the Plans are being used to defer ESA listing. 2.3.2 Alternatives -Other In sum, designated PHMAs should be expanded to all lands designated as PACs by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 2013 (COT 2013), and include expansions of Core Areas adopted by the State of Wyoming in 2015. In turn, SFA status and management parameters should be expanded to all lands designated as PHMA if the BLM truly wants to protect and conserve sage-grouse throughout its range and the Plans are being used to defer ESA listing. 2.3.3 Assumptions and Methodology The analytical assumptions in the DEISs are neither reasonable nor supportable At the beginning of Chapter 4, each DEIS lays out a series of analytical assumptions. The purpose of these assumptions is to set guidelines and provide reasonably foreseeable projected levels of development that would occur in the planning area during the planning period. As shown below, however, many of these assumptions are neither reasonable nor supportable when looked at objectively, and considering the most recent science. ? Assumption One: Sufficient funding and personnel would be available for implementing the final decision. ? Table ES-1 in each Executive Summary of the DEISs shows a significant decline in all planned habitat restoration and protection activities for FY 18, including conifer removal and invasive species removal. However, invasive species removal is already falling far behind the pace needed to adequately restore sagebrush habitat, as shown in a recent WAFWA report (WAFWA Gap Analysis) finding that most invasive weed management programs are addressing less than 10% of the average infested acres, while the annual rate of spread of invasive plants, can range from 15-35%. That document states, "[This] [l]ack of effort is due almost entirely to lack of capacity, not expertise."14 ? In FY 19, The Administration budget request for funding sage-grouse would impose further cuts by consolidating the sage-grouse program with other programs and reducing the total amount sought.15 ? Interior Secretary Zinke has told lawmakers that he wants to reduce the Department workforce by 4,000 full-time jobs.16(Greenwire 8/15/17) ? Assumption Two: Implementation-level actions necessary to execute the LUP-level decisions in this RMPA/EIS would be subject to further environmental review, including that under NEPA. ? Instruction Memorandum (IM) 2018-034, recent guidance issued by BLM governing oil and gas leasing, emphasizes using Determinations of NEPA Adequacy instead of NEPA analysis. ? IM 2018-061 instructs BLM staff members to ensure they are using several tools to make the NEPA process more efficient, including categorical exclusions for certain types of oil and gas development. ? Pending legislation, H.R. 6106, introduced by Representative Pearce (R-NM), would require use of categorical exclusions from NEPA for many oil and gas drilling activities. ? Pending legislation, H.R. 6088, introduced by Representative Curtis (R-UT), would allow oil and gas companies to obtain authorization to drill in some circumstances without NEPA analysis. ? Pending legislation, S.1417, introduced by Sen. Hatch (RUT) and Sen Heinrich (D-NM), would create categorical exclusions for a wide variety of sage-grouse management activities, such as the use of herbicides and pesticides, mechanical piling and burning, chaining, and broadcast burning. ? There has been a large increase in the use 5of categorical exclusions from NEPA analysis for oil and gas development in Wyoming, particularly in the Continental Divide-Creston Project Area, where categorical exclusions allowed by section 390 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. § 15942) are being employed. ? Assumption Three: Direct and indirect impacts of implementing the RMPA/EIS would primarily occur on public lands administered by the BLM in the planning area. ? The DEISs loosen restrictions on oil and gas development on BLM lands in a variety of ways, such as decreasing buffers, removing or modifying disturbance and density caps, opening new areas to development, and eliminating general habitat in Utah. While BLM assumes that impacts would primarily occur on public land, recent scientific research indicates the likelihood of impacts to adjoining private or public lands owned by agencies other than BLM. This study, by Spence et al., found that the probability of lek collapse was positively related to the density of oil and gas wells located outside of core areas at two distances -within 1.6 km and within 4.8 km of the core area boundary.17 ? These proposed changes would impact future collaborative processes, as expressed by Wyoming Governor Matt Mead: "If we go down a different road now with the sage grouse, what it says is, when you try to address other endangered species problems in this country, don't have a collaborative process, don't work together, because it's going to be changed," Mead said. "To me, that would be a very unfortunate circumstance."18 ? Assumption Four: The BLM would carry out appropriate maintenance for the functional capability of all developments. ? As noted in Assumption One, BLM is already not carrying out appropriate maintenance, and potential budget cuts foretell even greater deficiencies in the future. Moreover, the mere fact that treatment has occurred does not necessarily indicate that the habitat has successfully been restored, rendering Table ES-1 essentially meaningless. As the 2018 USGS Synthesis of recent scientific research states, "Restoring sagebrush communities can be difficult, costly and slow."19 ? In Desert Survivors v. U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Case No. 16-cv-01165-JCS (N.D. CA May 15, 2018)20, in ruling that the FWS erred in failing to list the bi-state GRSG population under ESA, the court held, "the service must offer some rational basis for its conclusions that future conservation efforts will be effective enough to improve the status of the bi-state (grouse) and therefore warrant withdrawal of the proposed listing." Id. at 64. Assumptions must have a basis in fact. ? Assumption Five: The discussion of impacts is based on best available data. ? In Chapter 4, the DEISs acknowledge that much important data is not available, including comprehensive planning area-wide inventory of wildlife and special status species occurrence and condition and GIS data used for disturbance calculation on private lands. Indeed, the DEISs acknowledge that some impacts of the proposed changes could not be quantified.21 ? CEQ regulations further require, where data is unavailable a summary of existing scientific evidence relevant to evaluating reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts and the agency's evaluation of such impacts.22The DEISs fail to provide either of these types of information. ? In addition to failing to include the results of the WAFWA Gap Analysis, the DEISs also do not consider a study published in PLoS ONE by Kitzberger et al. (PLoS ONE study) finding that many parts of the West can expect to see more than five times the area burned during the next 20 years than fires covered in the past 20.23 The DEISs state that their assumptions apply to the analysis of both alternatives presented by BLM. It is not appropriate, however, to rely on assumptions, as BLM has done here, that are not based either in fact or sound science. III.THE ASSUMPTIONS, DATA, AND PLANNING CRITERIA BLM RELIES ON IN THE DRAFT EISs ARE FLAWED. There are significant problems in the DEISs relating to the assumptions, data, and planning criteria BLM uses in support of the proposed amendments to the 2015 land use plans. These flaws lead to a series of inadequacies in the DEISs themselves, including both faulty conclusions and a high degree of regulatory uncertainty as to the meaning of the proposed amendments, discussed in detail below. A. The analytical assumptions in the DEISs are neither reasonable nor supportable At the beginning of Chapter 4, each DEIS lays out a series of analytical assumptions. The purpose of these assumptions is to set guidelines and provide reasonably foreseeable projected levels of development that would occur in the planning area during the planning period. As shown below, however, many of these assumptions are neither reasonable nor supportable when looked at objectively, and considering the most recent science. 2.3.4 Cumulative Impacts F. BLM's cumulative impacts analysis is insufficient and invalid. The BLM is required to consider the cumulative environmental impacts to sage-grouse and sage-grouse habitat in the EISs it has prepared. Cumulative environmental impacts are defined as: The impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such actions. 40 C.F.R. § 1508.7. "Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time." Id. Cumulative impacts must be considered in the scope of an EIS. Id. § 1508.2(c). Despite the requirement to consider cumulative environmental impacts in the sage-grouse land use plan amendment EISs, the BLM has failed to do this adequately. For one, the BLM claims that the cumulative effects analysis from the 2015 sage-grouse land use plan amendments meets the cumulative effects analysis requirement that is needed now. The inappropriateness and legal invalidity of this claim is discussed elsewhere in these comments. As noted above, tiering is only appropriate when a subsequent narrower environmental analysis relies on an earlier broader environmental analysis. See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.28 (a) (stating that tiering is appropriate when a program, plan, or policy environmental impact statement is used to support a new analysis of "lessor scope" or which is site-specific). But we do not have that here; the scope of the current analysis is as broad as the 2015 analysis. There is no "step down" present here, therefore the cumulative impacts analysis from the 2015 plans cannot "incorporate[ ] by reference the analysis in the 2014 and 2015 Final EISs and the 2016 Draft Sagebrush Focal Area Withdrawal EIS." Wyoming DEIS at 4-20. In addition, BLM cannot simply incorporate the previous analysis by reference without justifying how it is appropriate and summarizing how it applies, neither of which has been done in the Draft EISs. See, 43 C.F.R. § 46.135(a). BLM also must ensure any incorporation by reference does not impede review by the public, which it surely does here. See 40 C.F.R. § 1502.21. Moreover, the purpose and need for the 2018 EISs differs from that of the 2015 EISs, which underscores why neither tiering nor incorporation by reference is appropriate. Secondly, in each of the six 2018 EISs the BLM lists a number of projects that it claims reflect the cumulative effects impacts that are applicable here. See, e.g., Table 4-3 in the Wyoming Draft EIS (DEIS). But this list of projects fails to incorporate many relevant projects that should be considered in the cumulative effects analysis. In Wyoming, for example, neither the Normally Pressured Lance or Converse County oil and gas projects are listed. See Wyoming DEIS at Table 4-3, page 4-35. These are two mammoth projects, that will involve drilling thousands of oil and gas wells which will have significant impacts on sage-grouse and sage-grouse habitats.11 Neither of these projects were considered in the 2015 EISs. In Utah the Greater Chapita Wells Natural Gas Infill Project is not considered in the Utah sage-grouse plan amendment EIS. Utah DEIS at Table 4-4, pages 4-41 to 42. This project could involve the drilling of 2808 natural gas wells in Uintah County, which is prime sage-grouse habitat. See https://eplanning.blm.gov/epl-frontoffice/eplanning/planAndProjectSite.do?methodName= renderDefaultPlanOrProjectSite&projectId=3736 2. There are other projects missing from the Range Wide Impacts from Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Future Actions table in the other states. In addition, while in Wyoming (and the other states), past and upcoming oil and gas lease sales are mentioned, see Wyoming DEIS at Table 4-3, page 4-35, the list is incomplete. The June lease sale(198,588 acres) is mentioned but neither the upcoming September (366,151 acres) or December (698,589 acres) lease sales are discussed.12 The same is true in other states. For example, in Utah, the Utah DEIS says 646 acres of oil and gas leases will be offered in Habitat Management Areas (HMA) in June, but it fails to mention the 158,944 acres (with 45,227 acres that had been previously offered) that will be offered for lease in September.13 The same is true in other states. The BLM should review the list of projects shown in Tables 4-3 or 4-4 (depending on the state) causing cumulative impacts and ensure they are as comprehensive as is required to include "the incremental impact[s] . . . when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions." We note again the projects we have mentioned were not considered in the 2015 sage-grouse plan amendment EISs.These are "collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time" that must be considered in the cumulative impacts analysis, but which have not been. In addition, BLM should evaluate the cumulative effects of these projects across the planning areas of the 2015 Sage-grouse Plans. Under Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) guidance, BLM must consider the current aggregate effects of past actions in a cumulative impacts analysis. CEQ, Guidance on the Consideration of Past Actions in Cumulative Effects Analysis (available at https://ceq.doe.gov/docs/ceq-regulations-andguidance/ regs/Guidance_on_CE.pdf). This means the BLM must consider what the impacts of implementing the 2015 plans has been on cumulative impacts. BLM cannot just incorporate the 2015 plans by reference as its cumulative effects analysis, rather it must consider the "identifiable present effects of past actions," which the 2015 plans clearly are. Under the 2015 plans BLM has taken hundreds of actions, and in total those actions have had cumulative environmental impacts. An analysis of those cumulative impacts is missing from the current EISs, which is not permissible. "A cumulative impact analysis "must be more than perfunctory; it must provide 'a useful analysis of the cumulative impacts of past, present, and future projects.'"" N. Plains Res. Council, Inc. v. Surface Transp.Bd., 668 F.3d 1067, 1076 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Kern v. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 284 F.3d 1062,1075 (9th Cir. 2002) (additional citation omitted). "To be useful to decision makers and the public, the cumulative impact analysis must include "some quantified or detailed information; . . . general statements about possible effects and some risk do not constitute a hard look absent a justification regarding why more definitive information could not be provided."" 668 F.3d at 1076 (quoting Ocean Advocates v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, 402 F.3d 846, 868 (9th Cir. 2004) (additional citation omitted). Here the BLM has offered nothing more than a perfunctory cumulative impacts analysis. There is no useful analysis of past projects; the dozens if not hundreds of approved projects implementing the 2015 sage-grouse plans. There is no quantifiable or detailed information about those projects, and there are not even any general statements about the cumulative impacts of those projects, many of which have undergone a NEPA analysis. Based on the above, it is evident the cumulative impacts analyses in the 2018 Draft EISs is invalid and must be expanded to fully address the cumulative impacts from the amendments. 2.3.5 Data and Science A 2016 Wyoming study by Smith et al.33cited in both the USGS Annotated Bibliography and the ZUSGS Synthesis found that sage-grouse frequently used winter habitats outside of core areas. The Annotated Bibliography summarizes the implications of this study: Current seasonal use restrictions in winter concentration areas (December 1 to March 15) are shorter than the GRSG winter habitat use period identified in the study. A substantial proportion of winter use areas were located outside of identified core areas in one of the two study areas, suggesting reconsideration of the ability of Wyoming's Core Area policy to provide for long-term conservation of GRSG. While the Wyoming DEIS refers to potential changes to Habitat Management Area Designations (See, e.g., WY DEIS at 4-14-4-15), neither this study nor the need to expand winter habitat is mentioned. ? A second Wyoming study by Spence et al.35found the probability of lek collapse was positively related to the density of oil and gas wells located outside core areas at two distances - within 1.6 km and within 4.8 km of the core area boundary. The USGS Annotated Bibliography states: The proportion of the male population within core areas and the observed decreased probability of lek collapse within core areas suggest that the core area policy is providing broad protection for GRSG in Wyoming. However, limitations on development near core areas may be needed to more effectively protect GRSG populations within core areas.36 The Wyoming DEIS again makes no mention of this study, and in fact proposes reducing noise restrictions outside priority habitat (WY DEIS at 2-12-2-13), while other DEISs in other states, such as Utah and Idaho, eliminate a variety of restrictions outside but adjacent to priority habit (see e.g., UT DEIS at 2-6; ID DEIS at 2-10). A second Wyoming study by Spence et al.35 found the probability of lek collapse was positively related to the density of oil and gas wells located outside core areas at two distances -within 1.6 km and within 4.8 km of the core area boundary. The USGS Annotated Bibliography states: The proportion of the male population within core areas and the observed decreased probability of lek collapse within core areas suggest that the core area policy is providing broad protection for GRSG in Wyoming. However, limitations on development near core areas may be needed to more effectively protect GRSG populations within core areas.36 The Wyoming DEIS again makes no mention of this study, and in fact proposes reducing noise restrictions outside priority habitat (WY DEIS at 2-12-2-13), while other DEISs in other states, such as Utah and Idaho, eliminate a variety of restrictions outside but adjacent to priority habit (see e.g., UT DEIS at 2-6; ID DEIS at 2-10). BLM must accurately characterize the findings in the Synthesis, elaborate upon the status of data considered and explain how it is addressing missing data. The agency cannot simply gloss over these requirements with rote or unsupported conclusions that it used in support of its Preferred Alternative. We appreciate the idea that broad, science-based objectives have a place in determining whether greater sage-grouse habitat is contributing to stable populations. However, no single objective can cover the wide range of variability that occurs across a landscape as vast as the sagebrush sea. The Habitat Objectives Tables (Table 2-2) have been misinterpreted as standards that must be met, likely at the expense of the widest and most adaptable use in the West-livestock grazing. It does not make sense that these objectives be reflected in livestock grazing permittee/lessee terms and conditions if they do not fit the ecosystem in which they are being applied. Because of this, we appreciate those amendments that propose to make clear that habitat objectives must account for local conditions and site variability. This includes the removal of the seven-inch perennial grass and forb height habitat objective. We understand why grass and forb height objectives need to be considered for the health of the bird, but we believe these objectives should vary across the range. We request these changes be made to the habitat objectives tables for each greater sage-grouse RMP amendment. By ignoring the WAFWA Gap Analysis and Plos ONE study, the DEISs fail to recognize the warning that occurs later in the USGS Synthesis, which states: [T]here continues to be emerging science quantifying effects and measuring the efficacy of conservation recommendations. Review of this new information as it becomes available, and incorporating changes, if appropriate, are essential to implementing valid conservation recommendations.32 In addition to the problems with Table ES-1 noted above in the first section, the figures used in the Table and on page 3-1 are of limited utility at best because they are not broken down either state by state or by sage-grouse management zone. Range-wide data can mask significant decreases in habitat or population in a more localized area. In addition, no citation is provided for either data set so that the numbers provided can be examined and verified. ? The PLoS ONE study found that median increases in AAB (Annual Area Burned) greater than 700% are predicted for ID, MT, and NV, and strong upper quartile increases are predicted for OR, ID, MT, and WY. In many areas the actual burning on the ground has exceeded the models. This is a huge increase from the conclusion in the 2015 FWS sage-grouse listing decision that that wildfire would continue to affect the Great Basin at the current rate of about 85% percent per year.29 In discussing the findings of the Synthesis on impacts of activities such as oil and gas development to sage-grouse habitat, the DEIS states: The science developed since 2015 corroborates prior knowledge about the impact of discrete human activities on Greater Sage-Grouse. New science suggests that strategies to limit surface disturbance may be successful at limiting range-wide population declines; however, it is not expected to reverse the declines, particularly in areas of active oil and gas operations ([Synthesis], p.2). This information may have relevance when considering the impact of management actions designed to limit discrete disturbances.31 The studies referenced in this passage appears to be set out on page 14 and 15 of the USGS Synthesis. We were not able to locate a single instance in any of the DEISs, however, where any of these papers were cited in a discussion of the Impacts of the BLM Preferred Alternative in the DEISs. The DEISs ignore studies referenced in the USGS Annotated Bibliography and USGS Synthesis that either support additional protections for sage-grouse habitat or provide evidence against the amendments BLM proposes. The PLoS ONE study found that median increases in AAB (Annual Area Burned) greater than 700% are predicted for ID, MT, and NV, and strong upper quartile increases are predicted for OR, ID, MT, and WY. In many areas the actual burning on the ground has exceeded the models. This is a huge increase from the conclusion in the 2015 FWS sage-grouse listing decision that that wildfire would continue to affect the Great Basin at the current rate of about 85% percent per year.29 The WAFWA Gap Analysis shows that invasive plant infestations in the West, particularly in the range of the sage-grouse, have reached enormous levels with estimates of invasive annual grass and perennial forb infestations at more than 100 million acres of public and private lands. Again, this is far more than contemplated in the FWS sage-grouse listing decision.30 A limit of 3% human surface disturbance per square-mile section is the minimum necessary standard for preventing habitat abandonment by sage grouse. Knick et al. (2013) found that 99% of active leks across the western half of the sage grouse's range were surrounded by land with 3% or less human development. Decker et al. (2017) found a similar result in Colorado, with a linear decrease in sage grouse lek populations once surface disturbance increased above the 2.5% threshold. Preliminary results from Kirol et al. (in prep) indicate that the vast majority of sage-grouse were found in habitats with <1% surface disturbance. Disturbance density can also affect survival, Kirol et al. (2015a) found that brood survival for sage-grouse began to decline significantly once disturbance density hit the 4% threshold. The vast majority were surrounded by much less disturbance. Copeland et al. (2013) found that if all of the State of Wyoming sage grouse policy provisions (which include a 5% disturbance cap calculated using a Disturbance Density Calculation Tool) were implemented fully and to the letter, that a 9 to 15% decline in greater sage grouse populations would still occur statewide, including a 6 to 9% decline within designated Core Areas (where the 5% disturbance cap would be applied). There is no scientific evidence at all indicating that sage grouse can tolerate a greater percentage of surface disturbance. In particular, the 5% cap on disturbance proposed for the Wyoming RMP amendment for Core Areas and Connectivity Areas been shown to be effective by no scientific study, ever. The data BLM chose to rely upon is insufficient. The scientific grounding for the BLM plans, including the level of certainty in how they are applied, was a key part of the foundation for the FWS decision that listing the sage-grouse under ESA was not warranted.24 Any changes proposed to the plans now by the BLM should meet a similarly high standard, complying with both the CEQ regulations and considering all the most recent peer-reviewed research. Unfortunately, here, much of the relevant data is not available, and the data BLM has ignored includes important studies that would argue against many of the changes BLM proposes in the DEISs. Table ES-1 of the DEISs purports to use the amount of on-the-ground treatment activity for the past three fiscal years, as well as planned activities for the current fiscal year, to show progress in sagebrush habitat restoration. In addition, every DEIS also includes the following language on page 3-1: While the BLM acknowledges that there have been changes to the landscape since 2015, due to the scale of this analysis… data collected consistently across the range indicate that the extent of these changes to the landscape are relatively minimal. For example, BLM monitoring data collected and analyzed annually at the biologically significant unit (BSU) scale… indicates that there has been a minimal overall increase in estimated disturbance (less than 1 percent range-wide from 2015 through 2017) within PHMA. Moreover, there has been an overall decrease in sagebrush availability (less than 1 percent range-wide from 2012 through 2015) in PHMAs within BSUs. Finally, Chapter 3 of every DEIS references both the USGS annotated bibliography of scientific research on greater sage-grouse published since January 201525 (USGS Annotated Bibliography) and the USGS report that synthesizes and outlines potential management implications of the new science.26 (USGS Synthesis). These data are intended to show that changes to the landscape since the 2015 plans are "relatively minimal."27 In addition, the DEISs state: Based on available information, including [the Annotated Bibliography and Synthesis], the BLM has concluded that the existing condition is not substantially different from that of 2015; therefore, the data and information presented in the 2014 and 2015 Final EISs are incorporated into this RMPA/EIS.28 Both conclusions are faulty. Changes to the landscape since 2015 are not relatively minimal, and the sagebrush landscape of 2018 is not substantially similar to that of 2015, as shown below. BLM must accurately characterize the findings in the Synthesis, elaborate upon the status of data considered and explain how it is addressing missing data. The agency cannot simply gloss over these requirements with rote or unsupported conclusions that it used in support of its Preferred Alternative. Finally, Chapter 3 of every DEIS references both the USGS annotated bibliography of scientific research on greater sage-grouse published since January 201525(USGS Annotated Bibliography) and the USGS report that synthesizes and outlines potential management implications of the new science.26(USGS Synthesis).

Changes to the landscape since 2015 are not relatively minimal, and the sagebrush landscape of 2018 is not substantially similar to that of 2015, as shown below. Holloran (2005) found that several types of oil and gas infrastructure sited within 1.9 miles of the lek site had a negative impact on populations of breeding males on the lek; these infrastructure feature include both wellpads during the post-drilling, production phase and gravel trunk roads leading to five or more wellpads. It is important to note that a single wellpad or road can cause significant impacts, and these impacts occur even in cases where roads are not visible from the lek site due to intervening terrain (Holloran 2005). Drilling activities can have significant impacts when wells are sited within 3 miles of leks (id.). Manier et al. (2014) reviewed all available science and found that appropriate lek buffers (the "interpreted range") ranged from 3.1 to 5 miles. Aldridge and Boyce (2007) suggested that even larger buffers (10 km) are warranted. In addition to significant negative impacts on breeding populations at the lek site, industrial incursions can also have a significant negative impact on nesting females. The lek is the hub of nesting activity, with most females nesting within 4 to 6 miles of a lek site. Holloran et al. (2007) found that yearling sage grouse avoided otherwise suitable nesting habitat within 930m (almost 0.6 mile) of oil and gas-related infrastructure. This means that individual wellsites, and their access roads and other related facilities, will be surrounded by a 0.6-mile band of habitat that has substantially lost its habitat capability for use by nesting grouse. The National Technical Team (2011: 20) observed, "it should be noted that protecting even 75 to >80% of nesting hens would require a 4-mile radius buffer (Table 1). Even a 4-mile NSO buffer would not be large enough to offset all the impacts reviewed above." Importantly, a 0.6-mile lek buffer covers by area only 2% of the nesting habitat encompassed by a 4-mile lek buffer, which takes in approximately 80% of nesting grouse according to the best available science. Priority Habitats were largely designated on the basis of buffers around active lek sites, which encompass the breeding and nesting habitats used by grouse during spring and summer. But protecting wintering habitats is equally important to assuring the continued existence and ultimate recovery of the species, and these wintering habitats are frequently located outside the protective boundaries of designated Priority Habitats (see, e.g., Smith et al. 2016, Dinkins et al. 2017). For Wyoming, Dinkins et al. (2017: 10) state, "Although breeding habitat-defined as the area within 8.5 km [5.3 miles] of a lek-was a good surrogate for delineating all seasonal habitats for sage-grouse, Core Areas provided habitat protections disproportionately for summer habitats compared to winter." These researchers went on to state, "our mapping results demonstrated that net reproduction from all birds associated with a winter habitat magnifies the importance of maintaining high-quality winter habitat. In other words, birds breeding outside of winter habitats were reliant on winter habitats for winter survival; thus, degraded winter habitat could equate to loss of reproduction from a much larger spatial footprint. Recent empirical study confirms the established finding that sage-grouse lek attendance is negatively related to oil and gas density, regardless of sagebrush cover and participation.3 Green et al. (2017) examined greater sage-grouse lek attendance, oil and gas well, and habitat and precipitation data from Wyoming over the period 1984 to 2008, and, consistent with numerous prior studies, that lek attendance declines are closely associated with the density of oil and gas development: Oil and gas development correlates well with sage-grouse population declines from 1984 to 2008 in Wyoming, which is supported by other findings (Doherty et al. 2010b, Harju et al. 2010, Hess and Beck 2012, Taylor et al. 2013, Gregory and Beck 2014). As with other studies, we also found support for 4-year lag effects of oil and gas development on lek attendance (Walker et al. 2007, Doherty et al. 010a, Harju et al. 2010, Gregory and Beck 2014). This result suggests that development likely affects recruitment into the breeding population rather than avoidance of wells by adult males or adult survival. Adult sage-grouse are highly philopatric to lek sites (Dalke et al. 1963, Wallestad and Schladweiler 1974, Emmons and Braun 1984, Dunn and Braun 1985, Connelly et al. 2011a), and males typically recruit to the breeding population in 2-3 years. We would expect a delayed response in lek attendance if development affects recruitment, either by reducing fecundity or avoidance of disturbance by nesting females, as adult males die and are not replaced by young males. Sagebrush Focal Areas ("SFAs") are by definition a subset of PHMA, where all PHMA direction applies with additional protections overlaid in some cases. Our organizations agree with the need for modification insofar as we believe SFA management actions should be expanded to more lands. In addition, we believe that all priority habitats, including SFAs must be designated as sage-grouse Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACECs) and managed to protect sage-grouse, as discussed in more detail above. The current Greater Sage-Grouse RMP Amendments and Revisions incorporate insufficient Priority Habitat Management Area designations in all states except Oregon, Colorado, and North Dakota. Crist et al. (2015) provided a critique that indicated that many PHMA units were too small and isolated to sustain sage-grouse populations over the long term, and also noted that a handful of large areas are strongholds of disproportionate importance to sage-grouse conservation efforts. All lands designated as Priority Areas for Conservation 65 ("PACs") by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service need to be designated as Priority Habitat Management Areas and given strong, science-based protections in accord with the recommendations of the National Technical Team. In addition, expansions of PHMA are warranted in Wyoming, where the BLM and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service erroneously incorporated reductions in state Core Area designations that were made for political, rather than scientific, proposes, and which render this state's Priority Habitat Management Areas scientifically invalid. Scientific research has determined that one energy site per square mile is the density threshold at which significant impacts to sage-grouse populations begin to be measured (Copeland et al. 2013). Tack (2009) found that this study in Montana's Milk River Basin, well densities of one per square mile also we correlated with a very low probability of a lek being large (see Figure 9, p. 43). The analysis of Copeland et al. (2013) found that a statewide analysis 72 of well densities revealed population decline curves very close to the earlier studies by Holloran (2005), but also noted that a 1 wellpad per square mile density of development correlated to approximately 18% decline in sage grouse lek population (see Figure 4). So one wellpad per square mile definitely is not a zero-impact threshold. Indeed, Garman (2018) found that clustering 8 wells per pad using directional drilling in the Atlantic Rim coalbed methane project, which would meet the one-pad-per-square-mile threshold required for PHMA, still left comparatively little habitat within the Project Area outside the ecological zone of influence of roads and wellpads. This onesite-per-square-mile-section is a threshold that should not be subject to waiver, modification, or exception. The BLM's own experts recommended for existing fluid mineral leases that a 4-mile No Surface Occupancy buffer should be applied to leks, with an exception allowed in cases where the entire lease is within 4 miles of a lek, in which case a single wellsite should be permitted in the part of the lease most distal to the lek (NTT 2011). This recommendation is reinforced by a similar recommendation from western state agency biologists, who also recommended a 4-mile No Surface Occupancy buffer (Apa et al. 2008). According to Taylor et al.(2012: 27), in a study commissioned by BLM, 68 Second, female sage-grouse that visit a lek use an approximately 9-mi (15-km) radius surrounding the lek for nesting; a 2-mi (3.2-km) radius encompasses only 35-50% of nests associated with the lek (Holloran and Anderson 2005, Tack 2009). While a lek provides an important center of breeding activity, and a conspicuous location at which to count birds, its size is merely an index to the population dynamics in the surrounding habitat. Thus attempting to protect a lek, without protecting the surrounding habitat, provides little protection at all. The studies referenced in this passage appears to be set out on page 14 and 15 of the USGS Synthesis. We were not able to locate a single instance in any of the DEISs, however, where any of these papers were cited in a discussion of the Impacts of the BLM Preferred Alternative in the DEISs. ? By ignoring the WAFWA Gap Analysis and Plos ONE study, the DEISs fail to recognize the warning that occurs later in the USGS Synthesis, which states: [T]here continues to be emerging science quantifying effects and measuring the efficacy of conservation recommendations. Review of this new information as it becomes available, and incorporating changes, if appropriate, are essential to implementing valid conservation recommendations.32 ? The DEISs ignore studies referenced in the USGS Annotated Bibliography and USGS Synthesis that either support additional protections for sage-grouse habitat or provide evidence against the amendments BLM proposes. There is a substantial body of scientific literature concluding that discrete anthropogenic activities that are present in sagebrush have negative effects on sage-grouse. The extent of these effects varies based on the size, intensity and persistence of the human activity, and can range from displacement to local extirpation of sage-grouse.73 Nonrenewable energy developments, such as fluid mineral leasing, and their supporting infrastructure are a pervasive, and in some cases an increasing presence within the range of sage-grouse.74 There has, however, been a gradual decrease in recommended requirements for fluid mineral leasing within priority areas. * 2011 NTT Report75: For unleased federal fluid mineral estate, close priority areas with very limited exceptions. For leased federal areas, do not allow new surface occupancy in priority habitat, with limited exception. Proposed surface disturbance cannot exceed 3% with limited exception. Disturbance measured within individual priority areas and local project area.76 * 2013 COT Report77: Avoid development in priority areas; identify areas where leasing is not acceptable. If avoidance not possible, development should occur only in non-habitat areas or 72 U. least suitable habitat. Reduce and maintain density of energy structures below which there are no impacts to sage-grouse habitats or do not result in declines to sage-grouse populations.78 * 2015 BLM Plans79: Implement disturbance cap of 3% within individual priority areas and local project area in priority habitat. Implement a density cap of an average of 1 energy and mining facility per 640 acres.80 * 2018 BLM Proposed RMPA.EIS: Numerous additional waivers, exceptions and modifications for drilling in priority areas; restrictions on drilling limited; for Utah, if project design and site conditions indicate a project will improve habitat, exceedances of disturbance and density caps at either project level or individual priority area are allowed.; in Idaho disturbance cap only measured for individual population areas, not project area.81 The 2015 finding by the Fish and Wildlife Service that Greater Sage-Grouse did not need to be listed under the ESA relied heavily on the provisions in the 2015 BLM plans: As previously stated, sage-grouse are sensitive to disturbance, and small amounts of development within sage-grouse habitats can negatively affect sage-grouse population viability. Thus, limiting future disturbances in sage-grouse habitats is an essential component of reducing or eliminating effects related to disturbance, as recommended in the COT Report.82 In addition to the NTT and COT reports, numerous research papers confirm the importance of density and disturbance caps: * 2017 Edmunds study: Modeled density-independent and -dependent population growth across multiple spatial scales relevant to management and conservation. Relatively close fine-scale populations of sage-grouse can trend differently, indicating that large-scale trends may not accurately depict what is occurring across the landscape (e.g., local effects of gas and oil fields may be masked by increasing larger populations). 83 * 2017 Green study (importance of caps): Best models indicated that GRSG responded to energy development with a 1 to 4-year time lag, and well density within 6,400 m of leks best explained GRSG losses. Sagebrush cover and precipitation explained little variation in lek attendance over time. Across Wyoming, decreases in lek attendance were significant at a density of 4 wells per square kilometer, reaching 17 percent per year at 5.24 wells per square kilometer. Current regulations in Core Areas could limit GRSG losses from energy developments, but they may not promote GRSG recovery.84 * 2015 Holloran Study (importance of caps): Use of suitable winter habitat by sage-grouse decreased with increasing density of gas wells within 2.8 km of data loggers. Habitat use also increased with distance to wells and plowed main haul roads, but well density was a better predictor. Effects of anthropogenic activity were evident at lower well densities. Effects of gas development on sage-grouse can be reduced by minimizing well densities and adopting methods that reduce anthropogenic activities.85 * 2015 Fedy study (importance of caps): Birds avoided areas of high well density and nests were not found in areas with greater than 4 wells per km2 and majority of nests (63%) were in areas with = 1 well per km2.86 * 2015 Kirol study (importance of caps): Energy infrastructure had negative effects on habitat use and brood survival, with brood survival decreasing once surface disturbance exceeded 4 percent. Results suggest that reduction of habitat quality was primarily driven by avoidance of energy infrastructure, resulting in primary and secondary source habitat becoming low-occurrence habitat.87 * 2017 Spence Study (importance of caps): Probability of lek collapse inside core areas was positively related to the density of oil and gas wells located outside of core areas at two distances -within 1.6 km and within 4.8 km of the core area boundary.88 * 2018 Holloran Letter (importance of 2015 protections): Recommending management approaches and objectives established in 2015 BLM sage-grouse land use plans be used as minimum standards in sagebrush habitat.89 As explained in the NTT report: Sage grouse exhibit strong site fidelity (loyalty to a particular area even when the area is no longer of value) to seasonal habitats, which includes breeding, nesting, brood rearing, and wintering areas. (Connelly et al. 2004, Connelly et al. 2011b). Adult sage grouse rarely switch between these habitats once they have been selected, limiting their adaptability to changes. NTT at 51 (emphases added). Accordingly, loss of critical wintering habitat could lead to extirpation of sage-grouse populations that solely rely on these areas for the winter. See also FEIS at 3-5 ("Site fidelity in breeding birds could delay population response to habitat changes, and a clear response may require the death of most site-tenacious individuals.") Attached is Attachment 3 to comments submitted by The Wilderness Society, Conservation Colorado, National Audubon Society, Colorado Wildlife Federation, Rocky Mountain Wild, Western Values Project, National Wildlife Federation and Natural Resources Defense Council. For example, in Wyoming, Copeland et al. (2013) projected further sage-grouse population declines with full and rigorous implementation of the Wyoming Core Area plan (which subsequently was implemented in the federal Wyoming amendments and revisions as PHMA). Smith et al. (2017:9) found much lower probability of lek collapse inside PHMA, attributing this to a lower density of energy development in designated PHMA habitats: "This finding was predictable given how Core Areas were delineated to avoid existing energy disturbance and the low densities of disturbance where Core Areas were to be established prior to the [state Sage-Grouse Executive Order] in 2008." Also for Wyoming, Juliusson et al. (2017) modeled the likelihood of future oil and gas development under state and federal development restrictions (but not incorporating prioritization of leasing and development outside Core Areas, and found that with all other restrictions applied, 27.4% of the sage-grouse population would be exposed to baseline or highintensity energy development in Management Zone I (Northern Plains), versus 13.9% of the sage-grouse population in Management Zone II. Spence et al. (2017) found that the likelihood of lek collapse inside PHMAs was roughly half that of leks outside PHMAs, related to comparatively higher levels of surface development outside PHMAs, but also found that leks 53 near the boundary are likely to be negatively affected by development along the PHMA boundary. Edmunds et al. (2016) documented continued declines in most Core Areas, while Gamo and Beck (2017) attributed value to the Core Area effort on the basis of lower levels of drilling and construction in sage-grouse habitats outside Core Areas versus inside them. Based on these studies, RMPAs as originally drafted and approved are expected to slow the decline, but not to halt or reverse it. During the pendency of the sage-grouse RMPA process and in the years that followed, approximately 5 million acres of oil and gas leases were deferred from federal lease auctions across 7 western states due to sage-grouse concerns, including 2.2 million acres in Nevada, 1.6 million acres in Wyoming, 600,000 acres in Montana, and more than 300,000 acres each in Colorado and Utah. This enormous amount of lease deferral represents the sole effective and scientifically sound conservation measure in the ARMPAs, inasmuch as sage-grouse habitats that remain unleased cannot be industrially developed, and their habitats are not subject to further degradation. It is a well-established principle that for sage grouse, there is a time-lag for population responses to habitat impacts, taking two to ten years before population changes become measurable (Holloran 2005, Walker et al. 2007, Harju et al. 2010). As a result, the appropriate decision-point for changing management strategies would actually be 2-10 years before population declines are noted (in the best-case scenario that monitoring reliably recognizes a downturn as caused by a management problem versus population cyclicity, which is also problematic), which means that by the time that adaptive management changes are adopted it is already too late, the damage has been done, and because industrial infrastructure is rarely removed once in place the damage has become effectively irreversible. We appreciate the idea that broad, science-based objectives have a place in determining whether greater sage-grouse habitat is contributing to stable populations. However, no single objective can cover the wide range of variability that occurs across a landscape as vast as the sagebrush sea. The Habitat Objectives Tables (Table 2-2) have been misinterpreted as standards that must be met, likely at the expense of the widest and most adaptable use in the West-livestock grazing. It does not make sense that these objectives be reflected in livestock grazing permittee/lessee terms and conditions if they do not fit the ecosystem in which they are being applied. Because of this, we appreciate those amendments that propose to make clear that habitat objectives must account for local conditions and site variability. This includes the removal of the seven-inch perennial grass and forb height habitat objective. We understand why grass and forb height objectives need to be considered for the health of the bird, but we believe these objectives should vary across the range. We request these changes be made to the habitat objectives tables for each greater sage-grouse RMP amendment. Recent empirical study confirms the established finding that sage-grouse lek attendance is negatively related to oil and gas density, regardless of sagebrush cover and participation.4 Green et al. (2017) examined greater sage-grouse lek attendance, oil and gas well, and habitat and precipitation data from Wyoming over the period 1984 to 2008, and, consistent with numerous prior studies, that lek attendance declines are closely associated with the density of oil and gas development: Oil and gas development correlates well with sage-grouse population declines from 1984 to 2008 in Wyoming, which is supported by other findings (Doherty et al. 2010b, Harju et al. 2010, Hess and Beck 2012, Taylor et al. 2013, Gregory and Beck 2014).

This result suggests that development likely affects recruitment into the breeding population rather than avoidance of wells by adult males or adult survival. Adult sage-grouse are highly philopatric to lek sites (Dalke et al. 1963, Wallestad and Schladweiler 1974, Emmons and Braun 1984, Dunn and Braun 1985, Connelly et al. 2011a), and males typically recruit to the breeding population in 2-3 years. We would expect a delayed response in lek attendance if development affects recruitment, either by reducing fecundity or avoidance of disturbance by nesting females, as adult males die and are not replaced by young males. Priority Habitats were largely designated on the basis of buffers around active lek sites, which encompass the breeding and nesting habitats used by grouse during spring and summer.

It is important to note that a single wellpad or road can cause significant impacts, and these impacts occur even in cases where roads are not visible from the lek site due to intervening terrain (Holloran 2005). Drilling activities can have significant impacts when wells are sited within 3 miles of leks (id.). Manier et al.

The lek is the hub of nesting activity, with most females nesting within 4 to 6 miles of a lek site. Holloran et al. (2007) found that yearling sage grouse avoided otherwise suitable nesting habitat within 930m (almost 0.6 mile) of oil and gas-related infrastructure.

Even a 4-mile NSO buffer would not be large enough to offset all the impacts reviewed above." Importantly, a 0.6-mile lek buffer covers by area only 2% of the nesting habitat encompassed by a 4-mile lek buffer, which takes in approximately 80% of nesting grouse according to the best available science. The BLM's own experts recommended for existing fluid mineral leases that a 4-mile No Surface Occupancy buffer should be applied to leks, with an exception allowed in cases where the entire lease is within 4 miles of a lek, in which case a single wellsite should be permitted in the part of the lease most distal to the lek (NTT 2011). This recommendation is reinforced by a similar recommendation from western state agency biologists, who also recommended a 4-mile No Surface Occupancy buffer (Apa et al. 2008). According to Taylor et al (2012: 27), in a study commissioned by BLM, Second, female sage-grouse that visit a lek use an approximately 9-mi (15-km) radius surrounding the lek for nesting; a 2-mi (3.2-km) radius encompasses only 35-50% of nests associated with the lek (Holloran and Anderson 2005, Tack 2009). While a lek provides an important center of breeding activity, and a conspicuous location at which to count birds, its size is merely an index to the population dynamics in the surrounding habitat. Thus attempting to protect a lek, without protecting the surrounding habitat, provides little protection at all. To the extent that BLM's existing ARMPAs and revised RMPs ignore the recommendations of its own experts, they are arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion. BLM should rectify this legal deficiency if the ARMPAs are further amended. In the context of the original Greater Sage-Grouse RMP amendment and revision effort, BLM's own Draft EIS analysis has supported 4-mile No Surface Occupancy buffers to be applied as Conditions of Approval to existing fluid mineral leases. The Wyoming Nine-Plan DEIS states, "Walker et al. (2007) recommends a buffer distance of at least 4.0 miles containing extensive stands of sagebrush habitat for breeding populations to persist."

For the Buffalo RMP revision, BLM's analysis of the science states, 73 "Energy development within two miles of leks is projected to reduce the average probability of lek persistence from 87% to 5% (Walker et al. 2007a). Current research suggests that impacts to leks from energy development are discernible out to a minimum of 4 miles, and that some leks within this radius have been extirpated as a direct result of energy development (Apa et al. 2008). Even with a timing limitation on construction activities, Greater Sage-Grouse avoid nesting in oil and gas fields because of the activities associated with operations and production" Buffalo RMP Revision DEIS at 367.For Montana, BLM observes, "Impacts from energy development occur at distances between 3 and 4 miles. Impacts to leks caused by energy development would be most severe near the lek." HiLine RMP Revision DEIS at 4-135. Manier et al. (2014) undertook a comprehensive analysis of the available science on lek buffers, and concluded that the appropriate range for lek buffer protections was 3.1 to 5 miles, which encompasses and buttresses BLM's earlier NTT (2011) expert recommendations. State agencies and their wildlife experts have long pointed out the flaws in smaller lek buffers and the need for 4-mile No Surface Occupancy buffers around leks. According to the Nevada Division of Wildlife, "…the current NSO distance is 0.6 miles, which is not based on the best available science (see Coates et al. 2013 which suggests a buffer distance of 5.0 kilometers)." NDOW comments on Nevada -Northeastern California DEIS, January 14, 2014, analysis chart 1. Apa et al. (2008, emphasis added) reviews the best available science by a team of state sage grouse biologists, and states, "Yearling female greater sage-grouse avoid nesting in areas within 0.6 miles of wellpads, and brood-rearing females avoid areas within 0.6 miles of producing wells. This suggests a 0.6-mile buffer around all suitable nesting and brood-rearing habitat is required to minimize impacts to females during these seasonal periods." This report further clarifies, "These suggest that all areas within at least 4-miles of a lek should be considered nesting and brood-rearing habitats in the absence of mapping." Thus, by combining these two recommended buffers, state experts in this report in effect recommended a 4.6-mile NSO buffer around active leks. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has also pointed out the inadequacy of smaller lek buffers. For the Utah RMP effort, the agency states, "There is substantial scientific information that shows that impacts of human disturbance (e.g. oil and gas drilling) to sage-grouse remain discernible out to distances > 4 miles of a lek." Attachment 2, USFWS comments on Utah Conservation Plan 7/12/12, at 3. The agency goes on to conclude, "In summary, we recommend avoiding permanent structures within a 4 mile lek buffer…at all times. Exceptions may be appropriate for the placement of permanent structures on non-habitat areas within the 4 mile lek buffer if it can be determined that the location of these structures will not impact nesting sagegrouse." USFWS comments Utah Conservation Plan, 5/8/13 at 8. In Nevada, the USFWS states, "We recommend a year-round lek buffer of 4.0 miles." 74 BLM's own NEPA analysis indicates that proposed lek buffers are inadequate. In the Nevada -Northeastern California DEIS, BLM states, Impacts on GRSG accrue over varying distances from origin depending on the type of development: ? Energy extraction such as oil and gas, geothermal, and plan of operation mining at 11.8 miles (19 kilometers) based on direct impacts of field development, including associated infrastructure, noise, lighting, and traffic (Johnson et al. 2011; Taylor et al. 2012) Nevada -Northeastern California Greater Sage-grouse RMP Amendment DEIS at 605. BLM Wyoming Draft EIS analysis arrives at the same conclusion: "Buffer distances from 0.5 to two miles from oil and gas infrastructure have been shown to be inadequate to prevent declines of birds from leks (Walker et al. 2007). Studies have shown that greater distances, anywhere from two to four miles, are required for viable Greater Sage-Grouse populations to persist (Connelly et al. 2000, Holloran and Anderson 2005, Walker et al. 2007)." Wyoming Greater Sage-grouse RMP Amendment DEIS at 4-335. According to Apa et al. (2008), "Buffer sizes of 0.25 mi., 0.5 mi., 0.6 mi., and 1.0 mi. result in estimated lek persistence of 5%, 11%, 14%, and 30%." BLM concludes, "Studies have shown that greater distances, anywhere from two to four miles, are required for viable Greater Sage-Grouse populations to persist." Wyoming Greater Sage-grouse RMP Amendment DEIS at 4-335. For these reasons, the application of a 0.6-mile lek buffer is arbitrary and capricious, violates BLM Sensitive Species Policy, and will contribute to further population declines in Core Areas that will contribute to the need to protect the greater sage grouse under the Endangered Species Act. Holloran (2005) undertook an empirical test of the adequacy of 0.25-mile No Surface Occupancy buffers and 2-mile Timing Limitation Stipulations, and determined that sage grouse in the Pinedale Anticline and Jonah Fields would be completely extirpated within 19 years of the study as a result of full-field development with this package of protections applied. BLM's NEPA analysis for a recent Miles City Field Office oil and gas leasing EA provides a thorough synopsis: "Sage grouse are offered species specific protections through a stipulation. Under Alternative B, ¼ mile NSO buffers and 2 mile timing buffers would apply where relevant. Based on research, these stipulations for sage grouse are considered ineffective to ensure that sage grouse can persist within fully developed areas. With regard to existing restrictive stipulations applied by the BLM, (Walker et al. 2007a) research has demonstrated that the 0.4-km (0.25 miles) NSO lease stipulation is insufficient to conserve breeding sage-grouse populations in fully developed gas fields because this 75 buffer distance leaves 98 percent of the landscape within 3.2 km (2 miles) open to fullscale development. Full-field development of 98 percent of the landscape within 3.2 km (2 miles) of leks in a typical landscape in the Powder River Basin reduced the average probability of lek persistence from 87 percent to 5 percent (Walker et al. 2007a). Other studies also have assessed the efficacy of existing BLM stipulations for sage grouse. Impacts to leks from energy development are most severe near the lek, and remained discernable out to distances more than 6 km (3.6 miles) (Holloran 2005, Walker et al. 2007a), and have resulted in the extirpation of leks within gas fields (Holloran 2005, Walker et al. 2007a). Holloran (2005) shows that lek counts decreased with distance to the nearest active drilling rig, producing well, or main haul road, and that development influence counts of displaying males to a distance of between 4.7 and 6.2 km (2.9 and 3.9 miles). All well-supported models in Walker et al. (2007a) indicate a strong effect of energy development, estimated as proportion of development within either 0.8 km (0.5 miles) or 3.2 km (2 miles), on lek persistence. Buffer sizes of 0.25 mi., 0.5 mi., 0.6 mi. and 1.0 mi. result in an estimated lek persistence of 5 percent, 11 percent, 14 percent, and 30 percent. Lek persistence in the absence of CBNG development averages approximately 85 percent. Models with development at 6.4 km (4 miles) had considerably less support, but the regression coefficient indicated that impacts were still apparent out to 6.4 km (4 miles) (Walker et al. 2007a). Tack (2009) found impacts of energy development on lek abundances (numbers of males per lek) out to 7.6 miles." Miles City October 2014 Oil and Gas Leasing EA, Environmental Assessment DOIBLM-MT-C020-2014-0091-EA, May 19, 2014 at 60. For most states, BLM purported to apply lek buffer distances in accordance with Manier et al. (2014) at the project stage of the NEPA approval process. These typically are set at 3.1 miles for roads and energy infrastructure, 2 miles for tall structures, and 1.2 miles for low structures, and represent the lowest (least protective) end of the protection spectrum described by Manier et al. (2014). Green et al. (2017) found that oil and gas development in proximity to leks contributed to a 2.5% per year decline in sage-grouse populations, and that the 3.1-mile buffer best explained these energy-driven declines, but it is important to note that these researchers neglected to test development densities at buffer distances larger than 3.1 miles in radius. We are concerned that these buffer distances (and also the 1.2-mile standard for low structures) are inappropriately small (with the possible exception of the road buffer) because while they be adequate to protect breeding grouse while on the lek based on the best available science, they will allow these disruptive and damaging features to be located in the midst of prime nesting habitat, which extends 5.3 miles from the lek site (Holloran and Anderson 2005). Furthermore, "Justifiable departures to decrease or increase from these distances, based on local data, best available science, landscape features, and other existing protections (e.g., land use allocations, state regulations) may be appropriate for determining activity impacts." See, e.g., Idaho/Southwest Montana RMPA FEIS at DD-1. Statements like these completely undermine the certainty of implementation of lek buffers, rendering them completely discretionary. Because the nesting period is equally sensitive and equally important to survival of and recruitment to A limit of 3% human surface disturbance per square-mile section is the minimum necessary standard for preventing habitat abandonment by sage grouse. Knick et al. (2013) found that 99% of active leks across the western half of the sage grouse's range were surrounded by lands with 3% or less human development. Decker et al. (2017) found a similar result in Colorado, with a linear decrease in sage grouse lek populations once surface disturbance increased above the 2.5% threshold. Preliminary results from Kirol et al. (in prep.) indicate that the vast majority of sage-grouse were found in habitats with <1% surface disturbance. Disturbance density can also affect survival; Kirol et al. (2015a) found that brood survival for sage-grouse began to decline significantly once disturbance density hit the 4% threshold. The vast majority was surrounded by much less disturbance. Copeland et al. (2013) found that if all of the State of Wyoming sage grouse policy provisions (which include a 5% disturbance cap calculated using a Disturbance Density Calculation Tool) were implemented fully and to the letter, that a 9 to 15% decline in greater sage grouse populations would still occur statewide, including a 6 to 9% decline within designated Core Areas (where the 5% disturbance cap would be applied). There is no scientific evidence at all indicating that sage grouse can tolerate a greater percentage of surface disturbance. In particular, the 5% cap on disturbance proposed for the Wyoming RMP amendment for Core Areas and Connectivity Areas been shown to be effective by no scientific study, ever. Scientific research has determined that one energy site per square mile is the density threshold at which significant impacts to sage-grouse populations begin to be measured (Copeland et al. 2013). Tack (2009) found that this study in Montana's Milk River Basin, well densities of one per square mile also we correlated with a very low probability of a lek being large (see Figure 9, p. 43). The analysis of Copeland et al. (2013) found that a statewide analysis of well densities revealed population decline curves very close to the earlier studies by Holloran (2005), but also noted that a 1 wellpad per square mile density of development correlated to approximately 18% decline in sage grouse lek population (see Figure 4). So one wellpad per square mile definitely is not a zero-impact threshold. Indeed, Garman (2018) found that clustering 8 wells per pad using directional drilling in the Atlantic Rim coalbed methane project, which would meet the one-pad-per-square-mile threshold required for PHMA, still left comparatively little habitat within the Project Area outside the ecological zone of influence of roads and wellpads. The onesite-per-square-mile-section is a threshold that should not be subject to waiver, modification, or exception. BLM should not reduce protections for greater sage-grouse on GHMA in Idaho because the agency does not have enough information about some Idaho sage-grouse populations to reasonably predict what impacts of reducing protections will be. One area of concern is the East-Central Idaho population of sage-grouse, where BLM Idaho has proposed oil and gas leasing twice in 2018 and then temporarily deferred leasing after conservation groups filed administrative protests and litigated. In 2012, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service convened a "Conservation Objectives Team" of Service and state representatives with expertise in greater sage-grouse science and conservation. In 2013, that body issued a Conservation Objectives Team Report (COT Report) evaluating the threats to the species and recommending conservation measures. The COT Report described the East-Central Idaho sage-grouse population as "isolated/small size" and "high risk" with a "low probability of persistence" COT Report at 22, 76-77. Such a greater sage-grouse population is nevertheless 10 Green, Adam et al., Investigating Impacts of Oil and Gas Development on Greater Sage-Grouse, Journal of Wildlife Management, doi: 10.1002/jwmg.21179 (2016). 85 valuable because it helps ensure the species continues to exist by contributing to its redundancy, representation, and resilience. See COT Report at 12. Preserving peripheral populations is essential to arresting the decline of greater sage-grouse toward extinction and Endangered Species Act listing. See COT Report at 12-13. The COT Report further stated: [L]ittle information is available on [East Central Idaho] sage-grouse populations other than some limited location and attendance data on a few leks. No lek routes have been established within this area that would allow consistent monitoring of sage-grouse populations. This lack of data is largely due to very difficult access in most years during winter and spring. COT Report at 76. This paucity of information about the East-Central Idaho/East Idaho Uplands population of sage-grouse is well known to resource managers. Due to insufficient population information, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game closed the East Idaho Uplands area of the state to greater sage-grouse hunting in 2008. It has not been reopened since. See 2015 Idaho Sage-grouse Statewide Report at 16, 2016 Sage-grouse Rules at 2 and 2017 Sage-grouse Rules at 2.11 The Sage-grouse Conservation Plan prepared by the East Idaho Uplands Sage-grouse Working Group noted, "There is a need for better information related to population status and trends. Status, survival and trend data relative to sage-grouse populations in the East Idaho Uplands SGPA [Sage-grouse Planning Area] is lacking." EIU Sage-grouse Conservation Plan at 29. The Conservation Plan also stated that much of the area had not been surveyed for sage-grouse or had been only minimally surveyed by air without follow-up ground surveys; due to the lack of consistent lek counts and lek count routes, there was no index to sage-grouse breeding trend. EIU Sage-grouse Conservation Plan at 29. Furthermore, "It is unknown if sage-grouse in the East Idaho Uplands are migratory and if there is one population or multiple populations occurring in different parts of the area." EIU Sage-grouse Conservation Plan at 30. Moreover, the Plan stated there is no information available about seasonal habitat quality, the population is believed to be isolated from other sage-grouse populations, and there may be sage-grouse population isolations within the East Idaho Uplands Planning Area. EIU Sage-grouse Conservation Plan at 30, 31. The 2015 Idaho Sage-grouse Local Working Groups Statewide Annual Report, which was published in August 2016 by the Idaho Sage-grouse Advisory Committee Technical Assistance Team, demonstrates that five years later, these data deficiencies still existed. "Lack of information" was listed as a threat to the East Idaho Uplands greater sage-grouse population: "Most of EIU [East Idaho Uplands] does not have detailed information on populations, movements, etc." 2015 Idaho Sage-grouse Statewide Report at 20.12 11 The 2018-2019 Idaho sage-grouse season will not be set until August 2018. See Idaho Department of Game and Fish, Upland Game, Turkey & Furbearer, 2018 & 2019 Seasons & Rules at 9. Available at https://idfg.idaho.gov/sites/default/ files/seasons-rules-upland-birds-2018-2019.pdf. 12 The 2015 statewide report (published in August 2016) is the most recent. No Idaho Sage-grouse Local Working Group Statewide Report has been published for 2016 or 2017. Email communications between Ann Moser (Idaho Department of Fish and Game) and Kelly Fuller (Western Watersheds Project), December 19, 2017. 86 Oil and gas leasing and exploratory well drilling in this area, near Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge, has occurred in the past, despite BLM's lack of site-specific greater sagegrouse population information for this area. Attachment 6. Although BLM has deferred oil and gas leasing in this area twice in 2018, the Expressions of Interest that led to this area being scheduled for leasing are still listed as "pending" in BLM's National Fluids Lease Sale System database as of July 17, 2018. Its impact analysis must also account for the primacy of cheatgrass invasion in determining patterns of rangeland fire. According to BLM's past NEPA analysis, "The positive feedback loop between fire and invasive plant species may be the greatest impact on fire management and GRSG (Abatzoglou and Kolden 2011)." Nevada -Northeastern California Greater Sage Grouse RMP Amendment DEIS at 701. BLM further elucidates, 87 In Oregon 19th and early 20th century grazing practices, along with introduction and spread of invasive plant species and the practice of fire suppression in the 20th century, have all contributed to fire suppression and to increasingly destructive wildfires. Oregon Greater Sage Grouse RMP Amendment DEIS at 4-10. BLM's past NEPA analysis concedes, "In the absence of cheatgrass, Wyoming big sagebrush sites can take 150 years to recover." Nevada -Northeast California Greater Sage Grouse RMP Amendment DEIS at 608. When cheatgrass is present, it can take over following disturbance, forming a monoculture characterized by unnaturally frequent fire return intervals that can effectively prevent the recovery of sagebrush and perennial grasses on a long-term if not permanent basis. For Oregon, BLM states, "In Wyoming big sagebrush sites, full recovery to pre-burn sagebrush canopy cover conditions will take over 100 years (Cooper 2007);…." Oregon Greater Sage Grouse RMP Amendment DEIS at 3-70. More generally, BLM states, "Sagebrush recovers slowly from fire; most species do not resprout but must be replenished by winddispersed seed from adjacent unburned stands or seeds in the soil. Depending on the species and the size of a burn, sagebrush can reestablish itself within five years, but a return to a full pre-burn community cover can take 50 to over 100 years (Baker 2011)." Oregon Greater Sage Grouse RMP Amendment DEIS at 4-10. For these reasons, BLM must incorporate science-based measures to reduce the spread of cheatgrass, including rest from livestock grazing, into any future sage-grouse plan amendments, and must also rest burned areas for two years or more from livestock grazing, to allow native perennial grasses to recover and to reduce the distribution of weed seeds on newly burned areas. Smith et al. (2017:9) found much lower probability of lek collapse inside PHMA, attributing this to a lower density of energy development in designated PHMA habitats: "This finding was predictable given how Core Areas were delineated to avoid existing energy disturbance and the low densities of disturbance where Core Areas were to be established prior to the [state Sage-Grouse Executive Order] in 2008." Also for Wyoming, Juliusson et al. (2017) modeled the likelihood of future oil and gas development under state and federal development restrictions (but not incorporating prioritization of leasing and development outside Core Areas, and found that with all other restrictions applied, 27.4% of the sage-grouse population would be exposed to baseline or highintensity energy development in Management Zone I (Northern Plains), versus 13.9% of the sage-grouse population in Management Zone II.Spence et al. (2017) found that the likelihood of lek collapse inside PHMAs was roughly half that of leks outside PHMAs, related to comparatively higher levels of surface development outside PHMAs, but also found that leks near the boundary are likely to be negatively affected by development along the PHMA boundary. Edmunds et al. (2016) documented continued declines in most Core Areas, while Gamo and Beck (2017) attributed value to the Core Area effort on the basis of lower levels of drilling and construction in sage-grouse habitats outside Core Areas versus inside them. Based on these studies, RMPAs as originally drafted and approved are expected to slow the decline, but not to halt or reverse it. During the pendency of the sage-grouse RMPA process and in the years that followed, approximately 5 million acres of oil and gas leases were deferred from federal lease auctions across 7 western states due to sage-grouse concerns, including 2.2 million acres in Nevada, 1.6 million acres in Wyoming, 600,000 acres in Montana, and more than 300,000 acres each in Colorado and Utah. This enormous amount of lease deferral represents the sole effective and scientifically-sound conservation measure in the ARMPAs, inasmuch as sage-grouse habitats that remain unleased cannot be industrially developed, and their habitats are not subject to further degradation. Wyoming Greater Sage-grouse RMP Amendments Draft EIS at 4-276. Wisdom et al. (2011) found that lands within 3.1 miles of transmission lines and highways had an elevated rate of lek abandonment. Nonne et al. (2011) found that raven abundance increased along the Falcon-Gondor powerline corridor in Nevada both during the construction period, and long-term after powerline construction activities had ceased. Braun et al. (2002) reported that 40 leks with a power line within 0.25 mile of the lek site had significantly slower population growth rates than unaffected leks, which was attributed to increased raptor predation. Dinkins (2013) documented sage grouse avoidance of powerlines not just during the nesting period but also during early and late brood-rearing. LeBeau et al. (2014) found that sage grouse avoided habitats within 2.9 miles of transmission lines during the brood-rearing period. Hansen et al. (2016) documented negligible additional avoidance of a powerline co-located with an existing transmission line in low-quality wintering habitats in Utah, and stated (at p. 184, "existing transmission line corridors located in poor-quality winter habitat are likely already avoided by sage-grouse, and co-locating additional lines within these corridors may dampen the effects of new tall structures on the landscape in the years immediately following construction." Dinkins et al. (2014) documented no spatial avoidance, but lower hen survival in areas with higher powerline density. Shirk et al. (2015) found that colocating several transmission lines beside each other resulted in a complete barrier to sagegrouse migration and dispersal in central Washington. The National Technical Team (NTT 2011) recommended that Priority Habitats be exclusion areas for overhead powerlines, and that General Habitats should be avoidance areas for overheads lines.

We are concerned that the Draft EIS does not provide sufficient information to fully assess the impacts of the proposed action. For this reason, the EPA has rated the Draft EIS/RMPA as Environmental Concerns - Insufficient Information -(EC-2). The description of the EPA' s rating system is available at: https://www.epa.gov/nepa/environmental-impactstatementrating-system-criteria. The enclosed detailed comments include recommendations for improving the assessment and disclosure of the Proposed Action's expected impacts to greater sage-grouse and habitat; however, we defer to the expertise of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and appropriate state wildlife management agencies regarding the extent to which those impacts would be beneficial or detrimental to the species. Specifically, we recommend improvements in the analysis of the potential impacts from increased oil and gas development for the Proposed Action, and updating the mitigation section to reflect any changes resulting from public comments. Wyoming Greater Sage-grouse RMP Amendments Draft EIS at 4-276.

However, the BLM used 2012-13 data in their analyses for the 2015 land use plan amendments, and it cannot be denied that an extensive amount of new 1 information, project development, and other factors have been developed or occurred since 2013. This seemingly violates BLM Planning Handbook and NEPA procedures. Scientific Flaws with the Plan Amendment and Listing Decision: In addition to the missteps related to process, the Plan Amendments are substantively flawed. The key agency reports (the Reports) underpinning the Plan Amendments, as well as the earlier warranted but precluded GRSG listing decision, were plagued with conflicts of interest, bias and selective citation. They ignored the most relevant factors to grouse populations (weather, predation and hunter harvest) in favor of draconian restrictions that will cost jobs and harm local communities without corresponding benefits to the species. The 2018 LUPAs fail to acknowledge the scientific shortcomings in the National Technical Team ("NTT") Report, the Conservation Objectives Team ("COT") Report, the U.S. Geological Society ("USGS") Monograph, and the Manier et al. Buffers Report (collectively, the "Reports"), much less redress the resulting inaccuracies in the agency decisions. DOI and the U.S. Department of Agriculture must recognize critical errors in the Reports and the prescriptions they support. Because future agency management decisions and potential litigation continue to turn to the Reports for support, addressing the scientific foundation is crucial. Accordingly, DOI should include this statement in the forthcoming amendments and records of decision ("RODs"): The NTT Report, the COT Report, the USGS Monograph and Manier, et al. 2014 (collectively "the Reports") were heavily relied upon in the 2010 listing decision on GRSG as well as the LUPAs and corresponding RODs. Since then, the science and understanding on GRSG has evolved and some significant shortcomings with the Reports have come to light. Management prescriptions from the Reports should be viewed with caution and tempered with the best available information, including specifically state and local science and knowledge. Detailed Data Quality Act challenges based on these issues were never adequately answered. In 2015, a coalition of 20 local governments (including the Counties) as well as diverse agricultural and energy interests (collectively, the Petitioners) undertook an independent scientific review of the Reports. The reviews uncovered significant errors, omissions and biases in the Reports that have contaminated subsequent policy and management actions based thereon. In several Data Quality Act challenges, (the Challenges), Petitioners documented hundreds of pages of flaws with: * 3 percent disturbance caps * Density caps of 1 disturbance per 640 acres * Lek buffers * Required Design Features * No Surface Occupancy areas (NSOs) in priority habitat * Implementation of an avoid-minimize-compensate policy * Net conservation gains * Sagebrush canopy cover * The warranted but precluded listing decision for GRSG The Reports erroneously ignore accurate population data and adopt flawed modeling approaches that have consistently failed to accurately predict populations. This selective use of science is wholly misleading and assumes GRSG populations are in decline despite evidence to the contrary. The Reports ignore natural population fluctuations; single out human-driven activities for alleged declines (but exclude the significance of hunter harvest); and overlook actual threats to GRSG such as predation. The Reports fail to meet the standards of quality, integrity, objectivity and utility required by the Data Quality Act, as well DOI's standards of scientific integrity and transparency. DOI failed to address these shortcomings. The National Technical Team Challenge was 97 pages in length with four exhibits for a total of 197 pages of detailed issues. The COT Challenge was 88 pages with four exhibits for a total of 159 pages. The Monograph Challenge was 99 pages with three exhibits for a total of 332 pages. The Buffers Challenge was 41 pages. Nonetheless, the agencies virtually ignored these shortcomings and issued only a four-page response to the cumulative 729-page Challenges, and a two-page response to subsequent appeals. Moreover, in the NEPA documents, the agencies hardly recognized the existence of the Challenges, let alone addressed their merits. BLM and the USFS failed to address the substance and detail in these challenges and provided little if any rationale for their misplaced use of the Reports and the Monograph. No corrective actions were taken nor were adequate disclosures of these flaws recognized or addressed as required by implementing regulations for NEPA. See 40 C.F.R. § 1502.9(b). In sum, these misplaced and unscientific management restrictions will negatively impact the economies and future viability of countless communities, small businesses, and family farms and ranches as well as efforts to conserve GRSG and we request BLM address the above bulleted points. The purpose of this letter is to underscore recommendations made in a letter sent to you on Octob~13, 2017 by members of the sage-grouse science community in light of the recently completed U.S. Geo~ical Survey (USGS) literature review and the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) May 2018 draft Land UZPlan (LUP) amendments. Conclusions reached by the USGS in their synthesis of sage-grouse science (SynthdSi'S) published since release of the BLM and U.S. Forest Service's LUPs in 2015 suggest that if these agencies proceed with amendments to those LUPs they must do so with a narrow, science-based focus. Unfortunately, we do not believe BLM's recently released draft Environmental Impact Statements (DEISs) reflect such a targeted focus. The Department of Interior (DOl) and the u.s. Department of Agriculture (USDA) must recognize shortcomings in the key reports relied upon to craft the BlM's 2015 Record of Decision (ROD) which include the NIT and COT Reports and the USGS Monograph and the prescriptions they support. Agency management decisions and potential litigation will surely turn towards the Reports for support. Absent recognition of shortcomings, land management is sure to be entangled in controversy for years to come. Accordingly, we urge DOl to include this statement in the forthcoming amendments and records of decision (RODs): The NIT Report, the COT Report, the USGS Monograph and Manier, et al. 2014 (collectively "the Reports") were heavily relied upon in the 2010 listing decisian on GRSG as well as the LUPAs and correspanding RODs. Since then, the science and understanding on GRSG has evolved and some significant shartcomings with the Reports have come to light. Management prescriptions from the Reports should be viewed with caution and tempered with the best available information including specifically state and local science and knowledge. Most importantly, none of the information contained in the COT Report, NIT Report or the USGS Monograph specifically addressed the highly unique landforms, variable habitat or naturally fragmented habitat that exists in the Parachute-Piceance-Roan population found in Garfield County. The terrain in our County that hosts Greater Sage Grouse is a naturally fragmented habitat that varies radically over short distances to include severely undulating topography, steep slopes and deep canyons, dark timber, sage brush on the ridges and a complex range of vegetation types. These reports relied on above are void of scientific specificity regarding Garfield County's highly unique terrain. The BLM is required to contemplate new science since the BLM's 2015 Record of Decision to better inform policy in the RMPA. Rather, the BLM has only relied on a limited scope of new scientific information contained in a report prepared by the US Geologic Survey. This report ignores a vast body of additional science that provides beneficial analysis on grazing, predation, climate / weather impacts, high-resolution mapping and the value of including local working group activity. This a tremendous shortcoming where the BLM ignored the opportunity to approach the management of the impacts to the species that could have been informed by a wide net of best available science; rather, it appears the best available science has been cherry picked thereby excluding highly important elements of could and should contribute to a more robust and effective adaptive management program for the benefit of the species. We ask that the following information be considered in the EIS so that there is a more complete set of relevant new scientific information as best available science: A. THE IMPORTANVE OF HIGH RESOLUTION MAPPING TO PRIORITIZING SAGE-GROUSE CONSERVATION EFFORTS Coates, P.S., Casazza, M.L., Brussee, B.E., Ricca, M.A., Gustafson, K.B., Sanchez-Chopitea, E., Mauch, K., Niell, L., Gardner, S., Espinosa, S., and Delehanty, D.l., 2016, Spatially explicit modeling of annual and seasonal habitat for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus uraphasianus) in Nevada and northeastern California-An updated decision-support tool for management: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2016-1080, 160 p., https:/ldol.org/10.3133/ofr20161080. This revised USGS report utilized new data mUltiple sources, including updated GRSG telemetry locations, high-resolution vegetation maps, and seasonal habitat suitability indices. As a result of this higher resolution mapping, the authors note that, "GRSG habitat area increased by 6.5 percent compared to findings in the earlier report, with increases of a similar magnitude in core, priority, and general GRSG habitat management categories." The significance of this study is that it underscores the importance of producing modern, reproducible, high-resolution sage-grouse habitat maps to inform and prioritize conservation efforts far better that broad brush stroke approaches used in the development of the Northwestern Colorado RMP. A similar high-resolution habitat mapping effort is underway in Northwestern Colorado. ACCOUNTING FOR CLIMATIC VARIATION IN POPULATION RESPONSES IN ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT This paper is significant to northwestern Colorado but not for what the authors may have intended. Genetic and habitat connectivity analyses reveal the highest high levels of genetic and spatial connectivity among sage-grouse subpopulations were found within Sage-grouse management zone 2, comprising the greater Wyoming basin population which includes Northwestern Colorado. These results are contrary to and refute the basic assumptions of Garton et al. (2009, 2011), that assumed far greater genetic isolation and were used to produce the population extinction predictions relied upon by the USFWS in their 2010 ESA listing decision, management subsequent reports and recommendations (including the COT and subsequent BlM RMPs).

Tronstad, L., G. Jones, M. Andersen and G. Beauvais. 2018. Modeling and mapping the distribution of invertebrate prey used by Greater Sage-grouse during the early brood rearing period: Report of a pilot project. Report prepared for the Wyoming landscape Conservation Initiative by the Wyoming Natural Diversity Database, University of Wyoming, laramie, Wyoming. Previous research on sage-grouse habitat evaluations has focused on vegetation and topographic components. However, invertebrate prey, which is strongly affected by climate and local weather, is vital to chick survival and sage-grouse hens typically prefer brooding habitat with higher densities of invertebrates. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between vegetation and invertebrate species composition and density. This approach is significant because tracking annual variation and mUltiyear trends in invertebrate populations potentially provides a locally-based predictor of annual chick survival and therefore, population trends (i.e. spring conditions where a warm, moist spring may have far more invertebrates available compared to a cold, dry spring, and this will influence annual cohort size.).

BioArxiv (https:lldoi.org/10.1101/028274 The significance of this research to adaptive management in the Northwestern Colorado RMP is that it was the first study to quantitatively evaluate the relative effects of regional climatic variation (as indexed by the PDO) and oil and gas surface disturbance on sage grouse population dynamics, at local and population-level scales. This research underscores the need for accounting for climatic variation in understanding sage-grouse responses to human development and management actions, including the use of population "triggers" in adaptive management. THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL WORKING GROUPS AND KNOWLEDGE FOR EFFECTIVE SAGEGROUSE MANAGEMENT Belton, LR., S.N.

Human-Wildlife Interactions: 11(3): 274-286. Available at: https:lldlgltalcommons.usu.edu/hwl/volll/lss3/6 The significance of these two papers, one from Utah and the other from Wyoming, is that they demonstrate the value of participatory research and tailored management done at local (working group) scale, which benefits greater sage-grouse conservation efforts both locally and regionally. The collaborative, local working group approach as implemented in Utah and Wyoming, contrasts sharply with the one-size fits all, top-down management prescriptions as proposed in the BlM via the Northwest Colorado RMP. As noted by Christiansen and Belton (2017), the strength of the local working group approach is that it is "reliant on the ability of diverse participants, who often hold adversarial viewpoints, to develop and maintain positive working relationships in seeking to achieve mutually agreeable goals. We believe the Wyoming model has potential to succeed in an era of political polarization." THE IMPORTANCE OF MANAGING RAVENS: A DIRECT THREAT TO SAGE-GROUSE SURVIVAL Peebles, L.W., M.R. Conover, and J.B. Dinkins. 2017. Adult sage-grouse numbers rise following raven removal or an increase in precipitation. Wildlife Society Bulletin 41(3). Available at https:lldol.org/10.1002/wsb_788 This paper is significant to the Northwestern Colorado RMP because it underscores the importance of incorporating climatic (or long term weather) indices in any evaluation of population response to any management prescriptions, in this case, decreasing raven numbers to increase sage grouse survival. This approach is especially important for effective adaptive management of sage-grouse populations northwestern Colorado in general, and Gafield County in particular, where habitat is naturally fragmented and sage-grouse are found at low density, or both. The significance of this paper to the Northwestern Colorado RMP is twofold. First, the authors report that reducing anthropogenic subsidies (i.e. food and water sources, open landfills) is likely to be most effective in reducing raven densities over the long term, and thus decrease raven predation on sage·grouse nests and chicks. And second, the authors report that because livestock and animal husbandry operations provide indirect food and water subsidies that are exploited by ravens, increasing their distance from sage-grouse nesting and brood rearing habitat will further decrease predation on sage-grouse and increase overall population productivity. These recommendations are critical to Northwestern Colorado where the threat of predation from ravens us under-addressed and other restrictive land management measures are favored by the BLM. Peebles, L.W. and M.R. Conover. 2017. Winter ecology and spring dispersal of common ravens in Wyoming. Western North American Naturalist 77(3): 293308. Repeated research has shown that ravens have emerged as the primary predation threat to sagegrouse. However, land management agencies, including the BLM have continued to advocate for various restrictions on human activities (including NSO and setbacks) despite the fact that have not been proven to have a net positive effect on sage-grouse at local or population scales. The paper by Peebles and Conover (2017) is significant to the question of how to directly reduce local raven populations in order to mitigate the primary threat to sage-grouse eggs and chicks: determine raven dispersal distances and target winter roosts at landfills within range of sage-grouse nesting and brood rearing habitat. Because of the close proximity of landfills to BLM administered sagegrouse habitat in northwestern Colorado, this adaptive and highly effective approach should not be ignored or discounted in favor of one-size fits all management prescriptions that fails to address this threat. Peebles, loW. and M.R.

Because of the close proximity of landfills to BlM administered sage-grouse habitat in northwestern Colorado, this adaptive and highly effective approach should not be ignored or discounted in favor of one-size fits all management prescriptions that fails to address this threat. Additionally, as another example of the BlM's failure to meaningfully coordinate with local governments, the RMPA did not consider the predator control policies found in the Garfield County Greater Sage Grouse Conservation Plan of 2014, as amended and provided here: Section 5: Predotion of sage-grouse eggs, juveniles, and adults occurs naturally, but can increase in association with human development, unless precautions are undertaken. Scientific research has shown that the predators on sage grouse are generalists, meaning that they prey on other species as well, and in some cases their populations are subsidized by human sources of food. Sage-grouse eggs are preyed upon by red foxes, coyotes, badgers, ravens, and (sometimes) block-billed magpies. Common predators of juvenile and adult sage-grouse include golden eagles, prairie folcons (as well as other raptors), coyotes, badgers, red fox and bobcats. Younger birds (especially brood$), may be preyed upon by raven, red fox, northern harrier, ground squirrel, snakes, and weasels. However, of these predators, research has shown that ravens are the most abundant and have the greatest impact on the populotions studied. While predation on sage grouse occurs at all stages of the life cycle, it is predation on nests and broods that is generally recognized as having the largest deleterious effect on annual survivorship and recruitment in populations. Adding to this problem is the fact that predators, such as ravens, are subsidized by humans to the point where they exceed historic levels in some areas by as much as 1,500%. In such cases, management actions, especially where predators like ravens are abundant and sage grouse mortolity is high (such as in the Plan Area), may be needed to ensure that sage-grouse populations are not depressed by a known and potentially mitigated source of mortality. Ravens are clever and highly adaptable in their behavior. They use communication and group foraging which allows them to opportunistically exploit food resources associoted with humans (e.g., landfills, trosh, road kill, unottended food, and carrion from livestock operations). In contrast, sage-grouse are very stereotypic in their behavior and rely on cryptic coloration, which makes them vulnerable to predotion by rovens. As a result of these and other unintended food subsidies, raven populations have greatly expanded in the West. This, in turn, hos impacted many species, including desert tortoises, marbled murrelets, least terns, California condors, and sage-grouse. While reducing human-supplied food subsidies to predators is an essential part of any management strategy, it may not be effective unless coupled with active deterrents or management actions to reduce raven density (i.e., Coates and Delehanty 2010; Dinkins 2013). The last reported research on nest and brood survival in the PPR population (Apa 2010), estimated annual nest success between zero and 40%, and substantially lower chicle survival. By the end of that study, "Only 2 chicks remained radio-marked after 30 days of age. Apparent brood survival was 86% (n = 12/14) at 7 days, 62% (n = 9/14) at 14 days, and 14% (n = 2/14) at 30 days." Those data indicate predation could be holding back the PPR population. Chapter 6 References -This section refers to older (now amended) versions of the Garfield County's Land Use Resolution and the Greater Sage Grouse Conservation Plan which is additional evidence that the BLM did not meaningfully coordinate with Garfield County. Further, as pointed out earlier in these comments, the BLM has neglected to consider significant studies and best available science published since the 2015 ROD. Garfield County requests the BLM not only cite the following studies but also amend the RMPA DEIS to incorporate the value these studies bring to the document including adaptive management. Addressed Scientific Flaws with the Plan Amendments and the Listing Decision The Department of Interior (DOl) failed to recognize shortcomings in the key reports relied upon to craft the BLM's 2015 Record of Decision (ROD) which include the NTT and COT Reports and the USGS Monograph and the prescriptions they support. Multiple Data Quality Act challenges documented significant flaws with: * 3 percent disturbance caps * Density caps of I disturbance per 640 acres * Lek buffers * Required Design Features * No Surface Occupancy areas (NSOs) in priority habitat * Implementation of an avoidminimize-compensate policy * Net conservation gains * Sagebrush canopy cover * The warranted but precluded listing decision for GRSG Absent recognition of these flaws, land management will be misled and entangled in litigation for many years to come. Therefore, the Districts respectfully request DOl to include the following statement in the forthcoming amendments and records of decision (RODs): provide adequate habitat quality for nesting sage 0 grouse." Effects of rotational grazing management on nesting greater sage o grouse (The Journal of Wildlife Management https://onlinelibralY. wile)'. com/doi/full/1 0.1 002/jwmg. 21344) "The newest study's authors re-evaluated more than 800 nests from several studies that originally showed a positive correlation between nest success and grass height. After correcting the data to account for grass growth, researchers found no relationship between grass height and nest fate, confirming a sampling bias in two of three re-analyzed datasets, (emphasis added) and a reduced but still significant association in the third." "These findings suggest that the height of grass may not be as crucial to sage grouse nesting success as previously thought. Researchers recommend that field sampling methods be adjusted to ensure unbiased measurement of grass height at predicted hatch date, and that sitescale habitat management guidelines that include grass height as an indicator of nesting habitat quality be revisited."

Identifying unique place-based, topographical differences and adjusting standards accordingly should be a decision made by local land managers utilizing the best available information and local, scientifically based data. The RMPA should replace the current RMPA mapping with the revised mapping of priority habitat boundaries and active lek sites provided by Colorado Parks and Wildlife ("CPW"). Scientific Flaws with the Plan Amendment and Listing Decision: In addition to the missteps related to process, the Plan Amendments are substantively flawed. The key agency reports (the Reports) underpinning the Plan Amendments, as well as the earlier warranted but precluded GRSG listing decision, were plagued with conflicts of interest, bias and selective citation. They ignored the most relevant factors to grouse populations (weather, predation and hunter harvest) in favor of draconian restrictions that will cost jobs and harm local communities without corresponding benefits to the species. The 2018 LUPAs fail to acknowledge the scientific shortcomings in the National Technical Team ("NTT") Report, the Conservation Objectives Team ("COT") Report, the U.S. Geological Society ("USGS") Monograph, and the Manier et al. Buffers Report (collectively, the "Reports"), much less redress the resulting inaccuracies in the agency decisions. DOI and the U.S. Department of Agriculture must recognize critical errors in the Reports and the prescriptions they support. Because future agency management decisions and potential litigation continue to turn to the Reports for support, addressing the scientific foundation is crucial. Accordingly, DOI should include this statement in the forthcoming amendments and records of decision ("RODs"): The NTT Report, the COT Report, the USGS Monograph and Manier, et al. 2014 (collectively "the Reports") were heavily relied upon in the 2010 listing decision on GRSG as well as the LUPAs and corresponding RODs. Since then, the science and understanding on GRSG has evolved and some significant shortcomings with the Reports have come to light. Management prescriptions from the Reports should be viewed with caution and tempered with the best available information, including specifically state and local science and knowledge. Detailed Data Quality Act challenges based on these issues were never adequately answered. In 2015, a coalition of 20 local governments (including the Counties) as well as diverse agricultural and energy interests (collectively, the Petitioners) undertook an independent scientific review of the Reports. The reviews uncovered significant errors, omissions and biases in the Reports that have contaminated subsequent policy and management actions based thereon. In several Data Quality Act challenges, (the Challenges), Petitioners documented hundreds of pages of flaws with: * 3 percent disturbance caps * Density caps of 1 disturbance per 640 acres * Lek buffers * Required Design Features * No Surface Occupancy areas (NSOs) in priority habitat * Implementation of an avoid-minimize-compensate policy * Net conservation gains * Sagebrush canopy cover * The warranted but precluded listing decision for GRSG The Reports erroneously ignore accurate population data and adopt flawed modeling approaches that have consistently failed to accurately predict populations. This selective use of science is wholly misleading and assumes GRSG populations are in decline despite evidence to the contrary. The Reports ignore natural population fluctuations; single out human-driven activities for alleged declines (but exclude the significance of hunter harvest); and overlook actual threats to GRSG such as predation. The Reports fail to meet the standards of quality, integrity, objectivity and utility required by the Data Quality Act, as well DOI's standards of scientific integrity and transparency. DOI failed to address these shortcomings. The National Technical Team Challenge was 97 pages in length with four exhibits for a total of 197 pages of detailed issues. The COT Challenge was 88 pages with four exhibits for a total of 159 pages. The Monograph Challenge was 99 pages with three exhibits for a total of 332 pages. The Buffers Challenge was 41 pages. Nonetheless, the agencies virtually ignored these shortcomings and issued only a four-page response to the cumulative 729-page Challenges, and a two-page response to subsequent appeals. Moreover, in the NEPA documents, the agencies hardly recognized the existence of the Challenges, let alone addressed their merits.

THE IMPORTANVE OF HIGH RESOLUTION MAPPING TO PRIORITIZING SAGE-GROUSE CONSERVATION EFFORTS Coates, P.S., Casazza, M.L., Brussee, B.E., Ricca, M.A., Gustafson, K.B., Sanchez-Chopitea, E., Mauch, K., Niell, L., Gardner, S., Espinosa, S., and Delehanty, D.l., 2016, Spatially explicit modeling of annual and seasonal habitat for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus uraphasianus) in Nevada and northeastern California-An updated decision-support tool for management: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2016-1080, 160 p., https:/ldol.org/10.3133/ofr20161080.

This book also suffers from scientific and technical flaws. The Center for Environmental Science, Accuracy and Reliability analyzed four of the most frequently cited sources and found, as documented in our third DQA challenge: Northwest Colorado Greater Sage-Grouse Draft RMPA August 2, 2018 Page 12 of 17 * Significant mischaracterization of previous research; * Substantial errors and omissions; * Lack of independent authorship and peer review; * Methodological bias; * Lack of reproducibility; and, * Inadequate data. BLM finally relies on the flawed USGS "Conservation Buffer Distance Estimates for Greater Sage-Grouse -A Review" (Buffer Report), to support the 3.1-mile lek buffer for infrastructure related to energy development imposed in the Draft RMPA. Draft RMPA at H-3. As discussed in our fourth DQA challenge, the studies referenced in the Buffer Report did not test the buffers discussed therein and failed to recognize other factors driving GrSG population changes such as variations in regional climate and weather. Furthermore, the Buffer Report: * Was developed with unsound methods; * Ignores scientific studies that do not support its conclusions; * Reaches conclusions that are pure conjecture; and * Disseminates information that is neither objective nor reliable and that lacks scientific integrity. Accordingly, the Buffer Report, and by extension the buffers and noise restrictions in the Draft RMPA, are not based on the best available science. On March 22, 2013, the FWS-organized Conservation Objectives Team (COT) issued the Greater Sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) Conservation Objectives: Final Report (COT Report). BLM applies measures from the COT Report to all of the action alternatives identified in the ARMPA, and by extension to the Draft RMPA. As detailed in our second DQA challenge, the COT Report suffers from various errors. Specifically, the report: * Provides no original data or quantitative analysis; * Does not provide comprehensive, unbiased review of all available scientific literature; * Relies on unverified data; * Relies on flawed and biased reports; * Contains flawed methodology; * Suffers from conflicts of interest; * Relies on ambiguous definitions; * Includes unsupported, speculative statements lacking empirical basis; * Ignores evidence related to GrSG adaptation to disturbed environments; * Discounts conservation strategies utilized by states; and, * Fails to recognize latest habitat mapping efforts. The operational restrictions in the ARMPA and Draft RMPA are not based on the best available science. The Buffer Report, the NTT Report, the COT Report, and the GrSG Monograph are fundamentally flawed and do not support the operational restrictions in the ARMPA and the Draft RMPA. BLM should address additional scientific analysis related to GrSG conservation that were not cited in the NTT Report, COT Report, GrSG Monograph, and the Buffer Report. Additionally, BLM should utilize state and local conservation measures that have been imposed and successful for over a decade, rather than unsubstantiated landscape-scale measures that do not take into account site-specific considerations. The proposed disturbance cap and density limit, to be applied across an entire section of habitat that contains existing development and fragmentation, are overbroad and unduly restrictive. This type of habitat management mechanism should only be applied sparingly on an as-needed basis, after site-specific survey and biological analysis. Specifically, any disturbance threshold should be based on a discrete area of biological influence, rather than across an entire section of habitat that contains existing surface development and habitat fragmentation. The Draft RMPA fails to recognize that increased surface disturbance will not automatically result in environmental impacts where there are protections in place for specific resources, such as offset mitigation requirements. In addition, BLM fails to explain why it rejected less restrictive disturbance caps and density limits. Specifically, BLM proposes to require a 3% disturbance cap in Colorado and a 5% disturbance cap in Wyoming. 2015 ROD at 1-18. The use of a 5% disturbance cap in Wyoming demonstrates that a higher threshold is reasonable. Further, BLM does not explain why it rejected Colorado's less restrictive density BMP which calls for the avoidance of 10 well pads per 10-square mile area in GrSG breeding and summer habitat (within 4 miles of active leks) and allows for increased density with a Comprehensive Development Plan, which has proven effective. BLM should remove the proposed 3% disturbance cap and density limit. Instead, BLM should rely on site-specific analysis to determine potential impacts to GrSG and appropriate mitigation measures consistent with CPW's AMAIWR. Scientific Flaws with the Plan Amendment and Listing Decision: In addition to the missteps related to process, the Plan Amendments are substantively flawed. The key agency reports (the Reports) underpinning the Plan Amendments, as well as the earlier warranted but precluded GRSG listing decision, were plagued with conflicts of interest, bias and selective citation.

Buffers Report (collectively, the "Reports"), much less redress the resulting inaccuracies in the agency decisions. DOI and the U.S. Department of Agriculture must recognize critical errors in the Reports and the prescriptions they support. Because future agency management decisions and potential litigation continue to turn to the Reports for support, addressing the scientific foundation is crucial. Accordingly, DOI should include this statement in the forthcoming amendments and records of decision ("RODs"): The NTT Report, the COT Report, the USGS Monograph and Manier, et al. 2014 (collectively "the Reports") were heavily relied upon in the 2010 listing decision on GRSG as well as the LUPAs and corresponding RODs. Since then, the science and understanding on GRSG has evolved and some significant shortcomings with the Reports have come to light. Management prescriptions from the Reports should be viewed with caution and tempered with the best available information, including specifically state and local science and knowledge. Detailed Data Quality Act challenges based on these issues were never adequately answered. In 2015, a coalition of 20 local governments (including the Counties) as well as diverse agricultural and energy interests (collectively, the Petitioners) undertook an independent scientific review of the Reports. The reviews uncovered significant errors, omissions and biases in the Reports that have contaminated subsequent policy and management actions based thereon. In several Data Quality Act challenges, (the Challenges), Petitioners documented hundreds of pages of flaws with: * 3 percent disturbance caps * Density caps of 1 disturbance per 640 acres * Lek buffers * Required Design Features * No Surface Occupancy areas (NSOs) in priority habitat * Implementation of an avoid-minimize-compensate policy * Net conservation gains * Sagebrush canopy cover * The warranted but precluded listing decision for GRSG The Reports erroneously ignore accurate population data and adopt flawed modeling approaches that have consistently failed to accurately predict populations. This selective use of science is wholly misleading and assumes GRSG populations are in decline despite evidence to the contrary. The Reports ignore natural population fluctuations; single out human-driven activities for alleged declines (but exclude the significance of hunter harvest); and overlook actual threats to GRSG such as predation. The Reports fail to meet the standards of quality, integrity, objectivity and utility required by the Data Quality Act, as well DOI's standards of scientific integrity and transparency. DOI failed to address these shortcomings. The National Technical Team Challenge was 97 pages in length with four exhibits for a total of 197 pages of detailed issues. The COT Challenge was 88 pages with four exhibits for a total of 159 pages. The Monograph Challenge was 99 pages with three exhibits for a total of 332 pages. The Buffers Challenge was 41 pages. Nonetheless, the agencies virtually ignored these shortcomings and issued only a four-page response to the cumulative 729-page Challenges, and a two-page response to subsequent appeals. Moreover, in the NEPA documents, the agencies hardly recognized the existence of the Challenges, let alone addressed their merits. BLM and the USFS failed to address the substance and detail in these challenges and provided little if any rationale for their misplaced use of the Reports and the Monograph. No corrective actions were taken nor were adequate disclosures of these flaws recognized or addressed as required by implementing regulations for NEPA. See 40 C.F.R. § 1502.9(b). In sum, these misplaced and unscientific management restrictions will negatively impact the economies and future viability of countless communities, small businesses, and family farms and ranches as well as efforts to conserve GRSG and we request BLM address the above bulleted points. Research has shown that in arid and semiarid areas, grazing at use levels below 40 percent can have positive impacts to forage plants compared to exclusion of grazing.1 Research conducted in western Colorado in mountain big sagebrush communities found no significant effects from 40-50 years of grazing exclusion on cover or frequency of grasses, biotic crusts, or bare soil and that grazing exclusion decreased above ground net primary production and biodiversity.2 In a synthesis of scientific literature on long-term rest in the sagebrush steppe, Davies et al.3 found that long-term rest and properly managed grazing produced few significant differences, and in some situations, negative ecological effects from long-term rest. The Department of Interior (DOl) and the u.s. Department of Agriculture (USDA) must recognize shortcomings in the key reports relied upon to craft the BlM's 2015 Record of Decision (ROD) which include the NIT and COT Reports and the USGS Monograph and the prescriptions they support. Agency management decisions and potential litigation will surely turn towards the Reports for support. Absent recognition of shortcomings, land management is sure to be entangled in controversy for years to come. Accordingly, we urge DOl to include this statement in the forthcoming amendments and records of decision (RODs): The NIT Report, the COT Report, the USGS Monograph and Manier, et al. 2014 (collectively "the Reports") were heavily relied upon in the 2010 listing decisian on GRSG as well as the LUPAs and correspanding RODs. Since then, the science and understanding on GRSG has evolved and some significant shartcomings with the Reports have come to light. Management prescriptions from the Reports should be viewed with caution and tempered with the best available information including specifically state and local science and knowledge. Most importantly, none of the information contained in the COT Report, NIT Report or the USGS Monograph specifically addressed the highly unique landforms, variable habitat or naturally fragmented habitat that exists in the Parachute-Piceance-Roan population found in Garfield County. The terrain in our County that hosts Greater Sage Grouse is a naturally fragmented habitat that varies radically over short distances to include severely undulating topography, steep slopes and deep canyons, dark timber, sage brush on the ridges and a complex range of vegetation types. These reports relied on above are void of scientific specificity regarding Garfield County's highly unique terrain. While many opine about Sage-grouse as if they are the only species in the sage, I'm well aware of the decline of sagebrush songbirds and mule deer across much of the range, and have documented Brewer's and sagebrush sparrow, sage thrasher, and mule deer on the Pinedale Anticline's critical winter range, where the species has declined by 60% since drilling began in winter a little over a decade ago. Sage-grouse are now the face of a systemic problem of not giving wildlife freedom to roam across the west. Short-sighted land management plans that change with shifting political winds aren't good for wildlife or stakeholders. We need to know that our leaders in land management will stand with the best science and researchers in seeking optimal solutions. With that backdrop, the sudden change to Secretarial order 3353 just two years away from the next milestone of the current plan is baffling. I stand with Governors Mead and Hickenlooper in calling for giving the current plan a chance to work. Order 3353 isn't adaptive management, but a major shift from solid science into the unknown. State population targets and reduced buffers for these iconic birds, still declining and vulnerable to prolonged drought and a host of other threats invites a population crash that would likely be irreversible. The EPA supports coordination among federal, state, local, and tribal authorities for consistent and effective conservation of imperiled species. We are concerned that the Draft EIS does not provide sufficient information to fully assess the impacts of the proposed action. For this reason, the EPA has rated the Draft EIS/RMPA as Environmental Concerns - Insufficient Information -(EC-2). The description of the EPA' s rating system is available at: https://www.epa.gov/nepa/environmental-impactstatementrating-system-criteria. The enclosed detailed comments include recommendations for improving the assessment and disclosure of the Proposed Action's expected impacts to greater sage-grouse and habitat; however, we defer to the expertise of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and appropriate state wildlife management agencies regarding the extent to which those impacts would be beneficial or detrimental to the species. Specifically, we recommend improvements in the analysis of the potential impacts from increased oil and gas development for the Proposed Action, and updating the mitigation section to reflect any changes resulting from public comments. We note that most of the 2015 greater sage-grouse analysis was focused largely on lek habitat. However, BLM has also identified winter concentration, nesting, brood rearing and linkage habitats as having the highest conservation value to maintain sustainable greater sage-grouse populations1. We recommend the Final EIS include any new information on winter, nesting and brood rearing habitat in Colorado and consider whether additional mitigation measures are warranted to protect these seasonal habitats from impacts from O&G development. We also recommend the Final EIS include information on whether increased drilling and O&G production in greater sage-grouse habitat compared to the 2015 plan would specifically impact any general-or linkage habitat areas. The RMPA should replace the current RMPA mapping with the revised mapping of priority habitat boundaries and active lek sites provided by Colorado Parks and Wildlife ("CPW") A study was conducted by Adrian Monroe, a CSU research scientist, and found the effects of grazing on sage-grouse populations may depend on plant productivity. The study evaluates multiple, real-world livestock grazing operations across the entire state. There is a direct correlation between plant growth, when and how much livestock graze, and the effects on wildlife, and a way to sustain ranching while simultaneously sustaining wildlife populations. 2.3.6 Disturbance and Density Caps No surface occupancy stipulations must be maintained for oil and gas development in priority habitats. Preventing destruction of greater sage-grouse habitat is critical to avoiding harm while permitting development. Existing disturbance caps must be maintained to limit harm to habitat. Disturbance caps serve as a backstop that limits harm to habitat and provides needed certainty. BLM acknowledges the changes in Utah "could result in a site-specific loss of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and displacement from the area of development by local populations."90BLM also admits that, "Projects that would likely be precluded under the No Action Alternative could proceed under the "2018 proposed amendments."91BLM reasons, however, that requiring that impacts improve habitat will offset those concerns. There are significant problems with the agency's reasoning because the Draft Utah mitigation rule does not provide a preference for offset benefits to accrue within the landscape affected by the project; prioritize projects that provide the greatest benefits, and reduce the greatest threats, to sage-grouse habitat; does not require mitigation for all impacts; does not guarantee against temporal losses; does not use a habitat quantification tool to measure comparability between impacts and offsets. BLM also notes the requirement to avoid development within priority habitat, but this development would expressly occur within priority areas. The DEIS also provides new opportunities for waivers, exceptions, modifications for siting projects in priority habitat.93 In Idaho, the DEIS states: Removal of the 3 percent project level disturbance cap would allow BLM to intentionally cluster developments within areas already degraded by discrete anthropogenic activities in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat as long as the overall disturbance within the BSU remains below 3 percent. The 3 percent project scale disturbance cap has the potential to spread development into undeveloped areas of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat just to avoid reaching the 3 percent project scale disturbance cap in already fragmented areas. All 8 BSUs in Idaho are well under the 3 percent BSU scale Disturbance Cap (most are less than 1 percent) and are expected to remain low because of the nonetloss mitigation standard and the other restrictions to development in PHMA and IHMA. Some areas, especially those with existing development, may be further developed even though compensatory mitigation would offset those impacts for the statewide Greater Sage-Grouse habitat.94 Essentially, Idaho has come up with a standard that for the foreseeable future will never disallow a project because the priority area densities are so low, even though the density of an individual project area may be high. This flies in face of studies showing impacts to sage-grouse because of individual project density, and Edmunds study that there can be differences between densities at large and small-scale levels that are significant. Also, Idaho's mitigation program is not finalized, and there is no time line by which it is guaranteed to be finalized; thus, we do not know what provisions it will or will not include. As a result, we oppose these amendments to the land use plan, both because they will reduce important protections for sage-grouse, and because they make it more likely that the bird will need to be listed under ESA.95 IX. DENSITY AND DISTURBANCE CAPS SHOULD BE MAINTAINED. The DEISs propose changes in Utah and Idaho to the density and disturbance caps set out in the 2015 BLM sage-grouse land use plans limiting the amount of development that can take in priority habitat management areas. We oppose these changes, for the reasons set out below. 66 The decision by the FWS not to list sage-grouse under the ESA noted the importance of the caps to sagegrouse protection: Each Federal Plan includes a disturbance cap that will serve as an upper limit (the maximum disturbance permitted). Anthropogenic disturbance has been identified as a key impact to sagegrouse. To limit new anthropogenic disturbance within sage-grouse habitats, the Federal Plans establish disturbance caps, above which no new development is permitted (subject to applicable laws and regulations; e.g., General Mining Law of 1872, and valid existing rights). This cap acts as a backstop to ensure that any implementation decisions made under the Federal Plans will not permit substantial amounts of new disturbance within the distribution of sage-grouse on BLM and USFS 2.3.7 Fire and Invasive Species A more specific approach to managing noxious weeds and invasive species should be developed and included to address this significant threat. The 2018 report issued by Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (updating a 2013 report) summarizing policy, fiscal and science challenges land managers have encountered in control and reduction of invasive grasses and fire cycle, with a focus on the greater sage-grouse found ongoing gaps and also recommended that the agencies continue working on a "landscape-scale approach to fire and land management and further enhance collaborative, science-based approaches to management activities within the Sagebrush Biome." 2018 Gap Report, p. 46. Following these recommendations and committing to developing a more detailed strategy is needed. 2.3.8 General Habitat Management Areas A just-released U.S. Forest Service study (Cross 2018) attempted to quantify the importance of connectivity across the sagebrush range .61 Scientists set out to map the mating areas called "leks" and identify the birds that use each of these areas. They grouped 1,200 leks into "nodes," or a collection of leks, within the network of greater sage-grouse. The nodes were then categorized as "hubs" or spokes" based on their importance to facilitating gene flow within and across the range of sage-grouse. Hubs foster gene flow out to the spokes. If a hub were to be lost, the birds in the connected spokes would be at risk of genetic isolation. The two maps below depict (1) the location of general habitat in Utah under the 2015 BLM sage-grouse land use plans, with the pink areas representing general habitat,62 and (2) a figure depicting the overall ranking of node importance to genetic connectivity across the contiguous range of greater sage-grouse, as measured by "betweenness" calculated in Cross et al. 2018.63 As the maps reveal, the Forest Service found hubs across the bird's range, with a concentration in northwestern Utah, where protection of general habitat is particularly important. Areas is northeastern Utah also show up as corridors of genetic connectivity to Colorado. Even where general habitat is not important for connectivity between populations, as is in central Utah, general habitat is important for providing links between different priority habitat areas within Utah. Similarly, hubs were also concentrated in central Idaho, where large swaths of general habitat are located.64 *See attachement, Map* Given the role general habitat plays in preserving connectivity between populations, as well as the other purposes it serves, it would be a grave mistake to eliminate, or even reduce, protections for these areas. In addition, the importance placed on general habitat by the Fish and Wildlife Service raises the concern that the proposed changes will lead to a greater chance of listing sage-grouse under the ESA. The proposed amendments to eliminate or reduce protections for general habitat should therefore be rejected. CPC strongly supports the intent of the DRMPA to improve the alignment between individual state plans and/or conservation measures, and DOI and BLM policy. States have authority for managing wildlife populations and work with local governments and stakeholders to balance conservation and business development practices in consideration of their socioeconomic impacts. Of the more than 48 million acres in the Utah Subregional Planning Area, only about 580,000 are in general habitat, as are another 225,000 acres of mineral estate.55Eliminating general habitat in Utah would mean, for example, that mitigation, including avoidance, minimization and compensatory mitigation, as well as minimal Required Design Features (RDFs), are not required in those areas, regardless of the impact to sage-grouse populations or sagebrush habitat. It would also preclude application of precautionary measures such as avoiding removal of sagebrush and minimizing development that creates a physical barrier to sage-grouse movement.56For areas constituting such a small percentage of Utah's land base, it makes no sense to skimp on protections that could both prevent further reductions in Utah's sage-grouse populations and avoid imposing additional burdens on neighboring states still required to manage general habitat for sage-grouse. This is particularly true given the importance of general habitat in Utah and other sagebrush steppe states for sage-grouse connectivity. Sage-grouse select large intact sagebrush landscapes.57The USGS Synthesis has confirmed the importance of maintaining connectivity between different sage-grouse populations to conserve genetic diversity.58A 2015 study found that long-distance movements of GRSG have been documented, but the risk associated with the landscapes that the birds traverse is not well understood. The current designated priority area strategy does not protect movement corridors among priority areas, and some areas may be at risk of isolation even when they are not separated by large distances.59 A 2016 study covering Idaho, Utah and Wyoming showed that several sage-grouse moved 100 km north and west, traversing from the Wyoming Basin to a range typically associated with the Snake River Plain, and theorized that these migrating birds may serve as an important genetic link between two sage-grouse management zones.60 A just-released U.S. Forest Service study (Cross 2018) attempted to quantify the importance of connectivity across the sagebrush range.61Scientists set out to map the mating areas called "leks" and identify the birds that use each of these areas.

Similarly, hubs were also concentrated in central Idaho, where large swaths of general habitat are located.64 [See Attachment PG 37 and 38] Given the role general habitat plays in preserving connectivity between populations, as well as the other purposes it serves, it would be a grave mistake to eliminate, or even reduce, protections for these areas. In addition, the importance placed on general habitat by the Fish and Wildlife Service raises the concern that the proposed changes will lead to a greater chance of listing sage-grouse under the ESA. The proposed amendments to eliminate or reduce protections for general habitat should therefore be rejected. VII.GENERAL HABITAT MANAGEMENT AREAS SHOULD BE MAINTAINED. The Utah DEIS would eliminate all protections for general habitat.47Other states would weaken protections for sage-grouse in general habitat;48Idaho, for example would eliminate lek buffers, reduce the application of required design features, and eliminate compensatory mitigation in general habitat.49For the reasons set out below, we oppose any reduction of protection for general habitat. While General Habitat Management Areas (GHMA) represent areas with fewer leks and lower densities of breeding birds where disturbance is limited, and provide greater flexibility for land use activities,50their designation is still important to sage-grouse conservation. The FWS 2015 Sage-grouse Listing Decision states: The designation as GHMAs provide sage-grouse conservation by protecting habitat and connectivity between populations and potential refugia in the event of catastrophic events such as wildfire. While the amelioration of threats in GHMAs will likely be less than in PHMAs due to less stringent required conservation measures, GHMAs do have restrictions that benefit sage-grouse conservation.51 It is important to ensure that seasonal habitats not included in priority areas receive some protection,52and to allow for expansion of recovering populations into newly restored areas. In addition, general habitat can serve as a location for compensatory mitigation offsets and restoring degraded habitat.53The recent USGS synthesis of recent science on sage-grouse recently stated: Maintaining connectivity among (priority areas) through restoration activities or conservation of existing sagebrush communities at important "pinch points," where movements are constrained, is an important component of an overall sage-grouse management strategy. Maintenance or restoration of habitat quality within corridors is important to limit exposure to risk (for example, from predators), and because sage-grouse use these sites as resting and refueling areas.54 In addition, general habitat can serve as a location for compensatory mitigation offsets and restoring degraded habitat.53 The recent USGS synthesis of recent science on sage-grouse recently stated: Maintaining connectivity among (priority areas) through restoration activities or conservation of existing sagebrush communities at important "pinch points," where movements are constrained, is an important component of an overall sage-grouse management strategy.

Sage-grouse select large intact sagebrush landscapes.57 The USGS Synthesis has confirmed the importance of maintaining connectivity between different sage-grouse populations to conserve genetic diversity.58 A 2015 study found that long-distance movements of GRSG have been documented, but the risk associated with the landscapes that the birds traverse is not wellunderstood.

Because of the concern of a future listing under ESA, any changes should not represent a meaningful decrease in the current level of conservation under the 2015 Sage-grouse Plans. In the event that BLM wants to address the potential for broader habitat adjustments, then the agency can conduct additional analysis to evaluate the impacts of increasing and reducing habitat within a larger area (i.e., greater than 3% of the identified habitat management area polygon), which could then be tiered to for later adjustments. The Plans manage PHMAs as right-of-way "avoidance areas" instead of exclusion areas (See, e.g., Wyoming RMPA FEIS at 2-25), as recommended by their own experts. This prevents certainty of implementation by allowing new rights-of-way to be granted on a case-by-case basis. "Exclusion" is the appropriate level of management for these habitats based on the best available science, and this level of protection should also apply to Focal Areas and Winter Concentration Areas as well. Only portions of General Habitats would be managed as avoidance areas for rights-of-way based on other resource values (See, e.g., Wyoming RMPA FEIS at 2-26); the importance of protecting sage grouse habitat merits avoidance management for all General Habitats. XII. HABITAT BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENTS SHOULD BE BASED ON BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND DATA, AND MADE WITH FULL TRANSPARENCY. All the 2018 DEISs except for the Oregon DEIS include provisions for adjustment of sage-grouse habitat management boundaries.150 We support transparent and consistent science-based efforts to ensure that any habitat management boundaries changes (1) represent the most available up-to-date and accurate information; and (2) do the most effective job possible of conserving sage-grouse habitat, and do not result in a meaningful decrease in the current level of conservation provided by the 2015 sage-grouse land use plans. Moreover, boundary adjustments and complementary adjustments of related management prescriptions should only be made to reflect a changed understanding of the preferences of the species and/or data showing changed use and conditions of habitat; adjustments may not be made to accommodate a proposed use that might otherwise be prohibited or conditioned based on a different habitat classification. We recognize that some changes to boundaries will be so small that they do not require a plan amendment. Plain maintenance procedures are available to refine or clarify a previously approved decision. BLM's regulations and Land Use Planning Handbook provide that "land use plan decisions and supporting components can be maintained to reflect minor changes in data" but [m]aintenance is limited to further refining, documenting, or clarifying a previously approved decision incorporated in the plan."151 Examples of appropriate plan maintenance provided in the BLM Land Use Planning Handbook include "correcting minor data, typographical, mapping, or tabular data errors in the planning records after a plan or plan amendment has been completed" and "refining the known habitat of a special status species addressed in the plan based on new information."152 Such actions, which do not involve formal public involvement or NEPA analysis, should only be used for small boundary adjustments of an existing individual habitat management area. We propose that an adjustment (adding or subtracting acreage) comprising not more than 3% of an existing polygon would qualify as appropriate for a maintenance action. 2.3.10 Habitat Management Areas All sage-grouse habitat must be subject to specific management approaches. While the strongest protections should continue to apply to the most important habitat, managing general habitat is also important for maintaining, improving, restoring and expanding habitat overall. Protections that were included in Sagebrush Focal Area designations should be incorporated into Priority Habitat Management Areas, where appropriate. The General Habitat Management Areas in Utah must be maintained; eliminating GHMA in Utah would hamper sage-grouse recovery in the state and have grave implications for habitat designations in other states. Similarly, proposals to remove management protections associated with GHMA in Idaho must not be adopted, since they effectively undercut the meaning of the habitat classification. In addition, to meet the overall goals of the plans and habitat objectives to conserve, enhance and restore sage-grouse habitat, the plans should develop and incorporate specific restoration targets for PHMA to incentivize activities to reduce disturbance and the threat from noxious weeds. 2.3.11 Habitat Objectives Specific habitat objectives for all aspects of the sage-grouse lifecycle should be defined, as discussed in the 2018 USGS report, which highlight the need to address the full range of sage-grouse habitat. 2.3.12 Lands and Realty Sage-grouse habitat must be retained in federal ownership and not transferred to state control in order to maintain certainty of management across these lands, as well as habitat connectivity. Sage-grouse habitat should be retained in federal ownership. The BLM's Scoping Report mentions the concerns of states such as Utah that maintaining sage-grouse habitat in federal ownership could affect the states' ability to develop land.67In fact, the Utah DEIS states: Increased potential for disposal and/or exchange of BLM-managed federal lands in [priority] and Greater Sage-Grouse habitat outside of [priority areas] could possibly result in expanded economic opportunities in the affected location… Possible land uses include use for county and municipal physical facilities, commercial or residential development,e and/or recreation use.68 These uses are all identified as threats to sage-grouse habitat in the 2013 Conservation Objectives Team (COT) Report, which developed range-wide conservation objectives for sage-grouse that define the degree to which threats needed to be reduced or ameliorated to ensure that the species was no longer in danger of an ESA listing. 69 It can be difficult under the standards proposed by BLM to determine if land disposal "will compromise" sage-grouse persistence, or have "no direct or indirect impact" on populations.70Retaining habitat in federal ownership helps ensure the land will be managed as prescribed in the BLM land use plans, providing certainty. It also will promote connectivity of sage-grouse populations.71States have not committed to all the same management and approaches as BLM. Moreover, in some cases, such as for state trust lands, they are required to manage the lands to maximize revenues, which is likely inconsistent with conserving sage-grouse habitat. If there is a need to correct lands designated as sage-grouse habitat, we prefer it be accomplished through authorized habitat management boundary adjustments as provided for in the 2018 DEISs, consistent with our recommendations for how that process should be conducted. We also support the continued inclusion of provisions in the BLM plans that encourage acquisition of habitat where it will benefit sage-grouse populations. VIII.KEEPING GROUSE HABITAT IN FEDERAL OWNERSHIP IS IMPORTANT FOR CONSISTENT MANAGEMENT AND CONNECTIVITY. The 2015 Utah sage-grouse land use plan provides that BLM cannot dispose of priority or general habitat, unless there are no impacts to sage-grouse or its habitat or there would be a net conservation gain to sagegrouse. The 2018 DEIS would change this provision to allow disposal if it improves the condition of sage-grouse habitat, or BLM can demonstrate disposal "will not compromise the persistence of Greater Sage-Grouse populations" within priority habitat. The 2015 Utah plans also support identifying areas where acquisitions or easements will benefit sage-grouse habitat, while the 2018 DEIS eliminates this provision.65 Similarly, the Nevada DEIS also allows disposal of sage-grouse habitat if it would have "no direct or indirect adverse impact on conservation of the Greater Sage-Grouse or can achieve a net conservation gain though the use of compensatory mitigation."66 We oppose these changes in the 2018 DEISs. Sage-grouse habitat should be retained in federal ownership. The BLM's Scoping Report mentions the concerns of states such as Utah that maintaining sage-grouse habitat in federal ownership could affect the states' ability to develop land.67 In fact, the Utah DEIS states: Increased potential for disposal and/or exchange of BLM-managed federal lands in [priority] and Greater Sage-Grouse habitat outside of [priority areas] could possibly result in expanded economic opportunities in the affected location… Possible land uses include use for county and municipal physical facilities, commercial or residential development, and/or recreation use.68 These uses are all identified as threats to sage-grouse habitat in the 2013 Conservation Objectives Team (COT) Report, which developed range-wide conservation objectives for sage-grouse that define the degree to which threats needed to be reduced or ameliorated to ensure that the species was no longer in danger of an ESA listing. 69 It can be difficult under the standards proposed by BLM to determine if land disposal "will compromise" sage-grouse persistence, or have "no direct or indirect impact" on populations.70 Retaining habitat in federal ownership helps ensure the land will be managed as prescribed in the BLM land use plans, providing certainty. It also will promote connectivity of sage-grouse populations.71 States have not committed to all the same management and approaches as BLM. Moreover, in some cases, such as for state trust lands, they are required to manage the lands to maximize revenues, which is likely inconsistent with conserving sage-grouse habitat. If there is a need to correct lands designated as sage-grouse habitat, we prefer it be accomplished through authorized habitat management boundary adjustments as provided for in the 2018 DEISs, consistent with our recommendations for how that process should be conducted. We also support the continued inclusion of provisions in the BLM plans that encourage acquisition of habitat where it will benefit sage-grouse populations. 2.3.13 Lek Buffers Prescribed buffer distances (both those limiting activities and those setting out areas for analyzing and addressing impacts) must be maintained to guide analysis of impacts and limit harm to habitat. BLM and USFS may approve actions in PHMAs that are within the applicable lek buffer distance identified above only if the BLM or USFS determine that a buffer distance other than the distance identified above offers the same or greater level of protection to sage-grouse and its habitat. The BLM or USFS will make this determination based on best available science... For actions in GHMAs, the BLM and USFS will apply the lek buffer distances in Table 3 as required conservation measures to fully address any impacts to sage-grouse identified during the project-specific NEPA analysis. However, if it is not possible to locate or relocate the project outside of the applicable lek buffer distance(s) identified above, the BLM or USFS may approve the project only if: (1) Based on best available science, landscape features, and other existing protections, (e.g., land use allocations, State regulations), the BLM or USFS determine that a lek buffer distance other than the applicable distance identified above offers the same or a greater level of protection to sage-grouse and its habitat, including conservation of seasonal habitat outside of the analyzed buffer area; or (2) the BLM or USFS determines that impacts to sage-grouse and its habitat are minimized such that the project will cause minor or no new disturbance (e.g., co-location with existing authorizations); and (3) any residual impacts within the lek buffer distances are addressed through compensatory mitigation measures sufficient to ensure a net conservation gain, as outlined in the Mitigation Strategy (see below). By applying lek buffers in addition to other measures, the Federal Plans provide an additional layer of protection to the habitat in closest proximity to leks and the areas documented in the literature to be the most important for breeding and nest success.100 If BLM is to move forward with eliminating the 1-mile leasing closure around sage grouse lek sites in favor of a No Surface Occupancy (NSO) stipulation, then it must be done in a manner that provides certainty for conservation outcomes. The draft plan provides opportunities for oil and gas operators to seek waivers, modifications, or exceptions (WME) for both the new NSO stipulation within 1-mile of a lek and new criteria for WMEs in priority habitat beyond that distance. Given the fact that the criteria for both stipulations is heavily predicated upon consultation with Colorado Parks and Wildlife and compensatory mitigation, then BLM must commit to requiring compensatory mitigation while also still adhering to the mitigation hierarchy, which prioritizes avoiding and minimizing impacts prior to mitigating. On average, lek attendance was stable when no oil and gas development was present within 6,400m. However, attendance declined as development increased.4 For nesting habitat Zabihi et al. (2017) likewise found that avoidance of wellpads and access roads were the two most important factors predicting nest site selection. Importantly, Green et al. confirmed that declines in sage-grouse populations may continue even within Wyoming's "core areas," where density of wells is limited to approximately one pad per square mile. In addition, Kirol et a. (2015b) found that increases on coalbed methane wastewater ponds were correlated with decreased nest success in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming. To rectify these problems, BLM should impose, as terms of the Resource Management Plan, Conditions of Approval on all existing fluid mineral leases consistent with the recommendations of the Sage-Grouse National Technical Team, including no new surface occupancy on existing federal leases (with exceptions for occupancy of no more than 3% outside a 4-mile lek buffer, if the entire leasehold is within such habitat). To develop relevant and practical lek buffer distances for the BLM plans, DOI commissioned the U.S. Geological Survey to review the scientific information on conservation buffer distances for sage-grouse. The resulting study101 recommended there be 5 km (3.1 miles) between leks and infrastructure related to energy development.102 It is important to stress that this distance does not result in 100% protection for sage-grouse: [T]he minimum distance inferred here (5 km [3.1 miles]) from leks may be insufficient to protect nesting and other seasonal habitats. Based on the collective information reviewed for this study, conservation practices that address habitats falling within the interpreted distances may be expected to protect as much as 75 percent to 95 percent of local population's habitat utilization.103 A recent Wyoming study suggests that current regulations may only be sufficient for limiting population declines but not for reversing these trends. That study also noted that areas not protected under the 100 Wyoming plans are not subject to core area regulations and may experience larger increases in oil and gas development and, therefore, larger declines in sage-grouse populations.104 Other scientific input continues to stress the importance of buffers: ? 2016 Dahlgren study (UT): This study assesses distances between seasonal habitats to recommend buffer zones for conservation. Females and their broods from larger populations in contiguous sagebrush moved more than those in smaller, isolated populations, but small populations moved farther from leks to winter grounds. Distances from nests to leks were consistent with other research, but nest success slightly increased with distance from leks. Seasonal movements of Utah GRSG were generally lower than reported rangewide, likely because of fragmented sagebrush habitats. Management actions that increase the area of usable sagebrush may benefit Utah GRSG. Management plans can incorporate buffers based on, for example, observed distances between nests and leks to increase the conservation value of management actions. The authors recommended buffers of 5 and 8 kilometers between disturbed areas and GRSG breeding and summer habitats, respectively.105 ? 2018 Holloran Letter (importance of 2015 protections): Recommending management approaches and objectives established in 2015 BLM sage-grouse land use plans be used as minimum standards in sagebrush habitat.106 BLM's argument in support of the changes in Idaho, despite its acknowledgment that infrastructure and development would be allowed much closer to leks, is that there is very new development of infrastructure in Idaho in either priority or important habitat.107 If that is the case, then there is no real need for the proposed change. BLM also asserts that disturbance from development is not the major threat to sage-grouse in Idaho. While that is true, it is still a threat, one that buffers are designed to avoid. The Utah and Nevada DEISs argue that the 2014 USGS Report acknowledges that because of differences in populations, habitats and other factors, there is no single buffer distance that is appropriate for all sagegrouse populations and habitats across the range, and that buffers are just one of a number of protections for sage-grouse.108 The USGS Report acknowledges these points, and states that it attempted to take this variability into account in determining proper buffer distances, and notes that some studies have supported an 8 km buffer.109 As a result, USGS thus ended up with a compromise standard that protects most, but not all, habitat. Given that FWS explicitly relied on buffers as one of the protections that allowed it to avoid listing sage-grouse, it would be a mistake to reduce these standards or vest greater discretion with the states to allow reductions. X. BUFFERS AROUND LEKS SHOULD BE MAINTAINED. The Idaho DEIS proposes to weaken buffers around leks in important habitat management areas, and to eliminate them in general habitat. They also grant additional discretion to decrease or increase buffers generally.96 Other DEISs also increase the degree of discretion afforded to decrease or increase97 buffers.98 Still other DEIS propose to provide "clarification" for lek buffers without stating what form that clarification would take.99 We oppose any changes that would weaken the standard for buffers in the 2015 Sage-grouse Plans. The decision by the FWS not to list sage-grouse under the ESA noted the importance of buffers to sagegrouse protection, and their role in the decision not to list: Sage-grouse leks are communal breeding centers that are representative of the breeding and nesting habitats. Conservation of these areas is crucial to maintaining sage-grouse populations. 2.3.14 Mitigation Overall, the plans must explicitly commit to maintaining the FWS "not warranted" decision. The purpose and need of the 2018 amendments to seek better cooperation with states by modifying the management approach in the plans must be reconciled and made consistent with the purpose and need of the 2015 Sage-grouse Plans to conserve, enhance, and restore sage-grouse habitat by eliminating or minimizing threats to their habitat identified in the FWS 2010 finding that listing under the ESA was warranted. Without ongoing conservation, enhancement and restoration of habitat, the already impacted habitat and risks of further harm that led to the FWS 2010 finding will not be sufficiently addressed in these plans to maintain the FWS 2015 finding that listing is no longer warranted. Mitigation must be applied through the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, minimize, then compensate) and, at a minimum, apply a "no net loss" standard so that while a range of multiple uses continue, their impacts are addressed. Avoidance should include avoiding locating rights-of-ways in habitat. Mitigation programs must incorporate a set of recognized principles related to mitigation, and continue to provide for application of compensatory mitigation at greater than 1:1 ratios, where necessary to address factors such as the full suite of harms and the uncertainty of success for specific mitigation measures, including where state programs provide for such approaches. The 2015 Sagegrouse Plans were premised on the understanding that ongoing activities in habitat would result in ongoing damage to habitat, so that opportunities to enhance and expand habitat must be provided in order for the species to ultimately survive. Mitigation is a well-established tool that was relied upon in the 2015 Fish and Wildlife Service decision to support the decision to not list the Greater Sage-Grouse as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. The practice of "mitigation" is based on two common-sense principles: (1) certain activities are more appropriate in some locations than others; and (2) we should clean up after ourselves as we conduct activities that damage the landscape. The simplest definition of mitigation is "the action of reducing the severity, seriousness, or painfulness of something." Mitigation "done right" involves smart planning, efficient and effective decision-making, and predictability for project proponents, as well as a multitude of other stakeholder interests, and can result in positive outcomes for all -the public, communities, businesses, and the environment. The widely accepted mitigation hierarchy is a step-wise framework for evaluating proposed impacts that first acknowledges that the best way to address impacts from development on the most important habitat is to avoid those impacts in the first place. Some places are just too important to develop, or measures to minimize and/or compensate impacts may not be available or effective. Consider the wintering areas for sage-grouse. Several recent studies have confirmed the importance of ensuring conservation of sufficient amounts of these habitats.112 The next step in the hierarchy is to minimize impacts. A project developer should employ a wide range of actions to avoid as much disturbance as possible to wildlife in the area. For example, markers work to prevent fence-related mortality or injury that can occur when sage-grouse fly low to the ground over sagebrush range.113 If unavoidable impacts occur, the third and final step in the mitigation hierarchy is to compensate for the loss by creating, restoring, enhancing, or preserving habitat elsewhere. This might involve securing a conservation easement on private land or restoring nearby habitat with treatments designed to improve conditions for the affected species overall. Compensatory mitigation for a new road system or transmission line in sagebrush habitat could involve, for example, payments by the developer to reconvert farmland in central Montana that have pushed out sage species' preferred cover back to native sagebrush habitat. Thus, in its most basic sense, mitigation policy is truly about good governance. Sound mitigation policy provides agencies such as BLM with a structured, rational, and transparent framework for reviewing use requests and meeting their multiple use and sustained yield mandates. When agencies frontload their planning and provide the public and applicants with information in advance about where development should and should not go, they are empowered to make faster, better decisions. Potential conflicts between conservation and development are reduced when developers know in advance what areas should be avoided. Good mitigation policy and practice is also one of the best opportunities to achieve sustainable development and conservation goals. Projects, even those with relatively small footprints, can pose significant impacts to migratory wildlife. Avoidance of the most important places offers the best way to support a Western landscape where species can thrive. Where impacts cannot be avoided or minimized, well-designed compensatory mitigation programs can achieve the multiple-use, sustained yield objectives of BLM and other federal agencies. Additional authority also exists for the use of the mitigation hierarchy in issuing project-specific authorizations. For example, project-specific authorizations must be "in accordance with the land use plans,"135so if the land use plans adopt the mitigation hierarchy or other mitigation principles for the sage grouse under the various authorities described above, the project authorization must follow those principles. Moreover, in issuing project-specific authorizations, BLM may attach "such terms and conditions" as are consistent with FLPMA and other applicable law.136This general authority also confers broad discretion on BLM to impose mitigation requirements on project applicants, including compensatory mitigation in appropriate circumstances.137 Finally, as a distinct authority, BLM also has the obligation to ensure that project-specific authorizations do not result in "undue or unnecessary degradation. FLPMA states that BLM "shall, by regulation or otherwise, take any action necessary to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of the lands."138A number of cases have found that BLM met its obligation to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation based, in part, on its imposition of compensatory mitigation. See e.g., Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership v. Salazar, 616 F.3d 497, 518 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (BLM decision to authorize up to 4,399 natural gas wells from 600 drilling pads did not result in "unnecessary or undue degradation" in light of substantial mitigation required from permittees, including prohibition of new development outside core area until comparable acreage in the core was restored to functional habitat, and a monitoring and mitigation fund of up to $36 million); see also Gardner v. United States Bureau of Land Management, 638 F.3d 1217, 1222 (9thCir. 2011) (FLPMA provides BLM "with a great deal of discretion in deciding how to achieve the objectives" of preventing "unnecessary or undue degradation of public lands.") As noted above, there has been a great deal of concern surrounding the BLM's authority to apply a net conservation benefit standard for sage grouse. Regardless of the standard employed, it is most important that there be a high level of certainty that direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of infrastructure development will be offset with high quality, durable, timely, and additional compensatory mitigation projects. High quality compensatory mitigation projects are guided by mitigation programs that appropriately account for the magnitude, extent and duration of impacts, characterize the benefits of compensatory mitigation projects, and ensure that compensatory mitigation projects are durable. We support compensatory mitigation programs that seek to achieve a "reasonable relationship" between impacts and compensatory mitigation and adequately account for habitat quality, temporal losses, and risk of project failure. The 2016 Work Group Mitigation Report states that for compensatory mitigation programs to adequately address residual impacts, they should "provide habitat values, services and functions that bear a reasonable relationship to the lost values, service and functions for which mitigation is required".148 There are large variations in the quality of habitat for sage-grouse, and a significant likelihood of failure of restoration of habitat due to catastrophic fire events and the current low success rates of restoration.149Recognizing these issues, most state sage-grouse mitigation programs, such as Nevada, address the variation in habitat quality by including measures of habitat functionality and using adjustment factors to account for the risk of failure and temporal loss. If habitat functionality is considered, state agencies can use a ratio-based estimate, adjusted to include consideration of factors such as likelihood of success and temporal loss of functions. Compensatory mitigation programs need not rely upon overly complicated measures -they must be defensible but need not be overly precise. BLM has ample authority to apply the full mitigation hierarchy in the sage-grouse plans. FLPMA directs that public lands to be managed in a manner to ensure the protection of ecological and environmental values, preservation and protection of certain public lands in their natural condition, and provision of food and habitat for wildlife.120 This direction guides every significant aspect of the management of public lands under FLPMA, including the development of land management plans,121 project-specific authorizations for the use, occupancy, development of public lands,122 the granting of rights of way on public lands,123 and the promulgation of regulations to implement each of these authorities.124 While FLPMA does not elevate certain uses over others, it does delegate discretion to the BLM to determine whether and how to develop or conserve resources, including whether to require enhancement of resources and values through means such as compensatory mitigation.125 In sum, these statutory policies encompass the protection of environmental and ecological values on the public lands and the provision of food and habitat for fish and wildlife and are furthered by the implementation of the mitigation hierarchy, including compensatory mitigation, to protect and preserve habitat for the sage grouse. Beside the principles of FLPMA and its multiple use/sustained yield standards, individual provisions of that Act confer additional authority on BLM to apply the mitigation hierarchy. In the section on land use plans, for example, FLPMA obliges BLM to consider environmental values, such as fish and wildlife like the sage grouse, in the development of such plans.133More particularly, BLM must also "consider the relative scarcity of the values involved and the availability of alternative means…and sites for realization of those values".134 Sage-grouse habitat is a wildlife value with relative scarcity, as evidenced by the Fish and Wildlife Service's consideration of the species for listing under the ESA, its designation as a special status species by BLM, and its active management by numerous Western states. In the process of developing land use plans which account for this important and relatively scarce species, BLM can provide for the use of "alternative sites" in appropriate instances, thereby resulting in avoidance. Similarly, BLM can specify "alternative means," which can include minimization as well as compensatory mitigation under appropriate circumstances. In short, resources designated as "special" by BLM should be managed through a resource goal that may necessitate compensatory mitigation actions, as appropriate. BLM has the authority to incorporate, implement, and enforce state sage-grouse mitigation programs that meet a recognized set of principles. The 2015 Records of Decision for Greater sage-grouse included a commitment to develop compensatory mitigation strategies in each sage-grouse management zone.142 As the 2015 land use plans were completed and implementation efforts began, however, several states had already completed or had begun efforts to develop compensatory mitigation strategies to implement GRSG conservation measures on state and private lands. It thus became apparent that developing federal mitigation strategies for each management zone would be redundant and could, in fact, create conflicts between state and federal mitigation strategies. This recognition led to the establishment of the Greater Sage-Grouse Mitigation Work Group (2016 Work Group Mitigation Report), and its charge to identify key principles for compensatory mitigation strategies as well as mechanisms to support and institutionalize collaborative state and federal GRSG mitigation efforts.143 The 2018 DEISs state that the purpose of the Work Group was "to enhance cooperation with the states by modifying the approach to Greater Sage-Grouse management in existing land use plans to better align with individual state plans and/or conservation measures and DOI and BLM policy."144 The DEISs also state that, "The BLM will work to be consistent with or complementary to the management actions in [state] plans whenever possible."145 Given BLM's broad authority to adopt and impose mitigation to protect sage-grouse, at a minimum, BLM certainly can act to adopt, implement and enforce the state mitigation programs for use on federal land. In doing so, it is critical to ensure that the state mitigation programs employed by BLM follow commonly recognized principles, such as those laid out by The Nature Conservancy in its 2015 report, Achieving Conservation and Development: Applying the Mitigation Hierarchy (2015 TNC Report).146 These principles include: application of the mitigation hierarchy in a landscape context; policy goals that support conservation and drive accountability; inclusion of stakeholder engagement practices; long-term, durable options; additionality, equivalence, and protection against temporal losses.147 We support efforts of the states to experiment with different mitigation approaches, if their programs and those of the Department, meet the defined principles. The fact that the state programs differ from each other is not necessarily a concern; in fact, variation can often result in good management outcomes, enabling programs to be tailored to the needs of each state, as well as allowing states to experiment and determine which approaches are most effective. We thus support the Department providing minimum principles, consistent with the 2015 TNC Report, that all state programs must meet, and allowing states to exceed those principles if they choose to do so. FLPMA also directs the Secretary to "manage the public lands under principles of multiple use and sustained yield".126The principles of multiple use and sustained yield pervade and underpin each of BLM's authorities under FLPMA, including the policies governing the Act,127the development of land use plans,128the authorization of specific projects,129and the granting of rights of way.130Multiple use means, among other things: the management of public lands…so that they are utilized in the combinations that will best meet the present and future needs of the American people; … a combination of balanced and diverse resource uses that takes into account the long term needs of future generations for renewable and nonrenewable resources, including…range, … watershed, wildlife and fish…; and harmonious and coordinated management of the various resources without permanent impairment of…the quality of the environment...131 Sustained yield means "the achievement and maintenance in perpetuity of a high-level annual or regular periodic output of the various renewable resources of the public lands".132 Sage-grouse is certainly one of the wildlife resources to be protected under the multiple use standard, and it is a resource whose annual and periodic output is to be achieved and maintained in perpetuity under the sustained yield standard. To protect the present and long-term use of the public land for "fish and wildlife" "without impairment of the quality of the environment," BLM has the authority to apply the mitigation hierarchy for sage grouse, including compensatory mitigation in appropriate circumstances. Thus, BLM has additional, clear authority to use the mitigation hierarchy in its land use plans for the protection of the sage-grouse and its habitat. Case law confirms that multiple use/sustained yield principles do "not mandate that every use be accommodated on every piece of land; rather, delicate balancing is required." New Mexico ex rel. Richardson v. BLM, 565 F.3d 683, 710 (10thCir. 2009). The mitigation hierarchy, including compensatory mitigation, provides an important tool for achieving a balance among the multiple uses allowed on public lands. BLM can authorize a consumptive use, like oil and gas development, but balance that use by providing compensatory mitigation for the unavoidable losses suffered by the fish and wildlife. In other words, the mitigation hierarchy can have the effect of expediting and defending authorized consumptive uses of the public lands while simultaneously protecting fish and wildlife resource values in perpetuity. Good mitigation policy and practice is also one of the best opportunities to achieve sustainable development and conservation goals. Projects, even those with relatively small footprints, can pose significant impacts to migratory wildlife. Avoidance of the most important places offers the best way to support a Western landscape where species can thrive. Where impacts cannot be avoided or minimized, well-designed compensatory mitigation programs can achieve the multiple-use, sustained yield objectives of BLM and other federal agencies. Governments, businesses, and local communities are increasingly acting to improve mitigation policy and practice. This is shown by the following: ? 56 countries have or are developing national mitigation policies that require offsets or enable the use of offsets, with most of these policies developed over the past decade. ? Multi-lateral and private sector financial institutions are requiring projects they finance to avoid, minimize, and compensate for biodiversity impacts in accordance with new performance standards. This includes requirements for project developers to avoid impacts to "critical habitat." ? A 2015 analysis of the economic contribution of mitigation determined that the domestic ecological restoration sector directly employs approximately 126,000 workers nationwide and generates $9.5 billion in economic output (sales) annually, with an additional 95,000 jobs and $15 billion in economic output through indirect (business-to business) linkages and increased household spending. Governments, businesses, and local communities are increasingly acting to improve mitigation policy and practice.

The Service's finding was based not on the stability of the species' population, but rather on the "adequacy of regulatory mechanisms and conservation efforts".114Mitigation -avoidance, minimization and, where appropriate, compensatory mitigation -was an essential regulatory and conservation tool that supported this decision. Specifically, the FWS stated: All of the Federal Plans require that impacts to sage-grouse habitats are mitigated and that compensatory mitigation provides a net conservation gain to the species. All mitigation will be achieved by avoiding, minimizing, and compensating for impacts following the regulations from the White House Council on Environmental Quality (e.g., avoid, minimize, and compensate), hereafter referred to as the mitigation hierarchy. If impacts from BLM/USFS management actions and authorized third party actions that result in habitat loss and degradation remain after applying avoidance and minimization measures (i.e., residual impacts), then compensatory mitigation projects will be used to provide a net conservation gain to the species. Any compensatory mitigation will be durable, timely, and in addition to that which would have resulted without the compensatory mitigation.115 The decision outlines the efforts states have made to utilize regulatory mechanisms to address threats to the species, noting that the Wyoming state program "features development stipulations to guide and regulate development within the Core Population Areas to avoid as much as possible, but, if avoidance is not possible, to minimize and mitigate, impacts to sage-grouse and its habitat."116The Service then concluded, "Requiring mitigation for residual impacts provides additional certainty that, while impacts will continue at reduced levels on Federal lands, those impacts will be offset".117 Each of the seven states with significant sage-grouse populations has by now either completed or is working on establishing a mitigation program for sage-grouse. Barrick Gold and the Department of the Interior have also signed a separate agreement to create the Barrick Nevada Sage-Grouse Bank in northern Nevada, creating incentives for Barrick to voluntarily protect, restore and enhance sagebrush ecosystems for the benefit of sage-grouse, while allowing the company to conduct mining activities on other BLM land.118 Last August, the Department of the Interior (DOI) Sage-Grouse Review Team Report, commissioned by Secretary Zinke, concluded that state and federal mitigation programs were an important and critical tool to preclude an ESA listing, noting that both DOI and the states agree on this point. 119The 2015 BLM sage-grouse plans not only employ the mitigation hierarchy as a regulatory and conservation tool to preclude listing, but the listing decision is, in part, also based on the promise of the protections and conservation measures that implementation would deliver. In addition, BLM should have the policy prescriptions and tools available to allow for compensatory mitigation on public lands to offset private or public activities. Impacts to key sage-grouse habitat located on private land, particularly in states such as Nevada, often necessitate the need for compensatory mitigation on public lands, given the limited availability of private land for use as offsets. Maintaining this capability will be critical to conservation success. Last, but far from least, providing agency field staff with training is an important mechanism to accelerate permitting and project review. By committing resources to training field staff, BLM could increase the technical capacity of local staff to implement mitigation policies effectively and do so consistently across field offices. Providing clear direction to project proponents on how the agencies will make avoidance, minimization and compensatory mitigation decisions can help streamline project review and accelerate project approval. In doing so, it is critical to ensure that the state mitigation programs employed by BLM follow commonly recognized principles, such as those laid out by The Nature Conservancy in its 2015 report, Achieving Conservation and Development: Applying the Mitigation Hierarchy (2015 TNC Report).146These principles include: application of the mitigation hierarchy in a landscape context; policy goals that support conservation and drive accountability; inclusion of stakeholder engagement practices; long-term, durable options; additionality, equivalence, and protection against temporal losses.147 We support efforts of the states to experiment with different mitigation approaches, if their programs and those of the Department, meet the defined principles. The fact that the state programs differ from each other is not necessarily a concern; in fact, variation can often result in good management outcomes, enabling programs to be tailored to the needs of each state, as well as allowing states to experiment and determine which approaches are most effective. We thus support the Department providing minimum principles, consistent with the 2015 TNC Report, that all state programs must meet, and allowing states to exceed those principles if they choose to do so. It has recently been argued by several states that BLM may only use compensatory mitigation to prevent "unnecessary or undue degradation". Under this view, where the impacts of a proposed activity have not been demonstrated to rise to the level of "unnecessary or undue degradation," any authorization of that activity which requires either net benefit or no net loss for the actual impacts would violate FLPMA. The unnecessary or undue degradation standard, however, is just a minimum standard for BLM's land management policy; it does not restrain BLM's discretion to adopt or require mitigation in circumstances that do not rise to the level of "undue or unnecessary degradation" or to implement a higher mitigation standard. As explained above, BLM has numerous authorities supporting its use of mitigation more generally, including the policies and principles underlying FLPMA, the foundational multiple use, sustained yield standard, the authority to promulgate regulations, and the specific authorities applicable to land use plans and project-specific authorizations. This point was confirmed in Western Exploration, LLC v. U.S. Department of the Interior.139In considering the argument that a net conservation gain standard for compensatory mitigation violated FLPMA, the court stated: The FEIS states that if actions by third parties result in habitat loss and degradation, even after applying avoidance and minimization measures, then compensatory mitigation projects will be used to provide a net conservation gain to the sage-grouse. The Agencies' goals to enhance, conserve, and restore sage-grouse habitat and to increase the abundance and distribution of the species, they argue, is best met by the net conservation gain strategy because it permits disturbances so long as habitat loss is both mitigated and counteracted through restorative projects. If anything, this strategy demonstrates that the Agencies allow some degradation to public land to occur for multiple use purposes, but that degradation caused to sage-grouse habitat on that land be counteracted. The Court fails to see how BLM's decision to implement this standard is arbitrary and capricious. Moreover, the Court cannot find that BLM did not consider all relevant factors in choosing this strategy… In sum, Plaintiffs fail to establish that BLM's challenged decisions under FLPMA are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.140 Both FLPMA and the case law thus establish that BLM has ample discretion to go beyond the prevention of unnecessary or undue degradation to seek compensatory mitigation that will meet "the long-term needs of future generations for renewable and non-renewable resources, including, but not limited to, . . . wildlife and . . . natural scenic, scientific and historical values."141None of these authorities distinguish between avoidance, minimization, and compensatory mitigation or prohibit or circumscribe compensatory mitigation; rather, the authorities are broad and support the use of each aspect of mitigation in appropriate circumstances. BLM's obligations, discretion and authority are particularly important in coordinating with states, especially where states lack ownership or authority to carry out needed mitigation. XI. MITIGATION IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF FEDERAL AND STATE EFFORTS, AND MUST BE MAINTAINED. Each of the DEISs contains similar language requesting comments on how the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) should consider and implement sage-grouse mitigation: The DOI and the BLM have also modified their mitigation policies since the 2015 plans were finalized. The public did not have the opportunity to comment specifically on a net conservation gain approach to compensatory mitigation during the 2015 land use planning process. In addition, the DOI and the BLM are evaluating whether the implementation of a compensatory mitigation standard on public lands is appropriate and consistent with applicable legal authorities. We request public comment about how the BLM should consider and implement mitigation with respect to the Greater Sage-Grouse, including alternative approaches to requiring compensatory mitigation in BLM land use plans.110 For some states, such as Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming, the DEIS also removed the requirement of a net conservation gain standard for their mitigation programs.111 Overall: 1. Mitigation (avoidance, minimization, and compensation) as adopted in the 2015 BLM land use plans is an effective and well-established tool that the Fish and Wildlife Service relied upon to support its decision not to list the Greater Sage-Grouse as threatened or endangered under the ESA. Sound mitigation policy provides agencies such as BLM with a structured, rational, and transparent framework for reviewing use requests and meeting their multiple use and sustained yield mandates. The 2015 BLM sage-grouse plans employed the mitigation hierarchy to help reach their goal of protecting sage-grouse while also allowing multiple uses to proceed by ensuring that associated impacts to habitat are fully offset. 2. BLM has ample authority to apply the full mitigation hierarchy in the sage-grouse plans. Both FLPMA and case law provide BLM the discretion to seek compensatory mitigation to protect sage-grouse. 3. BLM has the authority to incorporate, implement, and enforce state sage-grouse mitigation programs that meet a recognized set of principles. We recommend that these principles should be consistent with those laid out by The Nature Conservancy in its 2015 report, Achieving Conservation and Development: Applying the Mitigation Hierarchy. In addition, we support compensatory mitigation programs that seek to achieve a "reasonable relationship" between impacts and compensatory mitigation and adequately account for habitat quality, temporal losses, and risk of project failure. The amount and type of compensatory mitigation should be proportional to, and have a reasonable relationship to, direct and indirect impacts. 2.3.15 Modifying Waivers, Exceptions, and Modifications of Fluid Minerals As an example, the general approach conditions included in the Draft Colorado RMP Amendment related to no surface occupancy stipulations are more specific and include public engagement. * Waivers are permitted if the area lacks "protected attributes" -as determined through coordination with Colorado Parks and Wildlife and following a 30-day public notice/comment period * Modifications and exceptions are permitted if: (1) impacts are fully offset by compensatory mitigation; or (2) no impacts to greater sage-grouse would occur because of terrain or habitat type -but can only be applied after consultation with Colorado Parks and Wildlife. CO Draft RMP Amendment/EIS, pp. 2-4 -2-5. Overall, one-time exceptions should be the preferred approach where relief is sought from protective stipulations, such that the safeguards prescribed in these stipulations will remain in place for the majority of oil and gas leases. Waivers, exceptions and modifications should only be granted from no surface occupancy (NSO) stipulations or any stipulations in PHMA after a 30-day public notice and comment period. Further, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service should have the opportunity to submit information for consideration prior to granting waivers, exceptions and modifications. Finally, it is critical that BLM track waivers, exceptions and modifications requested and those granted, and make that information available to the public. These records will provide important insight into how the stipulations are being applied and the potential impact of waivers, exceptions and modifications on the overall function of the plans. This information will also allow BLM to determine if the availability of or criteria for granting waivers, exceptions and modifications needs to be further narrowed in order to ensure sufficient protection for sage-grouse habitat. Accordingly, we recommend that each plan include language that provides: Exceptions will be considered prior to considering waivers or modifications. If the BLM determines that a waiver or modification is more appropriate, the reasons for such decisions will be documented. Waivers are permitted if the area lacks "protected attributes" -as determined through coordination with the appropriate state wildlife agency. Modifications and exceptions are permitted if: (1) impacts are fully and verifiably offset by compensatory mitigation; or (2) there are no impacts to greater sage-grouse because of terrain or habitat type, based on consultation with the applicable state wildlife agency. Prior to granting any waivers, exceptions and modifications, BLM will insure that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has the opportunity to submit information for consideration. For no surface occupancy stipulations or stipulations in Priority Habitat Management Areas, waivers exceptions and modifications will only be granted following a 30-day public notice and comment period. BLM will maintain an ongoing record of requests for waivers, exceptions and modifications and whether those requests are granted, and will publish those cumulative results on a quarterly basis. V. RECOMMENDED APPROACH TO WAIVERS, EXCEPTIONS AND MODIFICATION TO OIL AND GAS LEASE STIPULATIONS. The 2015 Sage-grouse Plans include numerous oil and gas lease stipulations that apply to development in order to protect sage-grouse and sage-grouse habitat, including no surface occupancy stipulations, timing limitations and surface use limitations. The draft amendments and EISs also rely on lease stipulations. However, the protections actually provided by the stipulations are only reliable and effective to the extent that the safeguards are applied. Waivers (permanent exemption that applies to the entire leasehold), exceptions (one-time exemption for a particular site within the leasehold) and modifications (change to the lease stipulation, either temporarily or for the term of the lease, can apply to the entire leasehold or certain areas) all permit an operator to avoid compliance with the requirements of a stipulation. Where these loopholes are permitted and used, the protections that the stipulations are supposed to provide can be undermined. Recent studies confirm that oil and gas development can harm both sage-grouse habitat and lifecycle activities, such as breeding.46 Consequently, it is vital that protections associated with oil and gas development are reliably applied and, as a result, that waivers, exceptions and modifications are not broadly used to weaken those protections. While we can accept narrowly prescribed waivers, exceptions and modifications to lease stipulations that are based on very specific criteria, broad standards, such as those currently included in the Nevada Draft RMP Amendment/EIS are not acceptable. 2.3.16 Noise Management Outside of PHMA Comment: 2 Document: CH 3 -Affected Environment 3.11 Noise 3.11.5 Page Number: 3-95 Line Number: 14 Local studies conducted for the PAPA found existing ambient sound levels (L50) at four locations throughout the Upper Green River area for hours important to greater sage-grouse lek behavior (1800-0800) were 19.9 dBA, 14.8 dBA, 14.3 dBA, and 14.5 dBA. The median L50 for all 18000800 hours at all sites was 15.4 dBA. Comment: 5 Document: CH 3 -Affected Environment 3.11 Noise 3.11.5.3 Page Number: 3-97 Line Number: 1-16 The discussion including the BLM Wyoming sage-Grouse RMP Amendments should include Appendix C, Required Design Features identifying ambient measures as 20-24 dBA at sunrise at the perimeter of a lek during active lek season. Comment: 7 Document: CH 2 -Alternatives 2.4.3 Greater Sagegrouse habitat management Page Number: 2-8 Line Number: 25-27 Noise protocols for Wyoming have been developed and should be required (Ambrose and MacDonald 2015. Review of sound level measurements in Wyoming relative to greater sage grouse and recommended protocol for future measurements) Management of noise should include but not be limited to, timing restrictions during lekking, nesting and brood rearing season, and design features that include; siting facilities outside of grouse priority habitat or placed to take advantage of topography, application of sound blankets and or sound walls, use of mufflers, and reducing traffic noise through controlled traffic patterns and restricting travel hours to between 8 am and 6 pm within 2 miles of the perimeter of a lek. Comment:3 Document: CH 3 -Affected Environment 3.11 Noise 3.11.5.2 PAge Number: 3-95 Line Number: 27 We are concerned for the validity of the noise data provided for this project as the microphone height was reported as being 2.43 meters (8 feet) above the ground. Protocols for noise monitoring were established for the Pinedale Field Office, Pinedale Anticline Project Area which requires a microphone height of 0.3 m (1 foot) to address the influence of wind on sound measurement. Comment:4 Document: CH 3 -Affected Environment 3.11 Noise 3.11.5.2 Page Number: 3-96 Line Number:2-7 An evaluation of sound level studies was conducted for WGFD which looked at noise data collected throughout Wyoming (Ambrose, S. and J. MacDonald, 2015. Review of Sound Level Measurements in Wyoming Relative to Greater Sage-grouse and Recommended Protocol for Future Measurements.) The authors recommended microphones be placed 1 foot from the ground (0.30 m) to more accurately reflect sounds experienced by the bird. They also found wind to have a clear influence on dBA data and metrics; the higher the wind speed, the higher the dBA levels "As wind speed increased, dBA levels increased, regardless of microphone height; however, dBA levels at 1.5 m were significantly higher than dBA levels at 0.3 m (up to 8.7 dBA higher). What these data indicate is that at a microphone height of 0.3 m, the increase in dBA level was due to sounds of wind through vegetation. The report goes on to say, "Sounds due to wind are of two types: natural sounds, such as leaves rustling and the sound of wind through vegetation, and wind-induced equipment sounds, such as turbulence over the diaphragm of the microphone, wind hitting the foam wind screen, wind causing the microphone tripod to move, or wind sounds through cables securing the tripod. Wind-induced equipment sounds are not part of the acoustic environment, but rather an artifact of data collection. Such data should not be included in analysis. "We are concerned for the validity of the noise data provided for this project as the microphone height was reported as being 2.43 meters (8 feet) above the ground. Also, no monitoring data was excluded from the analysis even though three of the microphones were found tipped over due to wind. This would suggest the data is flawed as the influence of noise and equipment falling over are not legitimate sounds of the environment, but artifacts of wind-equipment interaction. Comment:6 Document: CH 3 -Affected Environment 3.11 Noise 3.11.5.3 Page Number: 3-99 Line Number:1-8 Minimum L50 values reported for the monitoring sites were elevated due to the microphone height being at 8 feet from the ground and tipping over resulting in additive influence from wind. The single average L50 value of 25 dBA recommended to characterize the ambient noise level at the perimeter of lek location in the NPL Project EIS is flawed. By comparison, within the PAPA (an active gas field) the median L50 dBA for all hours at all leks for the years 2013-2015 was 26.0 dBA (range 17.5-36.9). Additionally, monitoring noise impacts in the PAPA has revealed lek declines for all leks exposed noise > 26 dBA from the perimeter of a lek. Comment: 1 Document: CH 3 -Affected Environment 3.11 Noise Page Number: 3-89 through 3-99 This section proposes to evaluate existing sound levels within the proposed project area to adequately assess noise-related impacts from the proposed action. The data was collected in 2012 and likely does not represent sound levels found in the project area today. Six of the 10 leks within the proposed project area are showing declining trends without the addition of this project activity. This suggests there are already impacts to sage grouse from existing anthropogenic activities. Four of the leks showing declining trends are within a Core area for sage grouse This project evaluation drew comparisons f a study conducted in Lander WY. To adequately assess the noise-related impacts of the NPL Project, it would be appropriate to incorporate local baseline data. Such data was collected for the adjacent Pinedale Anticline Project Area (PAPA) and should be included in this project evaluation. Noise level data has been collected throughout the Upper Green River Valley since 2009. This information is available from published reports on the BLMPAPO web page (http://www.wy.blm.gov/jio-papo/). Instead the analysis drew comparisons only to a study conducted in Lander WY. 2.3.17 Preferred Alternative Proposed Alternative to Maintain the "Not Warranted" Finding The 2015 Sage-grouse Plans were the basis for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) finding that listing the greater sage-grouse under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is no longer warranted. This decision was based on a determination that the plans provide sufficient certainty regarding their implementation and effectiveness and must not be threatened by this amendment process. The surest way to maintain the not warranted decision would be to maintain the current 2015 Sage-grouse Plans by adopting the "no action" alternative in this amendment process, which would still provide sufficient flexibility to adapt through implementation. However, recent instruction memoranda and policy changes (such as rescinding guidance on mitigation) that alter implementation of the 2015 plans are already undermining their effectiveness. The changes to the 2015 plans that are currently under review further jeopardize the structure and function of the plans and, as a result, risk the important protections that safeguard habitat and support FWS's not warranted finding. The collaborative work that went into creating the original plans should be honored. To the extent that DOI and BLM are committed to making some changes to the plans while also maintaining necessary protections to justify the Fish and Wildlife Service's finding, this proposed alternative highlights key elements to be incorporated in the plans, including maintaining current provisions and clarifying or improving others. This alternative is further supported by the 2018 U.S. Geological Survey report (https://doi.org/10.3133/ofr20181017), which found that research since 2015 reinforces the science underlying the structure and function of the 2015 Sage-grouse Plans. The following describes the key elements of our recommended alternative. Additional detail regarding implementation of the elements is available in technical comments. The surest way to maintain the not warranted decision would be to maintain the current 2015 Sage-grouse Plans by adopting the "no action" alternative in this amendment process, which would still provide sufficient flexibility to adapt through implementation.

Prioritization should be based on analyzing factors such as the condition of habitat and oil and gas potential to make informed decisions about when the best approach would be to prioritize other proposed lease or permits, or even defer leasing or phase development in order to ensure habitat is protected. In order to ensure adequate conservation of sage-grouse and sage-grouse habitat, prioritization of oil and gas leasing and development cannot be based solely on whether BLM has sufficient resources to process leasing nominations or applications for permits to drill in sage-grouse habitat. Rather, there must be a thorough consideration of opportunities to protect habitat. These opportunities include deferring proposed leasing that would unnecessarily harm habitat or where leasing is not the best use of agency resources (both internal resources and in terms of allocating our public lands), such as where there is low or no potential for leasing, high quality habitat and no surrounding infrastructure or development. BLM is not obligated to lease every parcel that is proposed nor is there a requirement that any deferral be replaced with another parcel to somehow maintain the same number of parcels or acres up for lease. See, e.g., New Mexico ex. rel. Richardson v. BLM, 565 F.3d 683, 710 (10th Cir. 2009) ("It is past doubt that the principle of multiple use does not require BLM to prioritize development over other uses."). Rather, the agency can take into account relevant factors and the importance of conserving grouse habitat to meaningfully prioritize leasing where it is most appropriate and least harmful to sage-grouse habitat. The impact such factors could have on leasing decisions is demonstrated by the map below, which shows the distribution of proposed lease sale parcels for the December 2018 sale in sage-grouse habitat in the Kremmling (Colorado) Field Office: [SEE ATTACHMENT PG 28] Explicitly considering the value of habitat and the potential for actual energy production would unquestionably help the agency prioritize the right parcels for leasing. RECOMMENDED APPROACH TO PRIORITIZING OIL AND GAS LEASING AND DEVELOPMENT OUTSIDE SAGE-GROUSE HABITAT. The 2015 Sage-grouse Plans are clear as to the need for prioritizing oil and gas leasing and drilling outside sage-grouse habitat and the desired effect of related actions. From the Rocky Mountain Record of Decision (p. 1-25): . . . the ARMPs and ARMPAs prioritize oil and gas leasing and development outside of identified PHMAs and GHMAs. This is to further limit future surface disturbance and encourage new development in areas that would not conflict with GRSG. This objective is intended to guide development to lower conflict areas and as such protect important habitat and reduce the time and cost associated with oil and gas leasing development by avoiding sensitive areas, reducing the complexity of environmental review and analysis of potential impacts on sensitive species, and decreasing the need for compensatory mitigation. The Rocky Mountain ROD also identifies prioritizing oil and gas leasing and development outside habitat as a "key component" and a "key management response" (pp. 1-18 -1-19). The Buffalo Field Office ARMP/ROD (p. 50) and Wyoming 9-Plan ARMPA (p. 24) echo this directive, including the following objective: Priority will be given to leasing and development of fluid mineral resources, including geothermal, outside of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. When analyzing leasing and authorizing development of fluid mineral resources, including geothermal, in priority habitat (core population areas and core population connectivity corridors) and general habitat, and subject to applicable stipulations for the conservation of Greater Sage-Grouse, priority will be given to development in non-habitat areas first and then in the least suitable habitat for Greater Sage-Grouse. (emphasis added). The inter-agency, expert Conservation Objectives Team (COT) Report confirms the need to prioritize development outside habitat, finding that: Sage-grouse populations can be significantly reduced, and in some cases locally extirpated, by nonrenewable energy development activities, even when mitigative measures are implemented (Walker et al. 2007). The persistent and increasing demand for energy resources is resulting in their continued development within sage-grouse range, and may cause further habitat fragmentation. . . . Both nonrenewable and renewable energy developments are increasing within the range of sage-grouse, and this growth is likely to continue given current and projected demands for energy.44 As a result, the COT Report recommended the following objective for energy development: "Energy development should be designed to ensure that it will not impinge upon stable or increasing sage-grouse population trends."45 Prioritization for Leasing BLM has used specific factors to guide prioritization of leasing outside sage-grouse habitat. For instance, in assessing the December 2017 lease sale for the Vernal Field Office (https://eplanning.blm.gov/epl-frontoffice/ projects/nepa/80165/130450/158729/Final_Vernal_EA.pdf), BLM created a chart evaluating how certain prioritization considerations applied to parcels (existing lease, existing unit, field-EIS, high gas potential, high oil potential), completed site visits to confirm conditions on the ground, and then only included parcels in the lease sale that met the majority of the factors. We propose that the BLM use the following factors: * Intactness/quality of habitat -classification of habitat (i.e., priority, important, general); quality of habitat; importance for connectivity or seasonal habitat * Population trends in applicable zone or biologically significant unit * Distance from existing disturbance * Distance from existing infrastructure -roads, well pads, pipelines * Need for additional infrastructure -estimated surface disturbance * Adjacent to existing lease -yes/no/proximity * Within existing oil and gas unit * Within existing master leasing plan * Oil potential -none, low, moderate, high * Natural gas potential -none, low, moderate, high BLM will conduct site visits to confirm conclusions, as needed. Decisions to include nominated lease parcels in sage-grouse habitat in lease sales will be based on the following evaluation of factors: -Parcels that do not have moderate or high potential should not be offered. -Parcels that have high quality habitat, are not in proximity to existing disturbance and/or require additional infrastructure to be developed should not be offered. -Parcels that are in close proximity to existing disturbance and infrastructure, and are already within an existing oil and gas unit or master leasing plan that has been analyzed in an environmental impact statement may be considered for leasing. -Parcels outside priority habitat should be considered for leasing prior to parcels in PHMA. Prioritization in Development BLM will prioritize development outside sage-grouse habitat by considering the following factors: * Intactness/quality of habitat -classification of habitat (i.e., priority, important, general); quality of habitat; quality of habitat; importance for connectivity or season habitat * Population trends in applicable zone or biologically significant unit * Distance from a lek * Need for new infrastructure -estimated surface disturbance * Ability to use existing well pad and infrastructure * Oil potential -none, low, moderate, high * Natural gas potential -none, low, moderate, high These factors will apply to both exploratory and other types of development activities. BLM will conduct site visits to confirm conclusions, as needed. Decisions to approve applications for permits to drill in sage-grouse habitat will be based on the following evaluation of factors: -Where applications for permits to drill are in high quality/intact habitat, are not in proximity to existing disturbance and/or require additional infrastructure to be developed, they will not be prioritized and opportunities will be evaluated to relocate permits. -Where applications for permits to drill are not in areas with high or moderate potential, they will not be prioritized. -Where applications for permits to drill are able to use existing well pads and infrastructure and otherwise avoid surface disturbance and noise impacts to leks, they are more suitable for processing and approval. -Applications for permits to drill outside priority habitat should be considered for approval prior to parcels in PHMA. Prioritization is also essential when it comes to the location of oil and gas leasing and development. BLM makes no mention of lease prioritization in the DEIS despite previous guidance regarding lease prioritization. Quite simply, it makes perfect sense to prioritize the leasing and development of oil and gas resources outside of priority and general habitat. Nearly 90% of Colorado's Greater sage grouse population is concentrated in Moffat and Jackson Counties. Without the highest quality habitat being conserved, the risk of adversely impacting those populations is far too high and in turn, the likelihood of a future ESA listing grows, which no one wants to see happen. 2.3.19 Range of Alternatives Alternatives are measured against purpose and need; BLM has not considered a reasonable range of alternatives in the Draft EIS based on the restated purpose and need. When developing an EIS, the "range of reasonable alternatives is measured against the 'Purpose and Need' section…." Cal. ex rel. Lockyer v. U.S. Dep't. of Agriculture, 459 F. Supp. 2d 874, 905 (N.D. Calif., 2006), aff'd, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 19219 (9th Cir. 2009). The statement of "purpose and need" is the basis upon "which the agency is responding in proposing the alternatives including the proposed action." 40 C.F.R. §1502.13 and City of Carmel-by-the-Sea v. U.S. Dep't. of Transportation, 123 F.3d 1142, 1155 (9th Cir. 1997). Therefore, if the purpose and need of the 2018 Draft EIS for the Greater Sage-Grouse changes from the purpose and need for the 2015 EIS, then the range of alternatives must necessarily change as well. Even the 2018 Draft EIS recognizes that "BLM's purpose and need for this planning action helps define the scope of proposed alternative actions…" Nevada DEIS, p. ES-2. In Lockyer, the Forest Service argued that it could base its EIS for the new 2005 version of the "Roadless Rule" upon the EIS (and its alternatives) for 2001 Roadless Rule that it replaced. The court found: This argument fundamentally misconstrues the role of the consideration of reasonable alternatives, which lies at the heart of any NEPA analysis. Failure to consider reasonable alternatives thwarts the goals of informed decision making and meaningful public comment before the environmental die is cast. Lockyer at 905 (citations omitted). The Forest Service proposed the 2005 Roadless Rule as a means to give states more authority over designating roadless areas on federal land. In fact, the Forest Service called the 2005 rule the "State Petitions" rule. While the Forest Service argued the 2005 rule and the 2001 rule "share the same purpose and need," the Court concluded that their purposes were "plainly quite different" because the 2005 rule granted state-specific exemptions. Lockyer at 906. The 2018 Draft EISs are clear that their purpose and need is different from the 2015 EISs. Under the heading "Purpose of and Need for Action," the Draft EISs state that "The purpose of this RMPA/EIS is to enhance cooperation with the states by modifying the approach to Greater Sage-Grouse management in existing land use plans to better align with individual state plans and conservation measures and with DOI and BLM policy." See, e.g. Nevada DEIS, p. 1-3. Because the 2018 Draft EIS states a different purpose and need compared to the 2015 EIS, BLM, pursuant to Lockyer, must necessarily consider a new range of alternatives to meet that new purpose and need. Under Lockyer, BLM in 2018 cannot tier to alternatives considered for the different purpose and need of the 2015 EIS. The No-Action Alternative in the Draft EIS is the baseline, not a real alternative. The 2018 Draft EISs for the Greater Sage-Grouse purport to compare two alternatives -the "No Action Alternative" versus the "Management Alignment Alternative." See, e.g. Nevada DEIS, p. 2-3. But the "'no action alternative generally does not satisfy the proposed action's purpose and need; its inclusion in the Environmental Impact Statement is required by NEPA as a basis for comparison.'" Lockyer at 905, quoting Ronald E. Bass, Albert I. Herson & Kenneth M. Bogdan, The NEPA Book: A Step-by-Step Guide on How to Comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, 95 (2d. ed. 2001). Because the No Action Alternative fails to satisfy the purpose and need of the 2018 Draft EISs, the Draft EISs propose only one alternative: the Management Alignment Alternative. When there is only one alternative, it is not, by definition, an alternative at all. "[T]he agency must consider a range of alternatives that covers the full spectrum of possibilities." Sierra Club v. Watkins, 808 F. Supp. 852, 872 D.D.C. 1991). By proposing the "Management Alignment Alternative" as the only option to the status quo, BLM has failed to "consider a range of alternatives that covers the full spectrum of possibilities." Id. at 872. BLM must evaluate additional management alternatives. By failing to thoroughly evaluate more than one alternative, BLM is not complying with NEPA.. See TWS v. Wisely, 524 F. Supp. 2d 1285, 1312 (D. Colo. 2007) (BLM violated NEPA by failing to consider "middle-ground compromise between the absolutism of the outright leasing and no action alternatives"); Muckleshoot Indian Tribe v. US Forest Serv., 177 F.3d 800, 813 (9thCir. 1999) (NEPA analysis failed to consider reasonable range of alternatives where it "considered only a no action alternative along with two virtually identical alternatives"). BLM must consider additional alternatives, including alternatives that are more environmentally protective than the Management Alignment Alternative. The purpose and need of the 2015 Sage-grouse Plans is to "conserve, enhance, and restore GRSG habitat by eliminating or minimizing threats to their habitat" (Rocky Mountain Record of Decision, p. 1-21), while the 2018 amendments are based on a purpose to "enhance cooperation with the states." BLM should consider an alternative that is explicitly focused on enhancing cooperation with the states while conserving, enhancing and restoring sage-grouse habitat. For instance, the projection of on-the-ground activities set out in Table ES-1 of the 2018 EISs shows a reduction in restoration efforts, but a more conservation-oriented alternative would consider increasing these projects. Similarly, this alternative would evaluate how to enhance cooperation with the states while retaining more of the core protections and management approaches that made the previous plans the basis for the FWS determination that listing was no longer warranted under the ESA. This alternative would be more environmentally protective and provide more certainty. We have developed a proposed alternative that would accomplish these goals, set out in detail in Attachment 1, incorporated herein by reference. BLM should also have considered alternatives to complete additional analysis of key protective provisions that it is proposing to eliminate through the DEISs: net conservation gain and Sagebrush Focal Areas (SFA). The DEISs state: The public did not have the opportunity to comment specifically on a net conservation gain approach to compensatory mitigation during the 2015 land use planning process. In addition, the DOI and the BLM are evaluating whether the implementation of compensatory mitigation standard on public lands is appropriate and consistent with applicable legal authorities. We request public comment about how the BLM should consider and implement mitigation with respect to the Greater Sage-Grouse, including alternative approaches to requiring compensatory mitigation in BLM land use plans. See, e.g. Utah DEIS, p. ES-8. The Management Alignment Alternative in the DEISs for Utah and Wyoming proposes to remove this standard. Utah DEIS, p. ES-8; Wyoming DEIS, p. ES-6. Rather than seeking comments only on eliminating this approach, BLM should evaluate an alternative that would retain the approach, while leaving the agency flexibility to determine applicable standards by working with the states. The DEISs also propose eliminating SFAs in Utah, Wyoming, Nevada and Idaho. Utah DEIS, p. 2-6; Wyoming DEIS, p. ES-6; Nevada DEIS, p. 1-8; Idaho DEIS, p. 2-7. BLM's scoping notice stated that the agency "seeks comments on the SFA designation" in response to the decision in Western Exploration, LLC v. U.S. Dep't of the Interior, 250 F. Supp. 3d 718 (D. Nev. 2017), which found BLM must conduct supplemental NEPA analysis in order to support the designation. 82 Fed. Reg. 47248, 47249 (Oct. 11, 2017). As another alternative, BLM should evaluate the impacts of the SFAs without the previously-proposed mineral withdrawal, which has now been withdrawn, in light of how those designations and the important protective measures they provide (in addition to the withdrawal protections) benefit sage-grouse habitat and how application can be better coordinated with the states. The range of alternatives is insufficient. The Draft EISs only consider one alternative, the "Management Alignment Alternative" and refer to the 2015 Sage-grouse Plans as the "No Action Alternative." This does not meet BLM's obligations under NEPA. The range of alternatives is "the heart of the environmental impact statement." 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14. NEPA requires BLM to "rigorously explore and objectively evaluate" a range of alternatives to proposed federal actions. See 40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.14(a) and 1508.25(c). NEPA's requirement that alternatives be studied, developed, and described both guides the substance of environmental decision-making and provides evidence that the mandated decision-making process has actually taken place. Informed and meaningful consideration of alternatives --including the no action alternative --is thus an integral part of the statutory scheme. Bob Marshall Alliance v. Hodel, 852 F.2d 1223, 1228 (9th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1066 (1989) (citations and emphasis omitted). "An agency must look at every reasonable alternative, with the range dictated by the nature and scope of the proposed action." Northwest Envtl Defense Center v. Bonneville Power Admin., 117 F.3d 1520, 1538 (9thCir. 1997). An agency violates NEPA by failing to "rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives" to the proposed action. City of Tenakee Springs v. Clough, 915 F.2d 1308, 1310 (9thCir. 1990) (quoting 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14). This evaluation extends to considering more environmentally protective alternatives and mitigation measures. See, e.g., Kootenai Tribe of Idaho v. Veneman, 313 F.3d 1094,1122-1123 (9thCir. 2002) (and cases cited therein). By only meaningfully considering one alternative and not considering alternatives that would be more environmentally protective, BLM has failed to consider a reasonable range of alternatives. The 2018 Draft EISs also state that their purpose and need is to "better align with … DOI and BLM policy." See, e.g. Nevada DEIS, p. 1-3. That policy was issued on June 7, 2017, through Secretarial Order 3353, "Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation and Cooperation with Western States." The Secretarial Order stated that one of the policy goals for managing the Greater Sage-Grouse is to "give appropriate weight to the value of energy and other development on public lands" in compliance with President Trump's Executive Order of March 28, 2017, "Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth" (EO 13783) The new "DOI and BLM policy" is completely opposite of the purpose and need expressed in the 2015 EIS, which identified the "major threats" to sage grouse habitat as "exploration and development" of hard rock mining and fluid mineral development. Nevada DEIS, p. 1-8. The purpose and need for the 2018 Draft EISs -and thus the basis for the 2018 alternatives -has shifted from conservation in 2015 to energy development in 2018: "As analyzed in the [2015 EIS], all of the previously analyzed alternatives, including one proposing constraints stricter than the current management plan, were predicted to result in a loss of development opportunities on public lands (emphasis added)." Nevada DEIS, p. 2-3. The purpose and need of the 2018 Draft EIS, pursuant to Secretarial Order 3353, is to "contribut[e] to economic growth and energy independence" (Nevada DEIS, p. 2-3), or, in other words, increase development opportunities on public lands. Therefore, BLM cannot base the pro-development alternatives in its 2018 Draft EISs upon the 2015 alternatives that had a purpose and need focused on conservation and avoidance of an ESA listing, not energy independence and economic growth. Because the "range of reasonable alternatives is measured against the'Purpose and Need' section," Lockyer at 905, the range of alternatives in the 2018 Draft EIS fail to account for the dramatic change in purpose and need compared to the 2015 EIS, which is a violation of NEPA. 40 C.F.R. §1502.13. In another section of these comments we discuss the purpose and need issue in the 2018 EISs in more detail. 2.3.20 Recreation These management strategies are more than smart conservation – they also support our local economies. A healthy sagebrush ecosystem is an important economic driver for Western economies and hundreds of other species that live in sagebrush habitat including the golden eagle, elk, pronghorn and mule deer. Research has shown that across the American West, the sagebrush ecosystem powers the outdoor recreation industry to the tune of more than $1 billion—$76 million in Colorado alone. 2.3.21 Sagebrush Focal Areas Concerns with removal of SFAs in Idaho, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. Unfortunately, under the draft land use plans and the accompanying EISs that BLM has prepared for proposed changes to the 2015 Sage-grouse Plans, the BLM would eliminate SFAs in the states of Idaho, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. This would include about 8.7 million acres of public land. It represents a tremendous downgrade in land use plan protections that are oriented towards sage-grouse conservation. While BLM previously decided to not pursue the withdrawal from mineral location and entry that was recommended under the 2015 land use plans for the approximately 10 million acres of SFAs that are located in the states of Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada, and Utah, this new, additional proposal represents a further step backward. It is a retreat from environmental protections that have been recognized as needed for sage-grouse conservation by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (and BLM). But given the previous retreat relative to mineral entry, the effect of the current proposed elimination of the SFAs in four of the states in the range of the sage-grouse is somewhat less significant. Still, there will be a number of lost or modified protections that applied to SFAs in one or more of the four states. These include provisions under the 2015 plans that require oil and gas leasing to only be allowed pursuant to a no surface occupancy (NSO) stipulation that was not subject to waiver, exception, or modification (Idaho, Nevada, and Utah); prioritizing SFAs for vegetation and conservation actions (Idaho, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming); and prohibitions of geothermal development in SFAs (Nevada). These are important protections that must be maintained in priority habitat management areas (PHMA) if SFAs no longer exist in the four states. The value of these protections was recognized by the Fish and Wildlife Service in its 2015 not warranted decision, and thus are a key component of the land use plans that must be maintained if the not warranted decision is to be sustained, which it must be. "Based on our recommendation to further protect sage-grouse population centers that have been identified in the scientific literature as critically important for the species and areas identified through our analysis as important for conservation, BLM and USFS designated areas as Sagebrush Focal Areas (SFA) and added protections that would further limit new, human-caused surface disturbance in SFAs." 80 Fed. Reg. 59858, 59875 (Oct. 2, 2015). SFAs "are the areas that the Federal Plans manage as the highest priority lands in PHMAs for sage-grouse conservation (Figure 5)." Id. at 59878. They are "strongholds" for sagegrouse conservation and as mentioned above contain important connectivity habitat and high densities of breeding birds. Id. The Fish and Wildlife Service recognized that in addition to PHMA protections, the protections mentioned above would also apply in SFAs, including mineral entry withdrawal, NSO stipulations for fluid minerals with no waivers, exceptions, or modifications, and prioritizing management and conservation actions. Id. This was because SFAs need "the most conservative strategies to protect sage-grouse and habitat." Id. Grazing permit review is also prioritized in SFAs. Id. at 59877, 59910. Clearly the protections in SFAs that would be lost by eliminating SFAs must be maintained in the remaining PHMAs, and the land use plan amendments BLM is contemplating must so provide. The BLM should modify the EISs and proposed land use plan amendments in Idaho, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming to specifically provide that the fluid minerals NSO stipulation with no waivers, exceptions, or modifications, the vegetation and conservation management stipulation, and where appropriate the prohibition on geothermal development will be specifically incorporated into and made a part of the PHMAs in those states. Inconsistent treatment across the plans appears arbitrary and capricious. While the BLM is planning to eliminate SFAs in Idaho, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming, they would be maintained in Oregon and Montana. The BLM provides no explanation for this differential treatment of central aspects of the 2015 Sage-grouse Plans, yet the agency must do so to comply with fundamental legal requirements that apply to Administrative Procedure Act rulemaking efforts, the hard look and public involvement provisions of NEPA, and the land use planning provisions of the FLPMA. In Oregon, the BLM states that SFAs presented "issues [that] require clarification of language in the 2015 ROD/ARMPA but do not require new analysis" and in any event the only issue that requires clarification relative to SFAs is withdrawal from mineral entry. Oregon Draft Resource Management Plan (RMP) and EIS at 1-8. The BLM does not mention Montana in this NEPA analysis because that state desires to leave its 2015 sage-grouse plans intact. Therefore, SFAs would remain intact in Montana. But in Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, and Nevada elimination of SFAs would be pursued with little explanation. In Wyoming "[u]nder the Management Alignment Alternative, there would be no designation of SFAs." Wyoming Draft RMP and EIS at 4-15. According to the BLM, the environmental impact of not having SFAs was considered in the no action alternative in the 2015 Approved Resource Management Plan Amendment (ARMPA), and in the other Wyoming RMPs that did not consider SFAs, the impacts of designating PHMAs encompassed the impacts of SFAs. Id. The BLM seems to believe that its 2016 Draft EIS for Sagebrush Focal Area Withdrawal concluded that SFAs had little conservation benefit and it isonly interested in issues related to the nonexistent mineral withdrawal in any event. Id. at ES-3, 1-8, 4-16. In Idaho, BLM without explanation, states SFAs duplicate protections, focus on mere de minimis activities, do not provide appreciable benefits for sage-grouse, and they complicate the state's adaptive management provisions. Idaho Draft RMP and EIS at ES-3, 1-6. BLM concludes "[t]he removal of SFA designations would have no measurable effect on the conservation of Greater Sage-Grouse in Idaho because the Management Direction proposed for PHMA would remain in place and continue to protect Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. SFA removal would add flexibility for responsible development with stringent requirements including mitigation to achieve a no net loss to Greater Sage-Grouse habitat in PHMA." Id. at 4-10. In Nevada, BLM is again concerned about the nonexistent mineral withdrawal serving as a basis for SFAs and whether SFAs "adequately maintain conservation of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat . . . " Nevada Draft RMP and EIS at ES-3, 1-8, 2-8. In Utah BLM also raises the nonexistent mineral withdrawal as a basis for eliminating SFAs as well as questioning whether they achieve conservation outcomes and concerns about alignment with the state strategy. Utah Draft RMP and EIS at ES-3, 1-7. The explanations for elimination of SFAs in these four states does not establish a clear basis for doing so especially when they would be maintained in Montana and Oregon. This differential treatment and the basis for it must be explained. Fundamentally BLM is creating regulatory uncertainty by creating this patchwork pattern. The need for regulatory certainty, and the fact it was established by the 2015 plans, was a key basis for the Fish and Wildlife Service reaching its not warranted decision. 80 Fed. Reg. 59858. Yet now BLM is creating regulatory uncertainty. This raises questions about whether the sage-grouse will have to be given ESA protections, which in our view should be avoided. At a minimum, to avoid this uncertainty, the SFA protections we have mentioned, like the fluid mineral NSO stipulation with no waiver, exception, or modification, need to made part of the PHMAs in states that no longer have SFAs. Moreover, BLM needs to address whether eliminating SFAs in some states will threaten SFA protections in Oregon and Montana where the SFA designation would remain in place. It would be inappropriate for SFAs to be threatened in Oregon and Montana just because they have been eliminated elsewhere. If BLM is going to treat SFA designation as subject to state-by-state revocation and not as a range-wide need-a proposition that is totally at odds with the Fish and Wildlife Service not warranted finding not to mention language in the 2015 land use plans-it needs to put in place provisions to ensure the SFA designations are protected where they remain and reconsider the proposals to eliminate SFAs. Recent legal decisions support maintaining SFAs. There are two recent decisions that BLM should consider as it makes decisions about SFA designations. These are W. Exploration, LLC v. U.S. Dept. of the Interior, 250 F. Supp. 3d 718 (D. Nev. 2017) and Desert Survivors v. U.S. Dept. of the Interior, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81922 (N.D. Cal., May 15, 2018). BLM frames Western Exploration as creating a need for these RMP amendments stating changes might be needed "in order to comply with the court's order" and "seeking comment on the SFA designation." 82 Fed. Reg. 47248-49 (Oct. 11, 2017). BLM states that the court "held that the BLM violated NEPA by failing to prepare a supplemental EIS for the designation of SFAs in the 2015 Greater Sage-Grouse Plan in Nevada." Id. at 47248. In fact, Western Exploration does not direct BLM to eliminate SFAs from the land use plans. First, the court found that the BLM had adequately considered any inconsistencies between the Federal sage-grouse plans and local county plans. 250 F. Supp. 3d at 744. The court also found that the BLM met its multiple use responsibilities under FLPMA when it adopted the Nevada sage-grouse plan. Id. at 746. The proposed withdrawal of 2.8 million acres from mineral entry (i.e., the SFAs) did not violate FLPMA. Id. "A review of the administrative record shows that BLM considered the relative value of Nevada's resources." Id. While the court agreed that under NEPA "the designation of 2.8 million acres as Focal Areas in Nevada amounts to a substantial change relevant to environmental concerns, requiring the Agencies to prepare [a supplemental EIS]" the court nevertheless refused to enjoin the ROD implementing the Nevada plan, holding "protection of the greater-sage grouse weighs against vacatur of the RODs. Enjoining implementation of the Plan Amendments pending the Agencies' preparation of an SEIS presents "the possibility of undesirable consequences" to the greater sage-grouse species and their habitat." Id. at 748, 751. Based on this decision, the BLM is not required to eliminate SFAs, as it proposes, but rather, at most, it should only reconsider whether the SFA designations were made with a sufficient opportunity for public comment, and allow for additional public comment if warranted, making, possibly, only mid-course corrections, not summary eliminations. Further, as discussed above, in Desert Survivors the court determined that in withdrawing the proposed ESA listing of the Nevada/California bi-state sage-grouse population the FWS ignored the best available science, improperly concluding voluntary conservation measures could stem the decline of the population. The court held the Service "erred in concluding there was sufficient certainty of effectiveness of planned conservation measures to support the conclusion that listing" the bird as threatened "was no longer warranted." Desert Survivors at 71. "There are no rational grounds for the service's conclusion." Id. at 83. The court held that, "the service must offer some rational basis for its conclusions that future conservation efforts will be effective enough to improve the status of the bi-state (grouse) and therefore warrant withdrawal of the proposed listing." Id. at 64. In reaching its 2015 not warranted finding, FWS concluded that SFAs had a strong scientific basis and were a critical element in showing that BLM had put in place adequate regulatory mechanisms to make listing the sage-grouse unnecessary. Now the BLM is abandoning the commitment to implement SFA protections in much of the range of the sage-grouse. That decision is not based on best available science and must be reassessed. Clearly the protections in SFAs that would be lost by eliminating SFAs must be maintained in the remaining PHMAs, and the land use plan amendments BLM is contemplating must so provide. The BLM should modify the EISs and proposed land use plan amendments in Idaho, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming to specifically provide that the fluid minerals NSO stipulation with no waivers, exceptions, or modifications, the vegetation and conservation management stipulation, and where appropriate the prohibition on geothermal development will be specifically incorporated into and made a part of the PHMAs in those states. In Oregon, the BLM states that SFAs presented "issues [that] require clarification of language in the 2015 ROD/ARMPA but do not require new analysis" and in any event the only issue that requires clarification relative to SFAs is withdrawal from mineral entry.

Reg. 59858, 59875 (Oct. 2, 2015). SFAs "are the areas that the Federal Plans manage as the highest priority lands in PHMAs for sage-grouse conservation (Figure 5)." Id. at 59878. They are "strongholds" for sage-grouse conservation and as mentioned above contain important connectivity habitat and high densities of breeding birds. Id.

Id. This was because SFAs need "the most conservative strategies to protect sage-grouse and habitat." Id. Grazing permit review is also prioritized in SFAs. Id. at 59877, 59910. IMPORTANCE OF SAGEBRUSH FOCAL AREAS An important component of the existing BLM and Forest Service sage-grouse land use plans is the designation of sagebrush focal areas (SFA). These are the most important sage-grouse habitats, which contain large, contiguous blocks of Federal lands in important sage-grouse habitats that have high levels of population connectivity and densities of breeding birds. 2.3.22 Sage-Grouse Current finding that listing is no longer warranted. In 2010, FWS determined that the greater sage-grouse warranted listing under the ESA "due to the loss and fragmentation of habitat and a lack of adequate regulatory mechanisms to stem habitat loss."1In 2015, FWS concluded that the species no longer warranted listing, explaining the change in position in a Frequently Asked Questions accompanying its finding as follows: How did the Service arrive at this not warranted finding? In September 2015, the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service completed amendments and revisions to 98 separate federal land use plans that address sage-grouse habitat loss, fragmentation, and other threats to the species. This represents the largest landscape-scale conservation planning effort in U.S. history. In addition, states in the greater sage-grouse range developed or updated greater sage-grouse conservation plans. New federal and state regulatory mechanisms developed since 2010 in the Rocky Mountain region have addressed the most serious threats to the species, primarily fossil fuel and renewable energy development, infrastructure such as roads and power lines, mining, improper grazing, the direct conversion of sagebrush to croplands, and urban and ex-urban development. In the Great Basin region, regulatory mechanisms and other conservation efforts developed since 2010 will substantially reduce and mitigate the primary potential threats of wildfire, invasive plants, conifer encroachment and mining.2 Although actual, on-the-ground, measurable improvements to sage-grouse habitat were not accomplished simply by completing the federal plans in 2015, the measures agreed to in those plans, along with those by the states of Wyoming, Montana, and Oregon formed the basis for the FWS finding by meeting the elements of the agency's Policy for Evaluating Conservation Efforts (PECE), which provides that, in order to rely on a conservation effort, FWS "must find that the conservation effort is sufficiently certain to be implemented and effective so as to have contributed to the elimination or adequate reduction of one or more threats to the species . . .3See, 68 Fed.Reg. 15100 (March 28, 2003) (emphasis added). FWS relied on this policy in its 2015 finding, stating: The [PECE] policy provides guidance on how to evaluate conservation efforts that have not yet been implemented or have not yet demonstrated effectiveness. The evaluation focuses on the certainty that the conservation efforts will be implemented and the effectiveness of the conservation efforts to contribute to make listing a species unnecessary. In this finding, we evaluated the certainty that the Federal Plans, and the Montana and Oregon Plans will be implemented into the future and the certainty that they will be effective in addressing threats, based on the best available science and professional recommendations provided in the COT and other scientific literature and reports. 80 Fed.Reg. 59874 (October 2, 2015) (emphasis added). BLM cannot rely on perch inhibitors to reduce impacts to sage grouse, as these do not address the behavioral avoidance of sage grouse of tall structures, and don't even completely prevent raptor perching. Prather (2010) provided an empirical test of the effectiveness of perch inhibitors on smaller distribution lines in Utah, and found that they had no significant effect in terms of reducing raptor perching activity. Lammers and Collopy (2007) found similar results for larger transmission lines in Nevada. Geophysical exploration can result in numerous impacts to sage grouse, including crushing sagebrush, creating linear disturbances through sagebrush habitat that facilitate the movements of sage grouse predators, causing direct disturbance to birds, leading to stress and/or displacement from important habitats, and direct collision mortality. For these reasons, the National Technical Team (2011) recommended, "Allow geophysical operations only by helicopter-portable drilling methods and in accordance with seasonal timing restrictions and/or other restrictions that may apply." The existing RMPAs neglect to provide definable seasonal restrictions on geophysical exploration in important sage grouse habitats, and also does not prescribe that low-impact techniques (i.e., heliportable methods) be applied, and the amendments to the RMPAs need to redress this deficiency. THE DIRECTION OF THE OVERALL CHANGES TO THE 2015 SAGE-GROUSE PLANS RISKS THE FINDING THAT THE GREATER SAGE-GROUSE NO LONGER WARRANTS LISTING UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. Although the FWS found that the greater sage-grouse no longer warranted listing under the ESA in 2015, the actions that this administration has taken and proposed are undermining the reasons for that finding, imperiling the species. Walking away from the vital commitments in the BLM's 2015 Sage-grouse Plans will have unavoidable consequences for the grouse, the more than 350 species that rely on the same habitat and the many stakeholders who have benefitted from the current, flexible management of millions of acres of public lands. If the administration continues on the present track, then: * Actual protections in BLM's 2015 Sage-grouse Plans -the "foundation" of FWS's 2015 not warranted decision -would be weakened or removed altogether, despite a wealth of science showing they are needed; * Commitments to implement and fund other meaningful protections will continue to be formally abandoned or made doubtful; and. * Without reliable, effective actions to address ongoing threats to greater sage-grouse, there will no longer be a basis for finding that a listing is not warranted, leading to action by the FWS and/or the courts to protect the species and its habitat. The FWS's 2015 finding explicitly relied on specific conservation measures in BLM's 2015 Sage-grouse Plans to address major threats, such as oil and gas development. For example, with respect to oil and gas in the Frequently Asked Questions: How do the conservation actions address the threat of oil and gas development in greater sage-grouse habitat? Oil and gas development is likely to continue throughout the greater sage-grouse range into the future, although its form and extent across the landscape may change. For this status review, the Service mapped locations of the highest potential for of oil and gas development in Montana, the Dakotas, Wyoming, Colorado and northeastern Utah to quantify potential exposure of greater sage-grouse to risk of future development. The Service's analyses indicate that the federal land use plans and the Wyoming Core Area Strategy are reducing exposure of the species to fossil fuel development, as measured by the portions of the breeding population and breeding habitat. The Service estimates that the vast majority of lands with a high-to moderate potential for oil and gas development are outside Priority Habitat. Regulatory mechanisms further reduce the risk of nonrenewable energy exposure to the breeding population and breeding habitat by more than 35 percent in Montana, Wyoming's Powder River Basin and the Dakotas, and more than 60 percent in the rest of Wyoming and adjacent portions of Colorado and Utah The NSO buffers in the plan are likely insufficient to protect wintering sage grouse. While surface disturbance could be prohibited up to 3.1 miles around leks, sage-grouse will still avoid development within 1.75 miles of wellpads and other development during winter (Holloran et al. 2015), or within 1.9 miles of wellpads during the breeding season (Holloran 2005), as discussed above. Thus, development near these buffer zones could still cause sage grouse to avoid otherwise suitable winter areas falling within lek buffer zones. No analysis shows that enough winter habitat will be left undisturbed under existing ARMPAs to support local populations. Absent a clear definition of "winter habitat" and "winter concentration area" and the distinction between the two, BLM should adopt a plan that provides adequate disturbance and vegetation protection for all identified winter habitats. In the current Plans, it is unclear whether these terms are interchangeable or distinct concepts. The NTT defines "winter concentration areas" as: Sage-grouse winter habitats which are occupied annually be sage-grouse and provide sufficient sagebrush cover and food to support birds throughout the winter (especially periods with above average snow cover). Many of these areas support several different breeding populations of sage-grouse. Sage-grouse typically show high fidelity for these areas, and loss or fragmentation can result in significant population impacts. NTT 2011, p. 37. Winter habitat, on the other hand, may be areas that have favorable sagebrush conditions for sage grouse throughout the winter, regardless of whether sage grouse annually occupy these areas. Wintering areas not utilized in typical years may become critical in severe winters. Caudill 2013. Thus, all winter habitat should be protected. Finally, as detailed in previous comments, BLM's winter habitat health objectives must have scientific support. These objectives should require 20-30% crown cover with shrub heights 25-35 cm above the median snow level, or greater than 40 cm in height, whichever is taller. See Center for Biological Diversity Nevada RMPA DEIS Comment, p.22. PHMA designations may not be adequate to protect sage-grouse wintering habitats. For example, in Wyoming, Dinkins et al. (2016) found that PHMAs protected 62.5% of breeding locations in Wyoming, but only 50% of wintering habitats. These researchers recommended designating winter concentration areas outside PHMAs for elevated habitat protections. BLM should suspend mineral leasing and all other development activities until all winter habitat is identified. Identified winter habitats, whether inside or outside of Priority Habitats, should be closed to future mineral leasing and materials sales and withdrawn from locatable minerals entry. For valid existing rights both agencies should impose a 3% surface disturbance limit and one pad limit, both calculated per square mile section of winter habitat; No Surface Occupancy within 1.75 miles of the edge of wintering habitats; and no high-volume roads within 1.9 miles of wintering habitats. Wintering habitats should be seasonally closed to all vehicular access between November 30 and March 15. If BLM will not protect all winter habitat as requested, BLM should suspend mineral leasing and all other development activities in winter 63 habitat until winter concentration areas are identified. These winter concentration areas should receive the same protections as the NTT recommends for priority habitats. BLM should also tailor winter habitat objectives to 20-30% crown cover with shrub heights 25-35 cm above the median snow level, or greater than 40 cm in height, whichever is taller. Wastewater ponds associated with coalbed methane development form breeding habitat for the Culex tarsalis mosquitoes that transmit West Nile virus, and have been directly linked to increases in these mosquito populations (Zou et al. 2006, Doherty 2007). The National Technical Team (2011: 19) observed that "ponds created by coal bed natural gas development may increase the risk of West Nile virus mortality in late summer (Walker et al. 2004, Zou et al. 2006, Walker 3 Id. 4 Green et al. at 9. 52 et al. 2007b)." In addition, Kirol et al. (2015b) found that coalbed methane wastewater ponds subsidize sage-grouse nest predators, and that pond shoreline length was the single greatest correlate with sage-grouse nest failure. Greater sage grouse have essentially no ability to develop immunity to West Nile virus (Naugle et al. 2004), and outbreaks of West Nile have led to catastrophic population losses of sage grouse in habitats developed for coalbed methane in the past (Walker et al. 2004). Sinai et al. (2017) found that sage-grouse did not produce antibodies against West Nile, and in addition were susceptible to avian leukosis virus. Taylor et al. (2012) found that the synergy of oil, gas and coalbed methane impacts and West Nile would result in the functional extinction of the Powder River Basin sage grouse population in Wyoming as a result of the next major West Nile virus outbreak. Sage grouse avoid habitats 54 surrounding roads (Braun 1986, Holloran 2005, Wisdom et al. 2011). According to BLM's own NEPA analysis: Impacts on GRSG accrue over varying distances from origin depending on the type of development: … ? Interstate highways at 4.7 miles (7.5 kilometers) and paved roads and primary and secondary routes at 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) based on indirect effects measured through road density studies (Connelly et al. 2004; Holloran 2005; Lyon 2000) Nevada -Northeastern California Greater Sage-grouse RMP Amendment DEIS at 605. BLM has admitted that roads fragment habitats and interfere with natural movements of sensitive species, and with regard to road upgrades, "Any exceptions resulting in road upgrades could further fragment habitat, cause vegetation loss, erosion, and the spread of invasive, nonnative plant species." Wyoming Greater Sage-grouse RMP Amendment DEIS at 4-313 and 4-294, respectively. BLM's own National Technical Team (2011: 11) recommended that at minimum, vehicle traffic in Priority Habitats be limited to designated roads and trails, use existing roads for access, limit construction to realignments of existing routes that minimize impacts to sage grouse, prohibit road upgrades that change route category, consider seasonal road closures, and conduct travel planning within 5 years, reclaiming roads and trails not designated for vehicular use. Road densities are also an issue, because sage grouse avoid habitats adjacent to roads. Holloran (2005) found that road densities greater than 0.7 linear miles per square mile within 2 miles of leks resulted in significant negative impacts to sage grouse populations. This road density should be applied as a maximum density in Priority and General Habitats, and in areas that already exceed this threshold, existing roads should be decommissioned and revegetated to meet this standard on a persquare-mile-section basis. BLM's proposed plan amendment fails to provide adequate limits on road density. Limiting road and trail networks and off-road vehicle travel also is critical in limiting the spread of invasive weeds. According to BLM's own NEPA analysis, "Roads and trails are one of the main vectors of invasive weed spread, which leads to increase in FRCC and ecosystems moving away from natural fire regimes (CEC 2012)." Nevada -Northeastern California Greater Sage-grouse RMP Amendment DEIS at 701.Off-road vehicle travel must be adequately regulated to protect sage grouse under new plans. According to BLM's own analysis, off-road vehicles are noisy, and typically exceed the background noise levels by more than 10 dBA. Northwest Colorado Greater Sage-grouse RMP Amendment DEIS at 399. This level of noise exceedance has significant negative consequences for sage grouse, as outlined in the section of this protest addressing noise. Off-road vehicle use also results in habitat degradation and destruction, disturbance of sage grouse, and proliferation of invasive weeds (NTT 2011; see also Manier et al. 2011). winter concentration areas should receive at least the level of protection from permitted industrial activities as recommended by NTT (2011) for priority habitats. As it stands now, unlimited surface disturbance is allowed in all winter concentration areas and winter habitat outside of priority habitats, risking significant winter habitat loss. This EIS must discuss these impacts resulting from development and sagebrush removal in winter habitat or respond to comments noting these impacts. Nor does it provide any sense of the long-term impact of winter habitat loss on the persistence of local sage grouse in the planning area. Moreover, BLM must identify baseline winter habitat and winter concentration areas to create a science-based understanding of any plan amendment's impacts on wintering sage grouse. Even if it were proper for BLM to postpone the identification of winter habitat, the EIS must analyze any specific plans as to how and when this will occur or the criteria these areas must meet for winter habitat protections to apply. And the planning amendment must provide for interim protections for these areas until mapping is complete. In the absence of interim protections, it is thus entirely possible that sage-grouse wintering areas will be irreparably damaged and sage-grouse populations lost before they can receive minimal protections that apply today under the ARMPAs, let alone the full set of protections needed for winter habitat based on the science. At minimum, any leasing or development of parcels that potentially contain winter habitat should be suspended until winter habitat and winter concentration areas are fully mapped and designated appropriate protections. This is extremely critical: Without any restrictions on sagebrush removal in wintering habitats, the habitat loss will be permanent. See Minnick 2015 (well sites lacked favorable soil conditions decades after reclamation, preventing sagebrush regrowth); cf. FEIS 4-315 (winter concentration areas "could be difficult to restore to original conditions…due to the composition and size of sagebrush in these areas"). Indeed, to the extent the EIS relies on winter habitat restoration as "mitigation" for any habitat loss, this is wishful thinking. Even a short-term loss of winter habitat would likely be detrimental to sage grouse dependent on these areas 2.3.23 Travel and Transportation Management Travel planning should be carried out to address the risks of habitat destruction and fragmentation acknowledged in the plans. 2.3.24 Waivers, Exceptions, and Modifications Waivers, exceptions and modifications to oil and gas lease stipulations must be subject to narrow and specific criteria so they are consistently and reliably applied, and can be effective as intended. In addition, applications for and responses to waivers, exceptions and modifications should be tracked and made available to the public. Finally, it is critical that BLM track waivers, exceptions and modifications requested and those granted, and make that information available to the public. These records will provide important insight into how the stipulations are being applied and the potential impact of waivers, exceptions and modifications on the overall function of the plans. This information will also allow BLM to determine if the availability of or criteria for granting waivers, exceptions and modifications needs to be further narrowed in order to ensure sufficient protection for sage-grouse habitat. Accordingly, we recommend that each plan include language that provides: Exceptions will be considered prior to considering waivers or modifications. If the BLM determines that a waiver or modification is more appropriate, the reasons for such decisions will be documented. Waivers are permitted if the area lacks "protected attributes" -as determined through coordination with the appropriate state wildlife agency. Modifications and exceptions are permitted if: (1) impacts are fully and verifiably offset by compensatory mitigation; or (2) there are no impacts to greater sage-grouse because of terrain or habitat type, based on consultation with the applicable state wildlife agency. Prior to granting any waivers, exceptions and modifications, BLM will insure that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has the opportunity to submit information for consideration. For no surface occupancy stipulations or stipulations in Priority Habitat Management Areas, waivers exceptions and modifications will only be granted following a 30-day public notice and comment period. BLM will maintain an ongoing record of requests for waivers, exceptions and modifications and whether those requests are granted, and will publish those cumulative results on a quarterly basis. V. RECOMMENDED APPROACH TO WAIVERS, EXCEPTIONS AND MODIFICATION TO OIL AND GAS LEASE STIPULATIONS. The 2015 Sage-grouse Plans include numerous oil and gas lease stipulations that apply to development in order to protect sage-grouse and sage-grouse habitat, including no surface occupancy stipulations, timing limitations and surface use limitations. The draft amendments and EISs also rely on lease stipulations. However, the protections actually provided by the stipulations are only reliable and effective to the extent that the safeguards are applied. Waivers (permanent exemption that applies to the entire leasehold), exceptions (one-time exemption for a particular site within the leasehold) and modifications (change to the lease stipulation, either temporarily or for the term of the lease, can apply to the entire leasehold or certain areas) all permit an operator to avoid compliance with the requirements of a stipulation. Where these loopholes are permitted and used, the protections that the stipulations are supposed to provide can be undermined. Recent studies confirm that oil and gas development can harm both sage-grouse habitat and lifecycle activities, such as breeding.46Consequently, it is vital that protections associated with oil and gas development are reliably applied and, as a result, that waivers, exceptions and modifications are not broadly used to weaken those protections. While we can accept narrowly prescribed waivers, exceptions and modifications to lease stipulations that are based on very specific criteria, broad standards, such as those currently included in the Nevada Draft RMP Amendment/EIS are not acceptable. As an example, the general approach conditions included in the Draft Colorado RMP Amendment related to no surface occupancy stipulations are more specific and include public engagement. * Waivers are permitted if the area lacks "protected attributes" -as determined through coordination with Colorado Parks and Wildlife and following a 30-day public notice/comment period * Modifications and exceptions are permitted if: (1) impacts are fully offset by compensatory mitigation; or (2) no impacts to greater sage-grouse would occur because of terrain or habitat type -but can only be applied after consultation with Colorado Parks and Wildlife. CO Draft RMP Amendment/EIS, pp. 2-4 -2-5. Overall, one-time exceptions should be the preferred approach where relief is sought from protective stipulations, such that the safeguards prescribed in these stipulations will remain in place for the majority of oil and gas leases. Waivers, exceptions and modifications should only be granted from no surface occupancy (NSO) stipulations or any stipulations in PHMA after a 30-day public notice and comment period. Further, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service should have the opportunity to submit information for consideration prior to granting waivers, exceptions and modifications. 2.4 UTAH-SPECIFIC COMMENTS 2.4.1 Purpose and Need Purpose and Need Statement The purpose and need for the RMP amendments should be expanded to better align with the overall goal-conserving the species and maintaining the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's 2015 "not warranted" decision. We recommend the commitment to conserve, enhance and restore sagegrouse habitat be reflected in the purpose and need statement and in the forthcoming record of decision. Although the State appreciates the BLM's efforts to enhance cooperation, based on each state's jurisdiction over sage-grouse, the Purpose an Need Statement should be revised and expanded to also" .. .incorporate updated science, research and local information and management practice, and to ensure, not only enhanced cooperation with the States, but also achieve consistency and coordination with State, Tribal and Local Governments' sagegrouse conservation and land use plans." The inclusion of the revised Purpose and Need Statement language will provide BLM with the tools necessary to revise the 2015 LUPA, allow the BLM to incorporate new information and changes to science and data that have come about since 2015, and will more closely align with language in FLPMA. Further, since it seems the purpose is also to build upon the 2015 planning process, the BLM may want to expressly state such to avoid confusion.4 Please revise the Purpose and Need Statement to ensure that the DEIS not only enhances cooperation with states, but also seeks consistency with state and local plans over sage-grouse. If there are any changes that experts deem necessary, these should instead be done via minor plan amendments, also known as "maintenance actions." A complete rewrite is an unnecessary waste of federal resources, and risks upending the official finding made by the FWS that a listing under the ESA is not needed. The 2015 sage-grouse plans are based on some of the best available science and responsibly balance energy development, recreation, grazing, and other activities on public lands. Proposed changes to the plans in these seven states would undermine the progress that has been made to ensure continued productivity of sagebrush habitat and allow for responsible development across the West on lands owned by all Americans. These changes would also erode fundamental land use planning prescriptions intended to avoid the need to list the sage-grouse for protection under the Endangered Species Act. Instead of amending the plans by weakening protections, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) should focus on engaging communities in the decisions necessary to implement the plans as they are. If there are any changes that experts deem necessary, these should instead be done via minor plan amendments, also known as "maintenance actions." A complete rewrite is an unnecessary waste of federal resources, and risks upending the official finding made by the FWS that a listing under the Endangered Species Act is not needed. BLM's Purpose and Need Violates NEPA BLM is employing an unlawful "purpose and need" for the Draft EISs. While BLM has some discretion over a project's "purpose and need," that discretion is not unlimited. BLM may not, for example, define the "purpose and need" so narrowly that it forecloses consideration of a reasonable range of alternatives. Westlands Water Dist. v. U.S. DOI, 376 F.3d 853, 867 (9th Cir. 2004); see also City of Carmel-By-The-Sea v. U.S. Dep't of Transp., 123 F.3d 1142, 1155 (9th Cir. 1997) (". . . an agency cannot define its objectives in unreasonably narrow terms."). Nor may BLM simply adopt the "purpose and need" advanced by a project proponent. National Parks Conservation Ass'n v. BLM [NPCA], 606 F.3d 1058, 1070-72 (9th Cir. 2010). Yet, that is exactly what BLM has done here. It has developed an unreasonably narrow "purpose and need" for the Draft EISs that forecloses consideration of any alternative that does not "align with individual state plans . . . ." See, e.g., Utah DEIS at ES-2. Further, it is self-evident that this "purpose and need" was defined not by BLM, as required by NEPA, but by the states/project proponents. Thus, BLM's "purpose and need" is fundamentally flawed and corrupts the range of alternatives, along with other aspects of the Draft EISs. 1. BLM's "Purpose and Need" for the Draft EISs is unreasonably narrow. In violation of NEPA, BLM is using an unreasonably narrow "purpose and need" for the Draft EISs. According to the Draft EISs, "[t]he purpose of this resource management plan amendment/environmental impact statement (RMPA/EIS) is to enhance cooperation with the states by modifying the approach to Greater Sage-Grouse management in existing land use plans to better align with individual state plans and conservation measures and with DOI and BLM policy." Utah DEIS at ES-2. This represents a dramatic departure from the original purpose behind BLM's sage-grouse conservation plans, which was based entirely on the need to develop "adequate regulatory mechanisms" that would avoid the need to list the species under the ESA. See, e.g., Utah 2015 Proposed Land Use Plan Amendment/Final Environmental Impact Statement at 1-27. Yet, BLM has totally and impermissibly eliminated this fundamental objective from the Draft EISs. When evaluating the reasonableness of an agency's "purpose and need" statement, courts consider the views of Congress . . . in the agency's statutory authorization to act, as well as in other congressional directives." Citizens Against Burlington v. BUSEY IV, 938 F.2d 190, 196 (D.C. Cir. 1991). Here, "Congress intended endangered species to be afforded the highest of priorities." Tenn. Valley Auth. v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 174 (1978). Accordingly, the ESA requires BLM to administer programs that "provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved . . . ." 16 U.S.C. § 1531(b); see also id. § 1536(a)(1) ("The Secretary shall . . . utilize such programs in furtherance of the purposes of [the ESA]."). Previously, BLM fulfilled the wishes of Congress by identifying the need to develop and adopt "adequate regulatory mechanisms" that would address the long-term "conservation needs of the species" as the guiding and principal purpose for the sage-grouse planning process. See, e.g., Utah 2015 Proposed Land Use Plan Amendment/Final Environmental Impact Statement at 1-27. This purpose drove the development of alternatives for the plans, and more than any other factor, shaped the final decision on the plans: "The ARMPAs are designed to directly address the specific threats to the species identified by the FWS in its 2010 listing determination . . . ." ROD and ARMPAs for the Great Basin GRSG Sub-Regions at 1-35. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) subsequently recognized BLM's conservation plans as the "foundation" of its "not-warranted" decision for Greater sage-grouse. 80 Fed. Reg. 59,858, 59,887 (Oct. 2, 2015). Notably, this decision found that only conservation plans adopted by BLM (and the U.S. Forest Service) and the states of Montana, Oregon, and Wyoming contained "adequate regulatory mechanisms." Id. at 59,936. However, in spite of Congress's clear direction to make the conservation of endangered and threatened species the "highest priority," and even though BLM did so during the original planning process, BLM has now abandoned this purpose. Instead, in the Draft EISs, BLM is focused on "aligning" its conservation plans with those of the states. This purpose has nothing to do with ensuring the long-term conservation of sage-grouse or avoiding a future ESA listing. If anything, this new direction will likely move the species closer to a listing, because BLM and FWS both previously rejected an approach that relied heavily on state plans: * BLM: "Alternative E is the alternative based on information provided by the State or Governor's offices for inclusion and analysis in the EISs . . . . The BLM believes Alternative E did not incorporate adequate regulatory mechanisms into the existing plan to meet its purpose and need to conserve, enhance, and restore GRSG and its habitat; therefore, the BLM did not select Alternative E as the ARMPA." ROD and ARMPAs for the Great Basin GRSG Sub-Regions at 3-3 to -4; and * FWS: "While 10 of the 11 States in the range of the sage-grouse updated their State plans to conserve the species by incorporating new information, which is a testimony to their concern and commitment to protect the grouse and its habitats, not all of these plans have been implemented or are regulatory in scope. We will specifically highlight the regulatory conservation actions mandated by the State plans in Wyoming, Montana, and Oregon because they provide the greatest degree of regulatory certainty in addressing potential threats on State and private lands not under the jurisdiction of Federal plans. We appreciate the work that each State has completed, but not all planning efforts met a level of certainty for implementation and effectiveness." 80 Fed. Reg. at 59,873. Moreover, by focusing so narrowly on what the states want, BLM is foreclosing consideration of alternatives that respond to new information concerning the species and what changes or new approaches might be necessary to strengthen the regulatory mechanisms adopted in 2015. In sum, BLM has adopted an unreasonably narrow "purpose and need" that violates NEPA. 2. BLM has impermissibly defined the "purpose and need" based on project proponent objectives. Also in violation of NEPA, BLM has improperly defined the "purpose and need" to reflect the narrow wishes of certain states/project proponents and not broader objectives set forth in the ESA and other federal laws. NEPA prohibits BLM from "mandating" that the interests of project proponents "define the scope of the proposed project." NPCA, 606 F.3d at 1070. Instead, BLM must reference and incorporate broader, national objectives contained in statutes and other congressional directives. Id. BLM failed to do so here, and instead developed the "purpose and need" to carry out the wishes of specific states. BLM has openly acknowledged doing so, stating that the decision to move forward with the plan amendments, as well as the range of issues and alternatives to be considered, came directly from certain states. See, e.g., Notice of Availability of the Utah Draft Resource Management Plan Amendment and Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation, 83 Fed. Reg. 19,803 (May 4, 2018) ("After carefully considering the Governor's input . . . the BLM proposes amending the Utah Greater Sage-Grouse land use plans that address GRSG management."); BLM, Press Release -BLM Listens to Utah State Partners (May 3, 2018) ("We are not abandoning the 2015 plans; we are building on them," said BLM state director Ed Roberson. "In the two and a half years since those plans were adopted, we've gotten tremendous feedback from the State on on-the-ground outcomes and impacts that are the basis for proposed changes that recognize the unique nature of sage-grouse presence in Utah."). Yet, BLM is not permitted to blindly accept a project proponent's objectives in this manner. As the NPCA court explained, "[o]ur holdings . . . forbid the BLM to define its objectives in unreasonably narrow terms. The BLM may not circumvent this proscription by adopting private interests to draft a narrow purpose and need statement that excludes alternatives that fail to meet specific private objectives . . . ." 606 F.3d at 1072. While it may have been permissible for BLM to develop a "purpose and need" that sought to better accommodate the wishes of the states, provided that any changes did not weaken the range-wide effectiveness of the plans or undermine the FWS's 2015 not-warranted determination, it did not do so. Consequently, by focusing so narrowly on what specific states want, and ignoring the conservation needs of Greater sage-grouse and objectives of the ESA, BLM's "purpose and need" for the Draft EISs violates NEPA. the Purpose and Need Statement should be revised and expanded to also ".. incorporate updated science, research and local information and management practice, and to ensure, not only enhanced cooperation with the States, but also achieve consistency and coordination with State, Tribal and Local Governments' sagegrouse conservation and land use plans." The inclusion of the revised Purpose and Need Statement language will provide BLM with the tools necessary to revise the 2015 WPA, allow the BLM to incorporate new information and changes to science and data that have come about since 2015, and will more closely align with language in FLPMA. Further, since it seems the purpose is also to build upon the 2015 planning process, the BLM may want to expressly state such to avoid confusion. Please revise the Purpose and Need Statement to ensure that the DEIS not only enhances cooperation with states, but also seeks consistency with state and local plans over sage-grouse. It is unclear exactly what the intent of the Utah DEIS is in Chapter 1. Are the above SOs incorporated by reference in to the Utah DEIS? If it is the policy of the DOI to enhance exploration of Federal onshore oil and gas leases and Federal solid mineral resources, does that mean provisions contrary to that intent are to be given lesser weight? What happens if new SOs are issued in the future that are inconsistent with the BLM's proposed amend 2.4.2 Criteria Section I .2 of the Draft EIS identifies the planning criteria associated with the Preferred Alternative and focuses on modifying protections for greater sage-grouse to conform with state plans and revised policies. We note that the new planning criteria do not include one of the criteria in from 2015 RMP, "maintaining the federal land management planning considerations to protect greater sage-grouse populations and habitats sufficiently so that the species does not warrant listing under the Endangered Species Act (ESA)." We recommend that BLM work with USFWS and Utah Division of Wildlife Resources to assess the impacts from the management changes in this RMPA on greater sage grouse conservation status and include that assessment in the Final EIS. 2.4.3 Issues Dismissed from Detailed Analysis Identify excess wild horses as a threat. Utah's plan calls for blanket analysis of actions, it doesn't give consideration of the issues and site-specific resource conditions. That is precisely why a blanket NEPA needs to be done through this RMPA. The use of site-specific NEPA many times delays efforts on the ground, that can have negative impacts and create an uncertainty for many other uses of the land. and be based on the specific conditions in the given planning area. Identify excess wild horses as a threat.

MA No. 135; LUPA at 4-253, 274, 335, 340, 420. The BLM's treatment of ravens and other generalist predators is a material deficiency. The NTT Report ignored a substantial body of literature about raven predation including, but not limited to, 25 different studies mentioned by Ramey in his review of the NTT Report. Attach. 5, Ramey, et al. at 2, 18-19; Attach. 3b, WSI at 29-30. Much like the NTT Report, the LUPA avoids "mention of management of predators on sage-grouse in areas of greatest risk of predation, and chose instead to treat this threat as a byproduct of human activities that can be regulated (i.e. land health assessments and emphasizing vegetation cover as a means to measure and mitigate livestock use; or increasing landscape level habitat connectivity)." Attach. 5, Ramey, et al. at 18. The BLM cannot rely on a narrow set of data to manage sage-grouse populations with regards to predation. 2.4.4 Modifying Waivers, Exceptions, and Modifications of Fluid Minerals Determinations The State also would like to see greater clarification to the criteria for allowing exceptions to NSO in PHMA. As written, an exception to NSO will be granted when: (1) fluid mineral leasing occurs in non-habitat that does not provide impOliant connectivity between habitats, (2) does not impair the function of adjacent seasonal habitat, the life history behavioral needs of GRSG due to project design, (3) is proposed to be undertaken to an alternative to a similar action occurring on a nearby parcel and development on the parcel in question will have less of an impact on GRSG or its habitat than on the nearby parcel. 29 The BLM needs to clarify whether or not all three scenarios identified above need to occur together, prior to allowing an exception, or whether each condition for a potential NSO exception can be standalone exception to NSO. Further, a fourth exception to NSO should read that an exception to NSO may be granted, if the project proponent works with the State and BLM to develop compensatory mitigation that improves functional habitat and corridors using the mitigation policies adopted by the State and BLM. The State believes the BLM should write MA-MR-3, as follows: An exception to NSO may occur, if: (1) fluid mineral leasing occurs in non-habitat that does not provide important connectivity between habitats, (2) does not impair the substantial function of adjacent seasonal habitat, the life history behavioral needs of GRSG due to project design, (3) is proposed to be undertaken to an alternative to a similar action occurring on a nearby parcel and development on the parcel in question will have less of an impact on GRSG or its habitat than on the nearby parcel or (4) if the project proponent works with the State and BLM to develop compensatory mitigation that improves functional habitat and corridors using the mitigation policies adopted by the State and BLM. The State supports the other changes to MA-MR-3. Recent studies confirm that oil and gas development can harm both sage-grouse habitat and lifecycle activities, such as breeding. Consequently, it is vital that protections associated with oil and gas development are reliably applied and, as a result, that WEMs are not broadly used to weaken those protections. While we can accept narrowly prescribed WEMs to lease stipulations that are based on very specific criteria, broad standards are not acceptable. WEMs should only be granted from no surface occupancy (NSO) stipulations or any stipulations in PHMA after a 30-day public notice and comment period. Further, the FWS should have the opportunity to submit information for consideration prior to granting WEMs. Finally, it is critical that BLM track both WEMs requested and those granted and make that information available to the public. These records will provide important insight into how the stipulations are being applied and the potential impact of WEMs on the overall function of the plans. This information will also allow BLM to determine if the availability of or criteria for granting WEMs needs to be further narrowed in order to ensure sufficient protection for sagegrouse Habitat. We would recommend that the Utah plan include language that provides: -Exceptions will be considered prior to considering waivers or modifications. If the BLM determines that a waiver or modification is more appropriate, the reasons for such decisions will be documented. -Waivers are permitted if the area lacks "protected attributes" -as determined through coordination with the appropriate state wildlife agency. -Modifications and exceptions are permitted if: (1) impacts are fully and verifiably offset by compensatory mitigation; or (2) there are no impacts to greater sage-grouse because of terrain or habitat type, based on consultation with the applicable state wildlife agency. -Prior to granting any WEMs, BLM will insure that the FWS has the opportunity to submit information for consideration. -For no surface occupancy stipulations or stipulations in Priority Habitat Management Areas, waivers exceptions and modifications will only be granted following a 30-day public notice and comment period. -BLM will maintain an ongoing record of requests for WEMs and whether those requests are granted, and will publish those cumulative results on a quarterly basis. Currently PHMAs are open to oil and gas leasing subject to an NSO stipulation. While exceptions to this stipulation can be permitted, no waivers or modifications are allowed. The FWS must agree to an exception. Utah DIES at 2-16 to -18. Now the BLM is proposing to maintain the NSO stipulation requirement in PHMA prior to leasing but it could allow waivers, exceptions, and modifications (WEM) to this stipulation, and the FWS would no longer have to approve a change. Id. Our concern with this section of the proposed land use plan is the possibility-indeed likelihood-that more WEMs to lease stipulations will be requested and granted in the PHMA areas where an NSO stipulation applies to oil and gas leasing. We can accept narrowly prescribed WEMs to lease stipulations that are based on very specific criteria. But broad standards, such as those currently included in the Nevada Draft RMP Amendment/EIS, are not acceptable. As an example, the conditions included in the Draft Colorado RMP Amendment related to no surface occupancy stipulations are very specific and include public engagement: * Waivers are permitted if the area lacks "protected attributes" -as determined through coordination with Colorado Parks and Wildlife and following a 30-day public notice/comment period. * Modifications and exceptions are permitted if: (1) impacts are fully offset by compensatory mitigation; or (2) no impacts to greater sage-grouse occur because of terrain or habitat type -but can only be applied after consultation with Colorado Parks and Wildlife. Colorado Draft RMP Amendment/EIS, pp. 2-4 -2-5. Overall, one-time exceptions should be the preferred approach where relief is sought from protective stipulations, such that the safeguards prescribed in these stipulations will remain in place for the majority of oil and gas leases. WEMs should only be granted from NSO stipulations, or any stipulations in PHMA, after a 30-day public notice and comment period. Further, the FWS should have the opportunity to submit information for consideration prior to granting any WEMs. Finally, it is critical that BLM track WEMs requested and those granted and make that information available to the public. These records will provide important insight into how the stipulations are being applied and the potential impact of WEMs on the overall function of the plans. This information will also allow BLM to determine if the availability of or criteria for granting WEMs needs to be further narrowed in order to ensure sufficient protection for sage-grouse habitat. Accordingly, we recommend that the Utah plan include language that provides: * Exceptions will be considered prior to considering waivers or modifications. If the BLM determines that a waiver or modification is more appropriate, the reasons for such decisions will be documented. * Waivers are permitted if the area lacks "protected attributes" -as determined through coordination with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. * Modifications and exceptions are permitted if: (1) impacts are fully and verifiably offset by compensatory mitigation; or (2) there are no impacts to greater sage-grouse because of terrain or habitat type, based on consultation with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. * Prior to granting any WEMs, BLM will insure that the FWS has the opportunity to submit information for consideration. * For NSO stipulations or stipulations in PHMA, WEMs will only be granted following a 30-day public notice and comment period. * BLM will maintain an ongoing record of requests for WEMs and whether those requests are granted and will publish those cumulative results on a quarterly basis. Restore No Surface Occupancy stipulations as mandatory for sage-grouse habitat when leasing for energy development. Allowing exceptions, in light of what we know with the science, will result in poorly planned development that negatively impacts habitat and leads to fewer birds. Finally, it is critical that BLM track boundary adjustments, waivers, exceptions and modifications requested and those granted, and make that information available to the public. These records will provide important insight into how the plans' requirements are being applied and the potential impact of such changes on the overall function of the plans. This information will also allow BLM to determine if the availability of or criteria for granting waivers, exceptions and modifications needs to be further narrowed to ensure sufficient protection for sage-grouse habitat. The plan should the general habitat classification and management protections, as well as those for the most important habitat, by restoring no surface occupancy stipulations without exception, waiver or modification to protect the most important grouse habitat and not sacrifice leks to oil and gas development. Similarly, one-time exceptions should be the preferred approach where relief is sought from protective stipulations, such that the safeguards prescribed in these stipulations will remain in place for the majority of oil and gas leases. In such cases, FWS should have the opportunity to submit information for consideration prior to granting waivers, exceptions and modifications. * The BLM should restore No Surface Occupancy stipulations as mandatory for sage-grouse habitat when leasing for energy development. Allowing exceptions, in light of what we know with the science, will result in poorly planned development that negatively impacts habitat and leads to fewer birds. EXCEPTIONS TO NSO STIPULATIONS According to MA-MR-3 WEMS -in PHMA, an Authorized Officer may only grant an exception to an NSO stipulation in a fluid mineral lease if "the proposed action is proposed to be undertaken as an alternative to a similar action occurring on a nearby parcel and development on the parcel in question would have less of an impact on Greater Sage-Grouse or its habitat than on nearby parcel." This language completely ignores myriad other factors that may support an exception on a case-by-case basis. For example, an exception could be granted for a well pad, if the well pad was within a depression which would reduce impacts (i.e. noise, etc.) to the surrounding area. Moreover, timing stipulations or other surface use conditions can often accomplish the same result as NSO. Thus, the Coalition would request that the criteria for an exception be modified to include the qualifier to accommodate a change in resource conditions or a site specific attribute (topography, sage-grouse use, etc.). Page 4-16: Section 4.6.1. Impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse. Waivers, Exceptions and Modifications for NSO Stipulations. In the fourth line of the first paragraph, it mentions that "Fish and Wildlife" concurrence would no longer be required. Does this mean the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources? 2.4.5 Sagebrush Focal Areas (SFA) Designations The announced plan revisions, namely the removal of “sagebrush focal areas” from the original conservation plan text, threatens the protections for sage-grouse on millions of acres of public lands. I do not support any proposed amendments to the Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation Plan that would allow new surface disturbances or the opening of these areas (SFA’s) to new hardrock mining claims. Weakening protections would have significant consequences for sage-grouse and other wildlife, sagebrush grasslands and the western communities and economies that depend on them. Rather than wasting time on trying to weaken the federal plans, the Trump administration should consider ways to improve them. Scientists have already identified gaps and deficiencies in the current conservation strategy, and have recommended measures to strengthen conservation and management of the species: Conserve all of the most important sage-grouse habitat, including Sagebrush Focal Areas within Priority Habitat Management Areas. As an example, winter habitat is particularly important to sage-grouse, mule deer and other wildlife, but the current federal plans fail to protect those areas from harmful land use and development. In the Sagebrush Focal Areas as listed in the original 2015 plan, federal land use plans will avoid new surface disturbance and recommend that the areas be withdrawn from new hardrock mining claims. Sagebrush Focal Areas DesignationslWithdrawal Recommendation The BLM's proposal in MA-SSS-2 of removing the 181,100 acres of BLM surface estate, together with the 52,200 acres of split federal estates, known as Sagebrush Focal Areas ("SF As"), is broadly supported and legally necessary to avoid ongoing legal challenges to a flawed NEPA process in 2015. 13 The BLM must remove SFAs as they were a last-minute addition to the 2015 LUPA and were not fully analyzed as required by law. The late-hour demand by former FWS Director Dan Ashe to include in the Utah and the other land use plans of over 10,000,000 acres of SF As was blatantly illegal. The SF As were created out of whole cloth by former FWS Director Ashe through to so-termed "Ashe Memorandum" of October 2014. According to the Obama Administration, the SF As "serve to anchor the conservation impOliance of the landscape.,,14 The Federal Government has conceded that the SFAs that appeared in the FEIS were entirely absent from the proposed action analyzed in the DEIS but can be excused as a minor variation of the land use restrictions originally proposed. IS Eliminating the legally questionable, unnecessary and counter-productive concept of SF As will provide enhanced coordination and consistency between the State Conservation Plan and the BLM's conservation goals for conserving sage-grouse habitat. Similarly, in analyzing the purpose for removing SF As, the BLM properly looked at (1) whether SF As were aligned with the State's strategy for conserving sage-grouse in the State's plan, (2) whether SFAs contribute to achieving conservation outcomes, and (3) the relevance of this habitat designation in the absence of a mineral withdrawal. 16 First, the BLM rightly concluded that the SF A Management Strategy from the 2015 LUPA did not align with the State's Conservation Plan for sage-grouse. The State has designated 11 Sage-grouse Management Areas. 17 Within those areas, some mineral, oil and gas, and other development is authorized, so long as actions are taken to minimize impacts to sage-grouse habitat and the State's 5 percent disturbance cap is not exceeded within habitat. Further, grazing, the associated water development, and other land uses associated with grazing are encouraged as the research in Utah, and elsewhere, has shown that grazing practices can be beneficial to sage-grouse. Regardless of the State's plans, SFAs, as envisioned in the 2015 LUPA, ignored the State management approach, and proposed withdrawing mining, strictly limited oil and gas development to No SUlface Occupancy, without exception and prioritizing revising grazing levels within SF As. Since none of the BLM's management approaches outlined in the 2015 LUPA align with State management, the BLM properly removed these from the DEIS, which is proper considering the mandate in FLPMA that BLM's plans be consistent with the State's plans, policies, and programs. Next, the BLM appropriately concluded, based on analysis in the 2015 LUP A, together with the analysis in 2016 draft Sagebrush Focal Area Withdrawal DEIS, that that SF A management regime does little to contribute to achieving conservation outcomes for sage-grouse habitat. 18 The bottom line is SF As do little for sage-grouse conservation since they do not address the needs of Utah birds. The major threats to Utah's sage-grouse are (1) fire, and (2) loss of habitat from encroachment of invasive weeds and conifers. 19 SF As focuses, instead on mining withdrawal, grazing, and oil and gas development, all threats that are minimal to Utah and were not identified in the COT Report as being major threats to habitat within Utah.2o Since the BLM's use of SF As in Utah attempts to address minimal, even non-existent threats to sage-grouse, the SF A approach does little to contribute to the long-term conservation of Utah's birds. Reveliing SFAs to PHMAs will allow the BLM to focus money and effOlis on implementing needed work of habitat restoration and fuels reductions, manage for invasive weeds, and suppress fire, actions which are truly necessary to conserve sage-grouse habitat in Utah. Finally, SF As are no longer relevant since the main goal of SF As was a mineral withdrawal to limit mining on federal lands. However, the mineral withdrawal was cancelled by the Secretary on October 11, 2017.21 Even absent the cancellation of the withdrawal, the BLM noted "no future mines are projected to be developed in the proposed Utah withdrawal areas during the 20-year period of the proposed withdrawal if a withdrawal is not implemented. Based on the projection that there would not be any future mines developed in the Utah withdrawal area, even if a withdrawal is not implemented, there would not be any economic or tangible social impacts from future mining operations in the Utah socioeconomic analysis area."22 Since the withdrawal was cancelled, and since mining was not a threat in Utah's SFAs, SF As are not relevant to Utah. For alI the above reasons, the State suppo11s the BLM's removal of SF AS. Issue #5, Recommendation 6: Agency staffing will not allow for prioritizing all allotments within SFAs; the inability to do so will result in litigation, causing unnecessary commitment of federal resources to litigated areas. BLM grazing regulations via 43 C.F.R. 4180.2(c) already requires BLM to make management changes in order for allotments determined to not be meeting rangeland health standards to move towards meeting. As such, additional language covering this is not legally required or rational (see Issue #2). Putting focus on grazing within focal areas is irrational unless a trigger has been tripped and a correlation has been made to existing livestock grazing (as opposed to historical livestock or other grazing practices). Issue #5, Recommendation 7: BLM must remove any and all reference to SFAs. SFAs are an overreach and unnecessary as priority habitat designations provide adequate habitat protection. The LUPAs must be amended to address this overreach of elevating livestock grazing to a primary threat, and not prioritize permit renewals in priority habitat unless a hard trigger is tripped and a cause and effect relationship is established, as published in alternative E of the DLUP of the Idaho plan. Issue 5: DEIS Comment 5: The DEIS at page 2-34 appropriately removes MA-LG-2 (aka "No similar action"); resolving all above recommendations. It is critical that BLM consider carry this recommendation forward in the FEIS, and implement a proposed action in the ROD that adopts the removal of MA-LG-2. SFAs and BSUs should be removed through any plan amendment processed. In the alternative, we contend that, at a minimum, a supplemental EIS process is initiated to assess the areas / units as to each LUPA. Under the No-Action Alternative, based on Utah's 2015 Approve Resource Management, the Bureau would have designated 181,000 acres as SFAs and there would have been recommendations for withdrawal and prioritized for treatments/livestock permits. Now, under Utah's Preferred Management Alignment Alternative, lands would no longer be designated as SFA and there would be no withdrawals. American Bird Conservancy believes SFAs contribute to achieving conservation outcome, and the management of the SFAs should align with the conservation alternative. BLM seeks to incorporate by reference discussion of proceeding without SFAs in analyzing alternatives in the 2015 BLM plans and deciding not to proceed with the mineral withdrawals in 2017.61 BLM cannot rely on these previous discussions as analyzing the impacts of removing SFAs. BLM must evaluate the impacts of not only eliminating potential mineral withdrawals, but also removing the other protections associated with SFAs. In addition, BLM must evaluate the benefits from maintaining the SFAs and/or maintaining the range of management measures associated with those designations. Eliminating SFAs would be a mistake. Like with GHMAs, SFAs would be retained in some states, specifically Oregon and Montana (SFAs were never designated in Colorado). This again raises concerns about whether BLM will maintain a landscape scale approach to managing sage-grouse. An important component of the existing BLM and Forest Service sage-grouse land use plans is the designation of SFAs. These are the most important sage-grouse habitats, which contain large, contiguous blocks of federal lands in important sage-grouse habitats that have high levels of population connectivity and densities of breeding birds. Although BLM halted the process to evaluate withdrawing the SFAs from mining, the SFAs continue to serve as a landscape-level anchor for the sustained conservation and restoration of sage-grouse, including addressing habitat linkages. SFAs are closed or excluded from discretionary surface disturbances, including, in various plans: from waivers, exceptions or modifications from NSO stipulations on oil and gas leasing; from utility-scale wind and solar development; and from geothermal leasing. In addition, SFAs are used to prioritize fire protection, habitat restoration, grazing allotment evaluations, and other habitat management actions. The SFA classification allows BLM to focus limited resources where they can provide the most benefits. Consequently, BLM should maintain the SFA designation and management. If BLM moves forward with removing these designations, then BLM must incorporate the key management approaches that apply to SFAs and do not otherwise apply to PHMA. Eliminating SFAs in Utah represents a tremendous downgrade in land use plan protections that are oriented towards sage-grouse conservation. This new, additional proposal represents a further step backward beyond the decision to not withdraw these areas from mining claims. It is a retreat from environmental protections that have been recognized as needed for sage-grouse conservation by the FWS (and BLM). But given the previous retreat relative to mineral entry, the effect of the current proposed elimination of the SFAs in four of the states in the range of the sage-grouse is somewhat less significant. Still, there will be a number of lost or modified protections that apply to SFAs. These include provisions under the 2015 plans that require oil and gas leasing to only be allowed pursuant to a NSO stipulation that was not subject to waiver, exception, or modification; and prioritizing SFAs for vegetation and conservation actions. These are important protections that must be maintained in PHMAs if SFAs no longer exist. The value of these protections was recognized by the FWS in its 2015 not warranted decision, and thus are a key component of the land use plans that must be maintained if the not warranted decision is to be sustained, which it must be. "Based on our recommendation to further protect sage-grouse population centers that have been identified in the scientific literature as critically important for the species and areas identified through our analysis as important for conservation, BLM and USFS designated areas as Sagebrush Focal Areas (SFA) and added protections that would further limit new, human-caused surface disturbance in SFAs." 80 Fed. Reg. 59858, 59875 (Oct. 2, 2015). By following the Conservation Objectives Team (COT) Report and the BLM's National Technical Team (NTT) guidance, and restricting impacts in the most important habitat, the Federal Plans ensure that high-quality sage-grouse lands with substantial populations are minimally disturbed and sage-grouse within this habitat remain protected. Id. at 59882. SFAs "are the areas that the Federal Plans manage as the highest priority lands in PHMAs for sage-grouse conservation (Figure 5)." Id. at 59878. They are "strongholds" for sage-grouse conservation and as mentioned above contain important connectivity habitat and high densities of breeding birds. Id. The FWS recognized that in addition to PHMA protections, the protections mentioned above would also apply in SFAs, including mineral entry withdrawal, NSO stipulations for fluid minerals with no waivers, exceptions, or modifications, and prioritizing management and conservation actions. Id. This was because SFAs need "the most conservative strategies to protect sage-grouse and habitat." Id. Grazing permit review is also prioritized in SFAs. Id. at 59877, 59910. BLM seeks to incorporate by reference discussion of proceeding without SFAs in analyzing alternatives in the 2015 sage-grouse plans and deciding not to proceed with the mineral withdrawals in 2017. See e.g., Utah DEIS at 4-12. BLM cannot rely on these previous discussions as analyzing the impacts of removing SFAs. BLM must evaluate the impacts of not only eliminating potential mineral withdrawals, but also removing the other protections associated with SFAs. In addition, BLM must evaluate the benefits from maintaining the SFAs and/or maintaining the range of management measures associated with those designations in other areas (PHMAs). The protections in SFAs that would be lost by eliminating SFAs must be maintained in the remaining PHMAs, and the land use plan amendments BLM is contemplating must so provide. The BLM should modify the EIS and proposed land use plan amendments in Utah to specifically provide that the fluid minerals NSO stipulation with no waivers, exceptions, or modifications, the vegetation, conservation and grazing evaluation management priorities, and, where appropriate, the prohibition on geothermal development, will be specifically incorporated into and made a part of the PHMAs. There are two court cases the BLM should consider as it makes decisions about SFA designations. These are W. Exploration, LLC v. U.S. Dept. of the Interior, 250 F. Supp. 3d 718 (D. Nev. 2017) and Desert Survivors v. U.S. Dept. of the Interior, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81922 (N.D. Cal., May 15 2018). BLM viewed Western Exploration as creating a need for these RMP amendments stating changes might be needed "in order to comply with the court's order" and "seeking comment on the SFA designation." 82 Fed. Reg. 47248-49 (Oct. 11, 2017). BLM said the court "held that the BLM violated NEPA by failing to prepare a supplemental EIS for the designation of SFAs in the 2015 Greater Sage-Grouse Plan in Nevada." Id. at 47248. The BLM needs a fuller appreciation of Western Exploration before it treats it as a command to eliminate SFAs from the land use plans. For one the court found that the BLM had adequately considered any inconsistencies between the Federal sage-grouse plans and local county plans. 250 F. Supp. 3d at 744. The court also found that the BLM met its multiple use responsibilities under FLPMA when it adopted the Nevada sage-grouse plan. Id. at 746. The proposed withdrawal of 2.8 million acres from mineral entry (i.e., the SFAs) did not violate FLPMA. Id. "A review of the administrative record shows that BLM considered the relative value of Nevada's resources." Id. While the court agreed that under NEPA "the designation of 2.8 million acres as Focal Areas in Nevada amounts to a substantial change relevant to environmental concerns, requiring the Agencies to prepare [a supplemental EIS]" the court nevertheless refused to enjoin the Record of Decision (ROD) implementing the Nevada plan, holding "protection of the greater-sage grouse weighs against vacatur of the RODs. Enjoining implementation of the Plan Amendments pending the Agencies' preparation of an SEIS presents ""the possibility of undesirable consequences" to the greater sage-grouse species and their habitat." Id. at 748, 751. Based on this decision, the BLM is not required to eliminate SFAs, as it proposes, but rather, at most, it should only reconsider whether the SFA designations were made with a sufficient opportunity for public comment, and allow for additional public comment if warranted, making, possibly, only mid-course corrections, not summary eliminations. In Desert Survivors the court determined that in withdrawing the proposed ESA listing of the Nevada/California bi-state sage-grouse population the FWS ignored the best available science, improperly concluding voluntary conservation measures could stem the decline of the population. The court held the Service "erred in concluding there was sufficient certainty of effectiveness of planned conservation measures to support the conclusion that listing" the bird as threatened "was no longer warranted." Desert Survivors at 71. "There are no rational grounds for the service's conclusion." Id. at 83.The court held that, "the service must offer some rational basis for its conclusions that future conservation efforts will be effective enough to improve the status of the bi-state (grouse) and therefore warrant withdrawal of the proposed listing." Id. at 64. The BLM needs to bear this decision in mind before it eliminates protections for the sage-grouse in SFAs. Courts are going to be suspicious of commitments/actions with unproven benefits and that are not consistent with current/best available science. As discussed above, in the not warranted finding the FWS clearly concluded that SFAs had a strong scientific basis and were a critical element showing that BLM had put in place adequate regulatory mechanisms to make listing the sage-grouse unnecessary. As noted, BLM reached similar conclusions in the 2015 sage-grouse plans. Further, ongoing reviews of sage-grouse science, such as the USGS Report, do not support weakening any of the protections in the 2015 Sage-grouse Plans. Now the BLM is abandoning the commitment to implement SFA protections in much of the range of the sage-grouse. That is a decision that may not withstand review because it contradicts the best available science. The protections in SFAs that would be lost by eliminating SFAs must be maintained in the remaining PHMAs. The BLM should modify Utah DEIS to specifically provide that the fluid minerals NSO stipulation with no waivers, exceptions, or modifications, the vegetation, conservation and grazing evaluation and management priorities, and where appropriate, the prohibition on geothermal development will be specifically incorporated into and made a part of the plan. 2.4.6 Disturbance and Density Caps Additionally BLM is arbitrary and capricious in the date they establish for counting disturbance. Garfield County asserts disturbance caps should start at the time of plan approval and not before. Any determination that existing human disturbance should count against the disturbance cap is based on assumptions of what existed in that location prior to creation of the disturbance. Inasmuch as some of the disturbances in Garfield County are well in excess of 100 years old, Garfield County questions BLM's ability to accurately assess whether the ground underlying the disturbance was actually Sage grouse habitat prior to being disturbed. Garfield County also questions the arbitrary nature of disturbance caps when considering Native Americans burned significant portions of the area and modified the landscape. Did those burn projects created by Native Americans get credit when new habitat was created or did they cause damage to what was then existing? BLM is required to disclose any uncertainties in the document. Garfield County asks for a detailed explanation of uncertainties associated with existing disturbance, including but not limited to: underlying lands that are now occupied by disturbance; lands that existed prior to Native American vegetation treatments; and conditions of lands prior to being impacted by pioneer livestock grazing, federally authorized timber projects, federal designations and Sage grouse management activities of the last two decades. Garfield County also opposes the "all lands" concept. BLM's planning authority is only for BLM lands. Garfield County and the State of Utah are the only entities that have authority to develop land-use plans for all lands within the County. BLM should not use calculations beyond their authorized boundaries. This is particularly true where Sage grouse have been shown to occupy areas that were previously non-habitat. If Sage grouse can occupy areas that have been modified, there is no limit to the extent to which man can create additional Sage grouse habitat. Thus, a) the priority management area boundaries become arbitrary and capricious, b) the lands identified for disturbance caps become arbitrary and capricious, and c) the whole disturbance concept becomes irrational. Garfield County asserts to compliance with FLIPMA and other consistency requirements mandate BLM a) must confine the disturbance cap to its own lands, b) must consider a net disturbance cap with credit being given to new lands that improve Sage grouse quality and quantity, and c) must begin disturbance cap calculations at the time the plan is implemented. Page 2 -10 Garfield County strongly supports opportunities for exceeding this disturbance cap, particularly where high-value Sage grouse habitat may be developed. Throughout the planning process BLM has ignored the difference between high-value habitat and low value habitat. Garfield County has adopted a Conservation and Recovery Plan which includes wildlife habitat evaluation criteria that is more stringent than that identified in NEPA or in BLM's planning laws. 40 CFR 1506.2 requires that BLM use the County criteria, unless specifically barred. BLM has failed to do so, making the plan inconsistent and indefensible. Garfield County demands that BLM enters into government to government coordination to resolve this inconsistency and appropriately evaluate the wildlife habitat value for areas identified in PHMA. MA-SSS-3B The ability to exceed the disturbance cap based on a project-by-project analysis will more closely align BLM's plans with the State's Conservation Plan and management strategies. The revised MA-SSS-3B allows the 3 percent disturbance cap to be exceeded "if a technical team determines that site-specific GRSG habitat and population information, combined with project design elements (siting, minimization measures, and compensation), indicates the project will improve the condition of GRSG habitat within the proposed project analysis area.,,23 The State appreciates the BLM's flexibility in alIowing the exceedance of the cap and believes such action wilI bring BLM management more in line with the State's approach to managing sage-grouse. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the BLM's disturbance cap of 3 percent, even with exceedance of the cap, is still inconsistent with the State's 5 percent disturbance cap, above the 2013 baseIine.24 Because of the inconsistency between the 2013 State Plan and the BLM, the State believes the BLM should allow the 3 percent disturbance cap to be exceeded if the project will improve the condition of GRSG habitat within the proposed project analysis area or within the Priority Habitat Management Area where the project is located. This proposed language to alI ow the project proponent to improve sage-grouse habitat in another portion of sage-grouse habitat within PHMA more closely aligns with the State's Conservation Plan and should be added to the Alternative. The State's Conservation Plan allows for projects or disturbance to occur within any SGMA, so long as the project is in non-habitat or if mitigation, siting, or other efforts by a project proponent results in an overall improvement of sage-grouse habitat within the Sage-grouse Management Areas within the State. Further, the exceedance of the BLM cap must occur since the State's disturbance cap is currently broader, at 5 percent. By alIowing certain exception to the cap, and allowing a project proponent to improve other sage-grouse habitat outside the project boundary, greater conservation may occur for sage-grouse. For example, the BLM could allow a project proponent to place a project in an already heavily developed portion of PHMA, and then utilize compensatory mitigation funds to conduct a habitat restoration project that results in increased functional habitat or corridors in an area that has very little permanent disturbance and is a more intact portion of sage-grouse habitat. This broader exception to exceeding the cap would better align with the State's plan. Next, the BLM notes,"The finding and recommendation shall be made by the technical team which should consist of a field biologist or other GRSG experts, and should include coordination with the appropriate State of Utah agency.,,25 The State believes that the language herein discussing the technical team should be revised to note that technical team "will be made up by BLM field biologist, other local GRSG experts, and biologists and other representatives from the State of Utah." Since Utah has jurisdiction over sagegrouse, the State's technical expelis should be on any technical team when discussing how a project or the mitigation tied to a project will impact sage-grouse. Further, the BLM notes that "An area with disturbance within occupied GRSG habitat is not excluded from the 3 percent until it has been restored to provide GRSG habitat.,,26 The BLM should include a time frame for how often the BLM will analyze whether disturbed GRSG habitat has been restored. The State would suggest language in this section that states: "at, a minimum, annually the BLM will assess the entire PHMA or BSU to determine what areas of disturbed habitat have been restored." Otherwise, the State suppOlis the other modifications to MA-SSS-3B. MA-SSS-3C Density of EnergylMining Facilities Similar to the discussion above, the BLM should clarify that the density cap may be exceeded if a project is located in non-habitat, or the projecwill improve the condition of GRSG habitat within the proposed project analysis area, or within the Priority Habitat Management Area where the project is located. Disturbance and density caps need to be maintained. They are science based, as the recent USGS Report shows and were well supported by the science cited for the 2015 plans. They are important for maintaining, improving, restoring, and expanding overall habitat. While we appreciate that any reductions in the protections could only be made where it is demonstrated that "the project will improve the condition of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat," we are concerned that these decisions will only be based on "site-specific" analyses. This presents a question as to whether the landscape scale conservation needs of sage-grouse will continue to be considered. They must be before any disturbance or density caps are reduced. As sage-grouse scientists have observed, it is critical that there continues to be a focus "on conserving the landscapes necessary to sustain sage-grouse populations." Exhibit 4. There is a need to focus management on maintaining the "landscape matrix" and therefore the scientists "recommend that sagebrush habitats be managed holistically and collectively . . ." Id. The scientists recommend that "management approaches and objectives established [in the 2015 plans] be used as minimum standards in sage-grouse habitats." Id. BLM's plan to rely only on site-specific analyses in order to justify exceeding the disturbance and density caps need to be modified to also consider landscape scale analyses and data. The decision by the FWS not to list sage-grouse under the ESA noted the importance of the caps to sage-grouse protection: Each Federal Plan includes a disturbance cap that will serve as an upper limit (the maximum disturbance permitted). Anthropogenic disturbance has been identified as a key impact to sage-grouse. To limit new anthropogenic disturbance within sage-grouse habitats, the Federal Plans establish disturbance caps, above which no new development is permitted (subject to applicable laws and regulations; e.g., General Mining Law of 1872, and valid existing rights). This cap acts as a backstop to ensure that any implementation decisions made under the Federal Plans will not permit substantial amounts of new disturbance within the distribution of sage-grouse on BLM and USFS lands. In addition to the percent disturbance cap at the BSU and project scales, the BLM and USFS will use a density cap related to the density of energy and mining facilities during project-scale authorizations. If the disturbance density is greater than an average of 1/259 ha (1/640 ac) in PHMA, the project will either be deferred or co-located in an existing disturbed area (subject to applicable laws and regulations, such as the General Mining Law of 1872, valid existing rights, etc.). 80 Fed. Reg. 59858. There is a substantial body of scientific literature concluding that discrete anthropogenic activities that are present in sagebrush have negative effects on sage-grouse. As pointed out in the USGS Report, the extent of these effects varies based on the size, intensity and persistence of the human activity, and can range from displacement to local extirpation of sage-grouse. There is also strong support for the density and disturbance caps in the COT and NTT reports. In addition to the NTT and COT reports, numerous research papers confirm the importance of density and disturbance caps. It is clear the density and disturbance caps must not be weakened. Disturbance and density caps are not a realistic measurement for actual wildlife habitat. Roads have been abandoned and reclaimed in GRSG habitat only to have the birds show up and stay in the area that the new roads were created. This is the same for many "mitigation" actions that attempt to second guess the bird's habits seldom works. The bird needs to tell us if any constraints are relevant for other activities on the ground. The plan protocol needs to allow working group input data to be implemented based on case by case evaluations. This plan should address the NEPA constraints to this protocol NOW; in this plan to avoid any implementation delays on the needs of the actions. MA-SSS-3B Because of the inconsistency between the 2013 State Plan and the BLM, the State believes the BLM should allow the 3 percent disturbance cap to be exceeded if the project will improve the condition of GRSG habitat within the proposed project analysis area or within the Priority Habitat Management Area where the project is located. This proposed language to allow the project proponent to improve sage-grouse habitat in another portion of sage-grouse habitat within PHMA more closely aligns with the State's Conservation Plan and should be added to the Alternative. The State's Conservation Plan allows fr projects or disturbance to occur within any SGMA, so long as the project is in non-habitat or if mitigation, siting, or other efforts by a project proponent results in an overall improvement of sage-grouse habitat within the Sage-grouse Management Areas within the State. Further, the exceedance of the BLM cap must occur since the State's disturbance cap is currently broader, at 5 percent. a. MA-SSS-3B By allowing certain exception to the cap, and allowing a project proponent to improve other sage-grouse habitat outside the project boundary, greater conservation may occur for sage-grouse. For example, the BLM could allow a project proponent to place a project in an already heavily developed portion of PHMA, and then utilize compensatory mitigation funds to conduct a habitat restoration project that results in increased functional habitat or corridors in an area that has very little permanent disturbance and is a more intact portion of sage-grouse habitat. This broader exception to exceeding the cap would better align with the State's plan. MA-SSS-3B Next, the BLM notes,"The finding and recommendation shall be made by the technical team which should consist of a field biologist or other GRSG experts, and should include coordination with the appropriate State of Utah agency. "25 The State believes that the language herein discussing the technical team should be revised to note that technical team "will be made up by BLM field biologist, other local GRSG experts, and biologists and other representatives from the State of Utah." Since Utah has jurisdiction over sagegrouse, the State's technical experts should be on any technical team when discussing how a project or the mitigation tied to a project will impact sage-grouse. MA-SSS-3B Further, the BLM notes that "An area with disturbance within occupied GRSG habitat is not excluded from the 3 percent until it has been restored to provide GRSG habitat. The BLM should include a time frame for how often the BLM will analyze whether disturbed GRSG habitat has been restored. The State would suggest language in this section that states: "at, a annually the BLM will assess the entire PHMA or BSU to determine what areas of disturbed habitat have been restored." MA-SSS-3C Density of Energy/Mining Facilities Similar to the discussion above, the BLM should clarify that the density cap may be exceeded if a project is located in non-habitaÇ or the project will improve the condition of GRSG habitat within the proposed project analysis area, or within the Priority Habitat Management Area where the project is located. 3.A. Application of Restrictive Management Prescriptions and the Closure of High Potential Phosphate Mineral Resources to Development. The RMPA/EIS continues to contain very prescriptive management recommendations that are carried forward almost in their entirety as recommended by the 2011 NTT report, including the following: o 3% limit on surface disturbance at both project and BSU level (Disturbance Cap); o 1 energy and mining facility per 640 acres (Density Cap); and, o Right-of-Way exclusions and avoidance areas. The RMPA/EIS also continues to recommend the closure of PHMA to non-energy leasable development, with the exception of "considering" the expansion of existing operations if disturbance (density and disturbance caps) are met and subject to compensatory mitigation. The prescriptive recommendations presented in the 2011 NTT should be re-evaluated by the BLM. These recommendations have been heavily criticized by multiple stakeholders, including Simplot and the American Exploration and Mining Association. The NTT recommendations were primarily based on the professional judgment of a few select agency biologists without proper peer review according to the Department's Data Quality Act requirements. The NTT report wrongly assumed that GSG conservation should subordinate all other lawful uses of federal lands in contravention of the agency's multipleuse mandate, including mineral development. Indeed, once the previous Administration took a hard look at the consequences of withdrawing over ten million acres from mineral entry, it was readily apparent that mining has little do with the continued viability of the species. As Simplot previously commented these prescriptions are not aligned with the actual threats to the species and provide very little flexibility. Mineral resources can only be mined where they exist. Options that exist for other resources to mine directionally are not an option for leasable minerals. Closing Priority Habitat Management Areas (PHMA) to non-energy development and applying the density and disturbance criteria as written in the RMPA/EIS, results in essentially closing 100% (42,700 acres) of the federal mineral estate with high phosphate potential to new nonenergy leasable mineral prospecting, exploration and leasing resulting in a low likelihood that existing facilities will be able to expand. already degraded by discrete anthropogenic disturbance while maintaining the overall BSU disturbance below 3%. Additionally, Idaho recognized that the current disturbance cap has the potential to spread or "encourage" development into undeveloped areas of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat just to avoid reaching the 3 percent project scale disturbance cap in already fragmented areas. Based on the "2015 Estimate of Disturbance on Greater Sage-Grouse Priority and Important Habitat Management Areas within the Biologically Significant Units (BSUs)" (Appendix A), disturbance thresholds in the Uintah Population Management Area are 0.88%, significantly below the recommended 3%. Additionally the 2018 Utah RMPA/EIS states in part on page 3-1: "...BLM monitoring data collected using nationally available datasets and analyzed annually at the biologically significant unit (BSU) scale, as outlined in the Greater SageGrouse Monitoring Framework (Appendix D of the 2015 ROD/ARMPA), indicate that there has been a less than 1 percent range-wide overall increase in estimated disturbance from 2015 through 2017 on PHMA and IHMA (Idaho Important Habitat Management Area.). Moreover, there has been a range-wide overall decrease of less than 1 percent range-wide from 2012 through 2015 in sagebrush availability in PHMA within BSUs." Although Simplot supports the additional flexibility incorporated into the Management Alignment Alternative to allow development in non-habitat portions of PHMA if it does not indirectly impact habitat; the RMPA/EIS continues to recognize in the analysis on page 4-30: "The potential for this exception to allow larger mineral developments would be low given the small likelihood that a large development would fit entirely within an area of non-habitat in PHMA and still not have any indirect impacts would be low. For large projects in this situation, the potential effect of this added flexibility is likely low." In regards to the density and disturbance factors, Simplot supports the recommendations presented in the Idaho Greater Sage-Grouse Draft RMPA/EIS under the Management Alignment Alternative to remove the density cap at a project level and only apply the disturbance criteria at the BSU level in PHMA. Removal of the disturbance criteria at the project level would allow the BLM to intentionally cluster developments within areas 3.B. Flexibility Under the Management Alignment Alternative exceedances of the disturbance and density cap (at both the BSU and project analysis area) in PHMA can be allowed if site specific Sage-Grouse habitat and population information combined with project design elements (siting minimization measures and compensatory mitigation) indicate a project will "improve" habitat. However, there is no clarification as to what constitutes an improvement or how much improvement will be required before an exceedance will be allowed. Additionally, as stated on page 2-10 in the RMPA/EIS, habitat improvement has to be achieved within the project analysis area: "However, the 3 percent cap may be exceeded at either scale if a technical team determines that site-specific Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and population information, combined with project design elements (siting, minimization measures, and compensatory mitigation) indicates the project will improve the condition of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat within the proposed project analysis area." The direction of incorporating "improvement" within the project analysis area in regards to compensatory mitigation is inconsistent with the State Compensatory Mitigation Program which allows compensatory mitigation to occur within broader Sage-Grouse Management Areas (SGMA). Additionally, site specific opportunities to improve habitat (such as reducing tree cover) may not exist at the required level within a project analysis area, but could exist in a wider population area (such as a BSU), which is not currently being taken into account in the RMPA/EIS. * Simplot does not support the "blanket" exclusion of energy development and other large scale disturbances from priority GRSG habitats as currently recommended in the plan revisions. Decisions should be based on the scope of the proposed actions and its impact to GRSG habitat and populations at the larger BSU. Page 4-16: Section 4.6. l. Impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse. Administering Disturbance and Density Caps. Duchesne County commends the BLM for recognizing that there may be cases where localized habitat improvements could benefit sage grouse more than strict adherence to an arbitrary density cap. Such flexibility, which would allow local managers to evaluate site-scale impacts and minimize impacts at the project level, should be included in the final agency decision. 2.4.7 Habitat Objectives Habitat Objectives Tables We appreciate the idea that broad, science-based objectives have a place in determining whether greater sage-grouse habitat is contributing to stable populations. However, no single objective can cover the wide range of variability that occurs across a landscape as vast as the sagebrush sea. The Habitat Objectives Tables (Table 2-2) have been misinterpreted as standards that must be met, likely at the expense of the widest and most adaptable use in the West-livestock grazing. It does not make sense that these objectives be reflected in livestock grazing permittee/lessee terms and conditions if they do not fit the ecosystem in which they are being applied. Because of this, we appreciate those amendments that propose to make clear that habitat objectives must account for local conditions and site variability. This includes the removal of the seven-inch perennial grass and forb height habitat objective. We understand why grass and forb height objectives need to be considered for the health of the bird, but we believe these objectives should vary across the range. We request these changes be made to the habitat objectives tables for each greater sage-grouse RMP amendment. Allowing local BLM offices to develop appropriate habitat objectives and consider variability across sites and years will improve implementation and provide the opportunity for results of that implementation to be recognized and rewarded. This approach also provides a collaborative pathway forward. The draft plan continues to state one habitat objective is to have sagebrush cover be between10 to 30%. This implies that once this is exceeded further sagebrush thinning will conducted. There is an absence of scientific support for this agency opinion. There is evidence to the contrary that BLM appears to be ignoring. BLM ignores well researched studies that have found this opinion false. The selective avoidance of important scientific information and failure to provide studies in support this agency opinion presents a significant failure of this plan. A number of agency opnions central to actions BLM is conducting to modify vegetation need to have an open scientific review and their merit proven by independent studies. 2018 draft plan, "In general, the existing conditions of livestock grazing in Utah remain the same as described in the 2015 Final EIS. BLM has continued to issue grazing permit renewals consistent with the regulation and in conformance with the RMPs, including the management in the 2015 ROD/ARMPA." BLM's sage grouse National Technical Team (NTT) provided direction that should be incorporated into this plan: * "Within priority sage grouse habitat, incorporate sage grouse habitat objectives and management consideration into all BLM grazing allotments through AMPs or permit renewals." * Prioritize completion of land health assessments and processing grazing permits within priority sage grouse habitat areas. Utilize Ecological Site Descriptions to conduct land health assessments to determine if standards of range-land health are met. As mentioned earlier, most grazing allotments in PHMA have not been assessed for improper grazing, and, based on the evidence BLM has provided, those that have improper grazing lack management changes that have led to monitoring that show today's rangelands now meet sage grouse needs. This land use plan fails to incorporate these key requirements in grazing management. The absence of these shows that this plan is weaker it would be if the NTT direction had been followed. In the 2018 plan, BLM uses new classifications of sagebrush habitat. Areas now called Wasatch are similar to mesic and areas noted as "low" are arid sites. Here are a few examples of the lowering of these habitat characteristics objectives in the new plan. For breeding habitat sagebrush should be between 40-80 cm high according to Connelly et al. (2000) and in the new plan the objective is 22 cm high in the wetter higher elevation sagebrush. Connelly et al.'s Table 3 shows perennial grass/forbs should be 18cm high or higher with 25% or more canopy cover in breeding habitat. The new plan calls for perennial grass cover of greater than 8% and forbs greater than 6% (14% total) with no height requirement. These recommendations in the plan don't appear to represent Utah sage grouse habitat characteristics at their potential. Modifying Habitat Objectives The State suppOlis the inclusion of the revised habitat objective tables and the associated scientific research that more closely aligns to known sage-grouse habitat and habitat requirements for Utah sage-grouse based on local research and data.27 After meeting with local constituents, it may be helpful to rename the different zones of habitat. Many commentators were confused with the names of Wasatch, Low and Parker, since Wasatch and Parker, can also describe specific locations within the State. A potential name change could basically be identifying the habitats as low, mid-elevation (in-lieu of Parker), and high elevation (in-lieu of Wasatch), fmiher not only map the habitat, but to also identify the habitats by elevation and precept zones that makeup those habitat clusters. Vegetation Objectives Lack Support In addressing the issue of canopy and wildfire, the NTT Report cites J.W. Connelly to support the conclusion that sagebrush canopy should not be reduced to less than 15% when managing wildfire fuels. NTT Report at 26. Connelly, however, discusses a range of 10% to 30% and explicitly states that land treatments should not be based on targets, schedules or quotas. John W. Connelly, et al., Guidelines to Manage Sage-Grouse Populations and Their Habitats, 28 WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN 967-985, 77 (2000). The NTT authors omitted the complete recommendation in the Connelly paper and arbitrarily picked 15% as the target for sagebrush canopy. The 2015 Plan then made this mandatory in Table 2-2. The NTT Report also contradicts its own statistical assertions. NTT Report at 7. First, the NTT Report states that priority habitat should be managed so that 70% of the habitat is adequate. Id. A page earlier, however, the report states that 50-70% of the range must be adequate to persist. Id. at 6. The sources cited do not recommend either the upper or lower range offered by the NTT authors. Those sources cited rely on anecdotal evidence of a preferred percentage. See Attach. 4, Maxwell at 14-15. The consistent overstating or misstating the recommendations taints the integrity and accuracy of the science. The singular conclusion is that the agenda to preserve large areas of federal land overrode principles of scientific integrity at every turn and this agenda led to the 2015 Plan and the pending litigation. Determination if GRSG habitat objectives are met (Table 2-2) The purported intent of Table 2-2 at page 2-4 of the LUPA in Utah (as well as similar "Table 2-2" in the other LUPAs) is to set habitat objectives for sage-grouse habitat in various parts of the season, i.e. lek habitat, nesting/early brood rearing, late brood-rearing/summer, and winter. However, the LUPAs continually elevate these "objectives" to Standards, and in many cases, inflexible Standards. The variability between just these four states show that the best available science is not being used and applied in "Table 2-2". Specifically, the GRSG LUPA in (at least) Utah includes the following Objective and Management Actions, which demonstrate these flaws / consequences: Objective SSS-3: In all GRSG habitat, where sagebrush is the current or potential dominant vegetation type or is a primary species within the various sates of the ecological site description, maintain or restore vegetation to provide habitat for lekking, nesting, brood rearing, and winter habitats. The Habitat Objectives for Greater Sage-Grouse (see Table 2-2, Habitat Objectives for Greater Sage-Grouse) summarize the characteristics that research has found represent the seasonal habitat needs for GRSG. The specific seasonal components identified in Table 2-2 were adjusted based on local science and monitoring data to define the range of characteristics used in the Utah Sub-region. Thus, the habitat objectives provide the broad vegetative conditions we strive to obtain across the landscape that indicate the seasonal habitats used by GRSG. These habitat indicators are consistent with the rangeland health indicators used by the BLM (more at 2-5). MA-LG-4: Evaluate Utah's Rangeland Health Standards and process grazing permits. Focus monitoring and management activities on allotments found not to be achieving Utah's Rangeland Health Standards where livestock grazing is identified as a causal factor and that have the best opportunities conserving, enhancing or restoring habitat for GRSG. Use ecological site descriptions and/or other appropriate information to determine the desired plant community within proper functioning ecological processes for conducing land health assessments to evaluate the achievement or non-achievement of rangeland health standards. MA-LG-5: in PHMA and GHMA, conduct land health assessments that include indicators and measurements of structure, condition, composition, etc., of vegetation specific to achieving GRSG habitat objectives (objective SSS-3) including within wetlands and riparian areas. Prioritize land health assessments in SFA, followed by PHMA outside of the SFA. Conduct land health assessments at the watershed scale and use the GRSG habitat objectives when assessing the applicable standard in GRSG habitats. Restore degraded sage-grouse habitat. Sage-grouse have already lost nearly half their range to agriculture and development. The federal sage-grouse conservation strategy should be updated to support active restoration of areas that can still be used by sage-grouse and other wildlife. Make vegetation management a priority. Maintaining and improving habitat is a long-standing tradition in Utah and walking away from this responsibility is a bad idea. THE USE OF THE IM'S IN THIS RMPA The cooperating agency instructions have been very clear that the mandates imposing rigid vegetation height is not acceptable. Since new data has shown a hard line on the use of stubble height to be a disproven theory, new peer reviewed science needs to be accepted into this plan. The IMs have conflicting language. It makes BLM protocols for sage grouse habitat monitoring and other requirements are simply incorrect. If BLM makes it so they are unable to comply, the flawed Grazing Habitat Objectives the RMPA and virtually every grazing permit located in priority sage grouse habitat will be an easy target for litigation. The use of HAF and AIM protocols do not address the needs of monitoring for the RMPA. HAF will only measure whether a site is capable of meeting habitat objectives. AIM will only show the amount of forage in pounds that site can produce. They do not develop monitoring data, which measures the change of rangeland over time in response to management. Continue to use the established monitoring protocol including cooperative monitoring with the allotment permittees. Changing protocols under the grazing IM's, BLM will be unable to comply to their own grazing habitat objectives making virtually every grazing permit located in priority sage grouse habitat open for litigation. The plan should also make vegetation management a priority and not allow disturbances to habitat to exceed more than 3% or one well pad/development per section. THE USE OF THE IM'S IN THIS RMPA The cooperating agency instructions have been very clear that the mandates imposing rigid vegetation height is not acceptable.

Surveys of habitat condition have verified that herbaceous vegetation abundance is greatly reduced from the ecological potential for many areas within Utah's occupied sage grouse habitat. Messmer and Dahlgren (2018) reported five years of habitat surveys that concluded that grass and forb abundance was reduced with only a fraction of expected perennial grass cover is less than a quarter of what was expected and much less than needed in order to meet the needs of sage grouse as defined by Connelly et al. (2000). This study looked transects near active nest sites for sage grouse. Messmer and Dahlgren recommended and BLM reduce vegetation height and canopy cover standards so that today's degraded habitat meets objectives. BLM appears to have adopted these recommendation and, unfortunately this study is not available to the public. We asked the author's for a copy and were denied this since it has yet to be published. We ask for a copy of this study and the supporting field data be provided by BLM because it is central to supporting their habitat objectives in this plan. 2.4.8 Adaptive Management Page 2 -41 2.7 Adaptive Management Garfield County recognizes the concepts associated with hard triggers soft triggers. However, one of the problems associated with public lands management is the federal government's inability to respond quickly. Provisions need to be in place such that local offices, local biologists -in cooperation and coordination with the State of Utah and local governments -can act quickly to not only correct declines in habitat quality, quantity and Sage grouse populations but also to make improvements in those areas. The current plan does not in encourage enhancement and development of Sage grouse habitats and populations aggressively enough. In this regard it is inconsistent with Garfield County's plans. In addition, adaptive management should make things better, faster; and credit needs to be given to offset potential future development and disturbances. The triggers are also based on total male sage grouse counted in each population area. The process of adding newly discovered leks to this total negates the authority of state and BLM population estimates. Appendix I does consider males/lek for one of its triggers. However, the amount of change must be huge in order to trigger action. A population decline needs to be more than 40% in one year. 2017 saw on average a 20% decline. This decline failed to trigger action because 2017 was the first year past a peak in the population cycle. As we have seen, rarely does this trigger identify important reductions sage grouse population, and, over time, we will see the population disappear before a trigger is crossed. This needs to be redesigned in order to capture important population changes in sage grouse numbers. population decline. Further, similar to hard-triggers, the BLM should note that it could also include other management actions, which may require the need to amend the RMP to address the situation and modify management. These clarifications will provide certainty, and ensures that the BLM's actions are not arbitrary or beyond the scope authorized by the Alternative or by law. Finally, after reviewing the Alternative, it appears the BLM has failed to include a monitoring requirement when soft-triggers are tripped. When developing the Alternative, it was assumed that both the State and BLM would cooperatively monitor whether management actions being implemented were successful to address a causal factor. Please add a statement identifying the intent to monitor. The statement could say the BLM, the State, and other members of the technical team, will annually monitor and record population trends to verify that any management actions implement to mitigate declines are being successful. If monitoring indicates continued declines, and if a hard trigger is tripped, the BLM will utilize the tools for managing species after a hard trigger is tripped. Adaptive Management Overall, the State believes the adaptive management protocols identified by the BLM will more closely align with the State's Conservation Plan.42 The Adaptive Management Triggers, together with the technical team working together to identify causal factors for any declines within six months of identifying that the trigger has been tripped, will provide synergistic partnership for managing sage-grouse and sage-grouse habitat. However, the BLM needs to clearly identify what conservation measures will be applied if a soft trigger is tripped, and BLM's management actions are the causal factor for the decline in sage-grouse populations. The Alternative notes that "the BLM manager will apply measures are conservative or restrictive implementation conservation conditions, terms, or decisions within the agencies' discretion to mitigate the decline of populations and/or habitats." if a trigger is caused by BLM management.43 Although the State understands that certain measures may be necessary to mitigate declines to sage-grouse caused by the BLM's management, the BLM needs to clarify and include language stating that the BLM: will work with the State of Utah, and public land users to adopt management protocols identified in the Alternative, or authorized by law to slow down or stop the The BLM would plan to change the hard and soft trigger adaptive management requirements to first require BLM to determine the "causal factor" causing the problem before applying corrective measures, unlike the current plan which allows corrective measures to be applied immediately. Utah DEIS at 2-28 to -29. This would weaken BLM's adaptive management plans and provisions. Determining the exact causes of why a trigger has been tripped is difficult at best from a scientific perspective, and it may be impossible in many cases. See Utah DEIS at Appendix I-7 (noting identifying specific causes and effects can be difficult). Hard and soft triggers are an important backstop that help ensure the plans are working and that management is changed if needed. Hard and soft trigger adaptive management provisions must be maintained and not limited. While it is appropriate to try to determine causal factors-this can help focus needed management-making this determination a prerequisite to taking action is ill-advised and would only weaken the Utah sage-grouse plan, perhaps awaiting a never-to-be-achieved, and impossible goal. Hard and soft triggers must continue to be applied and not delayed awaiting achievement of an impossible and unneeded goal. In considering changes to the adaptive management strategy it is also crucial that BLM provide for public involvement and engagement in this decision process. Under BLM's new instruction memorandum (IM) 2018-022 no provisions are made for public engagement in the hard and soft trigger implementation process, unlike BLM's prior IM 2016-140. This must be corrected and under the record of decision for this land use planning process the BLM must provide for public comment opportunities when hard and soft triggers are considered and implemented. Monitoring and Adaptive Management Monitoring is a critical component of the Utah RMPA and its Adaptive Management Plan given the value of the resource and the large scale of its habitat. The timing of monitoring and the data collected informs adaptive management actions. Appendix I (Adaptive Management) of the Draft EIS includes an overview of monitoring and states the RMP A contains a Monitoring Framework Plan (Appendix D). Appendix D is not included in the Draft EIS. Without seeing a revised Monitoring Framework Plan, it is difficult to evaluate the monitoring plan in relation to adaptive management plan. The EPA recommends the Final EIS include the revised Monitoring Framework Plan (Appendix D). The Adaptive Management strategy in the Draft EIS contains a two-tiered system of hard and soft triggers for the greater sage-grouse and its habitat. These triggers identify population and habitat thresholds which, if exceeded, would result in a change in how BLM addresses management of the greater sage-grouse in that area. The Draft EIS notes soft triggers represent an intermediate threshold where management changes are needed to prevent a severe decline, whereas hard triggers represent a more direct action to stop a severe deviation from the greater sage-grouse conservation objectives. For hard triggers, there are automatic adaptive management responses when strategy development and corrective action deadlines are not met, but there is no similar action for soft triggers. In its October 2015 finding that listing the greater sage-grouse under the Endangered Species Act was not warranted, USFWS states, "Further, in response to monitoring, activities allowable under the Federal Plans may be adjusted based on adaptive management criteria to provide an immediate, corrective response to identified triggers for populations or habitat declines.,,2 We recommend the Adaptive Management Plan in Final EIS include the actions that would be taken in the event that soft-trigger and hard-trigger deadlines are not met. 2.4.9 General Habitat Management Areas Because the hard trigger in the Sheeprocks has already been tripped, changing some GHMA to PHMA, it would be useful to include specific language on what an "untrigger" would do in this area in terms of allocations or management actions, since it seems unhelpful to return to GHMA if all other GHMA has been elimainated. This comment comes from discussion at the West Desert Adaptive Resource Management Group. Removal of GHMA The BLM's removal of GHMA and the management actions that require or discuss management scenarios within GHMA, including removing MA-SSS-5, must occur since GHMA management action does not align with the State's strategy for conserving sagegrouse. Further, the removal of GHMA is appreciated since the category of General Habitat does little for sage-grouse conservation in Utah. Indeed, eliminating the GHMA designation throughout Utah, and instead focusing the BLM's effOlts on the Priority Habitat Management Areas containing over 96 percent of Utah's sage-grouse population, will be the most valuable and productive approach to conserving sage-grouse habitat in Utah. As examined by BLM in the DEIS, the designation of GHMA has, and will continue to fail to properly conserve sage-grouse in Utah. GHMA areas in Utah include severely fragmented habitats, areas of habitat mostly on private propelty and tribal lands, areas containing small isolated populations, and many acres of unoccupied and non-habitats. 30 The GHMA in the State is of low-biological significance to sage-grouse in the State and limits the State and the BLM's ability to conserve sage-grouse and its habitatY As noted in the DEIS, "the GHMA in the Morgan and Summit counties areas is predominantly found on private lands; the GHMA between Vernal and Strawberry Reservoir (noted as South Slope Uintah in the 2015 Final EIS Chapter 3) is tribal and private lands; the areas of GHMA in the Uintah Population Area is separated into three small subpopulations, described in Chapter 3 of the 2015 Final EIS as Deadman's Bench, East Bench and Book Cliffs, and Halfway Hollow. None of the other GHMA in Utah includes any leks, and is generally comprised of poor quality habitat on the periphery oflarger PHMA.,,32 Prior to the development of the Utah 2015 LUPA, the State conducted an analysis of the GHMAs relative to the State SGMAs. This analysis was submitted to the BLM as part of the State's Scoping Comments (See Ex. A), in the State's 2015 Consistency Review and identified that the State's SGMAs, which makes up the BLM's PHMA, encompassed over 96 percent of the known sage-grouse populations in Utah and the habitats which offer the best ecological potentials for successful conservation.33 After removing Forest Service and tribal lands, the remaining GHMA habitat throughout Utah contains less than 1 percent of the State's known GPS and telemetry Sage-grouse habitat. 34 In other words, GPS and telemetry marked birds are rarely, if ever, using GHMA habitats. In fact, only a few more than 300 male sage-grouse were found in all GHMA and other non-PHMA habitat throughout Utah in 2017.35 In 2017, 0 males were counted in the Deadman Bench leks and the East Bench lek in the Uinta Basin.36 Thus, very few birds are found in or utilize GHMA habitats in Utah. As the BLM pointed out, of the 366-known occupied leks in Utah, 96 percent of these leks are found in PHMA.37 Only 8 of the 22 leks in GHMA are in areas affected by BLM management, with the other 14 in areas predominantly owned by tribal or private entities. DEIS.ld. The Alternative allows the BLM to prioritize habitat management in areas that encompass nearly 96 percent of the actual Greater Sage-Grouse, based on 2017 data, and only removes 1 percent of habitat on BLM lands. Based on the best available scientific data, the State's SGMA maps are being updated using state-wide location data obtained by sage-grouse marked with very-highfrequency (VHF) radio-collars. To refine these seasonal maps, the State and its partners has deployed over 300 global position systems (GPS) transmitters on sage-grouse. The GPS transmitters will provide over two million new locations that will be used to refine the sagegrouse seasonal habitat maps in Utah. As such, the State requests the BLM to continue to work with the State to remove the unnecessary GHMA designation and focus the BLM's time, effOlts, and resources on the areas of the State with the highest densities of birds and highest possibility for conservation success. The conservation value of any BLM GHMA lands to the persistence and growth of sage-grouse populations in Utah is marginal when compared with the habitat values and growth trends of populations in PHMA, which PHMA areas align with the State's plan. Finally, some commentators may try to argue that GHMA is vital for conservation of sage-grouse as creating areas necessary for connectivity and genetic flow in Utah. One scientific study that may be inappropriately relied upon by commentators contains certain flaws that were not addressed prior to publishing a paper. A recently-released U.S. Forest Service study (Cross 2018)38 attempted to quantify the impOltance of connectivity across the sagebrush range. The researchers grouped 1,200 leks into "nodes," or a collection of leks, within the network of greater sage-grouse. The nodes were then categorized as "hubs" or spokes" based on their importance to facilitating gene flow within and across the range of sage-grouse. The paper noted that Hubs foster gene flow out to the spokes. If a hub were to be lost, the birds in the connected spokes would be at risk of genetic isolation. The paper identified certain portions of Utah as hubs and spokes and areas of "betweeness" important for connectivity. However, the paper failed to consider the impacts that translocated birds have had in Utah. Throughout the 1950s to the present, the State has utilized hundreds of translocated birds from all pmts of the State as a tool to move birds and recover or supplement populations. Many of the areas identified in the paper as being important for "gene-flow" or connectivity, have been artificially connected through state management and translocation of sage-grouse. Further, the data from collared birds collected by Utah State and BYU, have failed to corroborate the position taken by the research paper. In fact, the data shows that most collared birds have very little interaction or use with BLM lands marked as GHMA. The argument that GHMA is important for gene-flow and connectivity is not supported by the best-available local data and science. For all the above reasons, the State supports the removal of GHMA. The usage of the term occupied habitat in the DRMPA/EIS causes confusion about potential mitigation requirements. Although the MAA eliminates the GHMA habitat category and removes associated management (see DRMPA/EIS page 2-6), the MAA also requires, "replace[ment of] occupied habitat developed outside PHMA by improving habitat in PHMA" (see DRMPA/EIS page 2-7; emphasis added). The term occupied habitat is not defined in the DRMPA/EIS, although the document states, "GHMA Areas with mapped occupied habitat outside of PHMA (management is only applicable to actions on BLM-administered lands). The [State Plan] does not include maps or specific management for occupied habitat outside their SGMA" (see DRMPA/EIS page I-3; emphasis added). The DRMPA/EIS continues that, "[i]t is important to note that the State of Utah's maps used for occupied habitat are broad in nature, and were developed to identify the general areas of potential habitat where Greater Sage-Grouse may be found. The state's general maps, and by extension the BLM's PHMA maps, were developed with the intent that as decision-making in the mapped areas moves from broad considerations to application at more specific areas, information that is correspondingly more detailed should be reviewed to determine if a given area actually includes occupied Greater Sage-Grouse habitat" (see DRMPA/EIS page I-4; emphasis added). The DRMPA/EIS further indicates, under the MAA, that the BLM should, "[o]utside of PHMA, provide that acres of occupied Greater Sage-Grouse habitat lost to habitat degradation actions…are replaced by creating/improving Greater Sage-Grouse habitat within PHMA" (see DRMPA/EIS page 2-22; emphasis added). Finally, the DRMPA/EIS states, "In addition, the [MAA] provides that occupied habitat outside PHMA that is lost to development be replaced by creating or improving habitat inside PHMA…The requirement to mitigate the loss of occupied Greater Sage-Grouse habitat in former GHMA area by creating or improving PHMA could have a collective impact over time. As the amount of development increases in former GHMA, the lack of local mitigation could accelerate the declines in Greater Sage-Grouse populations as available habitat that is not affected by disturbance shrinks" (see DRMPA/EIS page 4-18; emphasis added). The treatment of occupied habitat in these various locations throughout the DRMPA/EIS implies that mitigation is still going to be required for areas formerly classified as GHMA, which is inconsistent with the State Plan -there is no such category as GHMA in the State Plan, nor is there a requirement to mitigate for loss of GHMA (or disturbance of any other areas beyond those classified as SGMA) under the State Plan. Prior usage of the term occupied habitat in the preceding plan amendment documents, which are frequently incorporated by reference into the DRMPA/EIS, further complicates the issue. For example, the ARMPA states, "In Utah, all occupied GRSG habitat was identified as [Preliminary Priority Habitat]" (see ARMPA page I-14; emphasis added). This seems to imply that occupied habitat in the BLM's lexicon corresponds to PHMA, rather than GHMA, which would be more consistent with the BLM's usage of the term on DRMPA/EIS page I-4. However, going back further, the DLUPA/EIS states, "In Utah, occupied, winter, and breeding GRSG habitats are shown on Map I.I…Map I.I is based on the best available information on where GRSG populations are currently distributed in Utah" (see DLUPA/EIS page 3-5; emphasis added). The DLUPA/EIS continues, "The mapped habitat is considered occupied based on known historic habitats, field observations, professional judgement, radio-telemetry data, and intact sagebrush areas adjacent to the previously mentioned areas. In addition to leks, nesting habitat, brood-rearing habitat, and wintering habitat, mapped habitats included other known occupied habitats that may fall between those known season use areas and are considered occupied. While there may be GRSG outside current GRSG maps, the best habitat with the highest likelihood to support persisting GRSG populations are contained within the habitat maps" (see DLUPA/EIS page 3-13; emphasis added). Map I.I in the DLUPA/EIS appears to correspond all PHMA and GHMA combined, and this appears to be the only seemingly-definitive indication of a "definition" of occupied habitat. It is important to note that the State Plan does not include any definition of occupied habitat, nor does it include maps indicating the extent of habitat. It appears that the DRMPA/EIS requirement to mitigate for "occupied habitat" outside of PHMA -thereby continuing to require mitigation for former GHMA -is merely the result of inconsistent language usage. In any final environmental impact statement, record of decision, and/or revised land use plan amendment(s), the BLM should clearly define the term occupied habitat, and further should clearly indicate that mitigation for former GHMA -which is no longer existent under the MAA -is not required. This resolves an outside conflict with and inconsistency between the Federal plan and the State Plan. The BLM and the State of Utah should align their respective planning documents with regard to the definition of occupied habitat; The BLM should clearly state that mitigation for areas formerly in GHMA -which are to be removed under the MAA -is not required, regardless of whether that former GHMA is considered "occupied" or not. Second, the General Habitat Management Areas, or GHMAs, are aspects of the plan we want to bring to your attention. Under the No-Action Alternative, Utah would have 448,600 acres of GHMA. The management of these areas would follow the 2015 Plan Amendment. Lek buffers, required design features, net conservation gain, habitat objectives, and leasing prioritization would be included under the No-Action Alternative, as well. However, in the Preferred Management Alternative, no GHMAs will exist with hopes of directing improvements to Priority Habitat Management Areas (PHMAs). American Bird Conservancy sees the presence of GHMAs management in accordance with the conservation alternative in Utah as a way to protect the Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat. The Management Protocol in the 2013 State of Utah's Conservation Plan for Greater SageGrouse in Utah affirms, "[a]reas identified as habitat on federal and state lands should be managed to avoid surface disturbance to the greatest degree possible."105 It is important to ensure that seasonal habitats not included in priority areas receive some protection,106 and to allow for expansion of recovering populations into newly restored areas. In addition, general habitat can serve as a location for compensatory mitigation offsets and restoring degraded habitat.107 The recent USGS synthesis of recent science on sage-grouse recently stated: Maintaining connectivity among (priority areas) through restoration activities or conservation of existing sagebrush communities at important "pinch points," where movements are constrained, is an important component of an overall sagegrouse management strategy. Maintenance or restoration of habitat quality within corridors is important to limit exposure to risk (for example, from predators), and because sage-grouse use these sites as resting and refueling areas.108 [comment:37-16; 105.0306]The USGS Synthesis has confirmed the importance of maintaining connectivity between different sage-grouse populations to conserve genetic diversity.112 A 2015 study found that long-distance movements of GRSG have been documented, but the risk associated with the landscapes that the birds traverse is not well understood. The current designated priority area strategy does not protect movement corridors among priority areas, and some areas may be at risk of isolation even when they are not separated by large distances.113 A 2016 study covering Idaho, Utah and Wyoming showed that several sage-grouse moved 100 km north and west,traversing from the Wyoming Basin to a range typically associated with the Snake River Plain,and theorized that these migrating birds may serve as an important genetic link between two sage-grouse management zones.114[comment end] To whom it may concern, as both a citizen and a Biologist who has worked on Sage Grouse recruitment monitoring, I'm writing to strongly urge you NOT to relinquish the General Habitat designation from the 2015 Sage Grouse conservation plan. Taking this habitat away does three major, detrimental things: 1.) It relinquishes a safety buffer for populations within the critical habitat area. 2.) It offers nothing for the lecs that are already inside the General Habitat acreage, and 3.) It puts undo pressure on an already threatened bird in decline. Getting rid of this designated area in the name of focusing more resources on the priority area is equivalent to saying you're going to demolish half the house so that you can focus more on the fire burning the other half down. It's complete foolishness and does not take a 'good faith effort' approach to conservation. Your justification that it will not impact this already declining species because habitat effected by development is required to be replaced is absolute nonsense and reckless. First, fragmentation is the number one problem and this old growth sagebrush habitat cannot simply be replaced. Second, these birds do not simply pick up and utilize new habitat once disturbed. You would know this if you actually cared about what the science has to say. Lek site fidelity is absolute with Sage Grouse. Once their leking grounds are disturbed they are vanquished. Eliminating General Habitat Management Areas The BLM currently manages approximately 618,100 acres of BLM lands in Utah as GHMA for sage-grouse conservation. Utah DEIS at 1-4 (Table 1-2). The BLM manages these areas under a net conservation gain mitigation standard; lek buffer distances are applied; fluid minerals required design features (RDF) are used; oil and gas lease prioritization measures are required; stipulations are specified for fluid minerals leasing, including approximately 60,000 acres that are NSO or closed to leasing; discretionary PHMA provisions can potentially be applied to activities; and other provisions apply to things such as off road vehicle management, livestock grazing, wind energy, noise management, and rights-of-ways. Utah DEIS at 2-19 to -25. Now the BLM is planning to eliminate these areas and the protective management in them. It would return to the management provisions in the pre-2015 land use plans. Only if an area is adjacent to a PHMA might additional protections be considered. Utah DEIS at 2-21. This plan is fraught with problems and must be reconsidered. For one, this plan would only apply in Utah and not in the five other states considering sage-grouse plan amendments, or in Montana which is not considering amendments. This raises issues about whether the "rangewide" conservation program that was a hallmark of the 2015 plans will continue as the basis for sage-grouse conservation. PHMA and GHMA, coupled with SFA, were central to the 2015 conservation strategy, and now BLM is planning to abandon two of those pillars in Utah (GHMA and SFA). BLM's plan would likely "incentivize development in areas formally identified as GHMA." Utah DEIS at 4-17. BLM's plans will in all likelihood have negative impacts on sage-grouse in GHMA or on sage-grouse habitats in GHMA, despite BLM's claim that the impacts of the No Action Alternative and the Management Alignment Alternative will be the same in the long-term. Utah DEIS at 4-18. "As the amount of development increases in former GHMA, the lack of local mitigation could accelerate the declines in Greater Sage Grouse populations as available habitat that is not affected by disturbance shrinks." Id. "The changes in management in the Management Alignment Alternative would continue, if not accelerate these effects [due to fragmentation and further isolation and impacts to GHMA]." Id. BLM claims that these declines will be offset by increases in PHMA populations because of improved management in those areas. But this raises a question: if the goal is to "maintain and/or increase Greater Sage-Grouse abundance and distribution by conserving, enhancing or restoring the sagebrush ecosystem upon which populations depend in collaboration with other conservation partners", id., why not maintain GHMAs and also improve PHMA management? Under BLM's current sage-grouse land use plans, and under the No Action Alternative, development is already allowed in GHMAs. Utah DEIS at 4-17. There is no need to eliminate these areas in order to allow for development. Development in GHMAs under BLM's proposed plans is "not anticipated to be different than the development that would eventually be allowed under the No-Action Alternative . . . " Id. It is clear there is no need to eliminate GHMAs in order to "further enhance [BLM's] continued cooperation with western states by ensuring greater consistency between individual state plans and the BLM's multiple-use mission." Id. at ES-1 and 1-2. Development in GHMAs is already allowed, and even encouraged, so there is no inconsistency with Utah state plans. Under the No Action Alternative, where GHMAs would be maintained, there would only be a 0.1 percent reduction in employment and earnings compared to pre-2015 levels, so it is clear that maintaining GHMAs will have essentially no economic effect, which is in alignment with the plans of the state of Utah. Id. at ES-11. Moreover, the BLM existing plan "[has] not resulted in a large decrease in oil and gas leases or right-of-way applications or an increase in rejected applications . . .", so again it is clear GHMA management is not contrary to the State's plan. Id. at 4-34 Data presented in the Utah DEIS demonstrates the values of GHMA habitats. There is a considerable amount of sage-grouse breeding habitat that is found in GHMAs. Utah DEIS at Fig. 3-2. There are also considerable summer range areas in GHMA. Id. at Fig. 3-3. There is a large amount of winter range in GHMA areas. Id. at Fig. 3-4. It is clear that if GHMA are eliminated many habitat improvement and enhancement opportunities will be lost. As noted, the principal objective of BLM's proposed amendments to the Utah sage-grouse plan is an effort to better align with what BLM perceives to be the requirements of Utah's state sage-grouse plan. In particular BLM wants to align its management with the Sage-Grouse Management Areas (SGMA) that Utah has designated. BLM claims that its PHMAs "largely coincide" with the Utah SGMAs. Utah DEIS at 1-3. This is used to justify a management approach that is just based on PHMAs and which eliminates GHMAs. But if Figure 1-1 in the Utah DEIS ("Utah Planning/Habitat Areas, Surface Management and Sub-Surface Estate") is compared with the map of SGMAs in the Conservation Plan for Greater Sage-Grouse in Utah, it is clear that eliminating GHMA will throw away many habitat connectivity options. In particular, eliminating GHMAs will throw away the connections that the current GHMAs provide between the Uintah, Strawberry, and Carbon SGMAs. Links between the Strawberry and Rich-Morgan Summit SGMAs will also be lost. The links between the Carbon and Sheeprock Mountains SGMAs will be abandoned. See Exhibits 2 and 3 (presenting maps showing the GHMAs and SGMAs). Even if there are few leks in some of these GHMAs, or they are not managed by BLM because they are on Indian lands, or they already have a significant level of oil and gas development (such as is the case in some areas of the Uintah Basin), the value of these areas for sage-grouse conservation cannot be dismissed. If nothing else, even if there are currently limits on their value, the potential for these areas to contribute to sage-grouse conservation must be considered before they are eliminated from the Utah sage-grouse conservation plan. The Utah DEIS makes these points about the values that can attend habitats such as those found in GHMAs: Greater Sage-Grouse use multiple areas to meet seasonal habitat needs throughout the year and the resulting mosaic of habitats (e.g., winter, breeding, nesting, early brood-rearing, late brood-rearing, transitional, and movement corridor habitats) can encompass large areas. Broad habitat maps increase the likelihood that all seasonal habitats (including transition and movement corridors) are included. While areas of non-habitat, in and of themselves, may not provide direct habitat value for Greater Sage-Grouse (e.g., canyons, water bodies, and human disturbances), these areas may be crossed by birds when moving between seasonal habitats. Therefore, these habitat management areas are not strictly about managing habitat but are about providing those large landscapes that are necessary to meet the life-stage requirements for Greater Sage-Grouse. These areas will include areas that do not meet the habitat requirements described in the Seasonal Habitat Objectives table in the 2015 Final EIS. These areas meet Greater Sage-Grouse habitat needs by maintaining large, contiguous expanses of relatively intact sagebrush vegetation community. Utah DEIS at 2-4. It is clear the habitat linkages to PHMA that are provided by GHMA must be maintained. "Greater Sage-Grouse require large landscapes of contiguous sagebrush habitat to carry out their life-cycle. Securing these large landscapes from further degradation and adding more habitat through restoration is the primary conservation action for Greater Sage-Grouse." Utah DEIS at 1-2. Reviewing the new U.S. Geological Survey report on new science regarding sage-grouse that has been garnered since the 2015 plans were put in place, BLM said the report shows "[t]his understanding emphasizes the importance of maintaining connectivity between populations to ensure genetic diversity and distribution . . ." Id. at 3-3. And even where sagebrush habitats providing sage-grouse habitats may not be present, these areas encompass seasonal habitats and transition zones for sage-grouse and they may "may provide dispersal options or seasonal migration opportunities." Id. at 3-11. And they "may still provide important contributions to the mid-and fine-scale habitat levels for large, intact areas that are needed to support Greater Sage-Grouse populations." Id. at 3-12. Scientists recognize the need to maintain GHMAs. There is a need to manage sagebrush habitats holistically and collectively and "all sage-grouse habitats regardless of designation [should] remain an integral component of that management approach." Exhibit 4. "Amendments proposed to the LUPs reducing or eliminating management options in designated habitats-particularly proposed amendments in GHMA-limit the ability of agencies to manage at scales necessary to maintain these connections." Id. And even the Utah sage-grouse plan recognizes the need for management beyond just SGMAs. The Management Protocol in the State of Utah's Conservation Plan for Greater Sage-Grouse in Utah, 2013 states, "[a]reas identified as habitat on federal and state lands should be managed to avoid surface disturbance to the greatest degree possible." Conservation Plan for Greater Sage-Grouse in Utah at 21. Moreover, the FWS 2015 Sage-grouse Listing Decision states, The designation as GHMAs provide sage-grouse conservation by protecting habitat and connectivity between populations and potential refugia in the event of catastrophic events such as wildfire. While the amelioration of threats in GHMAs will likely be less than in PHMAs due to less stringent required conservation measures, GHMAs do have restrictions that benefit sagegrouse conservation. 80 Fed. Reg. at 59878. It is important to ensure that seasonal habitats not included in priority areas receive some protection, and to allow for expansion of recovering populations into newly restored areas. In addition, general habitat can serve as a location for compensatory mitigation offsets and restoring degraded habitat. For areas constituting such a small percentage of Utah's land base, it makes no sense to skimp on protections that could both prevent further reductions in Utah's sage-grouse populations and avoid imposing additional burdens on neighboring states where GHMA protection will still be required-the states of Nevada, Idaho, Colorado, and Wyoming, all of which border Utah. Do a better job of protecting Priority Habitat Management Areas by reducing oil/gas development impacts. New development should be prioritized outside these important population areas and strong buffers maintained around sage-grouse leks. To comply with FLPMA and the purpose and need statement, the BLM must remove GHMA management, and management of other habitats (surface or subsurface areas in Anthro and Tavaputs) since these areas are outside of the State's SGMAs, and revert management to pre-2015 LUPA. Under FLPMA, the BLM is to be consistent with the state's plans, policies, and programs. However, in the 2015 LUPA, the BLM failed to achieve or work towards consistency, and instead, elected to designate hundreds of thousands of acres of non-habitat, or fragmented and poor-quality habitat, outside of SGMAs, as "habitat." Such illegal actions have caused ongoing conflicts between the State, BLM, and local governments within the State. The BLM needs to remove 2015 LUPA management from all areas located outside of PHMA, unless such areas are managed as habitat within SGMAs by the State. Please ensure the BLM has properly removed 2015 LUPA management restrictions from all BLM lands located outside of PHMA. Further, the State has received comments from state agencies, local governments, and stakeholders who are concerned with the BLM's approach to sage-grouse mitigation requirements in "occupied habitat" outside of PHMA. MA-SSS-6 notes that: "Outside of PHMA, provide that acres of occupied Greater Sage-Grouse habitat lost to habitat degradation actions . are replaced by creating/improving Greater Sage-Grouse habitat within PHMA "39 The State's plan does not foresee requiring or utilizing mitigation outside of the State's mapped SGMAs. To bring this Section consistent with the State's Conservation Plan, the BLM should say Outside of PHMA, but within occupied habitat within the State's mapped SGMAs, provide that acres of occupied Greater Sage-Grouse habitat lost to habitat degradation actions . . are replaced by creating/improving Greater Sage-Grouse habitat within PI-IMA. The Draft EIS proposes eliminating SFAs and GHMAs, in addition to diminishing the protections that were established for PHMAs. SFA, GHMA and PHMA straddles the borders of Nevada, Idaho, Wyoming and Colorado. The ROD for the 2015 ARMPA emphasizes the importance of SFAs and GHMAs to maintaining the integrity of the PHMA and connectivity to other populations. It also notes these protections were created to support conservation measures for the greater sage-grouse and its habitat not just at a local-level, but on a landscape-level scale. The Draft EIS does not assess how these proposed amendments in Utah may impact populations in nearby states. Given greater sage-grouse populations cross state boundaries and because there are seven BLM state offices revising their plans, we recommend the Final EIS include a cumulative, cross-boundary effects analysis to assess the combined effects to greater sage-grouse populations and habitats associated with the revisions. Specifically, we recommend the cumulative effects consider current greater sage-grouse population conditions and trends compared against the expected effects of current management practices. 2.4.10 Exceptions/Variances from Non-Fluid Mineral Sage-Grouse Restrictions * Close loopholes and remove exceptions. The plans contain many new provisions that serve as loopholes and exceptions to habitat protections. We need certainty that crucial habitat will be protected to ensure the species thrives into the future. Considering Exceptions to Greater Sage-Grouse Restrictions in PHMA The BLM'S additions to MA-SSS-I which explains the PI-IMA "objectives and management actions apply to ecological sites that currently provide greater sage-grouse habitat within the respective PHMA polygons, as well as areas with ecological potential for greater sage-grouse habitat that have not crossed an ecological threshold to a different stable non-greater sage-grouse habitat vegetation community" is appreciated. Although the BLM in the next paragraph identifies a few potential scenarios for when an area within PI-IMA have crossed an ecological threshold where they no longer provide sage-grouse habitat (e.g., monoculture cheat grass, pinyon/juniper woodland), the BLM may want to discuss what factors the BLM will utilize to identify whether or not the sage-grouse habitat has crossed an ecological threshold. Further, the BLM may need some discussion and inclusion of literature identifying when an ecological threshold has been crossed, including literature discussing state and transition models that identify when thresholds have been crossed and what constitutes a stable or non-stable ecological site. 2.4.11 Prioritization of Mineral Leasing Further, the removal of lease prioritization objective will ensure the BLM's Alternative is more in line with the State's Conservation Plan. Generally, the State encourages development of oil, gas and minerals outside of occupied sage-grouse habitat within Sage-grouse Management Areas, if feasible for the project proponent. However, the State also realizes that, at times, smart project planning, including co-location or reasonable management stipulations, together with mitigation, may result in an overall increase in the amount and quality of habitat for sage-grouse. For example, the State has been working with project proponents throughout the State to modify development plans, or to set aside funding for habitat restoration projects, that would result in four acres of habitat being restored for everyone acre of habitat disturbed. This general approach of removing the lease prioritization will allow the BLM, the State and project proponents to discuss conservation measures to avoid, minimize, and compensate for impacts to sage-grouse, if a lease is purchased, and if the lease holder fulfills all necessary conditions to explore and develop leased lands. Finally, the myriad of protections already contained in the Alternative and the State Conservation Plan, preclude the necessity for avoiding leases within PHMA. If the BLM fulfills its duty under FLPMA, the Mineral Leasing Act, and the Federal Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing Reform Act of 1987, and uses the protections in this Alternative and the State Conservation Plan, then the BLM can lease lands within PHMA, avoid and minimize impacts to sage-grouse while improving the overall condition of sage-grouse habitat. Instead of amending the plans by weakening protections, pointedly prioritizing oil and gas development over protected species, BLM should focus on engaging communities in the decisions necessary to implement the plans as they are. Give the plans a chance to work. The recently issues Instruction Memoranda generally retreat from the protections set out in previous guidance to field staff in 2016. The first IM, issued in December 2017, reverses existing policy, directing BLM field offices to prioritize oil and natural gas leasing and drilling projects outside of the most sensitive sage grouse habitat. Instead, it states that BLM "does not need to lease and develop outside of [grouse] habitat management areas before considering any leasing and development within [grouse] habitat." The second IM, issued in January 2018, eliminates requirements for public notice and comment "when conditions worsen and there is a need for action" under adaptive management provisions in the grouse plans. It also shortens the public protest period for oil and gas lease sale parcels to 10 days from 30 days Under the No-Action Alternative, the Bureau would prioritize oil and gas leasing outside of the PHMAs and GHMAs. This would allow designed habitat areas to be off limits to the harmful impacts of mineral development. The Bureau's Preferred Management Alignment Alternative does the exact opposite. The Preferred Alternative no longer prioritizes oil and gas leasing outside the PHMAs or GHMAs. Under this alternative, mineral development would be able to invade these protected areas and in turn expose the Greater Sage-Grouse and its habitat to the harmful effects. We believe prioritization should be restored in accordance with conservational alternative to preserve the Greater Sage-Grouse. The prioritization requirement would be retained, unchanged, in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Oregon. Only in Wyoming might there be limited changes, but not a wholesale revocation (the prioritization requirement would be changed to only apply in PHMAs, not in GHMAs). Again, this raises issues about whether the "rangewide" conservation program that was a hallmark of the 2015 plans will continue as the basis for sage-grouse conservation. Prioritizing oil and gas leasing outside of sage-grouse habitats was a central feature in all of the 2015 plans, and now BLM is planning to abandon this pillar in Utah. Under this plan, it seems impossible for BLM to create a management strategy "that best meets the needs of the resources and values in this area under the BLM multiple use and sustained yield mandate." Utah DEIS at Dear Reader Letter. The 2015 plans are clear as to the need for prioritizing oil and gas leasing and drilling outside sage-grouse habitat and its meaning. For example, the Rocky Mountain Record of Decision (p. 1-25) states: . . . the ARMPs and ARMPAs prioritize oil and gas leasing and development outside of identified PHMAs and GHMAs. This is to further limit future surface disturbance and encourage new development in areas that would not conflict with GRSG. This objective is intended to guide development to lower conflict areas and as such protect important habitat and reduce the time and cost associated with oil and gas leasing development by avoiding sensitive areas, reducing the complexity of environmental review and analysis of potential impacts on sensitive species, and decreasing the need for compensatory mitigation. The Rocky Mountain ROD also identifies prioritizing oil and gas leasing and development outside sage-grouse habitat as a "key component" and a "key management response" (pp. 1-18 -1-19). In Utah, BLM is to "[p]rioritize the leasing and development of fluid mineral resources outside of GRSG habitat." Utah Greater Sage-Grouse ARMPA at 1-11. Prioritization cannot be based solely on whether BLM has sufficient resources to process leasing nominations or applications for permits to drill in sage-grouse habitat. Rather, there must be a thorough consideration of opportunities to protect habitat. We have these recommendations for how BLM should change its plans relative to prioritization with respect to the oil and gas leasing process, the oil and gas development process, and the application for permit to drill process. 1. Leasing BLM has used specific factors to guide prioritization of leasing outside sage-grouse habitat. For instance, in assessing the December 2017 lease sale for the Vernal Field Office, https://eplanning.blm.gov/epl-front-office/projects/nepa/80165/130450/158729/Final_Vernal_EA.pdf, BLM created a chart evaluating how certain prioritization considerations applied to parcels (existing lease, existing unit, field-EIS, high gas potential, high oil potential), completed site visits to confirm conditions on the ground, and then only included parcels in the lease sale that met the majority of the criteria. We propose that the BLM use the following criteria to prioritize oil and gas leasing outside of sage-grouse habitats: * Intactness/quality of habitat -classification of habitat (i.e., priority, important, general); quality of habitat; importance for connectivity or seasonal habitat. * Population trends in applicable zone or biologically significant unit. * Distance from existing disturbance. * Distance from existing infrastructure -roads, well pads, pipelines. * Need for additional infrastructure -estimated surface disturbance. * Adjacent to existing lease yes/no/proximity. * Within existing oil and gas unit. * Within existing master leasing plan. * Oil potential -none, low, moderate, high. * Natural gas potential -none, low, moderate, high. BLM will conduct site visits to confirm conclusions, as needed. Decisions to include nominated lease parcels in sage-grouse habitat in lease sales will be based on the following evaluation of criteria: * Parcels that do not have moderate or high potential should not be offered. * Parcels that have high quality habitat, are not in proximity to existing disturbance, and/or require additional infrastructure to be developed should not be offered. * Parcels that are in close proximity to existing disturbance and infrastructure, and are already within an existing oil and gas unit or master leasing plan that has been analyzed in an EIS may be considered for leasing. * Parcels outside priority habitat should be considered for leasing prior to parcels in PHMA. 2. Development BLM will prioritize development outside sage-grouse habitat by considering the following factors: * Intactness/quality of habitat -classification of habitat (i.e., priority, important, general); quality of habitat; importance for connectivity or seasonal habitat. * Population trends in applicable zone or biologically significant unit. * Distance from a lek. * Need for new infrastructure estimated surface disturbance. * Ability to use existing well pad and infrastructure. * Oil potential none, low, moderate, high. * Natural gas potential -none, low, moderate, high. These factors will apply to both exploratory and other types of development activities. BLM will conduct site visits to confirm conclusions, as needed. 3. Applications for Permit to Drill Decisions to approve applications for permits to drill in sage-grouse habitat will be based on the following evaluation of criteria: * Where applications for permits to drill are in high quality/intact habitat, are not in proximity to existing disturbance, and/or require additional infrastructure to be developed, they will not be prioritized and opportunities will be evaluated to relocate permits. * Where applications for permits to drill are not in areas with high or moderate potential, they will not be prioritized. * Where applications for permits to drill are able to use existing well pads and infrastructure and otherwise avoid surface disturbance and noise impacts to leks, they are more suitable for processing and approval. * Applications for permits to drill outside priority habitat should be considered for approval prior to parcels in PHMA. 2.4.12 Land Disposal and Exchanges Page 4-19: Section 4.6. l. Impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse. Land Disposal and Exchanges. In the final sentence of this subsection, it states that GRSG populations could be adversely affected to a greater degree with the removal of GHMA protections. Following that statement, Duchesne County suggests that the BLM restate the facts and statistics associated with the predominate GRSG habitat, leks and populations being within PHMA and such areas are not subject to disposal or exchange in the proposed amendments. It can be difficult under the standards proposed by BLM to determine if land disposal "will compromise" sage-grouse persistence, or have "no direct or indirect impact" on populations.145 Retaining habitat in federal ownership helps ensure the land will be managed as prescribed in the BLM land use plans, providing certainty. It also will promote connectivity of sage-grouse populations.146 States have not committed to all the same management and approaches as BLM. Moreover, in some cases, such as state trust lands, they are required to manage the lands to maximize revenues, which is likely inconsistent with conserving sage-grouse habitat. 2.4.13 Burial of Transmission Lines The Bureau would have been required to bury transmission lines unless "not technically feasible" under the No-Action Alternative. Greater Sage-Grouse instinctively steer away from tall structures; it is an innate characteristic of the species. When tall structures, like above transmission lines, are places in its habitat, this interferes with the way species normally functions and causes distress. Unfortunately, the Preferred Management Alignment Alternative allows the possibility for transmission line structures to be placed in amongst sagebrush lands and interfere with the Greater Sage-Grouse populations in Utah. 4-20: 4.6. l . Impacts on Greater Sage-Grouse. Burial of Transmission Lines. Duchesne County commends the BLM for recognizing that there may be cases where burial of transmission lines may have more impact on GRSG habitat and populations than overhead lines. Such flexibility, which would allow local managers to evaluate site-scale impacts and minimize impacts at the project level, should be included in the final agency decision. 2.4.14 Habitat Management Area Boundaries Page 3 -1 Paragraph 3 The referenced changes to the landscape are locally and regionally significant. Those changes form a basis for increases in Sage grouse population and improvements to Sage grouse habitat. It appears duplicitous that BLM identifies priority management areas and then ignores improvements to those areas it identified in 2015. BLM needs to assure improvements that occurred since 2015 (and for a decade prior to that) are included in the assessment of Sage grouse habitat. There needs to be a system where the tens of thousands of acres that have been restored or improved are credited against disturbance. This is a specific element of Garfield County's Conservation and Recovery Plan that is more specific but not in conflict with NEPA and must be included in BLM's Sage grouse Conservation and Recovery Plan unless the BLM is specifically barred by law. BLM can provide opportunities through this EIS for those habitat improvements to be credited toward recovery or the improvements can be recognized in site-specific implementation analysis that will follow. But BLM cannot completely ignore them and simultaneously complying with FLPMA's consistency, cooperation and coordination requirements, CEQ regulations, or a reasonable objective evaluation. This inconsistency exists throughout the document and needs to be resolved. Furthermore Garfield County asserts the positive changes in Sage grouse habitat since 2015 are significant and important. Large portions of BLM's priority habitat management areas are a) not occupied and b) not suitable for occupancy by Sage grouse. Consequently the statistical value of the improved habitat is significantly increased when only occupied or suitable habitat is considered. The State of Utah, and Garfield County in particular, can argue Sage grouse populations and available habitat has significantly increased since 2015. We ask that this paragraph be rewritten to accurately reflect the successful efforts associated with Sage grouse recovery and conservation, including and especially on BLM lands in our area. 3-18: 3.11. Recreation. The last paragraph of this section highlights the need for habitat maps to be considered flexible to allow adaptation to conditions on the ground. The 2015 BLM plan amendments contained mapping that affected the status of recreation travel routes in well-known, historic off-road motorized recreation areas in the Five Mile Pass and Little Sahara sand dunes areas. We applaud the efforts of the BLM to correct this error with this plan amendment and encourage the BLM to recognize that large scale mapping has its limitations and should not preclude legitimate uses of the surface when sage grouse habitat does not truly exist where mapped. 2.4.15 Mitigation Mitigation You have requested public comment regarding "how the BLM should consider and implement mitigation with respect to the greater sage-grouse, including alternative approaches to requiring compensatory mitigation in BLM land-use plans." Mitigation does provide benefits to species whose habitat is impacted by development. When used as intended, mitigation is a tool that results first in avoidance of impacts to important habitats, then in minimization of unavoidable impacts. When compensatory mitigation is appropriately analyzed and applied as an option to offset residual impacts, there are increased opportunities for landowners to participate in programs intended to improve habitats. The full suite of mitigation options, including compensatory mitigation, must be available to conserve the habitat and populations necessary to avoid a future listing under the ESA. Whether compensatory mitigation strategies are addressed in BLM land-use plans, or through other mechanisms such as guidance or memorandums of understanding, the approach should not diminish opportunities for landowners to work with permitting entities and project proponents to improve greater sage-grouse conservation efforts. Further, the standard provides a broad list of activities, including avoiding, minimizing, or compensating for impacts by applying beneficial mitigation actions, all of which may improve habitat conditions. The State appreciates this standard, while reminding BLM that project proponents must only be required to, at a minimum, ensure that projects do not cause undue degradation to the landscape. The BLM's statement identifying efforts to coordinate with the State to develop a fully suppOlied Mitigation Strategy is suppOlied as such action will enhance cooperation and coordination between the State, the BLM, and project proponents. As of this letter, the State and BLM have not fully developed or implemented a Mitigation Strategy, although the BLM recently issued 1M No. 2018-093, addressing the BLM's policies for using off-site compensatory mitigation. When developing the Alternative, the State believed the BLM would work with the State on a project-by-project basis to implement the principles and strategies contained in the State's Compensatory Mitigation Program. The State of Utah's Compensatory Mitigation Program was established, in part, by the Utah Legislature under Utah Code 79-2501 et. seq., Utah Administrative Rule R634-3 (Compensatory Mitigation Program), and the policy in the 2013 State Plan. In Utah, compensatory mitigation is pmi of a three-step process for conserving sage-grouse habitat, while balancing responsible economic growth and development. Before an organization uses compensatory mitigation, it should take any necessary steps -in consultation with the DNR -to employ the Management Protocols identified in the 2013 State Plan. Modifying Mitigation Standards and Compensatory Mitigation The Net-Conservation Mitigation Standard has long been challenged by the State as being unlawful extension of BLM' s authority under FLPMA, ultra-vires, and a violation of NEP A since the concept was a last-minute addition to the 2015 LUPA. The Net Conservation Gain standard has also created confusion and resulted in arbitrary application and interpretation to determine how much conservation or mitigation must occur for a "netgain" to occur. The revised standard which requires the BLM to provide ensure mitigation that improves the condition of greater sage-grouse habitat, may still be subject to challenges under FLPMA. 2-32. However, this standard is easier to measure and account for actions Net Conservation Gain Must Be Abandoned The Coalition appreciates the BLM's admission that the Net Conservation Gain standard was not publicly reviewed and, therefore, fatally flawed as a component of the 2015 Plans. Id. The net conservation gain standard was one of the reasons that the Coalition filed its petition for review of the 2015 Plan. As the Coalition emphasized in its protest of the 2015 Plan and its scoping comments and cooperating agency materials, the BLM has no authority to require mitigation of public land users that exceeds the undue and unnecessary degradation standard in FLPMA. See 43 U.S.C. Quincy Bahr Sage-Grouse Project Coordinator August 2, 2018 Page 17 1782(b). Moreover, with new policies and directives, the BLM lacks any secondary authority to implement a "net benefit", "net gain", or other standard that improves sage-grouse habitat as a condition for a permit or lease. See BLM Instruction Memorandum 2018-093 (July 24, 2018); see also U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Mitigation Policy, 83 Fed. Reg. 36472 (July 30, 2018) ("In light of the change in national policy reflected in Executive Order 13783 and Secretary's Order 3349, the comments received by the Service, and concerns regarding the legal and policy implications of compensatory mitigation, particularly compensatory mitigation with a net conservation gain policy, the Service has concluded that it is no longer appropriate to retain references to or mandate a net conservation gain standard in the Service's overall mitigation planning goal within each document. Because the net conservation gain standard is so prevalent throughout the Mitigation Policy, the Service is implementing this conclusion by withdrawing the Mitigation Policy.") In Section 302 of FLPMA, Congress has spoken to the discrete issue of what standard may or may not be applied to federal land management. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984) ("In interpreting an agency's enabling or organic statute, we "employ[ ] traditional tools of statutory construction" to determine "whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue."). Aside from the wilderness study areas, FLPMA provides that public lands shall be managed to avoid "undue and unnecessary degradation." The courts have found FLPMA to inherently allow some degradation. See Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership v. Salazar, 661 F.3d 66, 76-78 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (FLPMA's unnecessary or undue degradation standard must be read in light of BLM's responsibility under FLPMA to ensure public lands are managed under multiple use and sustained yield.); Gardner v. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 638 F.3d 1217, 1222-1223 (9th Cir. 2011) (Section 1732(b) does not mandate BLM to adopt restrictions that would completely exclude off-road vehicle use in a specific area.). Requiring that any change in habitat be accompanied by additional action to improve habitat far exceeds BLM's authority under FLPMA or NEPA. Case law sets similar standards under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) changes to critical habitat. See also Butte Envtl. Council v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, 620 F.3d 936, 947-48 (9th Cir. 2010) (FWS's determination that critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act would be destroyed was thus not inconsistent with its finding of no 'adverse modification' because the project would affect only a very small percentage of each affected species' critical habitat); see also Rock Creek Alliance v. U.S. Forest Service, 703 F. Supp.2d 1152, 1198 (D. Mont. 2010) (adverse modification of critical habitat under ESA allowable if effects are fully discussed and affected area is relatively insignificant). If the courts allow modification to critical habitat without "net conservation gain" then certainly wildlife habitat management for sage grouse cannot require more. Interpreting FLPMA as giving BLM the authority to require Net Conservation Gain or any improvement at BLM's discretion makes the undue and unnecessary degradation standard in FLPMA meaningless. No court will allow such an interpretation when the law so clearly states public lands shall be managed for undue and unnecessary degradation. Quincy Bahr Sage-Grouse Project Coordinator August 2, 2018 Page 18 B. Policy to Improve the Status of Sensitive Species Does Not Override FLPMA Land Management Standard BLM cannot rely on Manual 6840's sensitive species habitat "improvement" provisions as authority to undercut the law's clear direction. See Manual 6840.1H2a(1) ("It is also in the interest of the public for the BLM to undertake conservation actions that improve the status of such species so that their Bureau sensitive recognition is no longer warranted." (Emphasis added)). The manual only refers to the status of the species as measured by a host of metrics and does not refer to any single factor (i.e. population, habitat, seasonal mortality). FLPMA sets the controlling standard for land management. And, federal law supersedes agency policy so BLM improvement of habitat and species numbers does not mean BLM can impose "improvement" policies over and above the undue and unnecessary degradation standard. Manual 6840 is an agency directive and enjoys little if any deference under established case law. Federal land agencies since 1984 have relied on the decision of Chevron v. Natural Res. Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837 (1984) to justify and defend any decisions. Over the past 15 years, the courts have significantly narrowed the scope of deference accorded to these agency directives. In U.S. v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 232 (2000), the Supreme Court held that agency policy in the form of a tariff letter enjoyed little if any deference. Just a few months ago, the Supreme Court set aside a regulation that contradicted the law in SAS Institute Inc. v. Iancu, 138 S.Ct. 1348 (2018) and signaled growing support to reverse Chevron. FLPMA clearly mandates undue and unnecessary degradation as the management standard outside of wilderness study areas. Any management of sensitive species to improve their status must conform to the letter of the law. From these principles, it is clear that the DEIS needs substantial revision. The 2018 DEIS states that a project proponent would "[r]eplace occupied habitat developed outside PHMA by improving habitat in PHMA." DEIS at 2-7. Aside from the fact that the BLM never had, and most recently, has explicitly disclaimed any authority to require improvement of sage-grouse habitat, this provision would burden non-habitat with excessive impacts by removing forage for wildlife and livestock without any corresponding analysis of those impacts. As written, the Alignment Alternative increases development opportunities in non-PHMA while prioritizing mitigation efforts in PHMA without disclosing the secondary effects of that prioritization to livestock permittees or wildlife habitat or other development, such as transmission lines, mineral development, solar facilities or mine operations. Good mitigation policy and practice is one of the best opportunities to achieve sustainable development and conservation goals. Where impacts cannot be avoided or minimized, well-designed compensatory mitigation programs can achieve the multiple-use, sustained yield objectives. Do not strip the fundamental mitigation goal of "net conservation gain" from the plans. A no net loss of habitat merely prevents additional habitat loss and is not adequate to achieve long-term conservation of sage-grouse. Priority habitat for sage grouse can be developed on other Federal lands. Mitigation measures can be associated with drilling to develop more priority habitat at these other locations when exploration and mining of non-energy minerals is necessary. The following methods of mitigation were successfully implemented with drilling in priority habitat areas (occupied areas identified as "Winter" and "Brood Rearing" habitat) on Diamond Mountain: A. Avoid drilling during strutting (Breeding season is April June) B. Phase drilling – begin in areas with minimal impact potential C. Avoid wet meadow areas where greater sage-grouse tend to nest D. Locate drill sites with minimal sagebrush E. Locate drill pads near existing roads to minimize the need for new roads F. Reclaim pads with a seed mix beneficial to greater sage-grouse Under the No-Action Alternative, projects must provide a net conservation gain for Greater Sage-Grouse. This alternative would ensure that all efforts create population growth for the Greater Sage-Grouse. But the Preferred Management Alignment Alternative does not ensure the same. The Preferred Management Alignment Alternative says that projects must improve the condition of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat. This alternative says the Bureau must improve the habitat but not improve Greater Sage-Grouse populations. The alternative does not ensure the Bureau is required to maintain the Greater Sage-Grouse population. A net conservation gain promotes a sustainable population and consulting the conservative checklist to further develop the Mitigation Standard can only benefit grouse conservation efforts. Maintain a strong "net conservation gain" standard. Sage-grouse habitat is largely found on federally-managed public lands, and in order to offset development and properly manage these lands, the BLM must have a strong science-based plan that includes this standard so as to give the species a chance at long-term recovery. A no net loss of habitat merely prevents additional habitat loss and is not adequate to achieve long-term conservation of sage-grouse. Maintain or strengthen the mitigation policy. Good policy and practice is one of the best opportunities to achieve sustainable development and conservation goals. Where impacts cannot be avoided or minimized, well-designed compensatory mitigation programs can achieve the multiple-use, sustained yield objectives. Reduce manageable impacts in sage-grouse habitat. Some threats to sage-grouse are difficult to manage, such as wildfire and invasive species. The federal conservation strategy should compensate for those impacts by emphasizing management of land uses that we can control, such as livestock grazing, which contributes to unnatural fire and the spread of invasive species. BLM has ample authority to apply the entire mitigation hierarchy, including requiring compensatory mitigation. The 2015 Utah sage-grouse conservation plan provides that mitigation must provide for a "net conservation gain" to the species. Utah DEIS at 2-32. BLM must account for any uncertainty attendant to the mitigation and it will apply the avoid, minimize and then, last, compensate mitigation hierarchy. Id. at 2-33. BLM now proposes to eliminate the net conservation gain standard. It would apply mitigation only to PHMA and "manage activities that result in habitat loss and degradation to improve the condition of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat." Id. at 2-32. BLM would develop a Mitigation Strategy with the state of Utah, which would be based on the state mitigation approach. Id. at 2-33. The BLM has invited comment on these provisions stating, At the request of the State, the Management Alignment Alternative in this Draft RMPA/EIS proposes a change to compensatory mitigation by modifying the net conservation gain standard that the BLM incorporated into its plans in 2015. The DOI and the BLM have also modified their mitigation policies since the 2015 plans were finalized. The public did not have the opportunity to comment specifically on a net conservation gain approach to compensatory mitigation during the 2015 land use planning process. In addition, the DOI and the BLM are evaluating whether the implementation of a compensatory mitigation standard on public lands is appropriate and consistent with applicable legal authorities. We request public comment about how the BLM should consider and implement mitigation with respect to the Greater SageGrouse, including alternative approaches to requiring compensatory mitigation in BLM land use plans. Id. at ES-8, 2-5, and 2-41. Even if net conservation gain is not continued as the standard, at a minimum the BLM should maintain a "no net loss" mitigation standard. This can be achieved if BLM applies the avoid, minimize, then compensate mitigation hierarchy. BLM's mitigation policies must allow for more than a 1:1 ratio of compensation due to the uncertainty of some mitigation measures. It is crucial that this be a matter of federal policy not just state policy. State plans need to meet this minimum standard and they cannot transfer full authority from the BLM to the state. Key science-based mitigation principles must be maintained that engage stakeholders, with additional assurances maintained that compensatory mitigation is durable and additional, as has been recognized as necessary for effective mitigation programs. To the extent BLM relies on the State of Utah's sage-grouse mitigation policy, it must ensure that the resulting standards ensure it has the authority to incorporate, implement, and enforce state sage-grouse mitigation programs that meet a recognized set of principles. We recommend that these principles should be consistent with those laid out by The Nature Conservancy in its 2015 report, Achieving Conservation and Development: Applying the Mitigation Hierarchy. In addition, we support compensatory mitigation programs that seek to achieve a "reasonable relationship" between impacts and compensatory mitigation and adequately account for habitat quality, temporal losses, and risk of project failure. The amount and type of compensatory mitigation should be proportional to, and have a reasonable relationship to, direct and indirect impacts. It has recently been argued by several states that BLM may only use compensatory mitigation to prevent "unnecessary or undue degradation". Under this view, where the impacts of a proposed activity have not been demonstrated to rise to the level of "unnecessary or undue degradation," any authorization of that activity which requires either net benefit or no net loss for the actual impacts would violate FLPMA. The unnecessary or undue degradation standard, however, is just a minimum standard for BLM's land management policy; it does not restrain BLM's discretion to adopt or require mitigation in circumstances that do not rise to the level of "undue or unnecessary degradation" or to implement a higher mitigation standard. As explained above, BLM has numerous authorities supporting its use of mitigation more generally, including the policies and principles underlying FLPMA, the foundational multiple use, sustained yield standard, the authority to promulgate regulations, and the specific authorities applicable to land use plans and project-specific authorizations. Both FLPMA and the case law thus establish that BLM has ample discretion to go beyond the prevention of unnecessary or undue degradation to seek compensatory mitigation that will meet "the long-term needs of future generations for renewable and non-renewable resources, including, but not limited to, . . . wildlife and . . . natural scenic, scientific and historical values." 43 U.S.C. § 1702(c). None of these authorities distinguish between avoidance, minimization, and compensatory mitigation or prohibit or circumscribe compensatory mitigation; rather, the authorities are broad and support the use of each aspect of mitigation in appropriate circumstances. Given BLM's broad authority to adopt and impose mitigation to protect sage-grouse, at a minimum, BLM certainly can act to adopt, implement and enforce the state mitigation programs for use on federal land. In doing so, it is critical to ensure that the state mitigation programs employed by BLM follow commonly recognized principles, such as those laid out by The Nature Conservancy in its 2015 report, Achieving Conservation and Development: Applying the Mitigation Hierarchy (2015 TNC Report). These principles include: application of the mitigation hierarchy in a landscape context; policy goals that support conservation and drive accountability; inclusion of stakeholder engagement practices; long-term, durable options; additionality, equivalence, and protection against temporal losses. it is not clear how BLM would be able to adopt and enforce state mitigation plans, such as the Utah plan, as part of this sage-grouse management plan, even if they meet requirements for an acceptable compensatory mitigation program. Therefore, in addition to completing the necessary supplemental NEPA to evaluate the impacts of the new guidance on the Utah Plan, as discussed below, BLM must also clarify how the IM permits it to continue to uphold its commitment to the states in terms of applying state mitigation plans. "Substantial changes" to the Management Alignment Alternative required by IM 2018-043 must be evaluated in a supplemental EIS. BLM must prepare a supplemental EIS to evaluate the impacts of Instruction Memorandum (IM) 2018-093, which prohibits BLM from requiring compensatory mitigation. Supplemental EISs are required for "substantial changes in the proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns" or "significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts." 40 C.F.R. § 1502.9(c)(1)(i), (ii). Because IM 2018-093 is a paradigm shift on mitigation and eliminates one of the pillars upon which the 2015 Sage-grouse Plans and the "not warranted" determination stand, BLM must now prepare a supplemental EIS. In evaluating i99acts on the Utah Draft EIS, IM 2018-093 requires "substantial changes" to the proposed action that must be thoroughly evaluated in a supplemental EIS. While BLM proposes to remove the "net conservation gain" standard in the Management Alignment Alternative, it maintains requirements for compensatory mitigation and relies on it. For example, the Utah Draft EIS provides for exceptions from the surface disturbance cap based on compensatory mitigation: . . . the 3 percent cap may be exceeded at either scale if a technical team determines that site-specific Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and population information, combined with project design elements (siting, minimization measures, and compensatory mitigation) indicates the project will improve the condition of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat within the proposed project analysis area. Utah DEIS, p. 2-10. Similarly, in discussing the environmental effects of the proposed changes to the existing plan, the Draft EIS states: . . . the Management Alignment Alternative builds flexibility into the analysis by allowing exceedances of caps if certain condition are met. For example, if site-specific information (e.g., habitat condition, Greater Sage-Grouse use of the area) combined with project design information (i.e., project siting, minimization measures, and compensatory mitigation) indicate the project will improve the condition of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat, the caps can be exceeded" Utah DEIS, p. 4-15. Because IM 2018-093 prohibits BLM from "imposing" compensatory mitigation through "environmental impact statements" and "resource management plans," BLM is arguably obligated to delete these proposed actions from the EIS. These changes are neither "minor" nor "qualitatively within the spectrum of alternatives" evaluated in the Draft EIS. See Council on Environmental Quality, 40 Most Questions Asked Questions Concerning CEQ's NEPA Regulations at 22, available at https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/G-CEQ-40Questions.pdf. They go to the very heart of the conservation strategy set forth in the ARMPAs and ratified by the "not warranted" determination. See, e.g., 80 Fed. Reg. at 59,881 ("Requiring mitigation for residual impacts provides additional certainty that, while impacts will continue at reduced levels on Federal lands, those impacts will be offset to a net conservation gain standard."). Additionally, IM 2018-093 represents the very sort of "significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts" that demand further analysis. The Draft EIS incorporates compensatory mitigation into the Management Alignment Alternative, and the only other alternative evaluated -the no-action -would retain the current version of the Utah ARMPA, which contains the net conservation gain standard and compensatory mitigation. Thus, the Draft EIS neither envisions nor evaluates eliminating entirely compensatory mitigation. Further, to the extent that BLM could rely on the range of alternatives originally evaluated for the 2015 Utah ARMPA (which it cannot, as discussed above), those alternatives are of no help. None of those alternatives disclaimed the authority to impose "compensatory mitigation" as a means of offsetting unavoidable impacts on sage-grouse. In fact, compensatory mitigation and the net conservation gain standard were incorporated into all alternatives: "If impacts from BLM management actions and authorized third-party actions that result in habitat loss and degradation remain after applying avoidance and minimization measures (i.e., residual impacts), then compensatory mitigation projects will be used to provide a net conservation gain to the species." Utah ARMPA, Appendix F. In conclusion, IM 2018-093 requires "substantial changes" to the Draft EIS's Management Alignment Alternative that are not evaluated in the Draft EIS or the 2015 Utah ARMPA. Accordingly, BLM must now prepare a supplemental EIS to evaluate the new prohibition on compensatory mitigation. Development on existing leases should be managed under current regulations, which limit surface occupancy and disturbance. Years of research leave no doubt that sage-grouse do not do well in close proximity to energy development. Improve plan monitoring and oversight, including providing training to field staff and the necessary incentives to ensure proper implementation. The plans should contain metrics by which conservation success can be measured. Conservation metrics will help in effective management of the habitat and reduce wasting personnel time and limited funds. The plans contain many new provisions that serve as loopholes and exceptions to habitat protections. We need certainty that crucial habitat will be protected to ensure the species thrives into the future. The State and BLM must meet prior to finalizing this EIS to identify the proper Mitigation Strategy moving forward, in-light of 1M No. 2018-093. At a minimum, the State believes the BLM's action should be consistent with, and not oppose those, being implemented by the State. To ensure alignment, the BLM should state: the Mitigation Strategy will be consistent with the State's Compensatory Mitigation Rule and Conservation Plan. Working with the State to implement the proper mitigation strategy will ensure that sage-grouse habitat be managed in a manner to ensure the protection of ecological and environmental values, preservation and protection of certain public lands in their natural condition, and provision of food and habitat fr wildlifè and ensure that BLM "manage the public lands under principles of multiple use and sustained yield". By adopting principles in the State's Compensatory Mitigation Program, the BLM will ensure management of public lands...so that they are utilized in the combinations that will best meet the present and future needs of the American people. After developing the State Mitigation Strategy, the BLM and State should seek public comment on the Strategy prior to issuing a final EIS. The Preferred Alternative in the Draft EIS proposes to eliminate the "net gain compensatory mitigation standard," which results in a net conservation gain to the species, because it does not align with the state's mitigation program. The Draft EIS did not carry forward the mitigation strategy from the 2015 ARMPA -Appendix D. As a result, there are few details in the EIS about how mitigation would be implemented under the Proposed Action. For example, while the Draft EIS does state that projects must improve the condition of the greater sage-grouse habitat, it does not specify what is required under Utah's Compensatory Mitigation Rule and how it will apply to the RMPA. As a result, the Draft EIS does not assess whether the revised mitigation standard would result in a net conservation gain to the species. Mitigation is particularly important because the Proposed Action allows for development increases inside the former GHMA and allows for more exceptions to disturbance and density caps and NSO stipulations in the PHMA. The EPA recommends the Final EIS include the full revised compensatory mitigation strategy. 3.C. Compensatory Mitigation Compensatory mitigation requirements in PHMA habitat should be consistent with Secretarial Order 3360 "Rescinding Authorities Inconsistent with Secretary's Order 3349, 'American Energy Independence'". Any compensatory mitigation standard needs to be limited to PHMA, transparent, effective and statutorily-based. There is no rationale for applying a range-wide mitigation standard. The "net conservation gain" standard in the current plans are fundamentally inconsistent with the Secretary's Order and BLM's Congressional directives. Again, there is no "hard look" at what impact having no mitigation standard outside of priority habitat would actually have on the bird. It's all conjectural. Simplot previously commented that mitigation discussions need to consider a wide variety of opportunities including preservation (such as establishing conservation easements on private land), the establishment of mitigation banks, public-private partnerships, conservation plans, habitat restoration, noxious weed control, fence marking/removal, riparian restoration projects, prescribed fire (where appropriate), fuel breaks, green strips and payment in lieu. The definition of mitigation in the RMPA/EIS supports the incorporation of a wide range of mitigation actions: "Mitigation. Includes specific means, measures or practices that could reduce, avoid, or eliminate adverse impacts. Mitigation can include avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action, minimizing the impact by limiting the degree of magnitude of the action and its implementation, rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitation, or restoring the affected environment, reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action, and compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments." However, the RMPA/EIS currently does not provide clarification regarding the "amount" of mitigation required on federal land for disturbance in PHMA. This creates a serious legal issue with FLPMA as the law does not require eliminating all residual impacts; whereas the net gain or even a no net loss policy at the project level would run afoul of the agency's multiple-use and unnecessary or undue degradation standards. For example, on page 2-32, under the Modified Mitigation Standard (MASSS-3A), which previously referenced "net conservation gain" the RMPA identifies "improving sagegrouse habitat" in regard to the Management Alignment Alternative: "In PHMA, when undertaking BLM management actions, and, consistent with valid existing rights and applicable law, when authorizing third-party actions that result in habitat loss and degradation, the BLM will require and ensure mitigation that improves the condition of Greater Sage-Grouse habitat, including accounting for any uncertainty associated with the effectiveness of such mitigation. This will be achieved by avoiding, minimizing, or compensating for impacts by applying beneficial mitigation actions. Exceptions to this standard may be made for vegetation treatments to benefit Utah prairie dog." There is no additional information provided as to the amount of improvement required or where the improvement should occur (project level, BSU, PHMA statewide). As currently stated, "improve" is an ambiguous term that needs additional clarification. Additional language in the RMPA/EIS on page 2-33 states: "The BLM, in coordination with the State of Utah, will develop a Mitigation Strategy to guide the application of the mitigation approach and hierarchy. The Strategy should be based on the State-level Greater Sage-Grouse mitigation approach to the extent is it consistent with other agency regulations and policies." The State of Utah's Final Compensatory Mitigation Rule R634-4 (Rule) became effective on 4/1/18. In the Rule, the definition of actions required for compensatory mitigation are very narrow and are inconsistent with the range of mitigation actions identified in APPENDIX D MITIGATION STRATEGY: UTAH GREATER SAGEGROUSE LUPA. The State of Utah rule incorporates the mitigation requirement of providing four acres of functional, protected habitat or corridors for every one acre of permanent disturbance in Sage-Grouse habitat. This approach does not incorporate methods to quantitatively assess habitat function/quality as an alternative mitigation option. As outlined in Simplot's comments to the State of Utah in regards to the Proposed Compensatory Mitigation Rule, a simple 4:1 ratio is arbitrary, has no proportionate nexus to the impact, and ignores functional tools developed by other states to provide a scientifically defensible approach towards mitigation. Moreover, for valid existing rights imposing this mitigation ratio may raise constitutional issues. Requiring the 4:1 ratio in all SGMA's including non-habitat, in many instances will result in a much higher mitigation ratio than 4:1. With the revocation of Secretarial Order 3330, BLM guidance addressing the standard for net conservation gain is no longer valid. There is no basis provided in the definition of mitigation at 40 CFR 1508.20 to include a "net conservation gain" or require an "improvement" in regards to mitigation. FLPMA does not authorize BLM to require compensatory mitigation that goes beyond the impacts that result from third party activities conducted on federal lands. This concern is further supported by the statement on page 2-5 of the RMPA/EIS: "In addition, the DOI and the BLM are evaluating whether the implementation of a compensatory mitigation standard on public lands is appropriate and consistent with applicable legal authorities". Simplot does not support the incorporation of an arbitrary 4:1 mitigation ratio on federal land. Simplot supports the development of a Habitat Quantification Tool (HQT) or equivalent that accounts for all habitat characteristics or attributes that influence SageGrouse habitat selection across multiple scales to produce a habitat unit, generally functional acre, to be used to calculate debits associated with disturbances or credits associated with conservation. Where mitigation is driven by compensating for habitat debits (one habitat debit is equal to one habitat credit), the HQT provides for a quantitative tool that is based on best available science, rather than relying on arbitrary mitigation ratios. In the absence of an HQT, Simplot supports the inclusion of "no net loss" language as long as it's limited to priority habitat similar to that in the proposed Idaho Management Alignment Alternative to be incorporated at the appropriate population management unit level in coordination with the State. As previously stated, the Uintah Population Management Area is well below the recommended 3% percent BSU scale disturbance cap and the incorporation of a "no net loss" standard and other restrictions currently being applied to PHMA would ensure that disturbance would remain low at the BSU. There is currently no authority or guidance to require a "net conservation benefit" including "improvement" associated with mitigation under FLPMA or in BLM regulation. If compensatory mitigation is incorporated into the Final RMPA/EIS, the application of this tool needs to be statutorily-based and centered on actual on the ground threats to the species. The implementation of these standards needs to be clear and transparent to avoid the appearance that these standards are used to arbitrarily veto projects. Do not strip the fundamental "net conservation gain" standard. No net loss of habitat merely prevents additional habitat loss and is not adequate for long-term recovery. In the State, compensatory mitigation actions are measures that create, restore andlor protect functional habitat or habitat corridors to offset the impacts of unavoidable permanent disturbance to sage-grouse habitat. The State's program is voluntary in nature, unless required by regulatory agencies or action. In Utah, the State recommends that for everyone acre of functional sage-grouse habitat permanently disturbed by project proponents, four acres of functional habitats or corridors should be created, restored andlor preserved, as identified in the amended Utah Administrative Rule R634-3. Utah's compensatory mitigation ratio accounts for direct and indirect impacts that may result from permanent disturbance, differences in habitat quality and uncertainty related to mitigation success. This ratio reduces project costs by simplifying the analysis of these factors, while also ensuring effective conservation outcomes. The State and BLM must meet prior to finalizing this EIS to identify the proper Mitigation Strategy moving forward, in-light of 1M No. 2018-093. At a minimum, the State believes the BLM's action should be consistent with, and not oppose those, being implemented by the State. To ensure alignment, the BLM should state: the Mitigation Strategy will be consistent with the State's Compensatory Mitigation Rule and Conservation Plan. Working with the State to implement the proper mitigation strategy will ensure that sage-grouse habitat be managed in a manner to ensure the protection of ecological and environmental values, preservation and protection of celiain public lands in their natural condition, and provision of food and habitat for wildlife and ensure that BLM "manage the public lands under principles of multiple use and sustained yield". By adopting principles in the State's Compensatory Mitigation Program, the BLM will ensure management of public lands ... so that they are utilized in the combinations that will best meet the present and future needs of the American people. After developing the State Mitigation Strategy, the BLM and State should seek public comment on the Strategy prior to issuing a final EIS. 2.4.16 Lek Buffers LEK BUFFERS: ASSESS AND ADDRESS The DEIS attempts to clarify that lek buffers are not intended to preclude various uses and development, but rather, the buffers are the area where BLM will "assess and address" impacts to sage-grouse within those buffers. See MA -SSS-3H. Appendix B specifies that "[t]he [buffer] distances noted above are starting points, from which local information should be applied to determine if local variations in distances are necessary to address lek persistence." App. B at 1. Neither the body of the DEIS nor the Appendices define the actions it may take to "address" lek persistence or exactly how "lek persistence" will be measured. The BLM should work with the State of Utah to analyze the potential of further refining buffers using a unit-by-unit or habit-by-habitat approach based on Utah science while recognizing that there is no single distance that may be the appropriate buffer for all populations and habitats across the GRSG range. A more criteria driven process for utilizing justifiable departures when a lek buffer is increased or decreased that is developed in cooperation with the State is preferred by the Commenters. Finally, it may be helpful to review the management associated with the buffers by analyzing the question of whether or not buffers add anything in the presence of an allocation tied to the strict prescriptive requirements already required in PHMA. 2.4.17 Prioritization of Grazing Permits Regardless of the proper action of removing the decisions from the Alternative, the BLM may want to provide a clearer written statement better explaining the purpose of removing the above references decisions from the Alternative to ensure the action is supported by the Purpose and Need Statement. Changing Grazing Systems and Prioritization of Grazing Permits The BLM has aligned Objective SSS-4 and MA-VEG-l with addressing the threat of invasive annual grasslands to sage-grouse by adding the key term, invasive. This change will avoid misinterpretation by future land managers.49 Removing MA-LG-l is appreciated since the presence of sage-grouse should not and cannot be a determining factor into whether livestock grazing can occur in an area. 50 Removing MA-LG-2 and MA-LG-4 is also proper since the BLM should not arbitrarily base review of a permits and monitoring efforts based on whether or not a permit is found within a PHMA.51 Instead, priority should be based on other factors already laid out in BLM's land health and grazing regulations, policies and handbooks. The removal of MALG-5 is also proper since this is a guidance decision that does not and should not be included in a land use plan. The addition of the word "improper" when talking about livestock grazing is an important clarification in the Alternative. The 2015 Amendment falsely assumed and implied that proper livestock grazing could be a main reason for not achieving habitat objectives. The research in Utah, and throughout the west, has actually found that proper livestock grazing practices are key to helping develop and maintain successful habitat conditions. Fmther, the goal of the Alternative is not to punish livestock users, but to limit improper grazing practices that impact Land Health Standards. The addition of improper grazing, coupled with reminding the BLM to manage lands towards Land Health Standards, will ensure that permitees who practice proper livestock grazing techniques are not punished. Similarly, removal ofMALG-7, MA-LG-8, and MA-LG-9 are also planning and land health decisions that are already identified as practices in the BLM's land health standard and grazing policies, handbooks and decisions that do not belong in a land use plan. Removing MA-LG-12,14,15,17, and 18 from the Alternative is proper since, once again, the decisions are policy decisions already contained in other pOltions of the Alternative or other BLM policies, regulations, and handbooks. See 2-36,37. Whenever the NEP A is conducted for a vegetation treatment, range improvement project, or relinquishment of a permit, the BLM can, on a case-by-case basis, determine how to use a project or range improvement to conserve, enhance and restore habitats, especially when not all projects or range improvements will be located in occupied sage-grouse habitat. Regardless of the proper action of removing the decisions from the Alternative, the BLM may want to provide a clearer written statement better explaining the purpose of removing the above references decisions from the Alternative to ensure the action is supported by the Purpose and Need Statement. Changing Grazing Systems and Prioritization of Grazing Permits The BLM has aligned Objective SSS-4 and MA-VEG„I with addressing the threat of invasive annual grasslands to sage-grouse by adding the key term, invasive. This change will avoid misinterpretation by future land managers.49 Removing MA-LG-I is appreciated since the presence of sage-grouse should not and cannot be a determining factor into whether livestock grazing can occur in an area.50 Removing MA-LG-2 and MA-LG-4 is also proper since the BLM should not arbitrarily base review of a permits and monitoring efforts based on whether or not a permit is found within a PHMA. Instead, priority should be based on other factors already laid out in BLM's land health and grazing regulations, policies and handbooks. The removal of MALG-5 is also proper since this is a guidance decision that does not and should not be included in a land use plan.

Removing MA-LG-12,14,15,17, and 18 from the Alternative is proper since, once again, the decisions are policy decisions already contained in other portions of the Alternative or other BLM policies, regulations, and handbooks. See 2-36, 37. Whenever the NEPA is conducted for a vegetation treatment, range improvement project, or relinquishment of a permit, the BLM can, on a case-by-case basis, determine how to use a project or range improvement to conserve, enhance and restore habitats, especially when not all projects or range improvements will be located in occupied sage-grouse habitat. 2.4.18 Water Developments for Livestock Clarifying Management of Water Developments for Livestock The State believes the revisions to MALG-lO ensure the Alternative comports with State and Federal law. By removing the term, "new developments that divert surface water must be designed to maintain riparian or wet meadow vegetation and hydrology to meet Greater Sage-Grouse needs" the BLM is ensuring that management practices do not conflict with the beneficial use requirements of water in Utah.52 Further, he DEIS at page 2-37 appropriately addresses the removal of MA-LG-15 (aka "No similar action"), but omits to consider the removal of MA-LG-16, and only attempts to address MA-LG-I0, by modifying the wording to: In PHMA, limit authorization of new water developments to projects that have a neutral effect or are beneficial to Greater Sage-Grouse habitat (such as by shifting livestock use away from critical areas.)53 While this language is more appropriate than the No-Action Alternative, BLM should consider also removing MA-LG-16 and 10 in its entirety in the FEIS, and implement a proposed action in the ROD that adopts the recommendation. One of significant problems with the modified language in MA-LG-I0 is its use of the words "critical areas". Such words are not defined by the DEIS, and gives a potential of arbitrary application of such words to limit or eliminate any water development within a PHMA area. In the alternative, the FEIS should consider and the ROD should adopt the removal ofMA-LG-16, and further modify MA-LG-IO so as to say "In PHMA, allow authorization of new water developments that have a neutral effect or a beneficial effect to Greater Sage-Grouse habitat (such as by shifting livestock use away from critical areas, thereby limiting the intensity or duration of the scheduled livestock use around the critical area.) The LUPAs fail to recognize that many range improvements are associated with water rights owned or held by the permittee. LUPA needs to identify that existing rights will not be impaired or taken. Issue #5, Recommendation 12: Range improvements should not be prohibited per se in any GRSG habitat. Range improvements are a necessary range management tool. Issue 5: DEIS comments 8, 9, 10: The DEIS at page 2-37 appropriately addresses the removal of MA-LG-15 (aka "No similar action"), but omits to consider the removal of MA-LG-16, and only attempts to address, at page 2-26, MA-LG-10, by modifying the wording to: In PHMA, limit authorization of new water developments to projects that have a neutral effect or are beneficial to Greater Sage-Grouse habitat (such as by shifting livestock use away from critical areas.) While this language is more appropriate than the No-Action Alternative, BLM should consider also removing MA-LG-16 and 10 in its entirety in the FEIS, and implement a proposed action in the ROD that adopts the recommendation. One of significant problems with the modified language in MA-LG-10 is its use of the words "critical areas". Such words are not defined by the DEIS, and gives a potential of arbitrary application of such words to limit or eliminate any water development within a PHMA area. In the alternative, the FEIS should consider and the ROD should adopt the removal of MA-LG-16, and further modify MA-LG-10 so as to say "In PHMA, allow authorization of new water developments that have a neutral effect or a beneficial effect to Greater Sage-Grouse habitat (such as by shifting livestock use away from critical areas, thereby limiting the intensity or duration of the scheduled livestock use around the critical area.)" Rangeland health standards only require that significant progress is being made to achieve an applicable standard, like PFC; not that the standard be met. See 43 C.F.R. 4180.2(c). It is critical that any guidance language include "or, making significant progress towards" not just meeting PFC, as Section 4180.2(c) already requires. In addition, many "riparian areas" cannot make significant progress or cannot meet PFC with just grazing management, but require some artificial or mechanical means to restore an existing condition to allow the area any potential to achieve PFC. In addition, many other "riparian areas" cannot make significant progress or cannot meet PFC because they are subject, among other things: (1) to upstream activity beyond the management and control of the permittee and BLM; (2) to adjacent activity beyond the management or control of the permittee and/or BLM, like roads, recreational use, ATV use, etc.; (3) to livestock watering gaps or access points; (4) to normal or excess wild horse and burro use; or (5) to ditches and reservoirs authorized under pre-FLPMA Grants or FLPMA Rights-of-Way, wherein the purpose of the area is diverted for other, perhaps higher purposes, including, for example, municipal water supplies. The per se requirement to meet PFC is unwarranted and in many cases irrational. BLM should consider also removing MA-LG-16 and 10 in its entirety in the FEIS, and implement a proposed action in the ROD that adopts the recommendation. One of significant problems with the modified language in MA-LG-IO is its use of the words "critical areas". Such words are not defined by the DEIS, and gives a potential of arbitrary application of such words to limit or eliminate any water development within a PI-IMA area. In the alternative, the FEIS should consider and the ROD should adopt the removal of MA-LG-16, and further modify MA-LG-IO so as to say "In PHMA, allow authorization of new water developments that have a neutral effect or a beneficial effect to Greater Sage-Grouse habitat (such as by shifting livestock use away from critical areas, thereby limiting the intensity or duration of the scheduled livestock use around the critical area.) 2.4.19 Role of the States in Travel and Transportation Management Roads and Travel Management Clarifying the Role of the State of Utah and Counties with Respect to Travel Management Planning is greatly appreciated. 2-25. Though the BLM has clarified that it will coordinate with the State with regards to travel management, the State wants to ensure that State's and the counties' rights-of-ways, acquired through R.S. 2477 public use or other means, are preserved and remain open for public use regardless of any travel management decision unless the State or an individual county determines that a right-of-way should closed or the use on such a right-of-way be modified. Please include language expressly preserving the State's and each counties' ability to manage and maintain roads in open within PHMA since the State and counties within the State own certain right-of-ways arising out of years of public use and/or maintenance. 2.4.20 Range of Alternatives Page 2 -1 Alternatives. Garfield County finds no alternative that is completely consistent with Garfield County's Resource Management Plan and Sage grouse Conservation and Recovery Plan. Item 2b in the 40 Most Asked Questions Regarding NEPA requires that BLM analyze state and local plans even if they are inconsistent with federal law. We believe BLM has opportunities to comply with the County's Sage grouse Conservation and Recovery Plan during site-specific analysis and demand that BLM do so unless they modify this plan to include such analysis. Page 2 -2 Bullet Five. Garfield County asserts that alternative B is not wholly consistent with alternatives provided by the State of Utah or the Governor's Office. Evidence of the inconsistency is the fact that the State of Utah filed the lawsuit indicating BLM failed to fully consider their alternative. We suggest the first phrase say "Alternative E was similar to alternatives provided by the State of Utah." Page 2 -41 Section 2.6 Preferred Alternative Garfield County recognizes BLM's role in developing the preferred alternative. However, BLM has not developed any alternative that is consistent with Garfield County's Sage grouse Conservation and Recovery Plan, as required by law. Furthermore BLM has failed to adequately identify analyze and disclose inconsistencies and their efforts to resolve them. If, through the implementation phase, BLM's site-specific analysis will identify, analyze and disclose inconsistencies and will bring BLM's plan program and policy into consistency -to the maximum extent allowed by law with County plans, Garfield County does not object. However absent such inconsistencies are identified, analyzed and disclosed in this generalized plan, Garfield County asserts BLM has failed to analyze reasonable alternatives, failed to comply with FLPMA, failed to comply with CEQ regulations, and has created an indefensible document. We object. Page 2 -41 Section 2.6 Preferred Alternative Garfield County recognizes the mix and match concept and assumes the final product will be mixed and matched. There is nothing requiring BLM to select one entire alternative or the other, so it would make sense to identify the individual preferred elements from each of the alternatives that likely will be carried forward in the final decision. We strongly recommend and request that BLM evaluate each row of the alternative table and through shading, symbols or other reasonable method disclose the individual feature BLM prefers. We recognize this is somewhat innovative, but it will give the public and the cooperating agencies a much more realistic view of what the probable final decision will look like. Currently the DEIS has only two alternatives, a "No Action" alternative and the "Management Alignment Alternative." BLM should put forward a third alternative to respond to public scoping and DEIS comments. The Tenth Circuit has considered a situation identical to the path currently adopted by BLM in New Mexico ex rel. Richardson v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 565 F.3d 683, 709 (10th Cir. 2009). In that case, the BLM only considered two alternatives because a third more protective alternative did not meet the objective of the project. The Tenth Circuit held that the range of alternatives was unreasonable and set aside the BLM decision. To avoid the entire amendments being set aside, BLM needs to craft a reasonable third alternative, and allow the public to comment on the FEIS with the third alternative before signing the Record of Decision. The Coalition's scoping comments, incorporated by reference here, identify several possible changes to the Management Alignment Alternative that would fit the purpose and need of the 2018 Amendment and would also improve the analysis. For example, any prescription or limitation that is sourced in the NTT Report or the COT Report should be reconsidered due to the extensive scientific controversy regarding conclusions made in those reports and the methodological flaws within. Noise limitations and universal lek buffers are other examples where the standards adopted overshoot the data and published research. VII. THE FORCED TIMELINE HINDERS DOCUMENTATION THAT BLM IS TAKING A HARD LOOK AT IMPACTS The basic purpose of NEPA is to force a hard look at the impacts of the alternatives considered. Manygoats v. Kleppe, 558 F.2d 556, 560 (10th Cir. 1977) ("The thrust of NEPA is that all pertinent environmental data be gathered in one place, i. e., the "statement", there constituting a discussion of all relative environmental impacts of a proposed course or alternative courses of action which reflects that the agency has given all pertinent environmental matters a "hard look" and has made a "good faith, objective, and reasonable presentation of the subject areas mandated by NEPA . . ."). Truncating the amount of time the agency dedicates to the analytical component of the NEPA process, therefore, prevents a hard look and risks remand upon judicial review. The Coalition was given a single opportunity to review the administrative draft without any review of the final Administrative Draft EIS. Coalition members were not invited to participate as cooperating agency members at any time, and as of the date of this comment, the Coalition has no signed MOU with the BLM regarding this amendment. The clear reason for the failure to cooperate with the Coalition is the expedited timeline. The litigation currently pending in the Idaho and Montana federal courts to prevent land uses in PHMAs give BLM fair warning that all aspects of the FEIS must be defensive and durable. VIII. ADJUSTING PHMA AREAS AND DOCUMENTING REMOVAL OF SFAS Pursuant to FLPMA, the BLM must "develop, maintain, and when appropriate, revise land use plans" to ensure that land management be conducted "on the basis of multiple use and sustained yield." 43 U.S.C. §§ 1701(a)(7), 1712(a); see also Klamath Siskiyou Wildlands Center v. Boody, 468 BLM SHOULD CONSIDER A THIRD ALTERNATIVE In addition to the proposed agency action, every EIS must "[r]igorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives" to that action. 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14(a). "The existence of reasonable but unexamined alternatives renders an EIS inadequate." Friends of Southeast's Future v. Morrison, 153 F.3d 1059, 1065 (9th Cir.1998). The "heart of the environmental impact statement" are the alternatives proposed. 40 C.F.R. § 1502.14; Or. Natural Desert Ass'n v. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 531 F.3d 1114, 1121 (9th Cir.2008). This can be accomplished through incorporating the standards in the conservation checklist which has been attached for your convenience into each of the draft resource management plans. We request that the Bureau withdraw and then revise the draft RMPA/EIS for Utah to include this conservation alternative, not just a No-Action Alternative or a Preferred Management Alignment Alternative. American Bird Conservancy believes the Bureau's Utah plan would weaken existing protection and fail to address foreseeable impacts of mineral extraction. The plan leaves Greater Sage-Grouse at greater risk of becoming endangered, and the Bureau's inclusion of a conservation alternative urgently needed if grouse are to be conserved. We urge the Bureau to withdraw the draft RMPA/EIS to include a conservation alternative to reduce habitat loss and population declines of the Greater Sage-Grouse in Utah. The Range of Alternatives is Insufficient The Draft EISs only consider one alternative, the "Management Alignment Alternative" and refer to the 2015 Sage-grouse Plans as the "No Action Alternative." This does not meet BLM's obligations under NEPA. By only meaningfully considering one alternative and not considering alternatives that would be more environmentally protective, BLM has failed to consider a reasonable range of alternatives. Therefore, if the purpose and need of the 2018 Draft EIS for the Greater Sage-Grouse changes from the purpose and need for the 2015 EIS, then the range of alternatives must necessarily change as well. Even the 2018 Draft EIS recognizes that "[t]he BLM's purpose and need for this planning action helps define the scope of proposed alternative actions . . ." Utah DEIS at ES-2. Because the 2018 Draft EIS states a different purpose and need compared to the 2015 EIS, BLM, pursuant to Lockyer, must necessarily consider a new range of alternatives to meet that new purpose and need. Under Lockyer, BLM in 2018 cannot tier to alternatives considered for the different purpose and need of the 2015 EIS. The purpose and need of the 2018 Draft EIS, pursuant to Secretarial Order 3353, is to contribute to economic growth and energy independence, or, in other words, increase development opportunities on public lands. Therefore, BLM cannot base the pro-development alternatives in its 2018 Draft EISs upon the 2015 alternatives that had a purpose and need focused on conservation and avoidance of an ESA listing, not energy independence and economic growth. Because the "range of reasonable alternatives is measured against the 'Purpose and Need' section," Lockyer at 905, the range of alternatives in the 2018 Draft EIS fail to account for the dramatic change in purpose and need compared to the 2015 EIS, which is a violation of NEPA. 40 CFR §1502.13. By proposing the "Management Alignment Alternative" as the only option to the status quo, BLM has failed to "consider a range of alternatives that covers the full spectrum of possibilities." BLM must evaluate additional management alternatives. BLM must consider additional alternatives, including alternatives that are more environmentally protective than the Management Alignment Alternative. The purpose and need of the 2015 Sage-grouse Plans is to "conserve, enhance, and restore GRSG habitat by eliminating or minimizing threats to their habitat" (Rocky Mountain Record of Decision, p. 1-21), while the 2018 amendments are based on a purpose to "enhance cooperation with the states." BLM should consider an alternative that is explicitly focused on enhancing cooperation with the states while conserving, enhancing and restoring sage-grouse habitat. For instance, the projection of on-the-ground activities set out in Table ES-1 of the 2018 EISs shows a reduction in restoration efforts, but a more conservation-oriented alternative would consider increasing these projects. Similarly, this alternative would evaluate how to enhance cooperation with the states while retaining more of the core protections and management approaches that made the previous plans the basis for the FWS determination that listing was no longer warranted under the ESA. This alternative would be more environmentally protective and provide more certainty. We have developed a proposed alternative that would accomplish these goals which is included here as Exhibit 1. We ask that the BLM fully consider this alternative and that it be included as an alternative in either the final EIS for this project or in a supplemental EIS. BLM should also have considered alternatives to complete additional analysis of key protective provisions that it is proposing to eliminate through the DEISs: net conservation gain and SFAs. The DEISs state: The public did not have the opportunity to comment specifically on a net conservation gain approach to compensatory mitigation during the 2015 land use planning process. In addition, the DOI and the BLM are evaluating whether the implementation of compensatory mitigation standard on public lands is appropriate and consistent with applicable legal authorities. We request public comment about how the BLM should consider and implement mitigation with respect to the Greater Sage-Grouse, including alternative approaches to requiring compensatory mitigation in BLM land use plans. See, e.g. Utah DEIS at ES-8. The Management Alignment Alternative in the DEISs for Utah and Wyoming proposes to remove this standard. Utah DEIS at ES-8; Wyoming DEIS at ES-6. Rather than seeking comments only on eliminating this approach, BLM should evaluate an alternative that would retain the approach, while leaving the agency flexibility to determine applicable standards by working with the states. The DEISs also propose eliminating SFAs in Utah, Wyoming, Nevada and Idaho. Utah DEIS at 2-6; Wyoming DEIS at ES-6; Nevada DEIS at 1-8; Idaho DEIS at 2-7. BLM's scoping notice stated that the agency "seeks comments on the SFA designation" in response to the decision in Western Exploration, LLC v. U.S. Dep't of the Interior, 250 F. Supp. 3d 718 (D. Nev. 2017), which found BLM must conduct supplemental NEPA analysis in order to support the designation. 82 Fed. Reg. 47248, 47249 (Oct. 11, 2017). BLM should evaluate the impacts of the SFAs without the previously-proposed mineral withdrawal, which has now been withdrawn, in light of how those designations and the important protective measures they provide (in addition to the withdrawal protections) benefit sage-grouse habitat and how application can be better coordinated with the states. 4. An agency can only tier to an EIS of larger scope; BLM cannot tier its analysis of alternatives in the 2018 Draft EISs to the 2015 EISs since the 2018 Draft EISs are based on a different purpose and need and have a similarly broad scope. Instead of analyzing a full range of alternatives or the impact of its proposed Management Alignment Alternative, BLM seeks to rely on analysis from the 2015 Sage-grouse Plans. The 2018 Draft EISs state that: . . . issues were analyzed under most resource topics in the 2015 Final EIS, and these types of impacts on these resources are described in the range of alternatives in the 2015 Final EIS. The impacts of implementing the alternatives in this RMPA/EIS are within the range of alternatives previously analyzed. See, e.g. Nevada DEIS at 1-11. The Nevada Draft EIS further states that it "is tiered to the [2015 EIS] … and incorporates by reference all of the descriptions of the affected environment and impacts analyzed in the [2015 EIS]. … Incorporation by reference and tiering provide opportunities to reduce paperwork and redundant analysis in the NEPA process." Nevada DEIS, p. 1-2. While not mentioning tiering explicitly, the Utah DEIS is clearly based on the same rationale, relying to a large degree on the analysis in the 2015 Utah sage-grouse plan. See, e.g., Utah DEIS at 1-6, 2-3, and 4-12. However, an agency may tier a new EIS only to an existing EIS of larger scope. The 2018 Draft EIS for amending the 2015-Sage-grouse Plan as it applies to Utah would affect the same scope as the 2015 EIS. "Tiering is appropriate when the sequence of statements or analysis is: (a) From a program, plan, or policy environmental impact statement to a program, plan, or policy statement or analysis of lesser scope or to a site-specific statement or analysis." 40 CFR §1508.28. Because the 2018 Draft EISs are not of "lesser scope" than the 2015 EISs, NEPA prohibits the BLM from "tiering" to the 2015 EISs. See, 40 CFR §§ 1508.28, 46.140(c). Further, under the Department of the Interior's NEPA regulations, "[a] NEPA document that tiers to another broader NEPA document in accordance with 40 CFR 1508.28 must include a finding that the conditions and environmental effects described in the broader NEPA document are still valid or address any exceptions." 40 C.F.R. § 46.140. The Draft EISs have not made a thorough finding in this regard and cannot justify relying on previous analysis of alternatives. 5. An agency may incorporate documents by reference, but those documents must still be appropriate for the current use and context; BLM cannot incorporate by reference analysis of alternatives from the 2015 sage-grouse plans into these EISs. In addition to indicating that it is tiering to the previous analysis of alternatives, BLM also states it is incorporating the analysis of alternatives in the 2015 plan by reference. In the Utah DEIS approximately forty references are made to documents incorporated by reference. However, in order to incorporate documents by reference, BLM "must determine that the analysis and assumptions used in the referenced document are appropriate for the analysis at hand." 43 C.F.R. § 46.135(a). As discussed above, the analysis of alternatives in the 2015 plans did not relate to the purpose and need of these amendments and it is not appropriate to reference in this context. Further, as prescribed by the Council on Environmental Quality, "[a]gencies shall incorporate material into an environmental impact statement by reference when the effect will be to cut down on bulk without impeding agency and public review of the action. The incorporated material shall be cited in the statement and its content briefly described." 40 C.F.R. § 1502.21. BLM has not met these requirements either. Simply stating that the previous analysis of alternatives are incorporated by reference does not explain why the analysis is sufficient, what was analyzed, how it pertains to the focus of these amendments, or why it obviates the need for analysis of alternatives in these EISs. Moreover, failing to analyze alternatives in these EISs is not providing the public with a sufficient opportunity to review and evaluate the proposed course of action. BLM has attempted to rely on both authority to tier and authority to incorporate documents by reference without clarification and without actually meeting the applicable standards. BLM cannot simply look to the 2015 plans to avoid completing necessary NEPA analysis. The agency must analyze a reasonable range of alternatives in this NEPA process that addresses the new purpose and need. Instead of amending the plans by weakening protections, BLM should focus on engaging communities in the decisions necessary to implement the plans as they are. Give the plans a chance to work. 2.4.21 Assumptions and Methodology Chapter 4 Environmental Consequences We appreciate BLM's efforts to accurately describe environmental consequences. However the nature of landscape scale/statewide analysis creates numerous discrepancies with actual, site-specific impacts. Garfield County asserts many of the assumptions and conclusions drawn in this chapter are inaccurate for lands located in Garfield County. Provisions must be made to a) correct the inaccuracies or b) implement procedures for site-specific analysis that may accurately analyze impacts for proposed projects in the future. Given the desired timeframe, data requirements and difficulties in correcting existing analysis, the only reasonable option appears to be strict consistency, cooperation and coordination with Garfield County's plans as part of the implementation process. GRAPHIC IN ATTACHMENT: Figure 1 growth in number of leks counted in Utah The total number of male sage grouse counted has also increased during this time. UDWR has identified 429 leks of which 328 are occupied. UDWR has increased the number of leks counted over time from 47 in 1967 to 361 leks in 2012. Figure 2 UDWR's data shows the total number of male grouse counted over time. A regression analysis of the total number of males counted would show a slope that is going up, increasing each year. Table 3.2 in the 2018 draft plan presents the slopes from regression analysis for twelve population areas and for most population areas, the regression slopes are positive. This implies incorrectly, that sage grouse populations are increasing in ten regions in Utah. GRAPHIC IN ATTACHMENT: Figure 2 total males counted at leks in Utah BLM does not follow their own guidance when applying a regression analysis presented in Table 3.2. BLM should redo this analysis and not count recently discovered leks as part of a population estimate. The appendix for adaptive management calls for BLM to only use data from leks where data has been continuously collected for 20 years. Instead, it appears that BLM in partnership with the state has added additional leks as they are discovered thus bumping up the the total males sage grouse counted over time. We performed a regression analysis on the lek data that UDWR provides. One example demonstrates what we found. If you perform a regression analysis on the last 20 years of data for Rich-Morgan-Summit Counties for males/lek, the slope is downward. If you conduct a regression analysis for the same 20 years for the same counties counting the total males, the slope is up. The males/lek data show that the populations for most sites in Utah are in decline. BLM incorrectly based its analysis on methods that misrepresent sage grouse populations and, thus, BLM failed to identify problems and take needed action. One of the key products from a linear regression analysis is the calculation of the coefficient of determination (R2) This coefficient ranges from 0 to 1 and is used to see if regression analysis is a strong predictor from the data. An R2 of 0 means that a prediction can't be made and an R2 of 1 means that prediction can be made without error. For the example in the linear regression analysis for Rich-Morgan Summit Counties, the total males had a R2 of 0.02 and the regression analysis for males/lek had an R2 of 0.08 over a twenty year period of the data. Such low R2 numbers indicate that only 2% of the variance of the total males and 8% of variance the males/lek can be predicted. This low R2 occurs because these data are not linear and can not be predicted accurately using linear regression analysis. The sage grouse population numbers follow roughly a ten year cycle of peaks and valleys. For this reason for sage grouse population data linear regression analysis is inappropriate. Recently, Utah experienced a peak in population where males per lek number rose in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Then in 2017 these numbers experienced a 19% decline on average statewide. The long term population trend which is down has shown peaks and valleys over time that are generally lower in each cycle. The most recent peak at 21 males/lek was much lower than the earlier peak of 28 males per lek. We ask that the DEIS be corrected adding this analysis and grazphs to the final EIS. The data quality, methodology, and credibility issues of the NTT and COT Reports and the Monograph have been well documented and discussed by this point. See Attach 1, Data Quality Act Petitions 2 by Garfield County, et al. on NTT; Attach. 2, Garfield County, et al. Petition on COT; Attach. 3, Western Energy Alliance Data Quality Act Petition on Monograph;3 Attach. 3a, Center for Environmental Science, Accuracy and Reliability, Science or Advocacy?

The 2015 Plan was based on data with serious methodological flaws, is not the best available science, does not support the BLM's decisions and is arbitrary and capricious. These Garfield County and WEA petitions identified in excruciating detail data quality issues and created genuine scientific controversies regarding the status of the sage-grouse, its habitat needs, the impacts of public land uses on the sage-grouse and its habitat, size of lek buffers and disturbance caps, predation, hunting, impacts of energy development on sage grouse, noise, to name only a few issues. The 2015 Plan and the 2018 DEIS fail to address the scientific controversies. The 2015 responses that generally disagreed were a per se violation of NEPA. Middle Rio Grande Cons. Dist., 294 F.3d at 1230. NTT, COT and Monograph Flaws Start With Bias and Poor Statistical Analysis After the USFWS determined that the sage-grouse was warranted but precluded from being listed under the ESA, the BLM chartered the Sage-Grouse National Technical Team (NTT) in order to "develop new or revised regulatory mechanisms, through Resource Management Plans (RMPs), to conserve and restore the GRSG and its habitat on BLM administered lands on a range-wide basis over the long term." NTT Report at 4. The BLM preferred alternative in the 2015 Wyoming Plan was based largely on the NTT Report, other than the changes for net conservation gain, mandatory vegetation objectives, and the sagebrush focal areas (SFAs), which were added after the close of the public comment period. As explained in the 2014 Comments on the DEIS, the 2015 Protests, and the 2015 DQA Petitions, BLM's unquestioning adoption of the NTT, COT, and the Monograph failed to address the significant data quality and technical errors, omissions, actual and potential conflicts of interest, and most importantly, incorrect conclusions regarding sage-grouse status and habitat management. Monitoring schedules should be set and prioritized by the local office level on an annual or periodic bases based upon staff-levels and budgets. Local offices should not over-obligate their staff with monitoring requirements, but instead provide a framework to ensure all areas are receiving adequate staff time to manage the resource. Page 4-3: Section 4.3. General Method for Analyzing Impacts. The document states that the Intensity of impacts is to be described using quantitative data where possible and that descriptions such as major, moderate or minor impacts will be avoided. However, there are a number of instances in the Environmental Consequences Chapter where the terms minor, little, low and minimal are used extensively to characterize impacts when it appears that data could be used to quantify the anticipated impact (see, for example, each paragraph on Page 4-26). It appears that acreage data could be used in many of these instances to justify that minor impacts are anticipated. 1.1.1 Assumption One: Sufficient funding and personnel would be available for implementing the final decision. Table ES-1 in the Executive Summary shows a significant decline in all planned habitat restoration and protection activities for FY 18, including conifer removal and invasive species removal. Invasive species removal is already falling far behind the pace needed to adequately restore sagebrush habitat, as shown in a recent Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies Gap Analysis finding that most invasive weed management programs are addressing less than 10% of the average infested acres, while the annual rate of spread of invasive plants, can range from 15-35%. That document states, "[This] [l]ack of effort is due almost entirely to lack of capacity, not expertise."2 1.1.2 Assumption Two: Implementation-level actions necessary to execute the LUP-level decisions in this RMPA/EIS would be subject to further environmental review, including that under NEPA. It is not certain that implementation level actions necessary to execute the LUP-level decisions in the Utah DEIS would be subject to further environmental review. The following Instruction Memorandum (IM) detail guidance for BLM to scale back environmental reviews: ? IM 2018-034,5 recent guidance issued by BLM governing oil and gas leasing, emphasizes using Determinations of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) adequacy instead of NEPA analysis. ? Permanent IM 2018-014 directs BLM field staff to streamline NEPA reviews of applications for permits to drill federally owned minerals from non-federal surfaces. ? IM 2018-061 instructs BLM staff members to ensure they are using several tools to make the NEPA process more efficient, including categorical exclusions for certain types of oil and gas development. The following pending legislation could further reduce environmental review required: ? Pending legislation, H.R. 6106, introduced by Representative Pearce (R NM), would require use of categorical exclusions from NEPA for many oil and gas drilling activities. ? Pending legislation, H.R. 6088, introduced by Representative Curtis (R-UT), would allow oil and gas companies to obtain authorization to drill in some circumstances without NEPA analysis. ? Pending legislation, S.1417, introduced by Sen. Hatch (R-UT) and Sen Heinrich (D-NM), would create categorical exclusions for a wide variety of sage-grouse management activities, such as the use of herbicides and pesticides, mechanical piling and burning, chaining, and broadcast burning. Finally, there has been a large increase in the use of categorical exclusions from NEPA analysis for oil and gas development. For example, in Wyoming, particularly in the Continental Divide-Creston Project Area, categorical exclusions were allowed by section 390 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. § 15942) are being employed. 1.1.3 Assumption Three: Direct and indirect impacts of implementing the RMPA/EIS would primarily occur on public lands administered by the BLM in the planning area. The Utah DEIS loosens restrictions on oil and gas development on BLM lands in a variety of ways, such as decreasing buffers, removing or modifying disturbance and density caps, opening new areas to development, and eliminating general habitat in Utah. While BLM assumes that impacts would primarily occur on public land, recent scientific research indicates the likelihood of impacts to adjoining private or public lands owned by agencies other than BLM. This study found that the probability of lek collapse was positively related to the density of oil and gas wells located outside of core areas at two distances -within 1.6 km and within 4.8 km of the core area boundary.6 These proposed changes would impact future collaborative processes, as expressed by Governor Matt Mead (R-WY), "If we go down a different road now with the sage grouse, what it says is, when you try to address other endangered species problems in this country, don't have a collaborative process, don't work together, because it's going to be changed . . . To me, that would be a very unfortunate circumstance."7 1.1.4 Assumption Four: The BLM would carry out appropriate maintenance for the functional capability of all developments. As noted in Assumption One, BLM does not have the capacity to carry out appropriate maintenance, and potential budget cuts foretell even greater deficiencies in the future. Moreover, the mere fact that treatment has occurred does not necessarily indicate that the habitat has successfully been restored, rendering Table ES-1 less relevant. As the 2018 U.S. Geological Society (USGS) Synthesis of recent scientific research states, "Restoring sagebrush communities can be difficult, costly and slow." In Desert Survivors v. U.S. Dept. of the Interior,9 in ruling that the FWS erred in failing to list the bi-state GRSG population under ESA, the court held, "the service must offer some rational basis for its conclusions that future conservation efforts will be effective enough to improve the status of the bi-state (grouse) and therefore warrant withdrawal of the proposed listing."10 Assumptions must have a basis in fact. In Chapter 4, the Utah DEIS acknowledges that a large amount of important data is not available, including comprehensive planning area-wide inventory of wildlife and special status species occurrence and condition and GIS data used for disturbance calculation on private lands. Indeed, the DEIS acknowledges that some impacts of the proposed changes could not be quantified.11 CEQ regulations further require, where data is unavailable a summary of existing scientific evidence relevant to evaluating reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts and the agency's evaluation of such impacts.12 The Utah DEISs fail to provide either of these types of information. In addition to not including the results of the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA) Gap Analysis, the Utah DEIS also does not consider a study published in PLoS ONE by Kitzberger et al. (PLoS ONE study) finding that many parts of the West can expect to see more than five times the area burned during the next 20 years than fires covered in the past 20 years,13 as well as new research on the impact of climate change on sagebrush habitat.14 Lastly, there can also be a 1-to 4-year time lag between development and lek decline.15 Improving the Effects Analysis The Proposed Action includes components drawn from alternatives analyzed in 2015. The Draft EIS does not include a stand-alone effects analysis for the Proposed Action's combined components and instead relies primarily on the effects analysis in the 2015 EIS. Importantly, the 2015 EIS assessed the impacts of the overall management strategy (i.e. the combination of components) for each Action Alternative and did not independently assess the environmental effects of each component of the alternatives. For the Final EIS, we recommend that BLM consider the combined components in the Proposed Action (including recent modifications to compensatory mitigation policy3) to assess its overall impacts to greater sagegrouse populations and trends. 2.4.22 Sage-Grouse Reduce manageable impacts in sage-grouse habitat. Some threats to sage-grouse are difficult to manage, such as wildfire and invasive species. The federal conservation strategy should compensate for those impacts by emphasizing management of land uses that we can control, such as improperly managed livestock grazing, which contributes to unnatural fire and the spread of invasive species. Restore degraded sage-grouse habitat. Sage-grouse have already lost nearly half their range to agriculture and development. If there is to be any hope for the different state and federal plans to work together, this loss of habitat must cease. The federal sage-grouse conservation strategy should be updated to support active restoration of areas that can still be used by sage-grouse and other wildlife. Sage-grouse population trends: The EIS correctly notes that population trends both locally and at a state level are one of the most important indicators of the heath of this species and one of the best indicators of the success or failure of management actions. BLM has adopted the state's use of lek data making management decisions based on the slope of 20 years of male lek counts. Connelly et al. (2004) and Garton et al. (2011) recommend normalizing the data. Neither of the two studies recommend management be based on slope from regression analysis of lek data. Connelly et al. (2003) recommend using a population index that assess the rate of change from one year to the next year. With one exception, BLM has chosen not to follow this advice. Appendix B of the 2003 land use plan stated, "twenty years was chosen as the appropriate time period to identify trend leks". There is no supporting scientify justification nor peer reviewed journal articles to support this decision. It is an unsupported agency opinion. By averaging data over 20 years, the importance of changes that occur within one year, such as a signicant decline in the recent year, are marginalizied and the importance of such change downplayed. This averaging method misleads leaders, the public, and the media. Instead of normalizing the data and basing population trends on the average number of males per lek, BLM has chosen to use the total number of males counted at leks as a measure of population. Utah, as have many other states, has chosen to count more leks each year. Based on UDWR data, the graph of the growth of the number of leks counted is displayed in Figure 1. This shows roughly a 400% growth in the number of leks counted during the past twenty years. Sagebrush Characteristics for sage grouse: This draft plan recommends habitat objectives that allow degraded habitat to now meet objectives. A scientific study now being considered for publishing is cited by BLM to guide BLM's recommendations. The standard adopted from Connelly et al. (2000) is based on sagebrush ecological sites that are near of close to their ecological potential. Based on newsletter articles from the University of Utah's agricultural extension service, BLM's new standards are likely based on recent surveys of habitat conditions typical of what is now found in most of the degraded sagebrush lands in Utah. While most sagebrush habitat has sagebrush that show canopy cover height required, this is not true for the expected perennial native grasses and forbs. Grass and forbs canopy cover is more sparse and lower in height today in most areas than what would be expected for that same ecological site at potential. Table 3 is reprinted here from Connelly et al. (2000), the adopted standard that BLM used west wide. BLM and the state argue that the characteristics in Table 3 are not appropriate for conditions now found in Utah. If sage grouse populations were increasing and at potential, then that argument might have merit. But where sage grouse populations continue to decline, conditions that are less than the standard are likely to be one of the reasons for that decline in population. necessarily need to look to lesser or completely undisturbed areas. Even if an extremely small portion of one examination area is disturbed, Management Actions 126 and 127 force operators to find undeveloped surfaces to gain the full benefit of the five percent threshold. Thus, the 2015 Plan contradicts the stated objectives. Conserve all of the most important sage-grouse habitat. For example, winter habitat is particularly important to sage-grouse, mule deer and other wildlife, but the current federal plans fail to protect those areas from harmful land use and development. BLM acknowledges the changes in Utah could "could result in a site-specific loss of Sage-grouse habitat and displacement from the area of development by local populations."94 It also states that, "Projects that would likely be precluded under the No Action Alternative could proceed under the "2018 proposed amendments."95 It reasons, however, that requiring that impacts improve habitat will offset those concerns. This is problematic because it will presumably be accomplished through compensatory mitigation and is unclear how a project itself would improve habitat. The draft Utah mitigation rule, however, does not provide a preference for offset benefits to accrue within the landscape affected by the project; prioritize projects that provide the greatest benefits, and reduce the greatest threats, to sage-grouse habitat; do not require mitigation for all impacts; does not guarantee against temporal losses; does not use a habitat quantification tool to measure comparability between impacts and offsets.96 Protect sagebrush reserves. It is important, particularly in light of climate change, that land managers set aside areas both where sage-grouse are now and where they will need to go in the future; the current conservation plans fail to provide that direction. Protect sagebrush reserves. It is important, particularly in light of climate change, that land managers set aside areas both where sage-grouse are now and where they will need to go in the future; the current conservation plans fail to provide that direction. 2.4.23 Non-Sage-Grouse Section 4.6.3. Impacts on Soil Resources. In the fifth line of this section, there is mention of increased disturbance and compaction of soils associated with a return to cross country motorized vehicle use. Knowing that much of the affected area is in the Little Sahara sand dunes, much of the soil resources are actually sand, which is not subject to compaction and any disturbance is quickly erased by winds. As such, the impacts on soil resources may be overstated. 2.4.24 Livestock Grazing Out of the 1,319 allotments that BLM manages in Utah, 478 active BLM allotments include sage grouse habitat. Of those in 2012, BLM has determined 78 of these allotments do not meet Rangeland Health Standards (See Figure 1 in the attached comments). 98 of active BLM allotments with sage grouse have not been assessed to determine if they meet these standards. In Utah BLM allotments with sage grouse habitat, BLM has renewed the grazing permit for 756 allotments in Utah (57%) without any management changes, under the 2000 Congressional Appropriations Rider (see Figure 2 in the attached comments). This was not added to the final 2015 plan. We ask that BLM update this data showing how many allotments now don't meet Rangeland Health Standards. For those allotments that fail to meet standards and are making progress towards meeting them, we ask that BLM provide a description of what actions led to this progress and what monitoring validates this conclusion. For the purposes of this plan, only when habitat again meets sage grouse needs should that be called progress. The current plan addresses "improper grazing" in MA-LG-6. Improper grazing occurs in an area when the "area is not meeting or making progress towards achievable habitat objectives and land health standards and the causal factor is livestock." For areas with improper grazing, BLM then requires action to address the problems. Unfortunately, this plan does not require BLM to assess if an allotment has improper grazing when permits are renewed. As a result, there is an inadequate regulatory process. BLM has made addressing improper grazing optional. This is inadequate for sage grouse conservation. As we have seen in the past, BLM often renews permits without assessing if overgrazing is occurring and without public review and NEPA. Because of the magnitude of the number of grazing allotments that have degraded herbaceous plant communities in PHMA, BLM needs to require that all permits be assessed prior to renewal and that decision process offer the public a chance to participate. The final plan should require an assessment of all allotments being renewed to see if improper grazing is occurring. Using BLM's grazing response index, improper grazing can also be defined as an allotment where the grazing practices lead to a negative GRI score. The grazing response index can indicate proper and improper grazing: "The overall rating of the expected response to grazing is the sum of frequency, intensity and opportunity. A positive value indicates the management is beneficial to the health, structure and vigor of the plants. A negative value indicates that management is harmful. A zero rating is neutral." Any allotment that has grazing longer than two weeks and allows utilization at 50% or more is very likely to have a negative score and, thus, has improper grazing. Using the GRI methods just described, BLM should analyze the grazing practices in those allotments in PHMA and report in the final EIS those allotments with improper grazing. Under affected environment, we ask that the final EIS include both a map and table that describes those allotments in sage grouse habitat which graze during the nesting and brooding season and which graze for periods longer than two weeks and at a utilization level higher than 40%. There is no record of BLM's previous promises being honored. The Sierra Club is an interested public in a number of BLM grazing allotments and has never received communication from the BLM that documents the action promised (4-86). There is no report of those allotments that have improper grazing and also no information on actions that have been taken. If such information exists, please incorporate it into the final EIS. NTT Inaccurately Describes the Impacts of Domestic Livestock and Wild Horse Grazing a. Livestock Grazing Impacts The NTT Report unilaterally targets domestic livestock grazing and provides only a cursory analysis of wild horse and other ungulate impacts on rangeland conditions. The 2015 FEIS adopts the NTT Report for grazing guidance even though the Wyoming EO 2011-5, 2015-041 concluded that appropriate grazing is actually beneficial to sage-grouse habitat. As the Coalition and others have repeatedly emphasized, even USFWS in COT acknowledged that proper grazing could benefit the habitat. The NTT Report betrays sound management principles as it exhaustively lists domestic grazing restrictions, such as fences, exclosures, water developments, vegetation treatments, dispersing grazing animals, changing seasonal pastures, and retiring grazing privileges over three pages. See NTT Report at 14-18. Even more strikingly, the NTT Report begins by listing five potential impacts of "herbivory on sage-grouse and their habitat" and immediately follows that list with a paragraph discussing livestock without addressing the similar effects by wild horses or other ungulates such as antelope, mule deer, or elk. The Report omits contradictory findings that proper livestock grazing actually benefits GRSG habitat and viable populations. J. Cagney, et al., Grazing Influence, Objective Development, and Management in Wyoming's Greater Sage-Grouse Habitat (2010). The 2015 Plan repeat and adopted NTT approach and then made stubble height and canopy binding. As documented in WSI, this treatment of grazing lacked any objective data other than the potential for raptors to perch on fences. The theory that livestock water breeds mosquitos has been largely discounted as the grouse appears to have adapted to the West Nile Virus. Attach. 3b, WSI at 32-33. TABLE 2-2 IMPLICATIONS ON LIVESTOCK GRAZING 1 Residual Grass Height Not Supported By Science Quincy Bahr Sage-Grouse Project Coordinator August 2, 2018 Page 22 The Coalition appreciates that the Utah plan does not include residual stubble height requirements. To improve the analysis, the Coalition provides the following rationale for leaving grass height requirements out of the final plan. During cooperating agency meetings with the U.S. Forest Service in Wyoming, the Forest Service explicitly stated that the science cited by the 2015 Plans does not support the six inch residual grass height in the Forest Plans, and as a result, the Forest Service was removing that guideline from the Forest Service plan. See Attach. 6, USFS Power Point Presentation. The Forest Service also recognized that as an indicator of nest survival, grass height was premised on a false assumption -mainly that grass at successful nests was higher than failed nests because that grass provided better cover. Rather, as the Coalition has repeatedly commented, grass at a failed nest will necessarily be shorter than grass that is allowed to grow for longer at a successful nest. Thus, the six-inch residual stubble height requirement is no longer a part of the Forest Service plan when it was the Forest Service that originally advocated for this stipulation and recommended that Jim Lyons extend it to BLM land. The new Wyoming plan should return to rangeland health standards and guidelines pursuant to BLM authority in 43 C.F.R. part 4100. Attached to these comments is a Cooperating Agency presentation by the U.S. Forest Service that confirms that the Forest Service will abandon any requirement that livestock grazing must be managed to meet a six-inch or four-inch residual grass height. There is no literature that concludes grazing should be limited so as to reach a specified grass height for the benefit of sage-grouse -that is precisely what the U.S. Forest Service stated in its cooperating agency meeting. Rather, documented livestock grazing numbers across the West unilaterally show that grouse populations were at their highest when grazing was also at historic highs. This fact alone proves that the intensity of livestock grazing odes not correlate to a threat to sage-grouse habitat or numbers. Issue #5, Recommendation 5: Any decision from this process should amend all Plans to remove any elements as related to permitted livestock grazing, and to defer GRSG management to the BLM via continued implementation of 43 C.F.R. Part 4100, subpart 4180 (see Issue #2). Removal of permitted livestock grazing at any level from an allotment should never be a first choice "response" when conditions are not being met. Instead, a suite of options should be available for the agency and permittee to utilize to move towards meeting desired conditions. Issue #5, Recommendation 22:Any language relating to a reduction in grazing use due to allowable use level must be removed. Allowable use levels are not hard-and-fast, particularly as to the methods to monitor such levels, and as to the reason(s) for any failures (which can be inclusive of factors unrelated to livestock grazing, like insects, wild horses, wild burros, and wildlife). In addition, the imposition of allowable use levels impairs the ability for a permittee and BLM to implement adaptive management strategies. If, however, any amended Plan intends to impose allowable use levels, the implementation of such levels should be subject to a "Decision Tree" assessment process, like that prescribed in Idaho, as to the implementation of annual indicators, like allowable use levels. See USDI-BLM-Idaho Instruction Memorandum No. ID2005-074 dated June 2, 005 (wherein Idaho BLM prescribes the applicable of a "Decision Tree" analysis in implementation of annual indicators, like allowable use levels). Issue #5, Recommendation 23: As shown on page 132 of the Utah Protest Resolution Report, changes to permit should only occur to meet resource objectives outlined in the Proposed Plan after the proper monitoring data and Rangeland Health Assessment and Determination and NEPA analysis has been made, including the associated decisionmaking document as per 43 C.F.R. Part 4100, subpart 4160. Issue 5: DEIS Comment 18, 19: While the proposed alternative in the DEIS appropriately removes any and all reference to SFA (see DEIS at page 2-9, as to MA-LG-16, MA-MR3, MA-MR-12, MA-LR-11), and also removes the requirement of thresholds and responses (see DEIS at page 2-35, as to MA-LG-6), it fails to completely meet the recommendation above. It is critical that BLM consider and analyze this issue in the FEIS, and implement a proposed action in the ROD that adopts the recommendation. Issue #3: Management direction not consistent with on the ground management, including with adverse implications to private and State lands The GRSG LUPA includes a Management Action that intends to assume jurisdiction over private land and SITLA land. Specifically, MA-LG-3 provides at page 2-22 that "[i]n PHMA, consult, cooperate, and collaborate with other land owners and management agencies (e.g., private and SITLA) to develop plans which provide for landscape level approaches to habitat improvement. Manage unfenced private and SITLA lands within a grazing allotment that are under exchange of use agreements or percent public land use as a single unit that will have the same management as the public lands." As currently exists, the GRSG LUPA in Utah establishes direction to encumber private and state land with the management prescriptions on public land; adversely impairing private land and state land, including the flexibility that such land provides to a livestock operation. Issue 3:Recommendation 3: MA-LG-3 must be removed from Utah's ARMPA. While 43 C.F.R. 4130.3-2(g) and 43 C.F.R. 4130.6-1 speak of authority to issue Percent Public Land and Exchange of Use authorizations on unfenced, intermingled owned or controlled lands, these rules don't speak of authority for the BLM to assume management authority over such private and state lands. LUPA should not attempt to assume jurisdiction over private land or SITLA land, and its attempt to do so particularly via the last sentence in MA-LG-3 is unlawful; implicating takings. Issue 3: DEIS Comment 3: The DEIS at page 2-34 appropriately removes MA-LG-3 (aka "No similar action"). It is critical that BLM consider carry this recommendation forward in the FEIS, and implement a proposed action in the ROD that adopts the removal of MA-LG-3. Prioritization of land health assessments in sage grouse areas All LUPAs require the prioritization of grazing permit renewals within SFAs, assuming SFAs are sustained during this amendment process. In some cases, BLM requires prioritization of both Land Health Assessments as well as permit renewals. BLM grazing regulations via 43 C.F.R. 4180.2(c) already requires BLM to make management changes in order for allotments determined to not be meeting rangeland health standards to move towards meeting, additional language covering this is not legally required or rational (see Issue #2). Specifically, the GRSG LUPA in (at least) Utah, includes the following Management Action which demonstrates these flaws / consequences: (see MA-LG-2) Issue #5, Recommendation 5: Any decision from this process should amend all Plans to remove any elements as related to permitted livestock grazing, and to defer GRSG management to the BLM via continued implementation of 43 C.F.R. Part 4100, subpart 4180 (see Issue #2). Issue #5: LUPAs Repeatedly Elevate Livestock Grazing to Priority Threat Multiple scientific studies document that livestock grazing and sage-grouse conservation can beneficially co-exist. Top threats to GRSG include rangeland wildfire, invasive weeds, and development pressure, not livestock grazing. Livestock grazing is not even in the top-ten list of threats. Yet, despite this, BLM has erroneously imposed landscape-wide regulatory changes on the grazing livestock industry for purposes of conserving habitat for a single species through an inflexible framework that is overly restrictive and fails to account for the site-specific conditions necessary to make informed decisions. The LUPAs elevated livestock grazing as a priority threat, even though improper livestock grazing is listed only as a secondary threat.4 Being only a secondary threat, any decision from this process should amend all Plans to remove any elements as related to permitted livestock grazing, and to defer GRSG management to the BLM via continued implementation of 43 C.F.R. Part 4100, subpart 4180 (see Issue #2) so as to provide focus on "improper grazing" where it may or may not exist, as opposed to "proper grazing". If BLM erroneously decides against this recommendation, it is critical that BLM work closely with key stakeholders to develop grazing strategies that can be applied to LUPAs across the West for consistency (see Issue #3). Our comments below are our best effort of grouping issues that need resolved in any LUPA amendment, with some recommendations on what language should move forward. We encourage Secretary Zinke to provide the same opportunity that was presented by Secretary Salazar to work with our States and national affiliates to further this directive carry-forward the goal, objective or action from the "No-Action Alternative" (aka current 2015 ARMPA) into the intended new, updated 2018 ARMPA. 2.4.25 Fluid Minerals Impacts of Energy Development Dr. Rob Roy Ramey, Wildlife Science International, and Lex Ivey, Terracognito GIS Services, compiled and analyzed 100 years of data on oil and gas development in the Pinedale Anticline Project Area (PAPA). Rob Roy Ramey, Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Oil and Gas Development, Mitigation, and Greater Sage-Grouse Lek Attendance in the Pinedale Planning Area, Wyoming 1990-2012 (2014) (On file with author). The study also considered data on recent mitigation efforts for GRSG, spatial and temporal changes in oil and gas development, reclamation and restoration, along with GRSG responses (based on 22 years of male GRSG lek attendance data). The research results refute the NTT report and several studies cited in the NTT report (i.e. Holloran, 2005). Ramey suggests a paradigm shift in the relationship between oil and gas development and GRSG habitat selection and population viability. Ramey concludes that data from 1990 to 2012 do not indicate GRSG population decline nor widespread lek abandonment throughout the PAPA. In fact, lek attendance in the PAPA population was consistently above statewide averages and lek attendance did not decline in areas with 3% disturbance within 4 miles of the lek. Ramey concludes that studies currently being used for regulatory decisions with regards to GRSG are outdated and no longer relevant. Dr. Ramey also directly addresses Holloran's 2005 study and found no evidence of a population decline or population extirpation in the PAPA as predicted by Holloran in 2005. See also Attach 3a, CESAR at 38-39; Attach 3b, WSI at 51-52, 115-120. The DQA petitions also question the premise that energy development harmed sage-grouse or its habitat. Holloran's assumed absence of grouse from a lek meant extirpation when the grouse more likely moved. Id.; Attach. 5, Ramey et al. at 29. This avoidance is not extirpation. More recent research suggests that GrSG return to leks when development intensity drops. Page 2 -16 Garfield County opposes both alternatives regarding no surface occupancies stipulations. Neither of the alternatives is consistent with Garfield County's plans, a violation of federal law. Garfield County suggests that the language be changed such that occupied high-value habitats within PHMA are open to leasing fluid minerals subject to NSO. All other areas within PHMA (unoccupied and medium or low value habitats) should be open for leasing subject to site-specific stipulations. In addition any technical team must use criteria identified in Garfield County's Sage grouse Conservation and Recovery Plan and must provide an opportunity for the review and input of state and local entities. Waivers, Exceptions, and Modifications for NSO Stipulations The State would like further clarification as to the reasoning for BLM's inclusion of NSO stipulations in Section MA-MR-3. In-lieu of stating that "all PHMA is designated as open to leasing fluid minerals subject to NSO stipulation",28 the BLM should state that "occupied habitats within PHMA is open to leasing fluid minerals subject to NSO. All other areas within PHMA are open for leasing subject to site-specific stipulations, as determined by the technical team, necessary to prevent undue degradation or disturbance to potential sage-grouse habitat within PHMA." Development on existing leases should be managed per regulations that are currently in place, which limit surface occupancy and disturbance. Years of research leave no doubt that sage-grouse do not do well in close proximity to energy development. More development in the most important habitat will not help conserve the species. 2.4.26 Solid Minerals Exploratory drilling has been conducted on State mineral leases in Priority Sage Grouse Habitat on Diamond Mountain. This drilling was scheduled so as not to interfere with greater sage-grouse strutting, mating and brood rearing. Restoration of the drill sites included a seed mix which was beneficial to habitat improvement. Sage grouse populations in the area where drilling occurred in 2014 increased the following year, indicating that there was no negative affect on the population by drilling. Utah Mineral Resources has successfully managed an exploratory drilling program in critical grouse habitat at Diamond Mountain, Utah. This drilling project was conducted on lands with mineral leases through the State of Utah that are adjacent to current BLM phosphate lease lands and lands where there are Pending Phosphate Exploration Permits. This drilling program demonstrated that exploration scheduling can be scheduled at times when grouse are not strutting and nesting. Grouse population observed in the area increased after drilling was concluded. Revegetation of the drill locations and access roads included a seed mix designed to improve grouse habitat. This project clearly demonstrates that phosphate exploration can be successful in areas of sage grouse habitat with minimal impact to the grouse. Section 3.15.2 states “Information related to mineral potential has generally not changed since completion of the 2015 Final EIS and can be found in Section 3.21.2 on page 3-208.” Aside from the fact that the statement is false, the information in the 2015 Final EIS is wholly inadequate. The Bureau of Land Management obviously did not for, the 2015 Final EIS nor for this Document, contact its own customers who hold leases and prospecting permits for phosphate. Phosphate has been mined in the Uintah County since 1960; the mine is currently operated by J R Simplot. J R Simplot currently holds three Preference Right Phosphate Leases and another Phosphate Fringe Non Competitive Lease adjacent to its mine. These leases as well as several Phosphate Prospecting Permits held by Utah Mineral Resources LLD, are all within one of the “Primary Habitat Management Areas” from which mining will be disallowed according to the 2015 Final EIS as well as this document. Adjacent to the mine, leases and prospecting permits are mineral lands held by the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA). The SITLA lands are also leased for Phosphate. In 2014 the SITLA lands were drilled and explored for phosphate, the lessee, Utah Mineral Resources (UMR) spent in excess of $1,000,000.00 on their Diamond Mountain Phosphate Project. The results were a measured and indicated phosphate resource of 26.8 million tons and inferred resources of 23.1 million tons with estimated grade of near 20%. The Adjacent lands where UMR holds the prospecting permits have indicated resources of 7.1 million tons and inferred resources of 4 million tons. With implementation of this Plan Amendment the Prospecting Permits and likely any chance of a phosphate mine on the SITLA leases will likely have to be abandoned along with royalty payments to the School Trust of over $40 million. Phosphorus is the second most widely used fertilizer nutrient after nitrogen. Fertilizers account for more than 90% of total phosphate consumption in particular cereals (grains) which are estimated to account for 55% of fertilizer use worldwide. With the continuing decrease of farmable land in the world phosphate production will take an ever increasingly important role in order to feed the world population. Removing potentially important resources without any consideration other than its location within the habitat of a “game bird” is unwise. 3.E. Mineral Withdrawal Simplot supports the exclusion of Sagebrush Focal Areas in the RMPA/EIS and the prior withdrawal of the application to designate approximately 10 million acres of public and National Forest system lands located within Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming as Sagebrush Focal Areas (SFAs). In its 2010 finding, the FWS identified a number of specific threats to GRSG in the Great Basin Region; including the widespread present and potential impacts of wildfire, the loss of native habitat to invasive species, and conifer encroachment. Mining was not identified as a primary threat. For that reason, measures that do not have a discernable positive affect on the species or activities that already have adequate regulatory mechanisms in place (e.g., rangeland health standards or section 3809 plans for mining) need to be reevaluated and removed from consideration. Diverting those precious resources from the primary threats of wildfire and invasive species has no rational basis. Additional analysis and disclosure of the entire range of impacts associated with implementing the Management Alignment Alternative and its effect on the development of phosphate resources in Utah need to be included in the RMPA/EIS. 3.H. Valid Existing Rights Valid existing rights in regard to non-energy leasable minerals needs to be clearly identified in the RMPA/EIS. The RMPA/EIS fails to disclose how valid existing rights are maintained. It appears that restrictions identified in the RMPA/EIS could apply to existing leases and lease modifications within PHMA in KPLA. This is further supported by the language referenced in 'Impacts from management of Phosphate Leases" on page 4-386 of the LUPA/EIS: "In summary, the Proposed Plans close non energy mineral development to new leases that are not contiguous to existing operations, and because it applies the 3 percent disturbance cap at the project level, this would likely preclude the expansion or development of phosphate mines onto public lands in PHMA." (emphasis added) As previously stated, clarification needs to be provided in the RMPA/EIS consistent with the language provided in the Idaho and Southwestern Montana Greater Sage-Grouse Proposed LUPA/Final EIS; pg. 4259 and 4-260: "Unmined phosphate leases have valid existing rights and cannot be closed to development." The Proposed LUPA/Final EIS further states that "An indicator of an impact on non-energy solid leasable minerals is if there were substantial closures to non-energy solid mineral leasing in areas with high potential for non-energy solid mineral development, such as unleased KPLAs." The Idaho Proposed LUPA/Final EIS further states at page 4-265, that "Fringe leases and modifications to existing leases would be allowed in PHMA to satisfy valid existing rights." This assessment is directly comparable to the situation in Utah where 98% of the KPLA (both federal and private surface) is included as PHMA and closed to federal mineral leasing and development. The management direction in the RMPA/EIS conflicts with the rights already accorded under these leases. When a company enters into a mineral lease, that company obtains a right to a noncompetitive lease of any lease modification area. 43 C.F.R. §3510.11. This right is only subject to company's compliance with the restrictions contained within 43 C.F.R. §3510.15. If a company fully complies with those restrictions, the lease modification will be granted. Therefore, the leaseholder also holds the right to modify the lease pursuant to its application. *GIS DATA/MAPS and QUANTITATIVE DATA RELATED TO DIAMOND MOUNTAIN, UINTAH COUNTY, UT MINERAL DEVELOPMENT* These comments provide new information relevant to the EIS and specifically address social and economic resources. It is our position that responsible phosphate exploration and development can take place on Diamond Mountain. Here are our comments which address the social and economic resources of the area: Utah Mineral Resources, LLC (UMR) is a duly registered company in the State of Utah. UMR has active phosphate leases from the State of Utah and a considerable amount of work has been done to define a large phosphate resource. These leases are not in a contiguous block of land and adjacent federal lands are needed to allow future development. UMR has applied for Phosphate Prospecting Permits on the adjoining Federal lands. -Phosphate is one of three basic components of fertilizer-vitally needed to increase crop yields. -Phosphate production is currently a major component of the economy for the Vernal area. -Active phosphate mining is currently underway by Simplot and these mining operations are progressing toward Diamond Mountain. -State phosphate leases and pending phosphate prospecting permits (private surface and Federal minerals) are held by UMR and cover land which adjoin an active phosphate lease held by Simplot. -State lease payments and production royalties benefit the schools of Utah -More than $1,000,000 has been spent drilling, coring and testing the phosphate resource on UMR leases. -A Technical Report (compliant to Canadian NI 43-101 requirements) was prepared by Norwest Corporation in October 14, 2014. -This Technical Report states that measured, indicated and inferred in-place phosphate resources covered by State leases are 59.9 million metric tons. It also states that on adjoining Federal land (where prospecting permits are pending) measured, indicated and inferred in-place phosphate resources are 11.1million metric tons. -The phosphate bed is about 14 feet thick and extends throughout the UMR State lease area as confirmed by drilling. The depth to the phosphate bed ranges from 118.9 to 286.6 feet below the surface and it is approximately 20% P2O5. Successful reclamation for phosphate exploration and mining in the Diamond Mountain area has been proven. Simplot surface mining operations have been re-contoured and re-vegetated. Healthy plant growth provided better and needed winter range for big game animals, including elk. UMR successfully conducted an extensive drilling program on Diamond Mountain. All disturbed areas including drill pads, roads and a lay-down yard were successfully re-vegetated with a seed mix designed to benefit greater sage-grouse. Our understanding is that the Greater Sage-Grouse population increased after the drilling program was completed. We received an Earth Day award for the reclamation work on the project. A very large phosphate resource has been proven -based on limited work done to date. Additional Federal lands are needed to help consolidate the scattered State leases. This resource could be developed to provide good jobs and a basic component of food production. This can be accomplished without a negative impact on the greater sage-grouse population on Diamond Mountain. Development of leasable, non-energy minerals are currently prohibited in areas of greater sage-grouse priority habitat. Non-energy minerals are beneficial to regional economies and developing local resources protects our nation from dependence on foreign minerals. The following are comments relating to the need to keep greater sage-grouse priority habitat open to leasable minerals and locatable minerals. 1. A list of 35 minerals deemed critical to US national security and economy was recently developed. Agricultural minerals (except potash) were not included on the list but play an important role as a foundation for non-energy mineral independence. Three major components of fertilizer are Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium (N P & K). Phosphate rock is the major source of Phosphorus for US agriculture. 2. Most of the US demand for phosphate rock is supplied domestically and known resources such as Diamond Mountain shoud be open to new exploration and mining to assure independence from foreign supply in the future. 3. Exploration, resource development and mining provide jobs in rural communities and are a critical economic element in many regions. Several Phosphate Prospecting Permits are pending on lands adjacent to existing Federal Phosphate leases and State mineral leases where exploration and mining are currently permitted. Consideration should be made in the range management plan for new exploration and development of non-energy minerals on lands adjacent to current leases, exploration and mining activities. 7. Exploration and development of the phosphate resource at Diamond Mountain began in the 1960’s and these activities have been conducted concurrently with greater sage-grouse habitat improvement. Finally, it needs to be clear that the construction of roads and support facilities needed to support development of leases is allowed. Valid existing rights must be recognized in regard to existing leases. This includes being able to construct roads and facilities needed for development of the lease, and the modification of that lease as provided for in existing rules. Simplot's lease is a contract authorizing it to conduct mining operations on that tract, and granting the right to utilize adjacent lands by executing a lease modification. These rights cannot be suspended, revoked, or modified by the ARMPA. Because existing leases are valid existing rights established with the premise that they will be developed, the acreage associated with existing leases should not be shown as PHMA on maps or used to calculate disturbance and density thresholds. Valid existing rights need to be clearly identified and consistently addressed in all state plans. Currently there are discrepancies on how valid existing rights are being incorporated into the various state plans. Fringe leases and the development of existing leases should be recognized as a valid existing right and as such should be specifically included in the definition in the glossary. Currently there is no definition for valid existing right in the RMPA/EIS Glossary. Because the premise is that they will be developed (as a valid existing right), the acreage associated with existing leases should not be shown as PHMA or used to calculate disturbance and density thresholds. 'All. Non-Energy Leasable Minerals MA-MR-15/16 in the 2015 LUPA close PHMA to exploring or developing non-energy leasable minerals. Upon further review of the DEIS, the State did not see mention of how the BLM was going to modify this strategy to better align with the 2013 State Plan. The State would encourage a meeting with the BLM to identify strategies for allowing for development of non-energy mineral leasable in areas of non-habitat, or in areas where siting and minimization techniques can be utilized to continue to conserve sage-grouse habitats within PHMA. 3.G. Lack of Information on the Impacts of Prohibiting or Limiting Access to Phosphate Resources Simplot agrees with the recommendation under the Management Alignment Alternative to remove 448,600 acres of designated GHMA along with associated requirements of lek buffers, required design features, net conservation gain, habitat objectives, and leasing prioritization. However, there continues to be no discussion of the consequences of prohibiting or limiting access to hundreds of thousands of acres of high potential phosphate in PHMA in the RMPA/EIS. The RMPA/EIS and supporting analysis fails to discuss the effects on fertilizer availability, fertilizer sources and prices, and implications for national food security. This is further supported by text on page 4-386 in the Utah Greater-Sage-Grouse Proposed PLUPA/Final EIS: "No RFD scenario for phosphate was prepared that quantifies current phosphate reserves on private and public lands and forecasts production of those reserves. In the absence of this information and any proposed plans for leasing and developing federal lands for phosphate, it is not possible to quantify potential economic impacts…" Phosphate is an important mineral in regards to food and national security. Appendix B provides additional information on the importance of phosphate in Utah in regards to national food security. The Proposed LUPA/Final EIS was finalized in June of 2015. At the time of its release, Simplot had three existing leases that were assigned in 2008 and another fringe lease application that had been accepted by the BLM in the Plan area. Additionally, a draft Environmental Assessment (EA) had been completed for a fringe lease application during the analysis period of the LUPA/FEIS. The BLM issued a letter February 18, 2014 to Simplot Phosphates, LLC deferring a decision on the EA until the sage grouse land use plan amendments were completed. As Simplot previously stated, revisions to the ARMPA needed to include a complete and thorough analysis of the economic effects of not developing 88% (186,700 acres) of the federal mineral estate with phosphate potential within the decision area which includes closing 100% (42,700 acres) of the federal mineral estate with high phosphate potential. The impacts from removing this resource needed to be analyzed not only at the national level but also for the impacts to local economies. As described earlier, mining was not identified as a primary threat to the Greater SageGrouse. BLM needs to evaluate what projects or potential projects are actually contemplated during the time horizon of the EIS under current budget constraints and factor that into the analysis, rather than uniformly applying restrictive measures that will do nothing to further the conservation of the bird. Additional clarification needs to be included in the RMPA/EIS as to why the PHMA associated with total surface (acreage associated with the PHMA polygon; regardless of land ownership) increased 56,500 acres and PHMA associated with split estate (acreage where the surface and mineral estates are owned or administered by separate entities) increased 59,100 acres. Further reviews were conducted regarding the impacts of the Management Alignment Alternative on fluid mineral development in the RMPA/EIS as stated, in section 4.6.10 Fluid Mineral Development states: "The BLM Utah reviewed the Reasonable Foreseeable Development scenario (RFD), Appendix R of the 2015 Final EIS, and addressed changes in potential oil and gas exploration and development." However, no additional analysis was completed in the RMPA/EIS to quantify the impacts to leasable minerals from implementing the Management Alignment Alternative; despite the fact that there are at least three existing phosphate leases and a submitted fringe lease application for public lands within the planning area. Additionally, a draft EA has been submitted to the BLM in support of the fringe lease application. Simplot operations in the Vernal and Rock Springs area provide approximately 300 direct jobs, with annual payroll of approximately $40 million. Almost $60 million is spent for a variety of goods and services. Almost $2 million is paid in local taxes. The quantities of phosphate in the Vernal area are significant, and could provide good paying jobs for many decades, including other mineral developments. In addition, it alleviates the nation's reliance upon international mineral resources. 3.H. Valid Existing Rights Valid existing rights in regard to non-energy leasable minerals needs to be clearly identified in the RMPA/EIS. The RMPA/EIS fails to disclose how valid existing rights are maintained. It appears that restrictions identified in the RMPA/EIS could apply to existing leases and lease modifications within PHMA in KPLA. This is further supported by the language referenced in 'Impacts from management of Phosphate Leases" on page 4-386 of the LUPA/EIS: "In summary, the Proposed Plans close non energy mineral development to new leases that are not contiguous to existing operations, and because it applies the 3 percent disturbance cap at the project level, this would likely preclude the expansion or development of phosphate mines onto public lands in PHMA." (emphasis added) 2.4.27 Lands and Realty As Simplot noted in previous comments to the ARMPA, the RMPA/EIS continues to fail to disclose the basis by which private lands can be considered in a federal land management planning document. This seems to suggest a de-facto critical habitat designation without a listed species. While section 4 of the ESA can take into consideration conservation efforts on state and private lands to avoid a listing, BLM has no authority under FLPMA to apply land use plan restrictions on private land. The RMPA/EIS applies BLM Sage-Grouse habitat management area definitions, designated through the BLM planning process specifically for BLM administered land to private land; including population areas, PHMA and BSU's. As stated in part in the 2015 Utah Greater Sage-Grouse Proposed LUPA/Final EIS on page 2-4, population areas were "identified by the BLM and Forest Service" that were not entirely consistent with the state-identified SGMAs. Additionally the 2015 Utah ARMPA glossary definitions for "Population Areas" and "Planning Areas" further support the assumption that population areas were established for "all lands" within the planning area including private land. The wording "regardless of jurisdiction" which was added to the definition of Planning Area in the RMPA/EIS Glossary clearly supports this assumption: "geographical area for which resource management plans are developed and maintained regardless of jurisdiction." The term PHMA was identified during the planning process and specific objectives were identified on page 2-3 in the ARMPA to designate PHMA: "Objective SSS-1: Designate PHMA that are large enough to stabilize populations in the short-term and enhance populations over the long-term." The term "designated" continues to be consistently used in conjunction with PHMA throughout the RMPA/EIS. As defined in the RMPA/EIS glossary, in Utah, BSUs are synonymous with PHMA within a geographic area identified as a population area. Because the disturbance criteria and density cap would count all applicable disturbances within PHMA in any given BSU, including those on non-federal land, it appears to impart that the Plan intends to manage uses of non-federal land under the Management Alignment Alternative. This assumption is further supported by language in the RMPA/EIS on pages 2-10 and 2-12 which states: "In PHMA, manage discrete anthropogenic disturbances so they cover less than 3 percent of 1) PHMA associated with a Greater Sage-Grouse population area." "If the 3 percent anthropogenic disturbance cap is exceeded on all lands (regardless of land ownership) within Greater Sage-Grouse PHMA in any given population area (BSU), then no further discrete anthropogenic disturbances (subject to applicable laws and regulations, such as the Mining Law of 1872 [as amended], valid existing rights, etc.) will be permitted by the BLM within Greater Sage-Grouse PHMA in any given population area (BSU) until the disturbance has been reduced to less than the cap." "Subject to applicable laws and regulations and valid existing rights, if the average density of one energy and mining facility per 640 acres (the density cap) is exceeded on all lands (regardless of land ownership) in PHMA within a proposed project analysis area, then no further disturbance from energy or mining facilities will be permitted by BLM…" Additionally, the language in the Executive Summary on page ES-8 in the RMPA/EIS is implicit in identifying that the intent is to "manage" all PHMA (including private) which accounts for over 95% of Greater Sage-Grouse populations in Utah: "The Management Alignment Alternative focuses management on PHMA to protect the habitats that support over 95 percent of Greater Sage-Grouse populations in Utah." Based on the direction in the RMPA/EIS, the density and disturbance factor applies specifically to PHMA and PHMA should only be used in reference to those lands administered by the BLM as defined in part on page 1-3 in the RMPA/EIS: "PHMA-Areas prioritized for managing Greater Sage-Grouse populations (management is only applicable to actions on BLM-administered lands)…" Additionally the RMPA on page 1-5 states that: "Lands addressed in the RMPA/EIS will be BLM-administered land in Greater Sage-Grouse habitat, including surface and split-estate lands with federal subsurface mineral rights. Any decisions in the RMPA/EIS will apply only to BLM-administered lands." Applying the PHMA habitat designation to lands "regardless of ownership" is not consistent with this direction. Additionally, the glossary definition for PHMA in the RMPA/EIS no longer clarifies that PHMA is specific to "BLM administered Lands" it now appears to include "all": "Areas that have been identified as having the highest conservation value to maintaining sustainable Greater Sage-Grouse populations; they include breeding, late brood-rearing, and winter concentration areas." Also problematic is Figure 2-2b (GRSG Biologically Significant Units and Priority Habitat Management Areas) which applies BSU and PHMA designations to private land and Figure 2-1 (Management Alignment Alternative) on page 2-18 which assigns the PHMA designation to Total Surface (acres); "regardless of land ownership."4 Definitions and management actions associated with BLM habitat designations need to be removed from private land as they apply specifically to BLM administered lands; therefore there is no basis for including private land in density and disturbance calculations. 2.4.28 Wild Horse and Burro Wild Horses The DEIS states that impacts from wild horses were dismissed from detailed analysis. DEIS at ES-5. The DEIS states that wild horses were properly analyzed in the 2015 FEIS and that "no new insights into the impacts of wild horses and burros, fence collision, recreation, or noise on Greater Sage-Grouse have been developed (Hanser et al. 2018, p. 2)." DEIS at 3-3. The 2015 FEIS stated that In the Rock Springs Field Office, management of wild horses to consider wildlife, watershed, and other resource needs could provide Special Status Species wildlife with adequate forage, habitat cover and water, and could provide habitat protection for special status plants. Water developments to improve herd distribution and manage forage utilization for wild horses could reduce grazing pressure possibly providing additional forage and habitat for special status wildlife. FEIS at 4-263. This is the only language in the 2015 FEIS that assesses impacts of wild horses under the No Action Alternative. The problems with this analysis are profound and many, including: * The 2015 FEIS assumed a 20% population growth rate but studies by the State of Wyoming indicate that some HMAs are growing at 42% or more. Post gather flights of the HMAs in the Rock Springs Field Office indicate that 30 days after gathering the Adobe Town, Salt Wells, and Divide Basin HMAs, wild horse numbers were already above AML. Thus, there is no way the BLM can state that impacts from wild horses have changed because wild horse numbers have exploded across Wyoming. The impacts are not quantitatively or qualitatively the same as they were in 2015. * The DEIS completely misses the point. Regardless of whether there is new published literature, there are new impacts. The BLM may not rely on the lack of published studies to conclude that there are no new impacts -the BLM's duty to take a hard look at the impact of horses on sage-grouse is categorical. Moreover, the BLM must use its expertise in this area to synthesize raw data such as growing horse populations to determine the impacts on sage-grouse. * Secretarial Order provides the BLM with ample justification to reconsider the impacts of wild horses and to adjust AMLs if necessary during a land use planning process. See Secretarial Order 3362 at §b(5)(ii). USFWS recognized that feral equids and ungulates merited different management. COT at 24. COT recommended maintaining AMLs but did not understand the wild horse program or appreciate the fact that BLM has never maintained the AMLs. As acknowledged in April 27, 2018 Report to Congress Management Options for a Sustainable Wild Horse and Burro Program wild horse numbers are double the national AML. Even in Wyoming, which has operated under Consent Decrees, BLM has not maintained AML and is conducting a gather that will not reduce wild horses to AML. The HMAs include PHMA, particularly in Sweetwater County. Notwithstanding the fact that wild horses graze year-round, directly compete for habitat with GrSG and have documented adverse impacts on vegetation, NTT dedicates less than a page to analyze the effects of wild horses on GRSG habitat. The 2015 Plan did little better providing only that BLM should maintain AML. The NTT Report falls woefully short of adequately addressing the documented impacts of year-round grazing by wild horses on sagebrush and related habitat. See Ex. 5, Ramey et al. at 45, 49 The NTT Report assumes that wild horses be managed within existing AML's but the report makes no mention of reproduction rates, fertility measures, gather frequency, or the basic principles that drive wild horse management. The NTT Report does not describe or distinguish the biological differences in grazing habits and patterns of wild horses and livestock but COT does. COT at ii. Recent DOI Wild Horse report and S.O. 3362 confirms Coalition's comments on this issue from 2014 on. Per individual animal, horses consume more forage than cattle or sheep and remove more of the plant which limits vegetative recovery. COT at 46. Wild horses also travel great distances and act as vectors for invasive plant species. Id. The irreducible conclusion is that wild horses, unlike cattle or sheep, have significant impacts on GRSG habitat that the NTT Report and 2015 Plan do not describe or analyze. Virtually all of the Wyoming BLM AMLs were set in the grazing EIS written in the early 1980s, decades before sage-grouse were first considered to be in decline. Thus reliance on AMLs as having no adverse impact on sage-grouse habitat is seriously flawed. Wyoming HMAs include a significant percent of PHMA, such as in the Salt Wells HMA and the Divide Basin HMA. The 2018 DEIS repeats the errors made in 2015 by assuming AML is sufficient. Unfortunately, SGIT in Wyoming did as well. Page 2-35: Comparison of Alternatives. MA-LG-6. The county understands that the listed stipulations may need to be enacted when Land Health Standards are not being met. However, we also restate our concern that range conditions are often being deteriorated not just by livestock; but by the presence of wild horses and burros. At stated in Table 3-7 (Pages 3-12 and 3-13), the population of wild horses and burros in Utah Herd Management Areas is estimated at 5,299, while the Appropriate Management Level population is 1,956. This excess wild horse and burro population must be better controlled if Land Health Standards are to be met to the benefit of the grouse. Duchesne County encourages the BLM to include more effective management tools in this plan amendment or by other means to help accomplish this task. 2.4.29 Fire and Fuels Issue #4: Restoration and Rehabilitation not adequately assessed and May Not Reflect Achievable Conditions The LUPAs have significant flaws in assessing restoration and rehabilitation potential and impacts outside of fire rehabilitation. The documents do not address the need to prioritize areas for restoration where natural disturbance such as fire has occurred. They also do not address the need to evaluate unintended negative consequences, as well as the cost and the likelihood of success in restoration projects. The document also does not discuss areas that have crossed an ecological threshold. Specifically, the GRSG LUPA in (at least) Utah, include the following Management Action which demonstrates these flaws / consequences: MA-LG-13: In PHMA, evaluate the role of existing seedings that are currently composed of primarily introduced perennial grasses to determine if they should be restored to sagebrush or habitat of higher quality for GRSG. If existing seedings provide value in conserving or enhancing GRSG habitats, then no restoration will be necessary. Assess the compatibility of these seedings for GRSG habitat during the land health assessments. Issue #4, Recommendation 4: Priorities for re-establishment of sagebrush cover should be re-evaluated with "recently burned native areas" receiving first consideration. The post burn probability of expanding the range of invasive species or noxious weeds makes fire rehabilitation efforts a top priority. Extreme caution must be exercised with any proposal designed to convert nonnative perennial grasslands (especially those within lower elevation Wyoming big sagebrush sites) to a sagebrush dominated habitat with native understory. State and transition models should be utilized when setting project goals. Under current technology and funding, confidence in any conversion attempt is lacking, and any commitment by this planning process to do so is unrealistic; resulting to unachievable expectations. Issue 4: DEIS Comment 4: The DEIS at page 2-36 appropriately removes MA-LG-13 (aka "No similar action"3 ). It is critical that BLM consider carry this recommendation Page 3-14: Section 3.8. Wildland Fire Management. It is interesting to note that, since the 2015 BLM plan amendments, the acreage in Utah treated with the goal of improving sage grouse habitat has exceeded the acreage of habitat lost to wildfire. The county looks forward to working with the BLM in the upcoming programmatic EIS projects associated with fuel breaks and habitat restoration. Duchesne County's Resource Management Plan encourages federal agencies to continue such active vegetation management for the benefit of wildlife and to reduce fuel loads in the event of a wildfire. 2.4.30 Travel and Transportation Management Page 2 -38 First Row. Consultation alone with state and local governments regarding transportation facilities is inadequate. NEPA, FLPMA and a host of CEQ regulations require consistency, cooperation and coordination with state and local governments. In addition, BLM manages 0 miles of transportation facilities in Garfield County as reported by the agency under 23 CFR 460. BLM has reported it has no jurisdiction over any road in Garfield County for approximately 20 years. Inasmuch as 23 CFR 460 is a federal reporting requirement and BLM is required to accurately report mileage under its jurisdiction, it can be safely stated that BLM has no management control over roads in Garfield County. Furthermore, BLM is the servient estate where RS2477 rights occupy BLM ground. BLM cannot merely consult with the County; BLM needs to operate without impacting County rights of way and in a spirit of cooperation and coordination. This section needs to be revised. DEIS at page 2-39 appropriately removes MA-TTM-3 ("No similar action"). BLM should also clarify that any remaining travel management direction would not apply to permitted actions, including the management of livestock grazing permits. It is critical that BLM carry this recommendation forward in the FEIS, and implement a proposed action in the ROD that adopts the removal of MA-TTM-3. 2.4.31 Cumulative Impacts BLM's Cumulative Impacts Analysis is Insufficient and Invalid The BLM is required to consider the cumulative environmental impacts to sage-grouse and sage-grouse habitat in the sage-grouse land use plan amendment EIS it has prepared. Cumulative environmental impacts are: The impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such actions. 40 C.F.R. § 1508.7. "Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time." Id. Cumulative impacts must be considered in the scope of an EIS. Id. § 1508.25(c). Despite the requirement to consider cumulative environmental impacts in the sage-grouse land use plan amendment EISs, the BLM has failed to do this adequately. For one, the BLM claims that the cumulative effects analysis from the 2015 sage-grouse land use plan amendments meets the cumulative effects analysis requirement that is needed now. As noted, tiering is only appropriate when a subsequent narrower environmental analysis relies on an earlier broader environmental analysis. See 40 C.F.R. § 1508.28 (a) (stating that tiering is appropriate when a program, plan, or policy environmental impact statement is used to support a new analysis of "lessor scope" or which is site-specific). But we do not have that here; the scope of the current analysis is as broad as the 2015 analysis. There is no "step down" present here, therefore the cumulative impacts analysis from the 2015 plans cannot "incorporate[ ] by reference the analysis in the 2015 Final EIS and applicable portions of the 2016 SFA Withdrawal Draft EIS . . . ." Utah DEIS at 4-32 to -33. In addition, BLM cannot simply incorporate the previous analysis by reference without justifying how it is appropriate and summarizing how it applies, neither of which has been done in the Draft EIS. See, 43 C.F.R. § 46.135(a). BLM also must ensure any incorporation by reference does not impede review by the public, which it surely does here. See 40 C.F.R. § 1502.21. Moreover, the purpose and need for the 2018 EISs differs from that of the 2015 EISs, which underscores why neither tiering nor incorporation by reference is appropriate. Secondly, in each of the six 2018 EISs the BLM lists a number of projects that it claims reflect the cumulative effects impacts that are applicable here. See, e.g., Table 4-4 in the Utah DEIS. But this list of projects fails to incorporate many relevant projects that should be considered in the cumulative effects analysis. In Wyoming, for example, neither the Normally Pressured Lance or Converse County oil and gas projects are listed. See Utah DEIS at Table 4-4, pages 4-47 to -48. These are two mammoth projects, that will involve drilling thousands of oil and gas wells which will have significant impacts on sage-grouse and sage-grouse habitats. See, https://www.blm.gov/programs/planning-and-nepa/plans-in-development/wyoming/npl and https://www.blm.gov/programs/planning-and-nepa/plans-in-development/wyoming/converse-county-oil-andgas-project. (presenting the Normally Pressured Lance and Converse County EISs). Neither of these projects were considered in the 2015 EISs. In Utah the Greater Chapita Wells Natural Gas Infill Project is not considered in the Utah sage-grouse plan amendment EIS. Utah DEIS at Table 4-4, pages 4-41 to 42. This project could involve the drilling of 2808 natural gas wells in Uintah County, which is prime sage-grouse habitat. See https://eplanning.blm.gov/epl-frontoffice/eplanning/planAndProjectSite.do?methodName=renderDefaultPlanOrProjectSite&projectId=37362. There are other projects missing from the Range Wide Impacts from Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Future Actions table in the Utah DEIS. Notably, Montana is entirely ignored in the BLM's cumulative impacts analysis, which is clearly impermissible. In addition, while in Wyoming (and the other states), past and upcoming oil and gas lease sales are mentioned, see Utah DEIS at Table 4-4 at 4-47 to -48, the list is incomplete. The June Wyoming lease sale (198,588 acres) is mentioned but neither the upcoming September (366,151 acres) or December (698,589 acres) lease sales are discussed. See https://eplanning.blm.gov/epl-frontoffice/eplanning/planAndProjectSite.do?methodName=dispatchToPatternPage&currentPageId=125997 and http://rockymountainwild.org/upcoming_lease. The same is true in other states. For example, in Utah, the Utah DEIS says 646 acres of oil and gas leases will be offered in Habitat Management Areas (HMA) in June, but it fails to mention the 158,944 acres (with 45,227 acres that had been previously offered) that will be offered for lease in September. See https://eplanning.blm.gov/epl-frontoffice/eplanning/planAndProjectSite.do?methodName=renderDefaultPlanOrProjectSite&projectId=103243 &dctmId=0b0003e8810c3ec2. The same is true in other states. The BLM should review the list of projects shown in Tables 4-3 or 4-4 (depending on the state) causing cumulative impacts and ensure they are as comprehensive as is required to include "the incremental impact[s] . . . when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions." We note again the projects we have mentioned were not considered in the 2015 sage-grouse plan amendment EISs. These are "collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time" that must be considered in the cumulative impacts analysis, but which have not been. Under Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) guidance, BLM must consider the current aggregate effects of past actions in a cumulative impacts analysis. CEQ, Guidance on the Consideration of Past Actions in Cumulative Effects Analysis, available at https://ceq.doe.gov/docs/ceq-regulations-andguidance/regs/Guidance_on_CE.pdf. This means the BLM must consider what the impacts of implementing the 2015 plans has been on cumulative impacts. BLM cannot just incorporate the 2015 plans by reference as its cumulative effects analysis, rather it must consider the "identifiable present effects of past actions," which the 2015 plans clearly are. Under the 2015 plans BLM has taken hundreds of actions, and in total those actions have had cumulative environmental impacts. An analysis of those cumulative impacts is missing from the current EISs, which is not permissible. "A cumulative impact analysis "must be more than perfunctory; it must provide 'a useful analysis of the cumulative impacts of past, present, and future projects."" N. Plains Res. Council, Inc. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 668 F.3d 1067, 1076 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Kern v. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 284 F.3d 1062, 1075 (9th Cir. 2002) (additional citation omitted). "To be useful to decision makers and the public, the cumulative impact analysis must include "some quantified or detailed information; . . . general statements about possible effects and some risk do not constitute a hard look absent a justification regarding why more definitive information could not be provided."" 668 F.3d at 1076 (quoting Ocean Advocates v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, 402 F.3d 846, 868 (9th Cir. 2004)) (additional citation omitted). Here the BLM has offered nothing more than a perfunctory cumulative impacts analysis. There is no useful analysis of past projects; the dozens if not hundreds of approved projects implementing the 2015 sage-grouse plans. There is no quantifiable or detailed information about those projects, and there are not even any general statements about the cumulative impacts of those projects, many of which have undergone a NEPA analysis. Based on the above, it is evident the cumulative impacts analyses in the Utah DEIS is invalid and must be expanded to fully address the cumulative impacts from the amendments. The Draft EIS does not assess how these proposed amendments in Utah may impact populations in nearby states. Given greater sage-grouse populations cross state boundaries and because there are seven BLM state offices revising their plans, we recommend the Final EIS include a cumulative, cross-boundary effects analysis to assess the combined effects to greater sage-grouse populations and habitats associated with the revisions. Specifically, we recommend the cumulative effects consider current greater sage-grouse population conditions and trends compared against the expected effects of current management practices. This page intentionally left blank. Appendix 3 Current Conditions of GHMA in Utah Appendix 3. Current Conditions of GHMA in Utah Based on public comments, coordination with cooperating agencies, and internal review during the 2018 DEIS review process, the BLM has compiled the following information regarding the current status and condition of general habitat management areas (GHMA) across Utah. As part of this appendix, the BLM looked at five specific items of interest associated with GHMA throughout Utah. Those specific items were BLM management and decision acres, existing mineral developments and leases, current disturbances, leks and seasonal Greater Sage-Grouse habitat, and connectivity. The BLM presented information on these items because they relate to decision space, managerial discretion, habitat availability, linkages, and impacts that reflect the resources and issues facing the continued use of GHMA by Greater Sage-Grouse throughout Utah. To provide specific areas of analysis, the BLM has grouped GHMA in Utah into the following 10 distinct areas, including an overall statewide analysis, and further analysis has been provided in this appendix: UTAH’S GHMA GROUPS • South Slope • Wasatch Plateau • Ibapah • Deadman Bench • Lucerne • Bald Hills • Book Cliffs • Rich • West Tavaputs • Sheeprocks STATEWIDE Total Habitat Management Area Acres • 1,684,820 acres in GHMA • 5,600,900 acres in priority habitat management areas (PHMA) BLM Decision Area • 440,100 of the BLM-administered surface acres are in GHMA • 178,000 of the BLM-administered mineral estate acres are in GHMA • 2,079,900 of the BLM-administered surface acres are in PHMA • 1,319,400 of the BLM-administered mineral estate acres are in PHMA Existing Utah Division of Oil, Gas, and Mining (DOGM) Wells, All Surface Management Agencies • 1,695 (85%) of the 2,000 DOGM wells are in GHMA Authorized BLM Leases • 245,981 acres leased on GHMA • 127,949 acres leased on PHMA Disturbance Acres • 20,084 (1.2%) acres in GHMA • 42,383 (0.8%) acres in PHMA Leks/Seasonal Habitat • 22 (5%) of the 366 leks that are in Utah’s habitat management areas are in GHMA • 648,695 of the total 4,868,550 seasonal habitat acres in habitat management areas are in GHMA SOUTH SLOPE AREA Total Habitat Management Area Acres • 472,416 acres in GHMA • 279,615 acres in PHMA BLM Decision Area • 49,909 of the BLM-administered surface acres are in GHMA • 23,374 of the BLM-administered mineral estate acres are in GHMA • 51,771 of the BLM-administered surface acres are in PHMA • 66,239 of the BLM-administered mineral estate acres are in PHMA Existing DOGM Wells All Surface Management Agencies • 785 (99%) of the 793 DOGM wells are in GHMA Authorized BLM Leases • 41,927 acres leased on GHMA • 7,582 acres leased on PHMA Disturbance Acres • 4,718 acres in GHMA • 1,593 acres in PHMA Leks/Seasonal Habitat • 8 (33%) of the 24 Leks that fall within the habitat management areas are in GHMA • 302,628 of the total 557,429 modeled seasonal habitat acres are in GHMA GHMA Contribution to Connectivity Over the past several years radio-collars and GPS transmitters have been used to document movements of Greater Sage-Grouse on Little Mountain. One female was documented moving just north of the South Slope GHMA area1 (Utah Division of Wildlife Resources [UDWR] 2018). There are no physical barriers that would pose a substantial hurdle to natural movement into the South Slope GHMA area from the PHMA area just north. The radio-collared birds have also been documented moving west, back and forth from public lands to Ute tribal lands, although none of the birds have moved farther west than Whiterocks Canyon2 (UDWR 2018). There is high connectivity potential for the Greater Sage-Grouse populations that use the South Slope GHMA area, the PHMA area, and Ute tribal lands. 1 Brian Maxfield, UDWR Biologist, personal communication 2 Ibid. Appendix 3.

Two of the birds were found dead north of Highway 40, near the Kay and Escalante Ranches, and the third died near the lek area3 (UDWR 2018). There are no documented instances of these birds moving to Blue Mountain. Anecdotally, several years ago a conservation officer did see Greater Sage-Grouse gliding off the south-facing cliffs of Blue Mountain toward the Deadman Bench area; however, it is unknown whether the Greater Sage-Grouse actually moved to the Deadman Bench area. Very little is known about the connectivity of the Greater Sage-Grouse population in the Deadman Bench GHMA area to other populations, due to lack of data. 3 Brian Maxfield, UDWR Biologist, personal communication BOOK CLIFFS AREA Habitat Management Area Acres • 410,924 acres in GHMA • 0 acres in PHMA BLM Decision Area • 136,437 of the BLM-administered surface acres are in GHMA • 54,253 of the BLM-administered mineral estate acres are in GHMA • 0 of the BLM-administered surface acres are in PHMA • 0 of the BLM-administered mineral estate acres are in PHMA Existing DOGM Wells All Surface Management Agencies • 262 DOGM wells are in GHMA Authorized BLM Leases • 93,390 acres leased on GHMA • 0 acres leased on PHMA Disturbance Acres • 4,787 acres in GHMA Leks/Seasonal Habitat • 3 Leks fall within the GHMA habitat management area • 153,243 of the total 153,243 modeled seasonal habitat acres are in GHMA GHMA Contribution to Connectivity There was one telemetry study done in the Book Cliffs GHMA area on Greater Sage-Grouse in 2007 and 2008. The movement data from the study, indicated that males and broodless hens remained near the leks on East and Middle Bench in the spring and moved approximately 7.7 to 12 miles to Willow Creek and Agency Draw during the summer (Smith 2009). Brood-rearing hens used the Willow Creek area. During the fall, most Greater Sage-Grouse moved back to East and Middle Bench; however, in 2007 and 2008 some males were observed using Agency Draw and Willow Creek in November (Smith 2009). Smith documented a 17.5-mile movement of a hen from Seep Ridge to Ute tribal land; it remained in that area throughout the summer. Greater Sage-Grouse are known to inhabit tribal lands, but very little information is known about the status of these populations and their connectivity to other populations. Other than Smith’s movement data, very little is known about the connectivity of the Greater Sage-Grouse population in the Book Cliffs GHMA area. References Smith, L.

There are seven known leks in the area, six of which have been active over the past 10 years, with an average total male lek attendance of 635 (UDWR 2017). There has been a steady increase in West Tavaputs population over the past 10 years, with the past 5 years showing all time high lek counts6 (UDWR 2017). Telemetry monitoring suggests the Greater Sage-Grouse are using most of the mid-to high-elevation sagebrush areas on the plateau to meet breeding, nesting, and brood-rearing habitat needs. During winters, birds are moving to three primary locations lower on the plateau: Lower Steer Ridge, Sage Brush Flats, and Harmon Canyon. These wintering areas are relatively short distance migrations (0.3 to 4 Brian Maxfield, UDWR Biologist, personal communication 5 Ibid. 6 Ibid. 3 miles), depending on snow depths. There is evidence that Greater Sage-Grouse sometimes winter north of Nine Mile Canyon and mix with Anthro Mountain Greater Sage-Grouse 7 (UDWR 2018). Greater Sage-Grouse wintering areas were identified approximately 22 miles east of Anthro Mountain, and some Greater Sage-Grouse from Anthro Mountain were located approximately 6 to 22 miles southeast of Anthro Mountain (Duvuvuei 2013). These wintering areas are in the West Tavaputs GHMA area. Resident Greater Sage-Grouse from the Anthro Mountain population have been documented moving from Anthro Mountain to Bishops Ridge on the Tavaput Mountains8 (Forest Service 2012; Gruber 2012). Recent GPS data has indicated movements from Emma Park to the West Tavaputs area9 (UDWR 2018). Greater Sage-Grouse that were translocated to Anthro Mountain from Parker Mountain and also resident Anthro birds were documented moving from Anthro Mountain to Emma Park and Whitemore Park (Gruber 2012; Duvuvuei 2013). There was also evidence of Greater Sage-Grouse from a neighboring population on Anthro Mountain migrating nearly 25 miles to summer on Emma Park (Coleman 2004). All of these aforementioned movements may indicate potential connectivity between West Tavaputs, Wasatch Plateau, and Anthro Mountain Greater Sage-Grouse populations, as well as surrounding populations. References Coleman, T. 2004.

Recent GPS data has indicated movements from Emma Park to the West Tavaputs area10 (UDWR 2018). Greater Sage-Grouse that were translocated to Anthro Mountain, a neighboring population, from Parker Mountain and also resident radio-collared Anthro Mountain birds were documented moving from Anthro Mountain to Emma Park and Whitemore Park and back to Anthro Mountain11 (Gruber 2012; Duvuvuei 2013; Forest Service 2018). In 2002, a hen from Anthro Mountain was recorded nesting in Emma Park to overwinter, and then moving back to Anthro Mountain in the spring12 (Coleman 2004; Forest Service 2018). Even though Anthro Mountain is not encompassed in a habitat management area in the 2015 ROD/ARMPA for the BLM, birds from Anthro Mountain have been documented moving north up to Highway 40 and 6 to 18 miles southeast of Anthro Mountain (Gruber 2012; Duvuvuei 2013). Also, a radio-collared bird that was translocated to Anthro Mountain from Parker Mountain was recaptured on a lek near Fruitland (Gruber 2012). 10 Brian Maxfield, UDWR Biologist, personal communication 11 B. Christensen, US Forest Service, personal communication 12 Ibid. All these aforementioned movements may indicate potential connectivity between the West Tavaputs, Wasatch Plateau, and Anthro Mountain Greater Sage-Grouse populations, as well as surrounding populations. GHMA in the western portion of the Wasatch Plateau is not known to be significantly important in providing habitat for existing populations or for providing connectivity to other populations. In general, physical barriers (i.e., conifer and topography) contribute to these areas being relatively isolated and therefore, pose a substantial hurdle to natural movements and connectivity between any of the nearest Greater Sage-Grouse populations. References Coleman, T. 2004.

There is usable sagebrush and brood-rearing habitat in the GHMA area13 (UDWR 2018). The Lucerne GHMA area is likely an extension of the Greater Sage-Grouse habitat and population in Wyoming. There is a high probability that the Lucerne GHMA population is connected to the Wyoming population. Connectivity to other populations in Utah is unknown due to lack of data. 13 Brian Maxfield, UDWR Biologist, personal communication RICH AREA Total Habitat Management Area Acres • 197,900 acres in GHMA • 1,051,000 acres in PHMA BLM Decision Area • 300 of the BLM-administered surface acres are in GHMA • 23,606 of the BLM-administered mineral estate acres are in GHMA • 167,000 of the BLM-administered surface acres are in PHMA • 178,400 of the BLM-administered mineral estate acres are in PHMA Existing DOGM Wells All Surface Management Agencies • 0 of the 10 DOGM wells are in GHMA Authorized BLM Leases • 0 acres leased on GHMA • 4,448 acres leased on PHMA Disturbance Acres • 1,485 acres in GHMA • 6,039 acres in PHMA Leks/Seasonal Habitat • 7 (10%) of the 67 leks that fall within the habitat management areas are in GHMA • 60,952 of the total 877,914 modeled seasonal habitat acres are in GHMA GHMA Contribution to Connectivity Multiple radio-telemetry studies (VHF and GPS) have been conducted in the Rich area; however, telemetry information has not documented movements to GHMA on the western portion of the Rich area. No birds have been marked in any of the GHMA next to the Rich area (including the GHMA around Jordanelle Reservoir). Telemetry monitoring conducted in the Morgan-Summit area (25 VHF collars and 10 GPS transmitters) documented that most marked Morgan-Summit birds stayed within a local, small area throughout the year; however, three females moved out of immediate habitat area during the winter. The notable winter movements were two hens that moved southeast, in consecutive years, to GHMA near known leks near Rockport Reservoir and Jordanelle Reservoir. The hens were documented to be with other unmarked hens. It is unknown how important the Jordanelle Reservoir general habitat wintering areas are for the populations in PHMA. While there is an unquantifiable link between Morgan-Summit area and the Jordanelle Reservoir GHMA, no telemetry information exists for the Jordanelle Reservoir birds (GHMA). Additionally, telemetry information from birds in the Strawberry population, the nearest population, does not document any movements to the GHMA in the Jordanelle Reservoir area. (The BLM status of this habitat has little impact on Greater Sage-Grouse since it is primarily private lands.) SHEEPROCKS AREA Total Habitat Management Area Acres • 184,500 acres in GHMA • 646,600 acres in PHMA BLM Decision Area • 52,820 of the BLM-administered surface acres are in GHMA • 34,510 of the BLM-administered mineral estate acres are in GHMA • 381,100 of the BLM-administered surface acres are in PHMA • 111,200 of the BLM-administered mineral estate acres are in PHMA Existing DOGM Wells All Surface Management Agencies • 0 DOGM wells in Habitat Management Areas Authorized BLM Leases • 0 acres leased on GHMA • 6,869 acres leased on PHMA Disturbance Acres • 1,940 acres in GHMA • 4,322 acres in PHMA Leks/Seasonal Habitat • 0 of the 9 leks that fall within the habitat management areas are in GHMA • 2,957 of the total 434,749 modeled seasonal habitat acres are in GHMA GHMA Contribution to Connectivity Graduate students have conducted telemetry in the Sheeprocks area for 5 years, and additional telemetry has been conducted opportunistically. Between 2016 and 2018, birds from the Box Elder and Parker Mountain populations have been translocated into the high-quality habitat in the PHMA in the Sheeprocks population. Translocated and resident birds have been collared to help document movement patterns. Collar data indicate large movements from some translocated birds, though, there are no documented instances of birds moving from the core Sheeprocks area to the Tintic leks or to any other Greater Sage-Grouse populations in the state. Similarly, two years of limited telemetry information from collared Tintic birds do not indicate movements to the core Sheeprocks area; nevertheless, there have been reported sightings of birds in the area between the core Sheeprocks area and the Tintic area. The GHMA in the Sheeprocks area is not known to be important for providing important habitat for populations or connectivity to other populations. In general, physical barriers pose a substantial hurdle to natural movements of any of the nearest Greater Sage-Grouse populations, for example, the Great Salt Lake, the West Desert, Utah Lake, and the developments and mountains associated with the Wasatch Front. IBAPAH AREA Total Habitat Management Area Acres • 10,800 acres in GHMA • 88,800 acres in PHMA BLM Decision Area • 10,100 of the BLM-administered surface acres are in GHMA • 0 acres are BLM-administered mineral estate acres are in GHMA • 48,000 of the BLM-administered surface acres are in PHMA • 700 of the BLM-administered mineral estate acres are in PHMA Existing DOGM Wells All Surface Management Agencies • 0 DOGM wells in Habitat Management Areas Authorized BLM Leases • 0 acres leased on GHMA • 0 acres leased on PHMA Disturbance Acres • 81 acres in GHMA • 455 acres in PHMA Leks/Seasonal Habitat • 0 of the 4 Leks that fall within the habitat management areas are in GHMA • 3,692 of the total 56,411 modeled seasonal habitat acres are in GHMA GHMA Contribution to Connectivity This area has limited telemetry (VHF) data (11 birds) from 2005 to 2006. This information suggests that birds primarily use areas close to the leks during nesting, brood-rearing, and wintering; however, the farthest recorded movements were documented during the winter season, where birds moved as far as approximately 10 miles from the nearest lek. Habitat modelling suggests that there is some suitable habitat in the northeast corner of this GHMA. Although no birds have been documented in this area, it may still provide some level of habitat for birds. This area is not likely to be important for connectivity to the next nearest Greater Sage-Grouse population; this is because this population is relatively isolated to the east of the Sheeprocks population by approximately 60 miles. BALD HILLS AREA Total Habitat Management Area Acres • 21,200 acres in GHMA • 326,400 acres in PHMA BLM Decision Area • 8,300 of the BLM-administered surface acres are in GHMA • 1,241 of the BLM-administered mineral estate acres are in GHMA • 259,400 of the BLM-administered surface acres are in PHMA • 5,200 of the BLM-administered mineral estate acres are in PHMA Existing DOGM Wells All Surface Management Agencies • 0 DOGM wells in Habitat Management Areas Authorized BLM Leases • 0 acres leased on GHMA Disturbance Acres • 427 acres in GHMA • 3,765 acres in PHMA Leks/Seasonal Habitat • 0 of the 14 Leks that fall within the habitat management areas are in GHMA • 3,817 of the total 247,883 modeled seasonal habitat acres are in GHMA GHMA Contribution to Connectivity Greater Sage-Grouse GPS and VHF collars have been deployed throughout the Bald Hills Habitat Management Areas. To date, no birds have been documented using the GHMA; however, one study did indicate the relative “high probability” that Greater Sage-Grouse could use this area (Hansen 2016). Moreover, there is no known connectivity between the Bald Hills population of Greater Sage-Grouse and the Hamlin Valley population. Use of the Bald Hills GHMA areas as a corridor to Hamlin Valley would be the only logical reason birds would move into this GHMA area, and the likelihood of this, given habitat constraints, is low. Connectivity opportunities between the PHMA portions of the Bald Hills population and the Panguitch population of Greater Sage-Grouse is a more likely scenario (movement to the east). Reference Hansen, Erica P., "Influence of Disturbance on Greater Sage-Grouse Habitat Selection in Southern Utah" (2016).
