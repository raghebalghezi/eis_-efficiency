of Colonie, Albany County, NY Dear Ms. Krahling: Shumaker Consulting Engineering & Land Surveying, P.C., as a subconsultant to Clough Harbour & Associates, LLP, is providing environmental engineering services on behalf of the New York State Department of Transportation for the referenced project. We have a copy of a response from your office dated October 10, 2000, issued as a result of an initial request by Integrated Site Landscape Architects to review the project study area with respect to threatened and endangered species. However, since a significant amount of time has passed since the date of your response, we respectfully request that your office provide updated information on the presence of endangered and/or threatened species within the vicinity of the proposed roadway project located in the Town of Colonie, Albany County, New York. A portion of the Albany USGS Topographic Map is enclosed to assist with your review. We shall appreciate a written response at your earliest convenience to comply with scheduled project deadlines. If you have any questions or require further information, please contact this office. Very truly yours, SHUMAKER CONSULTING ENGINEERING & LAND SURVEYING, P.C. Eric B. Watkins Environmental Scientist II EBW/jmp Enclosure United States Department of the Interior FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE New York Field Office Long Island Field Office 3817 Luker Road, Cortland, NY 13045 3 Old Barto Rd., Brookhaven, NY 11719 Phone: (607) 753-9334 Phone: (631) 776-1401 Fax: (607) 753-9699 Fax: (631) 776-1405 Endangered Species Act List Request Response Cover Sheet This cover sheet is provided in response to a search of our website* for information regarding the potential presence of species under jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) within a proposed project area. Attached is a copy of the New York State County List of Threatened, Endangered, and Candidate Species for the appropriate county(ies). The database that we use to respond to list requests was developed primarily to assist Federal agencies that are consulting with us under Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) (87 Stat. 884, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). Our lists include all Federally-listed, proposed, and candidate species known to occur, as well as those likely to occur, in specific counties. The attached information is designed to assist project sponsors or applicants through the process of determining whether a Federally-listed, proposed, or candidate species and/or Òcritical habitatÓ may occur within their proposed project area and when it is appropriate to contact our offices for additional coordination or consultation. You may be aware that our offices have provided much of this information in the past in project-specific letters. However, due to increasing project review workloads and decreasing staff, we are now providing as much information as possible through our website. We encourage anyone requesting species list information to print out all materials used in any analyses of effects on listed, proposed, or candidate species. The Service routinely updates this database as species are proposed, listed, and delisted, or as we obtain new biological information or specific presence/absence information for listed species. If project proponents coordinate with the Service to address proposed and candidate species in early stages of planning, this should not be a problem if these species are eventually listed. However, we recommend that both project proponents and reviewing agencies retrieve from our online database an updated list every 90 days to append to this document to ensure that listed species presence/absence information for the proposed project is current. Reminder: Section 9 of the ESA prohibits unauthorized taking** of listed species and applies to Federal and non-Federal activities. For projects not authorized, funded, or carried out by a Federal agency, consultation with the Service pursuant to Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA is not required. However, no person is authorized to Òtake**Ó any listed species without appropriate authorizations from the Service. Therefore, we provide technical assistance to individuals and agencies to assist with project planning to avoid the potential for Òtake**,Ó or when appropriate, to provide assistance with their application for an incidental take permit pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA. Additionally, endangered species and their habitats are protected by Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA, which requires Federal agencies, in consultation with the Service, to ensure that any action it authorizes, funds, or carries out is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. An assessment of the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts is required for all Federal actions that may affect listed species. For instance, work in certain waters of the United States, including wetlands and streams, may require a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). If a permit is required, in reviewing the application pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (48 Stat. 401, as amended;16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.), the Service may concur, with or without recommending additional permit conditions, or recommend denial of the permit depending upon potential adverse impacts on fish and wildlife resources associated with project construction or implementation. The need for a Corps permit may be determined by contacting the appropriate Corps office(s).* For additional information on fish and wildlife resources or State-listed species, we suggest contacting the appropriate New York State Department of Environmental Conservation regional office(s) and the New York Natural Heritage Program Information Services.* Since wetlands, ponds, streams, or open or sheltered coastal waters may be present in the project area, it may be helpful to utilize the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) maps as an initial screening tool. However, they may or may not be available for the project area. Please note that while the NWI maps are reasonably accurate, they should not be used in lieu of field surveys for determining the presence of wetlands or delineating wetland boundaries for Federal regulatory purposes. Online information on the NWI program and digital data can be downloaded from Wetlands Mapper, http://wetlands.fws.gov/mapper_tool.htm. Project construction or implementation should not commence until all requirements of the ESA have been fulfilled. After reviewing our website and following the steps outlined, we encourage both project proponents and reviewing agencies to contact our office to determine whether an accurate determination of species impacts has been made.

While there are no ESA requirements for bald eagles after this date, the eagles continue to receive protection under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA). Please follow the Service's May 2007 Bald Eagle Management Guidelines to determine whether you can avoid impacts under the BGEPA for your projects. If you have any questions, please contact the endangered species branch in our office. 2 "While Indiana bats were known to winter in Albany County, we now believe they are likely extirpated or in such small numbers that it is unlikely that they would be present and impacted by any specific proposed projects in Albany, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, and Schoharie Counties.

This should be an official freedom of imfrmation request, howeverÉ. This large area is well developed in terms of commercial and residential. All are served by public water, Latham Water District. Latham WD draws its water from the Mohawk River, miles away, so no concern there. There may still be some very old private wells used for irrigation. We have no records that go back that far. Plus back then no records were officially kept. Most of the area is served by public sewers. there is a small pocket of commercial septic systems in the Old Nikkayuna/ Albany Shaker area just west of Rt I.87. In short there are no public or private drinking water wells that could be impacted by any work in the area you denoted. If you need any more information feel free to contact me 2 Tom Thomas J.

(SCE) conducted the preliminary asbestos screening conducted at the referenced project site and findings are contained within this summary report. 1.0 BACKGROUND The project consists of the construction/realignment of the I-87, Exit 3, Exit 4 and Access Airport Connector Road Improvements in Albany County. Impacted structures are identified as: Bridges ¥ BIN 1033141, I-87 SB over Albany Shaker Road (Replacement) ¥ BIN 1033142, I-87 NB over Albany Shaker Road (Replacement) Buildings ¥ None included at this time The objective of this screening is to identify impacted bridge components that are suspect asbestos-containing materials (ACM) and develop a sampling plan for future determination of asbestos content through laboratory analyses. 2.0 PRELIMINARY ASBESTOS SCREENING ¥ SCE conducted a preliminary asbestos screening of the bridge structures. Impacted materials that are ACM must be handled in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. A material is defined as an ACM under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1926.1101, if it contains greater than one percent (>1%) asbestos by weight. Preliminary Asbestos Screening Page 2 of 3 I-87, Exit 3/Exit 4 Access Improvements January 6, 2012 Town of Colonie, Albany County, New York PIN 1721.51, SCE Project No. 00458.00 Record plans were reviewed for each bridge structure. Table 1 lists the suspect ACMs identified on the record plans for each bridge structure. Table 1: Suspect ACMs Identified in Bridge Record Plans BIN (Year) Suspect ACM Location/comments BINs 1033141 & 1033142 (1957) Bituminous material (Item 61) Back of concrete wingwalls & abutments in contact with soil- not accessible Premoulded Bituminous Joint Filler Located at expansion joints Ð replaced in 1995 - paved over not accessible Compressed Asbestos Sheet Packing Top of backwall, beneath bridge deck Protective Coating for Metal (Item 300) Metal surfaces beneath metal grates (typically asbestos paint coating) SCE conducted a visual assessment of the bridge structures on December 29, 2011. Table 2 identifies the suspect ACM materials observed at each bridge structure, including the location of the material and the minimum number of bulk samples to be collected to confirm asbestos content. Table 2: Observed Suspect ACMs at Bridges Material Location BINS # of Samples per material 1033141 1033142 Paint Coating Steel girders below former grates * * * Paint Coating Remaining steel girders 3 3 6 Masonry Coating On abutment & pier pedestals concrete surfaces 3 3 6 Bearing pads Beneath bearings 3 3 6 Sheet packing Between top of backwall & bridge deck 3 3 6 Guide Rail Post Pads Beneath guiderail posts 3 3 6 # of Samples per Structure 15 15 30 * = Green paint coating previously sampled by inspectors from NYSDOT and identified as ACM, additional samples not required. NYSDOT protocol requires a minimum of three samples to be collected for each homogenous material at each bridge or building structure. The green paint coatings located beneath former grates were previously sampled by NYSDOT and determined to be ACM. Copies of the laboratory reports for the samples are attached. The preliminary asbestos screening was performed by New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL)-certified/United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)-accredited Asbestos Inspectors. Copies of the inspectorsÕ certifications and a copy of the SCE asbestos license are attached to this report. Suspect ACMs should be assessed prior to any rehabilitation or demolition activities.

Applicable regulations include National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) promulgated by USEPA and NYSDOL Industrial Code Rule 56 (ICR 56). 3.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The preliminary asbestos screening was performed in conformance with the NYSDOT Environmental Manual. A minimum of 30 samples for the 2 impacted bridges will be needed to adequately assess identified suspect materials for the presence of ACM.

Saladis Shumaker Consulting Engineering & Land Surveying, P.C. 143 Court Street Binghamton, NY 13901 Dear Ms. Saladis: In response to your recent request, we have reviewed the New York Natural Heritage Program database with respect to the proposed Interstate 87 Exit 3 Airport Connector, PIN 1721.51, in the Town of Colonie, Albany County. We have no recent records of rare or state-listed animals or plants, or of significant natural communities, at this site or in its immediate vicinity. Our database does have a historical record of a rare plant in the area of the proposed wetland mitigation site: in 1848, the rare orchid puttyroot (Aplectrum hyemale, listed by NYS as Endangered) was collected at ÒShakerÕs Woods south of Mill [Ann Lee] Pond.Ó We do not know the precise location of this collection, we have no recent information on this population, and there is uncertainty regarding its continued presence. We provide this information for your general reference. While its current status is not known, if suitable habitat for this plant, rich woods, is present in the vicinity of the project site, it is possible that it may still be found there. We recommend that any field surveys to the site include a search for this species, particularly at sites that are currently undeveloped and may still contain suitable habitat. If any rare plants or animals are documented during site visits, we request that information on the observations be provided to the New York Natural Heritage Program so that we may update our database. Information about many of the rare animals and plants in New York, including habitat, biology, identification, conservation, and management, are available online in Natural HeritageÕs Conservation Guides at www.guides.nynhp.org. For most sites, comprehensive field surveys have not been conducted; the enclosed report only includes records from our databases. We cannot provide a definitive statement as to the presence or absence of all rare or state-listed species or significant natural communities. This information should not be substituted for on-site surveys that may be required for environmental impact assessment. Sincerely, Joe Martens Commissioner  Nicholas Conrad Information Resource Coordinator 721 New York Natural Heritage Program August 29, 2013 Attn: Donald J. Lockwood 143 Court Street Shumaker Consulting Engineering & Land Surveying, P.C. Binghamton NY 13901 Dear Mr. Lockwood, The Albany County Agricultural and Farmland Protection Board met on August 29, 2013 to review the forms and maps you provided as well as other data provided by Albany County Office of Natural Resource Conservation, Albany County Soil and Water Conservation District, Cornell Cooperative Extension of Albany County and USDA Farm Service Agency. Following this review, we offer the following comments related to the economic effects to farmland relative to your proposed project: á As noted in the updated design report, the boundaries of Agricultural District #3 have changed. Parcel # 30-5-1 in the Town of Colonie is no longer included in the District and has been acquired by the Albany County Airport Authority. There are approximately 38 acres of districted land on the north side of Albany Shaker Rd. and 15 acres on Old Wolf Rd. that would be potentially impacted by the proposed alternatives. As stated in the updated design report, Òthe project right-of-way and limit of disturbance do not encroach on the Agricultural District #3.Ó á Parcels 30-5-1 and 30-5-9 in the Town of Colonie, owned by the Albany County Airport Authority, are no longer farmed. Lease agreements with farmers were not renewed as FAA policy no longer supports use of lands in the runway protection zone for growing grain or corn due to concerns over conflicts with wildlife. It is our understanding that these lands, including prime soils and soils of statewide importance, will be maintained as shrub land and will not be farmed. á Agricultural Assessment value of parcel 30-3-77 is estimated to be $22,193. The agricultural assessment value of farmland on Old Wolf Rd. is estimated to be $12,667. This farmland is used for the production of various vegetables. The current alternatives do not appear to encroach on these active farmlands therefore no economic impact is anticipated. á It appears that the only potential impact to farms in the project area would be the possibility of disrupted access during construction on Albany Shaker and/or Old Wolf Rd. and drainage issues that may arise during and/or after construction. Sincerely, Howard Zimmer, Chairman Albany County Agricultural and Farmland Protection Board Howard Zimmer Ð Chairman / Joseph Abbruzzese / Mark Stanton / Tom Gallagher / Herbert Reilly / Harold E.

When you have reached a tentative agreement on this issue with Eddie Person, please provide a map showing the proposed acquisition. In regard to Item #3, our discussion focused primarily on wetland restoration and creation opportunities, and it is in that context that I suggested a 1:1 ratio would be adequate given the proposed acquisition and protection component. I very much want to maintain a no-net loss of wetlands, and simple wetland enhancement would not achieve that. Some wetland enhancement may be appropriate as part of the overall mitigation proposal. Please contact me if you have any questions. Karl Parker >>> "Goetke, Diane (DOT)" <Diane.Goetke@dot.ny.gov>

The project study area includes I-87 between Sand Creek Road and Exit 5 (RM 87I 1108 2029), Wolf Road (known as Old Wolf Road) between the Exit 4 SB Exit Ramp and Albany-Shaker Road, Wolf Road between Albany-Shaker Road and Cerone Commercial Drive, and Albany-Shaker Road between Wolf Road and Meeting House Road. A total of approximately 8.0 miles of roadway within the Town of Colonie, Albany County are included in the project study area. There are two phases to the project. The first phase involves the replacement of the north and southbound bridges on I-87 over Albany-Shaker Road in the Town of Colonie in Albany County (BINs 1033141 and 1033142). Both of these bridges have numerous structural deficiencies including bearing and joint failure and concrete spalling. This phase also involves placing extensions on 6 culverts and installing stone aprons. The second phase involves access improvements between I-87, Wolf Road and the Albany International Airport. NEPA The entire project has been classified as a NEPA Class I in accordance with 23 CFR 771 which require the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement. Project Location Town of Colonie, Albany County Albany Quad Lat/Long 73¡47'45.173"W 42¡43'41.942"N Decimal Degrees -73 47.752876 42 43.699026 Federally Endangered or Threatened Species The US Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) Information, Planning and Conservation System (IPaC) website for Federally endangered species lists Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis), Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis), and bog turtle (Clemmys muhlenbergii). (See enclosed.) Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) and Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus) are also listed as endangered. Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) summer roosting habitat consists of dead, dying or live trees or snags with exfoliating or defoliating bark, or containing cracks or crevices. The project site is 12 miles from a priority 4 hibernaculum (Hailes Cave) in Albany County. Long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) Habitat for the summer may include day roosts in buildings, under tree bark or shutters, or caves during the night. Hibernation sites are often in mines or caves, and this species may co- STATE OF NEW YORK DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION - REGION ONE 50WOLF ROAD ALBANY, NEW YORK 12232 www.dot.ny.gov SAM ZHOU, P.E.

Foraging habitat includes forested hillsides and ridges, and small ponds or streams. The project site is located 12 miles from a Northern long-eared bat hibernaculum (Hailes Cave). There are no known capture or acoustical survey records or known roost areas in Region 1 for this species. This project was submitted to FHWA and USFWS under batch 3 for effects to the northern long-eared bat. A ÒNo JeopardyÓ response from the USFWS was received on July 3, 2014. (See enclosed.) The entire project will require the cutting of 50 trees. For the first phase, approximately 20 trees will need to be cut including poplar, cottonwood, red oak, silver maple, slippery elm and red maple. In order to protect these two species from project-related impacts, the trees will be cut between October 31st through March 31st. Because the trees will be cut during the time the bats are in their hibernacula, it will result in a Òmay effect but not likely to adversely effectÓ the Indiana and long-eared bat species. Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) - this invertebrate species is found in dry, sandy areas with open woods and clearings supporting wild blue lupine. This type of habitat is usually associated with pitch pine/scrub oak or oak savannah communities that are maintained by fire at an early stage of plant succession. The project site was evaluated for potential Karner blue habitat in June 2014 but none was found so there will be Òno effectÓ to the Karner blue butterfly. Bog turtle (Clemmys muhlenbergii) prefers habitat with cool, shallow, slow-moving water, deep soft muck soils, and tussock-forming herbaceous vegetation. In New York, the bog turtle is generally found in open, early successional types of habitats such as wet meadows or open calcareous bogs, generally dominated by sedges (Carex spp.) or sphagnum moss. A field visit in June 2014 showed that there is no suitable habitat on the project site. Therefore, there will be Òno effectÓ to the bog turtle from the project activities. Shortnose Sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) and Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus). In New York, these sturgeon are found only in the Hudson River and its immediate tributaries, where they move seasonally from New York Harbor to the Troy Dam. The Hudson River is 6 miles east of the project site so there will be Òno effectÓ to the sturgeon from project activities. Because the second phase of the project is scheduled to begin in 2019, prior to construction, the endangered species analysis will be reassessed based on current procedures and listed species. Bald Eagle Based on the Natural Heritage database, the nearest bald eagle nest is located 6 miles east on the Hudson River north of Troy. No bald eagle nests were found on the project site during a site visit in June 2014. Nationwide Permit NYSDOT anticipates that the work at these locations can be authorized under the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) General Permit Program (reauthorized March 2012) pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1344). Specifically, the proposed work can be accomplished in accordance with Nationwide Permit (NWP) 3 Ð Maintenance. If you have questions or require additional information, please contact our office as follows: Betty Ketcham, Environmental Contact Phone: (518) 485-9295 Fax: (518) 457-6887 E-mail: Elizabeth.Ketcham@dot.ny.gov Sincerely, Diane S.

O'Brien Federal Building llA Clinton Avenue, Suite 719 Albany, NY 12207 Dear Mr. Weibel: This responds to your August 12,2014, letter regarding the New York State Department of Transportation's (NYSDOT) proposed Interstate 87 Exit 4 Access Improvements - Phase 1 (PIN 1721.51) located in the Town of Colonie, Albany County, New York. We understand that the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is involved with funding the project. Pursuant to Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 (87 Stat. 884, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), the FHWA has determined that the proposed project may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect, the federally-listed endangered Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis). Given the location (no known roosting/foraging habitat), extent of tree removal (~20 trees), and the proposed conservation measures (e.g., conducting tree removal between November 1,2014, and March 31, 2015), we do not anticipate any adverse impacts to the Indiana bat. Therefore, we concur with your determination. The FHWA has also considered the potential for impacts to the northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis), but is not requesting U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) review or concurrence with any determinations for this species at this time. As you are aware, the northern long-eared bat is currently proposed for listing as an endangered species under the ESA and a final listing decision is expected in April 2015. At this time, no critical habitat has been proposed for the species. Pursuant to section 7(a)(4) of the ESA, federal action agencies are required to confer with the Service if their proposed action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the northern long-eared bat. Action agencies may also voluntarily confer with the Service if the proposed action may affect a proposed species.------------ -- - - ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Species proposed for listing are not afforded protection under the ESA; however, as soon as a listing becomes effective, the prohibition against jeopardizing its continued existence and "take'" applies regardless of an action's stage of completion. If the FHW A retains any discretionary involvement or control over on-the-ground actions that may affect the species after listing, section 7 consultation procedures apply. Additional information regarding the northern long-eared bat and conference procedures can be found at http://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/mammals/nlba/index.html. In addition, the FHWA has determined that the project will result in no effects to the federally-listed endangered Kamer blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) or the federally-listed threatened bog turtle (Clemmys [=Glyptemys muhlenbergii) as no suitable habitat for these species occurs at the project site. We have no additional comments on these species. No further coordination or consultation under the ESA is required with the Service at this time. Should project plans change, or if additional information on listed or proposed species or critical habitat becomes available, this determination may be reconsidered. The most recent compilation of federally-listed and proposed endangered and threatened species in New York is available for your information. Until the proposed project is complete, we recommend that you check our website every 90 days from the date of this letter to ensure that listed species presence/absence information for the proposed projects is current. * In addition to the above-referenced determinations regarding federally-listed or proposed species, the FHWA has also determined that the project will result in no effects to the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). As you are aware, bald eagles have been delisted pursuant to the ESA, but remain protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) (40 Stat. 755; 16 U.S.C. 703-712), the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA) (54 Stat. 250, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 668 et seq.), and by the State of New York. If eagles are found within the project area, the Service recommends that the NYSDOT follow the Bald Eagle Management Guidelines found on our website. The above comments pertaining to endangered species under our jurisdiction are provided pursuant to the ESA, MBT A, and BGEP A. This response does not preclude additional Service comments under other legislation. Any additional information regarding the proposed project and its potential to impact listed species should be coordinated with both this office and with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. ISection 3 of the ESA defmes "Take" as, "to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct. The term "Harm" is further defined by the Service to include significant habitat modification or degradation that results in death or injury to listed species by significantly impairing behavioral patterns such as breeding, feeding, or sheltering. "Harass" is further defined by the Service as actions that create the likelihood of injury to listed species to such an extent as to significantly disrupt normal behavior patterns which include, but are not limited to, breeding, feeding, or sheltering. 2Thank you for your time.

DOCUMENTATION PIN 1721.51.121 Interstate 87, Exit 3 / 4 Airport Access Improvements Town of Colonie, Albany County State of New York NY SHPO Project Review ID: 07PR05536  December 4, 2013  1. Project Description  The Project: Description and History The proposed Federally-funded project is a significant long-term capital investment linking two of the major transportation facilities of New York StateÕs Albany Capital District: Interstate 87 and the Albany International Airport.  The project area is located in the Town of Colonie, which is adjacent to the City of Albany. The general topography is flat to gently rolling. Along Wolf Road, to the east of Interstate 87 (I-87), is a densely developed suburban commercial area, characterized by a mix of office buildings, retail plazas, restaurants, hotels, and gas stations, each with individual parking lots. Further east of Wolf Road, outside of the project area, is typical suburban residential development, primarily single-family homes with a scattering of multi-family homes and low-rise apartment complexes. The west side of I-87, along Albany- Shaker Road, is rolling grass, scrub and farm fields. This portion of the project area was farmed for generations by the Engel family, although the Engel family discontinued their farming business in 2010.  The project proposes to improve access between Interstate 87 and the Albany International Airport, and between I-87 and Wolf Road. Safety and traffic operations will be improved at Exit 4. The project will be designed to not adversely impact I-87 mainline operations between Exit 2 and Exit 5 and to allow for future long-term improvements to I-87. Improving system connectivity between the existing pedestrian and bicycle facilities on Wolf Road and the facilities constructed as part of the Albany/Watervliet-Shaker Road project will also be considered during the evaluation of design alternatives.  Starting in the late 1970Õs and continuing into the early 1990Õs, a number of studies have looked at existing and future traffic operations in the project area. Each of these studies concluded that the existing I-87 interchanges would have difficulty handling the growth in traffic caused by expected increases in airport activity and continued economic development in the area without improvement to I-87 access. Based on these conclusions, the proposed project was added to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) capital program.  In 2000, NYSDOT initiated the project scoping process to develop project needs and objectives, and evaluate project issues, elements and initiatives which would have an effect on project scope, cost and schedule. This process included traffic data collection, conceptual alternative development, and development of over 50 conceptual design alternatives. Over the following 12 years, additional traffic studies and growth forecasts, further alternatives analysis, and input from project stakeholders have gradually winnowed the wide range of alternatives down to two alternatives: the Diamond Alternative and the Flyover Alternative.  Through 2012 and 2013, both the Diamond Alternative and Flyover Alternative were analyzed in great detail. When these final two alternatives were compared against each other, the Diamond Alternative proposed greater impacts to wetlands, more real-estate acquisition, the relocation of one residence and two active businesses, and overall higher construction costs and long-term maintenance costs than the Flyover Alternative. Additionally, since the Diamond Alternative is not the least environmentallydamaging reasonable alternative, NYSDOT faced significant challenges to obtaining permits for construction from the regulatory agencies involved, the New York State Department of Conservation and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. Ultimately, in November 2013, based on a balanced consideration of the impacts of these two alternatives, NYSDOT and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) jointly concluded that the Diamond Alternative is not a reasonable alternative, and the Diamond Alternative was dismissed from further consideration.  Why is the Project Needed? The proposed transportation project has been initiated to address the following needs within the Interstate 87 Exit 4 area:  Intersection Operating Conditions The project is necessary to provide improved access between Interstate 87 (I-87), Wolf Road, and the Albany International Airport. Within the project study area, six of the nine intersections evaluated have operational delays during the peak hours. These poor operations will continue to deteriorate in the future.  Safety The project is necessary to address safety concerns within the project study area. Safety concerns include existing I-87 Northbound exit ramp queuing back onto I-87, and operational and weave issues at the I-87 Southbound Service Road between Exit 5 and Exit 4. Three intersections exceed the statewide average crash rate for similar transportation facilities.  Structural Deficiencies The existing bridges carrying Interstate 87 over Albany-Shaker Road (Bridge Identification Numbers 1033141 and 1033142) are over 50 years old. These bridges are the only remaining bridges on Interstate 87 in Albany County dating from the original construction of the Interstate. The sufficiency ratings and bridge inspection for the bridges indicate that the bridgesÕ structural deficiencies need to be addressed. NYSDOT has installed temporary steel supports under the existing piers to partially address the deficient pier conditions.  Access The existing access limits the movement of goods between Interstate 87, the Albany International Airport, and the commercial corridor of Wolf Road, as well as the mobility of Park nÕ Ride and Airport shuttles between Wolf Road, Old Wolf Road, and the airport.  Land Use and Economic Growth The existing operational delays at intersections in the Exit 4 area inhibit mobility within the project area.  Objectives of the Project The following Primary Project Objectives were developed to recognize the overall goal of improving mobility and economic development for the Capital District. (1) Improve access between I-87 and the Albany International Airport without precluding future, longterm I-87 mainline improvements, and without impacting I-87 mainline operations between Exit 2 and Exit 5. (2) Improve access between I-87 and Wolf Road without precluding future, long-term I-87 mainline improvements, and without impacting I-87 mainline operations between Exit 2 and Exit 5. (3) Improve intersection operating conditions in the existing Exit 4 area and address safety concerns in the areas that exceed the statewide average accident crash rate for similar transportation facilities. (4) Eliminate the structural deficiencies associated with the I-87 northbound and southbound bridges over Albany-Shaker Road by providing bridges with a 50-year minimum service life.  In addition to the Primary Project Objectives, the following Secondary Objective was considered during the evaluation of design alternatives. (1) Improve system connectivity between the existing pedestrian/bicycle facilities on Wolf Road and the facilities constructed as part of the Albany/Watervliet-Shaker Road project.  The following considerations are also included in the evaluation of alternatives. (1) Impacts to existing sensitive environmental and cultural features in the project area. (2) Impacts to active agricultural land in the project area. (3) Impacts to viable commercial enterprises and other social and economic features in the project area. (4) A gateway effect between I-87 and the Albany International Airport is desired. (5) A pedestrian-friendly environment within the project area is desired. (6) Application of transportation system management, transportation demand management, and transit enhancements. (7) Project benefits versus cost.  Alternative Analysis More than 50 alternatives were evaluated on a conceptual level for the proposed project. During the long process of preliminary alternative analysis, many factors were considered, including: . the impacts to the long-operating Engel Farm; . potential impacts to the forested wetlands toward Ann Lee Pond; . locations of, and potential impacts to, vernal pools and wet meadows; . locations of, and potential impacts to, known historic sites and structures; . traffic patterns, traffic levels and forecasts; . interference with the Albany International AirportÕs Runway Protection Zone as defined by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); and . Interstate design parameters for I-87 (the Northway.)  In addition to comparison of the alternatives to the purpose and need statement, a review of the alternatives by the project stakeholders resulted in identification of one feasible alternative for consideration in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). This alternative, along with the No-Build Alternative, is described below.  No-Build Alternative This alternative provides for the continued maintenance of the existing highway by the NYSDOT maintenance forces with no capital funds being expended.  Alternative 1: Flyover Alternative The Flyover Alternative proposes construction of new ramps that will Òfly overÓ Interstate 87 to connect Interstate 87, Wolf Road and Albany-Shaker Road. The area of potential effects (APE) associated with the Flyover Alternative includes the area in which direct and indirect effects may occur as a result of proposed improvements including: . construction of new ramps to connect I-87 northbound and southbound to Albany-Shaker Road approximately 1000 ft west of the Albany-Shaker Road / Old Wolf Road intersection, and . construction of a new ramp to connect Albany-Shaker Road, approximately 1000 ft west of the Albany-Shaker Road / Old Wolf Road intersection, to I-87 southbound. . replacement of the I-87 bridges over Albany- Shaker Road; . removal of the existing Exit 4 southbound Exit Ramp; . removal of the existing southbound Collector-Distributor road between Exit 5 and Exit 4; . removal of the Exit 4 southbound Entrance Ramp; . replacement of the existing Exit 5 southbound Entrance Ramp; . pavement widening on I-87 northbound to construct an auxiliary lane between the existing Exit 4 northbound Exit Ramp and Exit 5 northbound Exit Ramp; . pavement widening and restriping for additional turn lanes and medians on Albany-Shaker Road; and . restriping on the existing Exit 4 northbound Exit Ramp.  The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the Flyover Alternative is cross-shaped, with the southwest-tonortheast arm following Interstate 87, and the southeast-to-northwest arm following Albany-Shaker Road. The proposed flyover ramps result in a ÒbulgeÓ to the APE on the east side of I-87, approximately 2,500 ft south of the I-87/Albany-Shaker Road bridges. On the west side of I-87, the ramps make a Òjug handleÓ shaped section of project area, where the exit roadway extends southwest from Albany-Shaker Road and then curves sharply south for the flyover bridge over I-87. ((Please refer to Figure 3A attached.) Along Interstate 87, the southwest terminus is approximately 1,800 ft north of the bridges carrying I-87 over Sand Creek Road. The I-87 northeast terminus is the bridges carrying I-87 over NYS Route 155, Watervliet-Shaker Road. The length along I-87 is approximately 1.8 miles. At the approximate midpoint of the I-87 arm are the bridges carrying I-87 over Albany-Shaker Road, Bridge Identification Numbers 1033141 and 1033142; these bridges are at the end of their service life, and will be replaced under Phase 1 of this project. The Albany-Shaker Road portion of the project area extends a distance of approximately 1.3 miles. The southeast terminus is approximately 600 feet southeast of the I-87/Albany-Shaker Road bridges, ending near the Albany-Shaker Road Ð Old Maxwell Road intersection. The APE follows Albany- Shaker Road, extending approximately 1.2 miles northwest of I-87/Albany-Shaker Road bridges, ending at the south entrance to Albany International Airport. The width of the APE along both I-87 and Albany- Shaker Road generally follows the highway boundaries of both travelways; this width is approximately 500 ft along I-87, and varies in width between 125 ft and 300 ft along Albany-Shaker Road. At the northeast end of the project area, the APE includes the Collector-Distributor Road which parallels I-87 to the west, which further widens the APE to approximately 800 ft in this northeastern-most section. The proposed ramps which connect Albany-Shaker Road and I-87 intersect Albany-Shaker Road approximately 1,100 ft west of the I-87/Albany-Shaker Road bridges. The combined ramps proceed southwesterly at a rough parallel to I-87 for approximately 1000 ft, and then the ramps curve strongly south, with the center ramp (Ramp A) crossing I-87 on the flyover bridge, the southern ramp (Ramp B) curving southward to meet I-87 southbound, and the northern ramp (Ramp A) continuing to curve in a half-circle to meet I-87 southbound. The width of the APE for the ramps is approximately 400 ft at the Albany-Shaker Road intersection, and flares wider as the ramps diverge as they approach I-87 to a width of approximately 1,200 ft along I-87. In late 2012, the proposed alignment of the ramps and their connection with Albany-Shaker Road on the west side of I-87 was altered, in response to concerns from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that the connector road was located within the FAAÕs ÒRunway Protection ZoneÓ for Albany International Airport. This alteration shifted the APE for the ramps approximately 200Õ eastward toward I-87. On the east side of I-87, where Ramp A (middle ramp leading to flyover bridge) connects to I-87, the APE varies in width, expanding from the typical 500 ft width of I-87 to approximately 800 ft at the widest point of the Òbulge.Ó The medians of I-87 were included in the APE, as well as the area between I-87 southbound lanes and the Collector-Distributor Road. Also included in the APE is a proposed wetland mitigation site located on the E.T. Person parcel. The Person parcel is located at the end of Sunset Boulevard, northwest of I-87, and borders Shakers Creek. The Area of Potential Effect was determined by the area needed for construction of the Flyover Alternative, including embankment at a sufficient height with appropriate side-slope grades, to support the flyover and exit/entrance ramps, area for staging material, equipment and personnel, and area for creation of required compensatory wetlands.  The Flyover Alternative improves operating conditions at the majority of the intersections in the I-87 Exit 4 area and reduces the travel time for major routes by 25%. This alternative also addresses safety concerns by diverting traffic away from the existing intersections that have crash rates which exceed the statewide average for similar facilities.  29.70 acres of right-of-way acquisition is necessary from 15 parcels under the Flyover Alternative. The proposed acquisitions associated with the Flyover Alternative predominantly affect properties on Albany- Shaker Road. Five (5) of the impacted parcels are owned by the Albany County Airport Authority and are identified for uses including residential, parking lot, commercial, air transport and vacant farmland. 16.60 acres of the total 29.70 acres will be acquired strictly for wetland preservation, restoration, and creation purposes. One residential property on Albany-Shaker Road will be acquired in full, and will require relocation.  The Flyover Alternative will affect a total of 1.96 acres of wetlands, comprised of 1.83 acres of shallow emergent marsh and wet meadow, and 0.13 acres of palustrine forest. Eight (8) of the 17 wetland areas that would be affected are directly influenced by the I-87 corridor, and, although they inherently provide some level of wildlife habitat, they primarily provide drainage for the existent roadway network. Impacts to the remaining wetland areas bear more significance, because they not only provide wildlife habitat and other functions and services, but are contiguous with or part of the greater Shaker Creek/Ann Lee Pond wetland/stream complex. Based on typically accepted replacement ratio guidance from USACE, a total of 2.09 acres of compensatory wetland creation is proposed is required for the Flyover Alternative, broken down as follows: emergent marsh and wet meadow impact = 1.83 acres at 1:1 replacement = 1.83 acres compensation, and forested wetland impact = 0.13 acres at 2:1 replacement = 0.26 acres compensation.  To address these compensatory wetland requirements, NYSDOT has been working with Mr. E. Person, owner of a parcel located at 200 Sunset Boulevard. NYSDOT proposes to acquire approximately 16.60 acres of this total 20.80-acre parcel (200 Sunset Blvd), in the areas outside of the existing developed parking areas, for preservation and wetland enhancement, restoration and/or creation. Acquisition of the 16.60 acres parcel would protect existing wetlands and Shaker Creek from commercial and/or residential development pressure. Additionally, within the 16.60 acres that NYSDOT acquires, NYSDOT would restore or create 2.10 acres of wetlands. The areas of potential wetland enhancement, restoration and/or creation are located around the periphery of the existing commercial business lot at 200 Sunset Blvd. The remaining developed area of the parcel (4.20 acres) would be retained by Mr. Person so he can continue his current level of business functions.  In conclusion, the environmental impacts of the Flyover Alternative include: . 29.70 acres of right-of-way acquisition from 15 properties. . 1.96 acres of wetland impacts, requiring 2.09 acres of compensatory wetland creation. . . 1 archaeological site impacted, the Engel Farm Precontact Archaeological Site.  Total estimated cost of the Flyover Alternative is $47.51 million.  Please see the chart on the following page for a summary of the Flyover Alternative.  Proposed Phases of the Project The project will be split into two separate phases for construction.  Project Phase 1 proposes the replacement of the existing bridges carrying Interstate 87 over Albany- Shaker Road (Bridge Identification Numbers 1033141 and 1033142). The replacement of the bridges cannot be separated out from the larger project since the design of the I-87 over Albany-Shaker Road bridges is directly influenced by the overall plan for the interchange reconstruction. The Phase 1 construction work is tentatively scheduled for letting in 2014 and construction in late 2014.  Project Phase 2 proposes the new interchange construction, including the acquisition of real property along Wolf and Albany-Shaker Road and throughout the project area, and construction of compensatory mitigation wetlands. The Phase 2 construction work is tentatively scheduled for letting in Spring 2019 and construction in 2019.  2. Steps Taken to Identify Historic Properties  Cultural Resources Surveys and investigations have been conducted for this project by the New York State Museum in Albany, NY, and by Hartgen Archaeological Associates, Inc., in Rensselaer, NY. Four reports have been prepared in the period of 2000 through 2013. All of the reports were submitted to the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation (NYS OPRHP), functioning as the New York State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for the Section 106 review process.

Evaluation of Project Impact on Identified Historic Properties  Historic Properties that may be Affected by the Project Historic Properties Wolf-Kemp Cemetery Historic Site. The cemetery is located within an agricultural field about 61 m (200 ft) north of the southbound lanes of I-87. The cemetery occupies a low knoll; it is visible from the highway between Albany-Shaker Road to the northeast and Sand Creek Road to the southwest. This cemetery is associated with the Wolf, Kemp, and Case families, who owned the farmland and lived in a farmstead on Wolf Road where the Homewood Suites Hotel is now located. The Wolf-Kemp cemetery has headstones dating to as early as 1811, possibly earlier, through the last quarter of the nineteenth century, indicating graves of at least 17 individuals. SHPO has indicated that the Wolf-Kemp Cemetery is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. SHPO has also stated that due to the assumed presence of human remains, SHPO strongly recommends that the Wolf-Kemp Cemetery is avoided.  Archaeological Sites Engel Farm Precontact Archaeological Site. The site is located within an agricultural field north-west of I- 87 and about 107 m (350 ft) east of the Wolf-Kemp Cemetery. Material remains revealed through Phase I and Phase II testing consist of fire-cracked rock and chert flakes, some utilized or scrapers, and debitage. The site is identified as a camp/workshop. As a result of Phase I and Phase II archaeological investigations, the Engel Farm site has been determined eligible for the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion D, as it likely bears additional information valuable to our understanding of Archaic period sites in the Northeast, and more specifically, the pre-contact use of the Pine Bush.  Four other potentially eligible historic archaeological sites, the Desmond Historic Archaeological Site, Exit 5 North Historic Archaeological Site, Exit 5 South Historic Archaeological Site, and the Stickley Historic Archaeological Site were identified in the Phase I Archaeological investigation (2011). All four sites are located within the Area of Potential Effect of the Flyover Alternative.  Desmond Historic Archaeological Site. The Desmond Site is in front of the house adjacent to the Desmond Hotel on Albany-Shaker Road, approximately 200 ft west of the I-87/Albany-Shaker Road Bridges. The site appears to be a sheet midden deeply buried by modern fill; the artifacts found included bottle glass, whiteware, brick, nails, and window glass. This section of APE was included to allow for potential widening of Albany-Shaker Road. However, design refinements have indicated that any widening in this location will not extend far enough to affect the Desmond Site; therefore, the Desmond Site will be avoided.  Exit 5 North Historic Archaeological Site and Exit 5 South Historic Archaeological Site. Both Exit 5 sites are located in the highway median between the I-87 southbound lanes and the Collector-Distributor road which extends from Exit 5 to connect with Old Wolf Road. Based on historic maps, both Exit 5 sites are in previously unsettled areas. Little is known about the sites, although the artifacts recovered from each Ð ceramic fragments, faunal bones, and shells - suggest that the sites may be surface dumps associated with neighboring farms. No road construction is proposed for either location, although the median may be used for either construction staging and/or compensatory wetland mitigation. If the space is used for either purpose, the sites will be fenced with Temporary Plastic Barrier Fence and thus avoided.  Stickley Historic Archaeological Site. The Stickley Site is in front of the Stickley Furniture store at 151 Wolf Road, on the east side of Wolf Road and south of the Wolf Road-Metro Park Road intersection. The Stickley site is associated with a farmhouse that is documented on historic maps dating from the 1860s through the 1950s; the artifact assemblage consisted of faunal bones, late 19th century ceramics, and vessel glass. The Stickley Site is just barely within the APE for the Diamond Alternative, which has been dismissed. The Stickley Site does not fall within the APE for the Flyover Alternative; therefore, the Stickley Site will be avoided.  Based on the feasible project alternative, the Stickley, Desmond, Exit 5 North, and Exit 5 South sites will all be avoided. Since these four sites will be avoided, there was no additional investigation to assess eligibility.  Flyover Alternative Ð Evaluation of Impacts to Historic Properties The flyover alternative as designed has elevated ramps, founded on embankment fill, which pass through the location of the Engel Farm Precontact Archaeological Site. NYSDOT, in consultation with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), New York State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), the Stockbridge- Munsee Community Band of Mohican Indians, the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, and the Delaware Tribe, has explored several strategies to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential impacts to the Engel Farm Precontact Archaeological Site. . Avoidance Measures. Redesign Ramp Placement. Moving the ramps of the Flyover Alternative away from the Engel Farm Precontact Archaeological Site was investigated. However, many factors combined to make moving the ramps entirely out of the Site impossible. Shifting the ramps northward along I- 87 towards the Desmond Hotel would impact the parking area of the Desmond Hotel, which would require acquisition of property from the Desmond Hotel. The projected increased highway noise from the moving the highway ramps nearer the Desmond Hotel reached unacceptable levels. Shifting the ramp complex southward would require real property acquisitions along Computer Drive West, which parallels I-87 to the east, between I-87 and Wolf Road. Several existing commercial properties would need to be acquired completely, and businesses relocated. This would cause a negative social and economic impact. Additionally, shifting the ramps far enough south along I-87 to avoid the Site resulted in impacts to the Wolf-Kemp Cemetery. Shifting the ramps westward is limited by the Federal Aviation AdministrationÕs ÒRunway Protection ZoneÓ for the Albany International Airport; furthermore, westward ramp alignment adjustment would not avoid the Site. For these reasons, NYSDOT concludes that shifting the ramp alignments as an avoidance option is not feasible or practical. Bridge over Site. The Flyover Alternative has three ramps which converge and touch down in the general location of the Engel Farm Site; these ramps are referred to (from north to south) Ramps C, A, and B. In March 2013, NYSDOT first proposed bridging only a portion of the Engel Farm Site (Locus 1), with a bridge on Ramp C (northern ramp). However, following the Section 106 consultation meeting on May 14, 2013, NYSDOT explored bridging the entire Engel Farm Precontact Archaeological Site, which requires two bridges: one on Ramp A (middle ramp) and the second on Ramp C (northern ramp) to span the entirety of the Engel Farm Site. Ramp B (southern ramp) would be relocated further south to avoid conflict with the southern edge of the Engel Farm Site, although the ramp location is limited due to the presence of the Wolf-Kemp Cemetery Historic Site. A retaining wall may be placed along part of Ramp C near Engel Farm SiteÕs southern boundary. NYSDOT explored designing the bridges using both curved and straight steel girders to support the rampÕs road surface. The longest bridge, the Ramp C bridge, would span the entire Site with a buffer of 15 feet from the west bridge abutment to the site boundary to account for footing excavation, and a buffer of 35 feet from the east bridge abutment to allow for footing excavation and positive surface drainage away from the Site. Accordingly, the Ramp C bridge requires a girder length of 250 feet to span the entire distance. The 250 ft span length is beyond the practical design length for a single-span bridge, so constructing a single-span bridge of this length presents significant engineering issues. While the girder can be fabricated, it would likely have to be transported in at least 3 sections. The 3 sections of girder would have to be spliced in the field; this requires temporarily supporting the girder during splicing with a steel frame and footing system. This temporary footing system must be level and designed to support the dead weight of the girder. The temporary footing system would require excavation within the boundaries of the Engel Farm Precontact Archaeological Site, causing damage or destruction to buried soils containing cultural deposits. In addition to the fabrication and construction challenges, the deflection of the bridge would not meet allowable standards based on driver comfort. Essentially, the bridge would feel ÒbouncyÓ and ÒunstableÓ to the driver. Due to these complexities of bridging the Engel Farm Precontact Archaeological Site in its entirety, NYSDOT concludes that bridging the Site is not feasible or practical. Furthermore, constructing a bridge over the site would not avoid impacts due to the requirement for a temporary footing system. . Minimization Measures. Fill over Site after Identifying Original Ground Surface. This option proposed to cover the original ground surface of the Engel Farm Site with a geotextile fabric to delineate the surface location, and then place embankment fill over the geotextile to construct the earthwork support for Ramps C, A, and B. Also, in order to carry rainwater and runoff away from the Engel Farm Site, a swale would be graded in the center of the Engel Farm Site, but above the original ground surface in the embankment fill. The swale would direct water to a culvert running underneath Ramp C, to divert water away from the Site. NYSDOT also proposed the following protective measures to be utilized during the ÒFill over SiteÓ construction. Prior to the placement of embankment fill, Temporary Plastic Barrier Fence would be installed to delineate edges of the Engel Farm Site; the fence is intended to improve visibility of the site boundary, and to help prevent construction personnel and equipment from entering the Site accidentally. A conceptual plan for this option is shown in Figures 2 and 2A. NYSDOTÕs preliminary geotechnical evaluation of the location indicated that the area consists of historically farmed soil overgrown by a meadow mat and an area of low woods, adjacent to standing water. The historically farmed soil indicates the likelihood of organic material in the soil to an unknown depth. Organic material in the soil contributes to long-term settling of the structure constructed upon embankment fill over the native soil. In September 2013, at FHWAÕs request, NYSDOT completed a formal geotechnical evaluation of the soils in the area proposed for the embankments that would support Ramps A, B, and C under the Flyover Alternative. The geotechnical evaluation confirmed that the upper level of the soil contains plant material and other organic material. Further, the geotechnical evaluation stated that the top one foot (1Õ) of soil must be removed prior to placement of the embankment fill. It is standard engineering practice to remove plant material and soil containing organic material before building an embankment, since an embankment constructed atop plant material and organic material continuously settles over time. Additionally, movement of equipment is likely to cause rutting and displacement of up to another ten inches (10Ó) of subsoil during the fill placement. In consultation with SHPO and FHWA, NYSDOT concluded that the proposed minimization measures would not ensure protection of the site from impacts during construction due to the removal and/or disturbance of the upper 1Õ Ð 10Ó of soil, or from potential physical alterations to site conditions after construction.  4. Basis for Recommended Project Findings  The Flyover Alternative proposes the construction of ramps supported by embankment fill in the location of the Engel Farm Precontact Archaeological Site, which causes an unavoidable impact to the Site due to site disturbance from construction. The Flyover Alternative avoids impact to the Wolf-Kemp Cemetery Historic Site. The New York State Department of Transportation has applied the Criteria of Adverse Effect (36 CFR Part 800.5(a)) and determined that the Flyover Alternative, will have an Adverse Effect on the Engel Farm Precontact Archaeological Site, an archaeological site eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.  . Mitigation Measures. Phase III Data Recovery with Interpretive Display as Public Outreach Component. NYSDOT proposes mitigation for the ÒAdverse EffectÓ in the form of Phase III Data Recovery for the Site, including public dissemination of the information retrieved through Data Recovery. Established procedures will be followed to implement a Data Recovery Plan, in consultation with the SHPO and the Native American Tribal nations. The public outreach portion of the Data Recovery will include an interpretive, museum-quality display. The content, format, and materials of the interpretive display will be determined through continued consultation among FHWA, NYSDOT, SHPO, and the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of Mohican Indians, the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, and the Delaware Tribe. The proposed interpretive display for public dissemination of information is an outcome of consultation, reflecting the interest of the consulting Tribes in learning more about the site, and sharing that information with the tribal members and others. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) is in development to resolve adverse effects, based on consultation among the SHPO, FHWA, NYSDOT, and the three Native American Tribal Nations.  5. Public Involvement  Public Involvement The following meetings and presentations have been held as efforts to seek the publicÕs input on the project in general: . October 17, 2005: Project Advisory Committee meeting was held at the Town of Colonie Public Operations Building to brief and solicit feedback from federal and state agencies and local governments on the Conceptual Alternatives Screening document, which contained a summary of 19 conceptual alternatives that were being considered. . November 21, 2005: Project Advisory Committee meeting was held at the Town of Colonie Public Operations Building to discuss any comments or questions from federal and state agencies and local governments on the Conceptual Alternatives Screening document that was distributed on 10/17/2005. . October 11, 2007: NEPA scoping meeting was held at the Town of Colonie Public Operations Building to discuss the purpose and need statement and range of alternatives of the project with federal and state agencies and local governments. . November 26, 2007: NEPA scoping meeting was held at the Sand Creek Middle School Auditorium on 11/26/2007 to discuss the purpose and need statement and range of alternatives of the project with the general public. . April 2, 2009: An advisory agency scoping meeting was held at the Town of Colonie Public Operations Building to discuss the feasible alternatives which will be considered during preliminary design, review the decision making process, and review the coordination process. . June 1, 2011: An advisory agency meeting was held at the Town of Colonie Public Operations Building to discuss the feasible alternatives which will be considered for the administrative DEIS. Once the Draft Environmental Impact Statement is ready for release for public comment, NYSDOT plans to hold a public hearing, anticipated to be in February 2014. The specific date and time is yet to be determined.  Section 106 Consultation NYSDOT has consulted with the New York State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and the Native American Tribes according to established procedures. Albany County falls within the Area-of-Interest of three Native American Tribes: the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of Mohican Indians, the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, and the Delaware Tribe. As noted in the listing of Cultural Resources investigations (see Section 2 of this document), many cultural resources studies have been completed for this project. In January 2012, NYSDOT provided the Phase I Archaeological Investigation report to SHPO and the three Native American Tribes. NYSDOT staff, as well as representatives from FHWA and primary engineering consultant CHA, Inc., also met with Ms. Sherry White, Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO) for the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of Mohican Indians, to visit the Engel Farm Site location in person on January 11, 2012. The 2011 Phase I report included the 2000 Pre-Reconnaissance Study as an appendix. Responses from SHPO and from Tribal Representatives were supportive of continuing with a Phase II Site Examination of the Engel Farm Site.  The Phase II fieldwork and report were completed in November 2012, and NYSDOT distributed the report in November 2012. In December 2012, the alignment of the connector road (in the Diamond Alternative) and the ramps (in the Flyover Alternative) was altered in order to move the roadways out of the ÒRunway Protection ZoneÓ of Albany International Airport. An Addendum Phase IB study was conducted for these new sections of APE identified after the alignment shift. NYSDOT distributed the Addendum Phase IB study to SHPO and the Native American Tribes in March 2013. In late March 2013, NYSDOT circulated an initial proposal to bridge a portion of the site to all parties.  On May 14, 2013, NYSDOT hosted a Section 106 consultation meeting, with NYSDOT staff, Ms. Sherry White, Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO) for the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of Mohican Indians, FHWA staff, and SHPO representatives at the meeting. The THPOs from the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe and the Delaware Tribe were updated by telephone conversations a few days after the consultation meeting, and all parties were sent the minutes of the May 14th consultation meeting by email.  In July 2013, NYSDOT circulated a ÒDraft Finding DocumentationÓ to SHPO, FHWA, the Stockbridge- Munsee Community Band of Mohican Indians, the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, and the Delaware Tribe. The circulation and review of the Draft was intended to share the NYSDOT analysis of potential avoidance measures, reach out to consult with the SHPO, share views of the SHPO with the Tribal Nations, and solicit and obtain the views of each Tribal representative.  Prior to the dismissal of the Diamond Alternative in November 2013, SHPO and all three Native American Tribes had indicated to NYSDOT and FHWA that they would prefer the Diamond Alternative to be progressed, as the Diamond Alternative avoids impact to the Engel Farm Precontact Archaeological Site  However, in light of the fact that the Flyover Alternative is the sole reasonable alternative, the Section 106 consulting parties have communicated the following opinions to NYSDOT regarding the treatment of the Engel Farm Precontact Archaeological Site, which would be affected by the Flyover Alternative. . Delaware Tribe: Dr. Brice Obermeyer, THPO for the Delaware Tribe, stated in a letter dated December 11, 2012, that ÒWe [the Delaware Tribe] concur that the construction will have an adverse effect on the site and concur with the Phase III Data Recovery Plan.Ó . Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe: Mr. Arnold Printup, THPO for the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, indicated in a letter dated April 2, 2013, that the Tribe would prefer strategies that avoided impact to the Site. . Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of Mohican Indians: Ms. Sherry White, THPO for the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of Mohican Indians, stated in an e-mailed letter to FHWA dated August 27, 2013, that ÒOur tribe makes every effort to work with agencies to find a working solution that will accommodate all parties and issues.Ó The letter suggested alterations to the plan for Phase III Data Recovery of the Engel Farm Site.  NYSDOT has considered the views of the Native American Tribal Nations in the assessment and resolution of adverse effects. In response to the Tribal NationsÕ stated preference for avoidance of the site, NYSDOT has thoroughly analyzed Flyover Alternative avoidance options, and has determined that avoidance is not feasible or practical. In response to the suggestion from the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of Mohican Indians that an interpretive display be included as the public outreach part of the Data Recovery, NYSDOT has included the interpretive display.  NYSDOT continues to consult with SHPO and the Native American Tribes, with the goal of reaching consensus regarding mitigation strategies.  6.

Through consultation in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and its implementing regulation (36 CFR Part 800), NYSDOT and FHWA have determined that the Interstate 87-Exit 4, Airport Access Improvement project will result in adverse effects on the Engel Farm Site, a property determined eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The following data recovery plan includes a description of the Engel Farm Precontact site along with sections outlining the research questions, excavation methods, artifact analysis and interpretation, and a time table for the completion of this work. All work will follow the New York State Education Department Workscope for New York State Department of Transportation Projects (SED 2004). Information relating to the project workscope was provided by Tanya Thorne of the NYSDOT, Region 1.  NYSDOT Project Overview  The Engel Farm Precontact site will be impacted as a result of PIN 1721.51.121 which involves Access Improvements for the Albany International Airport. Access improvements for the project include but are not limited to the reconfiguring of Exit 4 to allow for improved traffic capacity handling and improved airport access off of the north and south bound lanes of Interstate 87. As part of this project several additional improvements will be needed including the construction of new entry/exit ramps to Interstate 87 on the southside of its intersection with Albany- Shaker Road as well the replacement of bridges that carry Interstate 87 over Albany-Shaker Road. The depth of impact in these areas is currently not known however, it is expected that all impacts will be contained within the first two feet of the ground surface.  Relationship between Project Area and Archaeological Sites  Hartgen Archaeological Associates previously completed a reconnaissance survey and site examination for this project within the area of potential effects (APE) established for the proposed reconstruction of Exit 4 (Hartgen 2011). The survey identified six archaeological sites within the proposed project limits including the Engel Farm Precontact site. According to the report (Hartgen 2012), other isolated precontact sites surround the Engel Farm Precontact site (including the Shaker Run 1 and 2 sites, the Squash Patch Site, and the Shaker Creek Sites) increasing the potential that the site could contribute to our understanding of the past.  Based on consultation with the New York State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), the Stockbridge- Munsee Community Band of Mohican Indians, the Delaware Tribe, and the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, the Engel Farm Precontact Site has been determined eligible for listing in the National Register. Data was generated through surface collection, shovel testing, and archaeological unit excavation. Surface collection as part of recent survey efforts recovered 43 precontact artifacts including chert debitage and fire cracked rock. Surface collection over the previous decades by the land owner recovered numerous artifacts. The property owner recently provided 14 projectile points, 2 bifaces, and a ground pestle. Both Vosburg and Brewerton projectile points were found within, or near to, the Engel Farm Precontact Site.       Figure 1.

The reconnaissance survey and the site examination of the Engel Farm Precontact site produced a limited number of artifacts within the first soil layer. The limited number of artifacts recovered suggests that the site represents a temporary or seasonal occupation that may have been occupied over several successive years.  Site Location and Boundaries  The Engel Farm site is located in Albany County on the north side of Interstate 87 and south of the Albany International Airport. The site and much of the surrounding area is located with the Albany Pine Bush. The Engel Farm Site, as tested within the APE for this project, measured 3,700 m2 (39,828 ft2) in size. The entire site is recommended for data recovery.   Following Hartgen (2012:1), Òthe Engel Farm Precontact site lies amid a patchwork of farm fields, drainage ditches, scrub lands, and woods. The site itself is flat with small variations in topography creating a less well-drained area in the south near a pond, which also coincides with the densest concentration of artifacts. A low rise to the north overlooks the pond and a similar rise in the west hosts a family cemetery from the late 18th century. Isolated finds were found at both high spots, including a flake to the north and a possible Vosburg-type projectile point to the west. A brushy, wooded drainage feature obscures the view of the site from Interstate 87Ó.  Background of Small Lithic Sites in the Northeast and Albany County  The archaeology of the Northeastern United States is represented by various site types that dot the landscape and were used for a variety of purposes by Native groups in the past. Included among these types of sites are small lithic scatters. Lithic scatters are most readily classified by their small size (often ranging in size from a few meters to a maximum size of one acre), limited artifact assemblages (often less than several hundred artifacts consisting mostly of lithic debitage), low density of features, and relatively limited number of formal tools or other types of artifacts (ie. ceramics). Small lithic scatters have been identified on sites dating from approximately 12,000 years ago up until the time of European contact (Beckerman 2002).  In the Town of Colonie, small lithic sites have been identified at several sites including the Colonie Shaker Creek I and II sites (Miroff and Carrington 2007). At the Colonie Shaker Creek I site, a small lithic assemblage measuring approximately 30 meters square (4 meters (13.12 feet) wide x 9.5 meters (31 feet) long) was identified within the project limits producing 3 artifacts. A small lithic assemblage was also identified at Loci 1 of the Colonie Shaker Creek II site and measured approximately 4 meters (13.12 feet) long and 4 meters (13.12 feet) wide. This assemblage produced 3 artifacts. It is important to note that the testing interval within both of these sites was successively reduced from 15 to 2.0 meters (50 feet to 6.56 feet) to more accurately define the site boundaries around positive and negative shovel test pits. Close interval testing allowed archaeologists to refine the project limits and reduce the size of the site within the APE.  Previous Work at the Engel Farm Site  Data collection included a systematic surface collection, a line of shovel tests arranged at an interval of 4.5- 5 meters (14.76-16.04 feet) apart, and the excavation of multiple units totaling an area of 20 m2 (215.2 ft2) (Hartgen 2012). Although excavations were conducted through the first and second soil layers to a depth of 60 centimeters (23.62 inches) below ground surface, more than 98% of the artifacts were recovered from the plowzone at an approximate depth of 0-45 centimeters (0-17.71 inches).  Surface collection as part of recent survey efforts recovered 43 precontact artifacts including chert debitage and fire cracked rock. Surface collection over the previous decades by the land owner recovered numerous artifacts. The property owner recently provided 14 un-provenienced projectile points, 2 bifaces, and a ground pestle to Hartgen (2012) to examine during the site examination. Both Vosburg and Brewerton projectile points were found within, or near to, the Engel Farm Precontact Site and point to the occupation of the site during the Archaic Period.  Artifacts and associated materials recovered from excavation units within the APE for this project include pieces of wood charcoal, chert flakes, fire cracked rock, a chert core, a quartzite cobble and a quartzite flake, chert bifaces, one lanceolate projectile point (possibly a Meadowwood point), and one projectile point base made from Onondaga Chert. A total of 94 artifacts were recovered from Locus 1 with evidence of horizontal artifact patterning including fire cracked rock and sandstone cobbles. This suggests that features may have been present in this area.  The Engel Farm Precontact Archaeological Site lies in the Pine Bush region, an archaeologically littleknown landscape in native North America. The Engel Farm Precontact site is part of a constellation of other sites located within this ecosystem, but no attempt has been made to deal with these sites as a cultural context as of yet and explore their potential for providing more information about site organization and landscape use. Most notably, the Squash Patch (Hartgen 2004) and Shaker Run sites (Mackey 1990, Curtin 1991) lie within 1,400 feet and one mile, respectively, to the Engel Farm Precontact Site in the head of the Shaker Creek drainage. Two of the Shaker Run sites were found to be eligible for National Register listing and were the subject of Phase III data retrieval.  Another known field survey in the immediate area was conducted in 1999 by Dr. Michael Werner of Werner Archeological Consulting. It consisted of a Phase 1 Survey for a private business that did not continue with the project. Though unpublished and lacking site files, Dr. Werner has communicated to the NY SHPO office that the 1999 survey was conducted in a parcel in the vicinity of the Squash Patch area bordering the Engel Farm Precontact Site. This survey yielded precontact artifacts in surface find spots in two open field locations as well as shovel tests in two wooded areas. In addition, he stated there were isolated finds throughout the entire property. The Engel Farm Precontact Site is larger in area than the Squash Patch or Shaker Run Sites. Based on the artifacts that have already been recovered, and the EngelÕ own collection of artifacts they have gathered, the Site is has the potential to produce material that could be used to address questions related to the Early Archaic to Late Archaic period occupation of the Pine Bush.  RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND FIELD METHODOLOGY   Mitigation of the Engel Farm site is likely to yield information that could be used to address research questions relating to the precontact and post-contact occupation of the site. As discussed below, several general research topics will be explored during this project. The methodology put forth in following section is meant to maximize the research potential of the site in an effort to address these research questions.  PRECONTACT RESEARCH ISSUES   The Pine Bush is considered by many archaeologists (e.g. Ritchie 1995; Ritchie and Funk 1973) to have been an important settlement and resource procurement area throughout the Archaic and Woodland Periods. Unfortunately, the lack of professional work in the Pine Bush has not only limited our ability to interpret activities associated with the regional organization and resource scheduling tasks of these precontact populations but has also created a noticeable gap in our understanding of the settlement of eastern New York.  Compounding this problem is a distinct bias on the part of archaeologists toward the excavation of larger camps and semi-permanent village sites in the region. As evidenced by the site files at the New York State Museum and the NYS Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation, dozens of precontact sites can be found nearby in Albany County. These sites are quite diverse with small and large seasonal camps, village sites (e.g. Ritchie 1968), burial sites (Parker 1922), and temporary resource processing stations (e.g. Jones et. al. 1992) reported. Unfortunately, only larger base camps and villages (e.g. Snow 1995) have been intensively investigated. As a result, the diverse relationship between these larger sites, smaller camps and lithic scatters remain poorly understood.  Mitigation of the Engel Farm Site could potentially contribute to our understanding of the Pine Bush by collecting information about the subsistence and settlement activities of one of these small camp sites.   Specific research themes to be addressed during Data Recovery have been developed as a result of consultation among SHPO, FHWA, NYSDOT, and Tribal Nations. These include the following:  1. Are there associated Paleo-Indian components of the Engel Farm Precontact Archaeological Site? 2. Are there any archaeological features preserved within the site contexts? 3. How does the Engel Farm Precontact Archaeological Site fit within a regional archaeological context? (key components will include regional syntheses, settlement patterns, and resource usage/exploitation through time). 4. What contextual relationship can we establish between this site and other known precontact sites in the Pine Bush Region (e.g. the Squash Patch site, the Shaker Run sites, information in the vicinity identified by Werner Archeological, etc.)  The ability of the archaeologists to understand these questions requires us to put them within the larger archaeological framework of the chronology of the region, its settlement and subsistence data, and the role of material culture among past populations. A discussion of each of these is provided below.  Chronology  The chronology of the Engel Farm site needs to be refined before other research questions can be addressed. As discussed in the Background section, possible Vosburg and Brewerton projectile points have been recovered from deposits located beyond the site boundaries. These types of points are usually found on sites dating to the Late Archaic Period and probably indicate that the deposits on the north side of Albany-Shaker Road date to c. 4,000-1,500 B.C. (Ritchie 1971). Presently, no diagnostic artifacts have been recovered from within the project limits and the artifact catalog contained in the site examination report does not list any additional artifacts that can be used to refine the age of the site. Although we expect the deposits identified in the first and second soil layers to also date to the Late Archaic Period, successful completion of this data recovery project will require confirmation of the temporal affiliation of this portion of the site using radiocarbon dating and/or stylistic analysis. Ideally, data required for radiocarbon dating will be derived from carbon-bearing features. Stylistic analysis will also be employed during the mitigation and will require the recovery of temporally diagnostic artifacts (e.g. projectile points, etc.) from identified features and living floor contexts within the project limits.  Site Formation Processes  Reconstructing the formation processes of a site is a complex task that requires an understanding of the dynamic relationship between past populations and the local environment. According to Butzer (1990:37-39), this complex relationship often requires that a geomorphological study be completed so that questions related to precontact/ historic land use and the development of the local landscape can be adequately addressed. The formation of the Engel Farm Precontact Site will be reconstructed through a detailed study of the siteÕs geomorphology. Analysis of the soils (and their association with cultural material from the site) will not only allow researchers to document how individual soil horizons (and the corresponding floodplain and terrace) formed but is also expected to resolve issues related to the post-glacial deposition of precontact materials in two distinct soil layers. Archaeologists will attempt to address this issue through block units and a detailed analysis of the formation processes of the site.   Since excavation units will be placed across the site, a comparative study of the geomorphology of these environments may be possible and could further enhance our understanding of the formation of this precontact site. Soil samples will be collected for organic carbon and particle size analysis and may provide valuable insights contributing to our understanding of the physical characteristics and precontact use of these different environments. Spatial Patterning and Site Function   Information about the spatial patterning and function of a site is most readily reflected in the distribution of structures, features, and artifacts across the site. Archaeologists will reconstruct the spatial patterning of the site through an analysis of the horizontal and vertical distribution of artifacts and features within the project limits. As discussed in the Background section, Hartgen Archaeological Associates (2012) identified four discrete concentrations of artifacts within the current project limits. Due to the limited amount of testing in these areas as well as the fact that few units extended significantly into the subsoil, we currently do not know whether a second precontact component is located underneath or whether they represent isolated artifacts that were deposited as a result of some other process. Archaeologists will attempt to address this issue through deep testing within the project limits and through a detailed analysis of the formation processes of the site. Refinement of the horizontal distribution of artifacts across the site is equally important and will also represent a major research focus of this project. As discussed in the site examination report (2012), multiple artifact clusters were identified within the original project limits.   The identification of features within the project limits is important and is expected to provide information about the siteÕs function and duration of use. Northeast archaeologists regularly argue that the function of a site is largely dependent upon the types of features that are found (Ritchie and Funk 1973; Ritchie 1968; Snow 1980). Moeller (1992) similarly argues that a detailed analysis of the size, shape, and feature contents can provide meaningful information about the siteÕs duration of use, seasonality, and activities. Although no precontact features have been identified within the project limits, the recovery of fire-cracked rock suggest that one or more hearths may be located within the project limits. If features are identified within the project limits, information about the size, shape, and feature contents will be recorded on standard field forms. In addition, flotation samples will be collected from each of these features and are expected to produce botanical remains that could be used to enhance our understanding of the seasonality of this hunter-gatherer site.   Finally, the artifacts themselves are expected to provide information about the spatial organization and function of this precontact site. Archaeologists often argue that the types of chipped stone tools and the types of debitage that are deposited at a site are indicative of group mobility and settlement organization (Binford 1978; Kintigh 1984; Magne 1985). Despite these claims, only a handful of Northeast archaeologists have used lithics to enhance their discussion of settlement organization (Cesarski 1996; Versaggi 1987). Mitigation of the Engel Farm Precontact Site will attempt to contribute to this research theme by exploring the unique relationship between lithic technology and settlement organization.  Subsistence   Archaeologists have long constructed subsistence models that emphasize the important role that hunting and gathering played among the precontact peoples of the Northeast. Although aviary and aquatic resources are often recovered from these sites, these specimens are not considered to be primary food items and have been regarded as supplementary foods among Northeast hunter-gatherer populations. An important aspect of these models is the belief that this type of subsistence strategy was uniformly adopted across the Northeast and continued to be practiced (relatively unchanged) between the Late Archaic (c. 6,000 B.P.) and the first half of the Middle Woodland (c. 1,500 B.P) Periods (Ritchie 1968; Ritchie and Funk 1973). Recently, archaeologists have begun to question this assumption suggesting that the subsistence strategies of these precontact populations were probably more complex with precontact groups consuming different types and frequencies of foods (e.g. Asch Sidell 1999; Bernstein 1992, 1999; Cassedy 1998; Versaggi 1999).  Mitigation of the site is expected to contribute to this research issue by documenting the subsistence practices of this small site. As discussed in the Artifact Analysis section, questions relating to the subsistence strategy of this precontact population will be addressed based upon the recovery of floral and faunal remains from features and living floor contexts. Identification of the floral remains from this site will be completed by a professional archaeobotanist while identification of the faunal remains from the site will be completed Òin houseÓ by staff from the New York State Museum.  Microscopic analysis of the chipped stone tools and utilized flakes will also be completed and may contribute to our understanding of the subsistence activities of this precontact population. A small portion of the lithic assemblage will be sent to a professional lithic analyst for use-wear analysis (see Organization of Lithic Technology section). Microscopic analysis of these artifacts is expected to produce detailed information about the range of materials (e.g. bone, meat, plants, etc.) that were being processed by the occupants of this site.  Organization of Lithic Technology  Stone tools and debitage are often one of the most important artifact classes found on precontact sites due to their abundance, imperishability, and information content (Shott 1994:69; Morrow 1997:51-69). Recent studies of these types of artifacts using macro- and microscopic techniques have not only provided archaeologists with information about how these objects were manufactured (Callahan 1979) but have also contributed information about the siteÕs function and duration of occupation (Odell 1996), the subsistence patterns of precontact populations (Kay 1996), and the accumulation and exchange of raw materials across a larger geographic region (Shott 1994). The reconnaissance survey and the site examination of the site produced lithic artifacts within the current project limits (Hartgen 2012). Mitigation of the Engel Farm Precontact Site is also expected to produce flakes and other bifacially worked tools that could be analyzed using general and microscopic techniques.   Throughout the last two decades archaeologists have become aware of the importance of modeling lithic production trajectories (e.g. Kintigh 1984; Magne 1985; Odell 1996). As a result, researchers have attempted to (1) understand the processes through which unmodified raw materials are transformed into finished tools and (2) establish a typology for the flakes generated by the production of stone tools. Previous work suggests that examination of both the finished tools and the debitage will help us to understand the types and range of tool-making activities that were occurring at the Engel Farm Precontact Site (Hartgen Archaeological Associates 2012). Staff from the New York State Museum will attempt to reconstruct the stages of manufacture (using both the finished tools themselves and the associated debitage) so that questions about settlement systems, group mobility, and stone tool production can be addressed.  The bifacially worked tools and a sample of debitage will undergo microscopic use-wear analysis. Usewear analysis is expected to inform us about the range of the materials that were being processed (e.g. meat, bone, hide, shell, plants, etc.), the activities involved in the preparation of these materials (e.g. scraping, boring, crushing, etc.), and whether expedient tools were hafted. Although only one other lithic use-wear study exists for Albany County (Jones et. al. 1992; Versaggi et. al. 1993), several similar studies have been completed for sites in southern and eastern New York (e.g. Pagoulatos 1992) and will serve as an empirical model for this project. METHODS   The horizontal and vertical extent of the site will need to be adequately investigated in order to address the research questions proposed for the data recovery project. The current project workscope indicates that field investigations will need to be completed in an area measuring approximately 3,700 m2 (39,828 ft2). 153 shovel test pits (STPs), and 20 1 m2 units have already been excavated within the original boundaries of the Engel Farm site (Hartgen Archaeological Associates 2012). This data recovery plan proposes that a total of 10-20% of the Engel Farm site be excavated. As discussed below, we propose that a number of block units be excavated within the current project limits. Given the size and shape of the project area, it is possible that previously excavated units may fall within the boundaries of these block excavations thereby reducing the size of area that needs to undergo data recovery.   Mitigation of the Engel Farm Precontact site will occur in four stages or tiers with scheduled ÒbreaksÓ in the work effort for the various consulting parties to discuss the result and further discuss whether the current mitigation plan needs to be revised.  Overview of Tier 1A Excavations  The initial excavations (or Tier 1A investigations) will involve a combined field strategy consisting of close interval shovel testing and coordinated field inspection by a professional geomorphologist. The methodology for both of these activities is provided below.  Tier 1A excavations will be through the completion of close interval testing. Hartgen Archaeological Associates completed Phase I and Phase II archaeological testing at the Engel Farm Site in 2011 and 2012. Within 153 shovel test pits and 20 1x1 meter (3.2 feet x 3.2 feet) square units, 127 artifacts were recovered. More than 98% of the artifacts were recovered in first soil layer at a depth of approximately 0-20 centimeters (0-7.87 inches). As indicated in Figures 1-3 of the site examination report (Hartgen Archaeological Associates 2012), this first (and sometimes second layer) consists of the plowzone. The remaining 2% of the artifacts were identified within the Bhorizon soils at a depth of approximately 30-60 centimeters (11.81-23.62 inches) below the ground surface. The depth of almost of all of the shovel test pits excavated within the project limits is 50 and 60 centimeters (19.68-23.62 inches) below ground surface. Although the report is not specific as to the site type, its low density of artifacts and limited number of features argues for its use as a one time or repeated use lithic scatter.  We propose that 290 shovel test pits be excavated across the entire site area at an interval of 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) apart. The two and a half meter interval will be at the lower threshold for finding small sites. Each STP will be placed along a grid set-up across the site. Excavation of these units will allow archaeologists to reassess the distribution of artifacts across the site and develop a more refined plan for the placement of these units across the site so as to maximize the data potential of the units. Each of the shovel test pits will be excavated through the plow zone and into the B-horizon soils to a depth of approximately 1 meter (3.2 feet).  We estimate that the 290 STP will encompass approximately 108 square meters of the site and will be completed at the start of Tier 1A testing. We estimate it will take about two to three weeks for the shovel test pits to be excavated. Once complete, an assessment of the site boundaries and size should be completed to see if the size of the site can be reduced or refined based on the close interval shovel testing. Once complete the remaining 10% of the site area will be excavated using block excavations.  Coordination with a Geomorphologist  Prior to the start of Tier 1B Excavations, a geomorphological study will assess the following information: . Identify the likely soil sequences in project area based upon available geological and archaeological information. . Establish the likelihood of deeply buried archaeological deposits based upon soil formation. . Provide a terminal depth at which buried occupational surfaces are likely to occur. . Provide recommendations for beneficial and documentary steps to be taken during archaeological excavations while excavation blocks are open and accessible to documentation  Sites within the Pine Bush dating to the Early and Late Archaic have the potential to have a Òstone zoneÓ or layer of stone tools that have migrated downward in the soil over millennia and are now located below the plow zone. They may not appear in surface collections. The geomorphologist will be responsible for determining the depth of the stone zone across the site to determine the maximum depth of excavation needed in the test units.  The results of this testing will be summarized in a report due within 30 days of the start of the work. The report will provide a recommendation for the depth of testing needed along with associated maps and profiles describing the result of the work. This information will be shared with NYSDOT, FHWA, SHPO and the consulting parties to further refine the Tier IB, 2, and 3 Excavations as described below.  Overview of Tier 1B, 2, and 3 Excavations  Due to several parameters of the data recovery component of the project including site area, environmental conditions, soil types, and site loci with variable artifact concentrations, the New York State Historic Preservation Office, New York State Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration and consulting parties have proposed that the following tiered data recovery approach be employed. The tiered approach allows for consultativebased decision making at pre-established milestones in the mitigation process. Objectives and milestones for each tier are provided below. At the completion of the first two tiers, excavation results will be considered against a set of objective criteria. The objective criteria are derived directly for the accepted research questions to be employed for the data recovery component of the project. If the criteria are met, additional excavation will be completed. This process continues through the tiers until the criteria are not met and no further archaeological field work is determined to be warranted.  Excavations will be completed in excavation blocks no smaller than 2m x 5m (6.4 feet x 16.4 feet) in area, and preferably in blocks 2m x 10m (6.4 feet x 32.8 feet) or 3m x 10m (9.8 feet x 32 feet) in size. Block excavations are suitable for exposing large areas of a site and facilitating the identification of less-obvious ephemeral archaeological features. Excavation will be established on the same field grid established for the Phase I testing and Phase II excavations conducted by Hartgen Archaeological Associates (2012).  Tier 1B Ð It is recommended that Tier 1B consists of systematic block testing to equal the remainder of the 10% of horizontal extent of the Engel Farm Precontact Site, or approximately 262 m2 (2820 ft2) of excavation units.  The following milestones are established to objectively assess if the provided research questions can be answered based upon the Tier IB level of data recovery: . Is the overall artifact density greater than 4.04 artifacts/ m2 excavated? . Are there any lithic artifacts attributable to Paleo-Indian occupation? . Does the artifact assemblage include other artifact classes beyond lithics? . Does the artifact assemblage include diagnostic artifacts both in: o Temporal and cultural affiliation? o Material origin? . Are subsurface archaeological features identified? . Is there any evidence of burials within the project limits?   If none of the above criteria are met, the data recovery will be considered complete and proceed with the regional synthesis component of the project. If any of the criteria above are met, the data recovery process would continue to Tier 2. Tier 2 would continue investigation to expand any unit(s) that meets the above criteria, by excavating an additional block test in the immediate vicinity.  If material (artifacts) recovered through the completion of Tier 1B excavations cannot aide in addressing the provided research questions, advancement to Tier IB excavation is likely not warranted. If analyses of material recovered through the completion of Tier IB can address the majority of these milestones, advancement to Tier 2 and continued data recovery is likely warranted. If analyses of material recovered through the completion of Tier One B can address all of these milestones to conclusion, advancement to Tier Two and continued data recovery is likely warranted.  After completion of approximately 85% of Tier 1B Data Recovery, preliminary results will be summarized by the field archaeologists in an End-of-Field letter and prepared for presentation to the consulting parties. Preliminary recommendations will also be prepared for the consulting parties prior to review. If further field work is recommended, these steps will allow for the seamless continuation of ongoing field work.  Based upon recovered information, the determination should be made in consultation if Tier 2 excavations should proceed, and if so to determine the location and size of the block excavations. Information considered should include evaluation of lithics recovered (e.g., tool types, diagnostics, material, quantity), other artifact types recovered (e.g., ceramics, processed faunal remains), features identified, soil types, etc.  Tier 2 Ð If it is determined that Tier 2 excavations are warranted, it is recommended that these excavations include additional block-type and individual unit excavations to attain a higher percentage of coverage and at the same time help determine what methods, if any, would be needed to obtain sub-plow zone materials if present.  It is recommended that Tier 2 consists of systematic block testing to equal 5% of horizontal extent of the Engel Farm Precontact Archaeological Site, or approximately 185m2 (1991 ft2) of excavation units.  After completion of the Tier 2 Data recovery, preliminary results will be summarized by the field archaeologists and prepared for presentation to the consulting parties. Preliminary recommendations will also be prepared for the consulting parties prior to review. These preliminary results may be prepared before completion of all scheduled fieldwork for Tier 2 excavations. This will reduce delays between review of preliminary field results and the determination if Tier 3 excavations are warranted by meeting the established criteria.  Based upon recovered information, the determination should be made in consultation if Tier 3 excavations should proceed, and if so to determine the location and size of the block excavations. Information considered should include evaluation of lithics recovered (e.g., tool types, diagnostics, material, quantity), other artifact types recovered (e.g., ceramics, processed faunal remains), features identified, soil types, etc.  The following milestones are established to objectively assess if the provided research questions can be answered based upon the Tier 2 level of data recovery:  . Is the overall artifact density of the site greater than 4.04 artifacts/m2 excavated? . Are there any lithic artifacts attributable to Paleo-Indian occupation? . Does the artifact assemblage include other artifact classes beyond lithics? . Does the artifact assemblage include diagnostic artifacts both in: o Temporal and cultural affiliation? o Material origin? . Are subsurface archaeological features identified?  If material (artifacts) recovered through the completion of Tier 2 cannot aid in addressing the provided research questions, advancement to Tier 3 is likely not warranted. If analyses of material recovered through the completion of Tier 2 can address the majority of these milestones, advancement to Tier 3 and continued data recovery is likely warranted.  Results should be reviewed by the consulting parties. Based upon recovered information, the determination should be made in consultation if Tier 3 excavations should proceed. Location and size of excavations should be reviewed in consultation prior to initiation of field work.  If further excavation is deemed warranted Tier 3 excavations should be designed to continue questions that have developed during field work of Tiers 1 and 2 for the remainder of the site. If a stone zone is present, Tier 3 should determine if a large enough sample has been obtained to ensure a legitimate interpretation of the site.  Tier 3-If it is determined that Tier 3 excavations are warranted, it is recommended that these excavations include additional block-type and individual unit excavations to attain a higher percentage of coverage and at the same time help determine what methods, if any, would be needed to obtain sub-plow zone materials if present.  It is recommended that Tier 3 consists of final archaeological testing to equal 5% of horizontal extent of the Engel Farm Precontact Archaeological Site, or approximately 185m2 (1991 ft2) of excavation units.  If further excavation is deemed warranted Tier 3 excavations should be designed to address/ continue questions that have developed during field work of Tiers 1 and 2 for the remainder of the site. Specifically, Tier 3 should remove the plow zone to look for all potential features with appropriate data gathering (sampling or full excavation of features). If a stone zone is present, Tier 3 should determine if a large enough sample has been obtained to ensure a legitimate interpretation of the site.  Excavation Procedures  Mitigation of the Engel Farm Site will involve the excavation of large block units within the project limits. Each of the units will be excavated 15 cm (6 ins.) into sterile non-artifact bearing soils using shovels and trowels. Each of these units will be excavated in 10 cm (4 ins.) arbitrary levels within natural soil horizons. Natural soil horizons will be identified based upon changes in the color and texture of the soils. Changes in the color of the soil will be determined using the Munsell Soil Color Charts (Munsell 1975) while changes in the texture of the soils will be determined based upon the quantity or frequency of sand, silt, and clay present in a particular layer. The soils that are removed from these units will be screened through . inch (0.63 cm) mesh hardware cloth and the artifacts that are recovered from each of the units will be bagged by excavation layer or feature and will be returned to the Anthropology Laboratory at the New York State Museum to be washed and catalogued. A detailed description of the analysis of specific artifact classes is contained in the Artifact Analysis and Interpretation section of this report.  To insure that the excavation of these block excavations do not violate OSHA safety regulations, each of these units will be excavated in the center if they exceed a depth greater than 1 meter. Based upon the information collected during the site examination as well as similar excavations conducted within the Pine Bush, we currently anticipate that the deeper units that are excavated within the project limits may need to be excavated to a depth of 150 cm (59 ins) below the ground surface. If the deposits extend more than 150 cm (59 ins), then the walls of the unit may need to be shored by the contractor or NYSDOT to insure the safety of the field crew.  We currently estimate less than a dozen features to be identified within the project limits. Each of the features will be photographed and drawn in plan view prior to excavation. Once the feature is bisected and a crosssection of the feature is visible in the wall or floor of the unit, basic information (e.g. feature type, the size and shape of the feature, whether the feature contains artifacts) about the feature will be recorded on standard field forms.  Flotation samples will be collected from both features and living floor contexts. Flotation samples will be collected in standard 10 liter units with initial processing (floating and sorting) of the samples occurring at the New York State Museum. Once the floatation samples have been processed, the botanical remains will be sent to a professional archaeobotanist for identification. Analysis and identification of faunal remains will be completed ÒinhouseÓ by staff from the New York State Museum. Recovery of floral and faunal remains from the site will not only contribute to our understanding of the subsistence strategies of these precontact populations but will also provide basic information about the types of plants and animals that were locally available.  Charcoal samples will also be collected from intact features for radiocarbon dating. We currently anticipate that charcoal samples will be sent to Beta Analytic, Inc. for analysis. Ideally, each of these samples will be derived from a different feature. However, if less than a dozen charcoal bearing features are identified, then multiple samples from important features may be submitted for analysis. If more than a dozen features are identified, then the principal investigator will devise a sampling strategy to insure that the various components of the site are adequately dated.   The north and east walls of the units will be scraped with trowels and photographed before the block excavations are backfilled. At this time, a geomorphologist (Dr. Julieann van Nest) from the New York State Museum will analyze the soils within the project limits. Soil samples will be collected from each of the major soil horizons and will be sent to Pennsylvania State University Department of Agronomy for particle size (PSA) and organic carbon analysis (OCA). Once analyzed, this information will be correlated with the artifacts that are recovered during the field investigations so that research questions relating to the formation processes and age of the site can be addressed.  At the completion of the field investigations, it expected that between 10% and 20% of the current site area will have been excavated.  Project-specific Needs   Based upon guidelines agreed upon by the NYSHPO, the NYSDOT, the FHWA and the Consulting Parties, stripping of the site will not be permitted since previous testing demonstrated that artifacts are recoverable from the ÒplowzoneÓ and that artifacts in the plowzone maintain a level of horizontal locational integrity, even if vertical displacement of artifacts within the plowzone has occurred as a result of past farming activity.  Additional restrictions as agreed upon by the NYSHPO, the NYSDOT, the FHWA, and the Consulting Parties, indicate that the use of heavy equipment will be prohibited within the site boundaries. Due to the nature of the sandy soils on site, the near surface deposits identified within the project limits by Hartgen Archaeological Associates (2012), the use of heavy equipment within the project limits has the potential to impact fragile remains.  A tribal monitor will be on site during all phases of archaeological field work.  ARTIFACT ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION  PRECONTACT ARTIFACT ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION  Processing and Artifact Analysis  All artifacts will be returned to the Anthropology Laboratory at the New York State Museum to be washed and catalogued. Precontact artifacts will be catalogued according to procedures developed by staff from the New York State Museum in Albany. During this project, precontact artifacts will be assigned to one of seven distinct material classes including chipped stone, ground stone, pottery, shell, bone, and other. Each of these material classes will be further broken down into distinct subcategories based upon their specific material form, surface treatment, and/or function (e.g. gray chert Vosburg projectile point). Approximate periods of use and/or information concerning the cultural tradition will be recorded when appropriate. The resulting catalogs will be entered into a relational data base management program (ACCESS) to facilitate subsequent analysis and accessioning of artifacts. With the exception of the samples that are submitted for radiocarbon analysis, all of the artifacts that are sent to consultants for analysis will be returned to the New York State Museum upon the completion of the analysis. Since the samples that are submitted for radiocarbon dating will be destroyed during analysis, documentation of the submitted samples (e.g. weight, number of specimens, etc.) will be completed prior to submission to Beta Analytic, Inc. for analysis. This information will be included in the final artifact catalog.  Artifacts are expected to be recovered from each of the test units and will allow questions related to the chronology, site formation processes, spatial organization and function, subsistence, and organization of lithic technology to be addressed. Questions related to the chronology of the site will be addressed using radiocarbon dating and stylistic analysis of artifacts. Stylistic analysis of artifacts will be completed by staff from the New York State Museum and will involve a comparison of artifacts against previously established artifact typologies. Projectile points will be assigned to a particular time period based upon established point types in Ritchie (1971). Diagnostic pottery may also be recovered if the site dates later than the Transitional Period (circa 1,500 B.C.). If pottery is recovered during the field investigations, assessment of the temporal affiliation of these artifacts will follow Ritchie and MacNeish (1949:97-124) and MacNeish (1952).  We currently anticipate that less than a dozen precontact features will be identified within the project limits. One charcoal sample (weighing approximately 15-30 g) will be collected from each of the features and will be sent to Beta-Analytic, Inc. of Coral Gables, Florida for radiocarbon dating. If more than a dozen features are identified within the project limits, a sampling strategy will be devised by the principal investigator so that a representative sample of the siteÕs deposits can be dated. If less than one dozen charcoal bearing features are identified, then multiple samples may be submitted for analysis.  A study of the siteÕs geomorphology will be completed by a professional geomorphologist (Dr. Juliann van Nest) and is expected to produce data that will allow questions concerning the formation of the site to be addressed. The formation of the site will largely be reconstructed based upon a visual examination and mapping of the horizontal and vertical distribution of soils across the site. This work will be facilitated by the collection of soil samples for particle size analysis and organic carbon analysis. Particle size analysis will allow researchers to document the physical properties (e.g. lithology, stratigraphy, etc.) of the sediments (Brown 1997). Organic carbon analysis is expected to produce information about the development and modification of soils as a result of human activity (Brown 1997). We currently anticipate that 10 soil samples will be sent to the Department of Agronomy at Pennsylvania State University for analysis. Each of these samples will be collected from different soil layers and a complete discussion of the results of this work will be contained in the final report.  Given the large size and location of the excavation units across the site, researchers should be able to collect information that will allow issues relating to the development of the site to be documented and the age of individual soil layers to be estimated (Tankersley et. al. 1997). Information regarding the formation and age of these deposits may be further refined once the physical properties of the soils, artifacts, and radiocarbon dates from features are compared. Excavation of these large block excavations to a minimum depth of 150 cm (59 ins) should also be sufficient to allow questions regarding the stratified nature of the site to also be resolved.  Questions relating to the organization of lithic technology will be completed through a detailed analysis of the chipped and ground stone tools from the site. Processing and general cataloging of chipped stone tools will be completed using the criteria outlined in the reconnaissance survey and the site examination reports (Hartgen 2012). Initial analysis will involve cataloging these artifacts according to their functional or technological attributes (e.g. biface, projectile point, debitage, utilized flake, etc.), material type, and size. Flakes and pieces of lithic shatter will be further assigned to one of nine debitage categories (e.g. primary, secondary, tertiary, bifacial thinning, pressure, broken, or utilized flakes, general shatter, and block shatter, etc.) and a general edge wear inspection of these flakes will be completed using a binocular microscope.   Once general morphological analysis of these artifacts has been completed, a 10-20% sample of the lithic assemblage will be carried out by a professional lithic analysis for use-wear analysis. Use-wear analysis of these artifacts is expected to provide information that will allow archaeologists to determine how and under what conditions these expedient and curated tools were used. The sample that will be analyzed will be selected by the principal investigator and will include artifacts that exhibit evidence of polishes or striations on the artifactÕs surface as determined during general examination under low magnification. Detailed analysis of the striations (e.g. type, density, and distribution) and identification of polishes will be completed using a light microscope at a magnification of 100x to 500x. Identification of specific polishes will be determined based upon the comparison of artifacts with existing reference collections. When possible, the consultant will photograph prominent examples of polishes and striations so that a permanent record of the use-wear patterns of these artifacts can be created. Some of these photographs will be included in the final project report.  If recovered in the test units, ground or pecked stone tools will be catalogued according to their functional characteristics (e.g. hammerstone, pitted stone, netsinkers, etc.) and material type. Correlation of these artifacts with other artifacts from the site is not only expected to contribute to our understanding of the organization of lithic technology but is also expected to contribute to our understanding of the function and settlement organization of the site. The locations of fire-cracked rock will also be recorded on the project map. These artifacts are also expected to contribute to our understanding of the function and settlement organization of the site and will be counted and weighed before being discarded in the field.   The spatial organization and function of the site will be reconstructed through an analysis of the spatial patterning of artifacts and features across the site. As previously discussed, the reconnaissance survey and the site examination identified several artifact clusters within the boundaries of the project area. Several block units will be excavated within the boundaries of this artifact cluster and detailed information about the horizontal arrangement of artifacts and features within this cluster may result in the delineation of smaller activity areas across the site. Association of these activity areas with a particular function or activity will largely be determined based upon the types of features and artifacts that are identified.  A detailed analysis of the vertical arrangement of artifacts in the various soil layers is also expected to contribute to our understanding of the stratified nature of the site as well as assist archaeologists in determining how many different precontact occupations are present at the site. If two or more occupation layers are identified, variations in the distribution of chipped stone tools, debitage, and other artifacts between these different occupation levels is expected to be informative and will enhance our understanding of changes in the spatial organization and use of this site.   Site function will be determined based upon the number and types of activities that can be assigned to a particular occupation layer. The discovery of features within the project limits (and the subsequent analysis of feature contents) will form the basis for our interpretation the siteÕs function. Features will be assigned to different functional categories (e.g. hearths, storage pits, postmolds, etc.) based upon their contents, shape, size, and relationship to other site attributes (Moeller 1992). Features that fail to produce diagnostic artifacts but are identified in the same soil layer will be considered to be contemporaneous. Documentation of the location of these features across the site and in relationship to high concentrations of artifacts is important and will also contribute to our understanding of the spatial organization of the site.  Detailed analysis of the types of artifacts (e.g. ground and chipped stone tools) is also expected to contribute information about the function of the site. As previously discussed, the identification of specific polishes and striations on expedient and curated chipped stone tools will allow archaeologists to make inferences about the types of resources that were exploited, the processing/preparation of these resources, and the degree of mobility needed to acquire such resources.   Documentation of the subsistence economies of these hunter-gatherer populations will be determined based upon the recovery of floral and faunal remains from features and intact living floors. Flotation samples will be collected in 10 liter units and will be initially processed (or floated) by staff at the New York State Museum. Depending upon the types of carbonized remains that are recovered from heavy and light fractions, as many as 14 floral samples will be sent to a professional archaeobotanist for identification. The principal investigator will be responsible for the final selection of these samples so that a representative sample from feature and non-feature contexts can be obtained.  We expect that floral remains will be identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. Identification of individual specimens will be determined based upon the size and shape of the seed. Comparisons with existing type botanical collections and/or known seed identification manuals may also be completed if unusual or unique specimens are recovered. A description of the frequency and types of seeds that are found will be included in the final report. This information will be integrated with other types of data (e.g. faunal remains, lithic polish, etc.) so that questions about seasonality and precontact subsistence can be addressed.  Analysis of faunal remains will be completed Òin houseÓ by staff from the New York State Museum. When possible NYSM staff will also collect more specific information about the remains including the species, When possible, additional information regarding the specific bone element and portion, bone fusion, and presence of specific markings (e.g. cut marks) will be recorded. State of bone fusion can provide information about the age of the animal at the time of death. Precontact butchering techniques and post depositional processes (especially those caused by rodent activity) can also be inferred from the markings that are present on the bone.  Interpretation   The data that are generated as a result of the field investigations will be integrated to provide an interpretation of the use of this precontact site. Integration of these types of data is expected to provide an insight into the use and settlement of this site. Use-wear analysis and identification of subsistence remains from features will not only provide critical information about the seasonality and function of the site but are also expected to provide information about the types of resources that were exploited and the range of activities that occurred at the site. A detailed understanding of the organization of lithic technology will also contribute to our understanding of possible lithic exchange networks and the movement of groups throughout the region. Finally, an assessment of the physical characteristics of the soils and their relationship to artifacts will provide information about the chronology and the formation of the site.  An important aspect of this work will involve its interpretation in relationship to regional settlement and subsistence patterns. In the absence of an adequate settlement and subsistence model for Albany County, the data that are generated will be interpreted in relationship to VersaggiÕs hunter-gatherer settlement model (Versaggi 1987). Although this model was originally constructed for the adjacent Susquehanna Valley, use of the model in eastern Schoharie and Albany Counties (Jones et. al. 1992; Versaggi and McDonald 1991) suggests that it can provide a basic framework against which this small site can be interpreted. In the future, as new sites are identified in the Town of Colonie, this model can be refined so that the unique characteristics of these hunter-gather populations are reflected.   CURATION   All artifacts and project documentation (e.g. unit forms, field notes, project maps, etc.) will be curated at the New York State Museum in Albany. Given the number of artifacts that were produced during the site examination, mitigation of the Engel Farm site is expected to produce in excess of 400 artifacts and may require as much as 3 ft3 for storage. These artifacts will be curated according to state and federal guidelines for the curation of archaeological remains as outlined in the New York State Education Department Cultural Resource Survey Program Work Scope Specifications for Cultural Resource Investigations on New York State Department of Transportation Projects (NYSED 2004: Appendix D). The New York State Museum meets state and federal guidelines for being a repository for these items.   REPORT   An end of field letter will be submitted to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) and the New York State Historic Preservation Office (NYSHPO) within 5 days of the completion of the fieldwork. A final report will be submitted to NYSDOT for approval within one year of the completion of the fieldwork. This report will include specific sections devoted to the prehistory of the project area, the field and laboratory methods, excavation results, artifact analysis, and interpretation.  In addition, a separate Historic Context Report will be prepared and submitted as a separate volume with the final report. The Historic Context Report will review what is known about the environmental, historic, and settlement/subsistence occupation of the Pine Bush and its larger significance to sites located in Albany County, New York. The Historic Context Report will provide a summary of potential research questions that could be generated as well as a list of collections/projects/archaeological materials already known to exist for the Pine Bush.  After NYSDOT has approved the report, a copy of the report will be submitted to NYSHPO for comment. After both NYSHPO and NYSDOT have approved the final report, additional copies will be made available to SHPO for distribution to local and state repositories.  DISSEMINATION OF PROJECT RESULTS   The results of this project will be disseminated through public lectures and talks to community and civic groups, public programs (behind the scenes tours) as well as visits to the site during excavation. Conference presentations may also be generated for the New York State Archaeological Association and the New York Archaeological Council at the conclusion of the project. In addition, the Historic Context document that is developed for this project will be disseminated to the town and public offices to assist in planning efforts for future projects in the Town of Colonie.  SCHEDULE   This project is expected to take approximately 45 weeks to complete with specific tasks assigned as follows:  Project Set-up and Landowner Notification: It is expected to take one week to set-up the project and obtain permission to excavate from current landowner.  Fieldwork: Data Recovery excavation of the Engel Farm site is expected to take between 14 and 16 weeks to complete.  End-of-Field Letter: An end of field letter will be submitted by staff from the New York State Museum to the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation, Region 1, and the NYS Environmental Science Bureau within 5 days of the completion of the fieldwork. This letter will contain a summary of the field investigations as well as a discussion of whether the work deviated from what was originally proposed within the Data Recovery Plan and why, and if enough information has been collected to address the research questions outlined in the data recovery plan. NYSDOT will be responsible for distributing the letter to other interested parties and the Federal Highway Administration as needed.  Laboratory Processing/Analysis: Artifact processing and cataloging is expected to take 6 weeks to complete with some of the work being completed while the fieldwork is on-going.  Data Recovery Report: A final report is expected to take approximately 20 weeks to produce. Production of the report on the Data Recovery Excavations may occur while the processing of artifacts is on-going.  Historic Context Report: A final report containing the historic context is expected to take approximately 6 months to complete. Production of the Historic Context Report may occur while the Data Recovery excavations are occurring.  KEY PERSONNEL  Principal Investigator: Dr. Christina Rieth will serve as the principal investigator for this project. The principal investigator is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the excavation and analysis as well as preparing the final report for the data recovery project.  Crew Chief: A crew chief will be assigned to this project as available. The crew chief will not only be responsible for supervising the field crew but will also be responsible for the daily excavation of the site in the principal investigatorÕs absence.  Field Technicians: Field technicians will be assigned to this project as available. Field technicians will be responsible for carrying out all aspects of the excavation and general data recording during the field investigations.  Lab Technicians: The lab technicians will be assigned to this project as available. The lab technicians are responsible for the general processing and cataloging of artifacts. In addition, lab technicians may also assist the principal investigator in the analysis of artifacts and preparation of the final project report.  Lithic Analyst: Lithic Analysis will be completed by the staff from the New York State Museum and will be responsible for completing micro-wear analysis of flakes and chipped stone tools from the site.  Archaeobotanist: Nancy Asch Sidell will be hired as a consultant for this project and will be responsible for the identification of botanical remains recovered from the site.  Geomorphologist: Dr. Julieann van Nest of the New York State Museum will serve as the geomorphologist for this project and will be responsible for completing a geoarchaeological study of the site.   NEW YORK STATE OFFICE OF PARKS, RECREATION, AND HISTORIC PRESERVATION HUMAN REMAINS POLICY   In the event that human remains are encountered at the Engel Farm site, the following guidelines will be followed:  . At all times human remains must be treated with the utmost dignity and respect. Should human remains be encountered, work in the general area of the discovery will stop immediately and the location will be immediately secured and protected from damage and disturbance.  . Human remains or associated artifacts will be left in place and not disturbed. No skeletal remains or materials associated with the remains will be collected or removed until appropriate consultation has taken place and a plan of action has been developed.  . The county coroner/medical examiner, local law enforcement, the SHPO, the appropriate Indian Nations and the involved agency will be notified immediately. The coroner and local law enforcement will make the official ruling on the nature of the remains, being either forensic or archaeological.  . If human remains are determined to be Native American, the remains will be left in place and protected from further disturbance, until a plan for their avoidance or removal can be generated. Please note that avoidance is the preferred choice of the SHPO and Indian Nations. The involved agency will consult SHPO and appropriate Indian Nations to develop a plan of action that is consistent with the Native Americans Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) guidance.  . If human remains are determined to be non-Native American, the remains will be left in place and protected from further disturbance until a plan for their avoidance or removal can be generated. Please note that avoidance is the preferred choice of the SHPO. Consultation with the SHPO and other appropriate parties will be required to determine a plan of action.   Bibliography  Asch Sidell, N. 1999 Precontact Plant Use in Maine: Paleoindian to Contact Period.

If a burial site, human remains, or bones thought to be human remains, are encountered during construction for a DOT undertaking, the work will be stopped immediately and rescheduled to avoid disturbing the area. The remains will be left in place and protected from further damage.  2. In accordance with NYSDOT Updated Standard Specifications 107-01.D, Archaeological Salvage, the Engineerin-Charge (EIC) will, through proper channels, notify the Director of the Construction Division who will notify the DOT Office of Environment (OOE) and the Regional Cultural Resources Coordinator (CRC). The EIC will report the discovery of human remains to the local police, and the county coroner having jurisdiction, or to the medical examiner, and will arrange immediate inspection of the site1. 1 In NYC, the discovery must be reported to the office of the chief medical examiner and to a police officer. In Erie County, the discovery must be reported to the medical director.  2 Assuming archaeologists are not already on-site, monitoring construction activities. In most cases, professional bioarchaeologists on staff at the NYS Museum, Public Archaeology Facility at Binghamton, or State University at Buffalo will be called in for the identification.  3. If the site is determined to be part of a criminal investigation, the police will notify the EIC when work in the area may resume.  4. If determined that the remains are not a police issue, the CRC will notify the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation/ State Historic Preservation Office (OPRHP/SHPO), appropriate Indian tribal contacts, and archaeologists2, and arrange site visits accordingly. Work will be temporarily suspended in the area, and measures will be taken to secure the burial site and protect the remains from disturbance.  5. The OOE will arrange for professional skeletal analysis to identify the remains as human, if necessary. NYSDOT will invite designated Indian tribal representative(s) to participate in the consultation process. Representatives will be determined on the basis of established Department contacts and identified areas of interest for tribal nations.  6. The OOE, in consultation with the OPRHP/SHPO, Indian tribes and other identified consulting parties, will arrange for an archeologist to establish horizontal and vertical extent of the burial(s) and assess measures for avoiding the human remains if possible.  7. Any new location or alignment developed to avoid the burial(s) will be subject to archaeological investigation, and the results will be provided to the OPRHP/SHPO, Indian tribes, and other consulting parties as appropriate for comment before the project proceeds in this area.  8. If the alignment is unchanged, a plan will be developed in coordination with FHWA, SHPO, Indian tribes, and other consulting parties as appropriate to preserve the site and protect the burial(s) before the project proceeds in this area.  9. If removal and reburial of the remains is necessary, it will be undertaken in a manner agreed to by all involved parties. Temporary disposition of the remains until reburial will be determined in consultation with the Indian tribes and other consulting parties as appropriate.  10. Any actions relating to the treatment, disposition, removal, or reburial of human remains will comply with all applicable State and Federal laws and regulations.  1 Introduction  Safety Table 3 - Measurement Receiver Descriptions Table 5 - Sound Transmission Calculation Predicted noise levels at receivers for both design alternatives decrease from existing conditions. For both the Diamond and Flyover Alternatives, this is due in part, to shielding effects provided by the proposed on- and off-ramps. These shielding effects are particularly important for R1, R2 and R4 A-C. Changes in traffic patterns and volumes account for the change at R5. Although noise impacts have been evaluated for both the Diamond and Flyover Alternatives, the Diamond Alternative has been dismissed from further consideration as a reasonable alternative, as noted in Section 2.3 Ð Project Alternates. As such, abatement measures have only been considered for the Flyover Alternative.  West Wall 5 Summary  Figures INPUT: ROADWAYS Interchange 3/4 CHA 27 February 2012 EVN TNM 2.5 INPUT:

Is the State sufficiently financially committed to the second phase of the project or can the State Legislature do something to be of assistance? Response 1: The Department, in conjunction with the capital District Transportation Committee (CDTC), has identified an excess of $26.0 M available post-TIP for Phase 2 of this project. Paula A. Mahan, Supervisor, Town of Colonie Comment 2: We really support the project in the Town of Colonie. We have been working with the State DOT for several years now and you have done a great job of keeping us informed and involving us in the options that are available to the Town. We look forward to continuing to work with you. Response 2: Comment noted. John OÕDonnell, CEO, Albany County Airport Authority Comment 3: I have been at the Airport for 18 years and I've worked diligently with NYSDOT to achieve what we consider to be the solution, the Flyover Alternative. The Airport serves some 15 counties and many of those folks don't know how to navigate around the congestion that currently exists. The Airport is committed to working with the local chambers and our elected officials to press the funding for this project; however, we'd like to see the schedule improve. Response 3: NYSDOT is open to moving the Phase 2 construction forward if project funding becomes available. Mike Eagan, President & CEO, Albany-Colonie Regional Chamber of Commerce Comment 4: The Airport is a regional asset and this project is important to the entire region. We have letters of support from organizations in Columbia County, Greene County, Rensselaer County, Saratoga County, Warren and Washington County because we realize that it's important to the overall safety and overall growth of our community. We're pleased that the DOT's office realizes that this project is important and we believe the Governor's office realizes that. It is critical to make sure we are not here for another hearing about this in five or six years, but in five or six years from now people are on the newly constructed Exit 4. Response 4: Comment noted. Ivan Vamos, New York State Bicycling Coalition / CDTC Bike-Pedestrian Advisory Board Comment 5: The shared use path along the south and southwest side of Albany-Shaker Road is an excellent feature of the project, providing a much needed connection to attractions along the route and to an underutilized trail segment built with an earlier phase of Albany-Shaker Road (CR 151) project to the north and west and the many destinations to the east linking to commercial, cultural and recreational attractions. Response 5: Comment noted. Comment 6: Improvements to the sidewalks along Albany-Shaker Road and Wolf Road and the improved connections between the new shared use path and destinations such as hotels, restaurants, the library, the Crossings Park can greatly improve the attraction of the area for visitors, commuters and others. Response 6: Comment noted. Comment 7: Intersections such as the ones at Wolf Road and the junction of the flyover ramps and Albany-Shaker Road will require extra attention to safely accommodate heavy use by many modes of travel. We hope that theAugust 2014 Final Design Report / Environmental Impact Statement PIN 1721.51 rideable shoulders on Albany-Shaker Road will also get the improvements (and clear marking) as noted in the project features, since use along this route can be expected to increase. Response 7: Traffic control details to manage conflicts between vehicles and bicyclists at the southern end of the shared-use path will be explored during final design. Comment 8: The people bicycling or walking along the new shared use path who are destined to the airport will use the path until it ends, then cross Albany-Shaker Road at a traffic light and enter the airport complex. Some connections through the parking and to the terminal are probably needed at that location. Response 8: The entrance into Albany International Airport is outside of the project study area, and improvements to the pedestrian facilities between Albany-Shaker Road and the airport terminal are outside of the scope of the proposed project. In addition, the parking area at the airport is owned and maintained by Albany County Airport Authority, and as the owner, any projects would need to be progressed by the Authority. Comment 9: The problem will be those bicyclists and pedestrians who arrive at the end of the trail in search of the next trail segment. That little used, but existing trail segment can be accessed via a difficult to find trailhead next to NYS Route 155, and then the trail segment is located parallel to and to the west of new CR 151. Most of the walkers and riders at the ÒendÓ of the new trail to be built with Exit 4, when faced with the dilemma of no shown path to the next trail segment, will proceed north, as counter-flow traffic along the southeast bound limited access four lanes of Albany-Shaker Road until they find an entrance road that may look like it can connect to the existing trail link. This will create a dangerous situation and perhaps a nuisance to some property owners. The obvious solution is to route those wishing to continue along the trails but are not headed to the airport to turn west on Meeting House Road, past the Shaker Historic attractions and probably proceed along Ann Lee Pond Park, Heritage Lane, and perhaps Airline Drive (one block each) to the existing shared use trail and bridge over NYS Route 155. While this is a pleasant ride / walk along low volume roads, the appearance of the route can be confusing and perceived as the entrance to a private farm-like complex (that after all was the historic use of the property). Unless the route is well marked and somewhat improved, bicyclists and pedestrians who are unfamiliar with the connection will avoid it and confront a dangerous alternative a little further north at the end of the new trail. Response 9: The need for guide signs for the shared-use path and connection along Meeting House Road to the existing Albany-Shaker Road trail system will be evaluated during final design. Comment 10: The need is to develop a design and project that will tie these two important trail segments together. The markings and signs should be designed and implemented with Exit 4 and be in keeping with the historic and natural character of the area, while carrying the clear message recommending the safe through-travel route. Your consultant team for the next phase of the Exit 4 project can add at a very small increment to the design costs involved for this task. We hope this small but most important added component of the Exit 4 project can be added to the design and implementation work being undertaken along with the major phases of the interchange and trail projects scheduled for 2019. Response 10: The need for guide signs for the shared-use path and connection along Meeting House Road to the existing Albany-Shaker Road trail system will be evaluated during final design. Anthony LaFleche, Resident Comment 11: I support the 12-foot travel lanes that offer wide trucks and buses to get through and go through the traffic. We hope that's the standard for many other DOT projects. I just want some consistency in the width of the travel lanes and the 12-foot, I think, is superior. Response 11: Comment noted. Comment 12: I support expanding the northbound Exit 4 entrance ramp to the Exit 5 exit ramp will allow for much smoother merging in traffic and less traffic backup north of Exit 4, which occurs daily. Response 12: Comment noted. Comment 13: I think the flyover ramp is the best alternative because it allows the northbound traffic to go pretty much directly to the Airport avoiding two whole intersections and allowing the southbound traffic to avoid one intersection. It's going to allow for them to get in and out faster and less backup on Wolf Road and particularly the Wolf Road/Albany-Shaker Road intersection. Response 13: Comment noted.August 2014 Final Design Report / Environmental Impact Statement PIN 1721.51 Comment 14: Creating the more traditional diamond entrance ramp for Exit 5 southbound and eliminating the auxiliary 5/4 ramps in that area will improve the safety and reduce driving congestion. Response 14: Comment noted. Comment 15: My main concern is having the bridge remain at three travel lanes in each direction. If this bridge is going to last for 50 years or even longer, can we honestly say that three lanes will be enough throughout that entire time period to handle the capacity, particularly with the Airport growing, the region growing, particularly Saratoga County growing? I feel that having four lanes or at least the capacity for four lanes is ideal for that bridge. Response 15: The State has no current plans to widen I-87; however, over-widening of the bridge will be necessary in order to maintain three lanes of traffic in each direction of I-87 during construction. Comment 16: The shoulders on Albany-Shaker Road will be five feet. I think eight feet they should be eight feet to match the consistency with some other DOT projects. It allows bikes to avoid traffic even more, it allows traffic to pull over just in case of an emergency, and allows emergency vehicles to use it as a temporary lane. Five feet can't do it, but eight feet can handle any vehicle on the road. Response 16: The bike lanes on Albany-Shaker Road between Wolf Road and the flyover ramps are proposed to be 5 ft. wide which is the standard width for bicycle lanes on curbed roads in accordance with the NYSDOT Highway Design Manual, Chapter 17. Providing more bicycle lane width would result in additional right-ofway impacts and potentially result in 1 additional residential relocation and impacts to parking areas at commercial businesses along Albany-Shaker Road. Comment 17: The northbound Exit 4 flyover lane, when it finally merges with Albany-Shaker Road, has two leftturn lanes and one right-turn lane right. If you can make that middle lane go left or right, because either way both would go into two travel lanes in either direction, it would allow for the people coming from the Northway not to have to go over two lanes to have to turn right. I think that will improve traffic flow in that area and make it easier for the people to not have to merge over two lanes. Response 17: Reconfiguring the lanes on the ramps for a right turn lane, shared right/left turn lane, and left turn lane was considered and dismissed because it would potentially create additional queues in the center lane by holding right turning vehicles behind left turning vehicles at the red signal that could otherwise turn right on red. Gloria Jean Knorr, Resident Comment 18: I never liked Exit 4 because my uncle's farm was cut by the Northway separating his house from his barn and farmland. I am happy that Exit 4 is gone, because I'm a bus traveler. I get off at Engel's Farm and walk Old Wolf Road to Albany Medical College Department of Medicine on Watervliet-Shaker Road. I would like to sell the 13 acres that remain of my uncleÕs farm in honor of my son by having a wonderful project there. Response 18: Comment noted. Howard Adams, Jr. Comment 19: I was around long before the Northway was built and I have seen the DOT make a lot of mistakes. The first one was when they first started the Northway. Look at the Tappan Zee Bridge, any kid walking through the woods knows you don't pick the largest part of the (river) to jump across. Not only that, it has salt water, as well from the road salt in the winter. And now, it's falling apart. So what do they do? They spend another hundred, billion, thousands or however many bucks they're spending to make the mistake all over again down there. And three miles down the river, they could have built a substantial bridge like the George Washington, hang it from wire, no salt wear, just like the George Washington Bridge. Response 19: Comment noted. Comment 20: I think, as I see this, they are not considering the most logical alternative, which is a simple cloverleaf intersection exit just like up at Exit 6. They're making a primary mistake by creating another T-intersection with traffic lights to get to the Albany Airport. On Wolf Road now, it's essentially a T-intersection. And when you come off of the Northway to get to Wolf Road, you come to a T-intersection. The T-intersection is a short-term solution. You don't build super highways with 10 years, 20 years, or 50 years in mind. You build it for the future. IAugust 2014 Final Design Report / Environmental Impact Statement PIN 1721.51 am so sick and tired of hearing these grandiose mistakes. What you should do is reconsider the whole thing and make a regular clover intersection. So you have to fill in a few swamps, knock down a motel or two, but you do that all the time. And as far as filling in swamps, if the wetlands law was there 200 years ago, New York City would be a village, so would Albany. It's garbage. Go back to the drawing board and start looking one hundred years from now, not ten or five. Get a clover leaf there, period. Response 20: Since 2000, over 50 conceptual alternatives have been developed and evaluated for engineering considerations and environmental impacts. These concepts included clover leaf, single point urban interchange, and diamond interchange designs, as well as many others to improve traffic operations and access in the Exit 4 area. Based on evaluation of the conceptual alternatives, two alternatives were selected for further consideration in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement because they complied best with the project objectives. These alternatives were presented at the February 25, 2014 public hearing, and the Flyover Alternative has been selected as the Preferred Alternative because it meets all of the project objectives and results in less environmental impacts than the other feasible alternatives.August 2014 Final Design Report / Environmental Impact Statement PIN 1721.51 Analysis of Comments Received on the Draft Design Report / Environmental Impact StatementAugust 2014 Final Design Report / Environmental Impact Statement PIN 1721.51 Disposition of Comments on the Draft Design Report / Environmental Impact Statement (January 2014) The following is a summary of comments received during the public comment period for the January 2014 Draft Design Report (DDR) / Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the subject project. Amy L. Gitchell, Chief, Upstate New York Section, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Comment 1: We recommend that we conduct a site inspection of the project area with you this spring to verify the extent of waters of the United States in the project area, and to determine with you whether an approved or preliminary jurisdictional determination is appropriate for this project. Response 1: NYSDOT plans to proceed with a preliminary Jurisdictional Determination. A site visit with the ACOE will be scheduled during the summer of 2014. Comment 2: According to the DEIS, the NYSDOT plans to seek confirmation of Nationwide Permit Number 14 for Phase I of the project, and then seek an individual Department of the Army permit for Phase II of the project. Based upon the information received to date, we cannot concur at this time that separate review of the proposed impacts to waters of the United States for each project phase is appropriate in this case. Should the NYSDOT continue to seek separate authorizations for each phase, we recommend that the NYSDOT submit to this office as soon as possible, justification as to why you believe the reviews should be separated and have independent utility. Response 2: As part of the permitting process, NYSDOT will prepare and submit justification that the two construction phases have operational independence. Comment 3: In addition, it was indicated to this office that the NYSDOT planned to complete during Phase II of the project, any required compensatory mitigation needed to offset impacts to waters of the United States that would occur during Phase I construction. Given the timeframes between Phase I and II construction, the lack of confirmed funding for Phase II construction, and our regulations at 33 CFR Part 332.3(m), we would not approve this proposal. As stated in 33 CFR Part 332.3(m), implementation of the compensatory mitigation project shall be, to the maximum extent practicable, in advance of or concurrent with the activity causing the authorized impacts. Response 3: Mitigation for Phase 1 (replacement of the I-87 bridges over Albany-Shaker Road) wetland impacts will be completed during Phase 1 construction. Mitigation for Phase 2 construction (new interchange ramps) wetland impacts will be completed during Phase 2 construction. Comment 4: While we recognize that the work description and plans contained in the DEIS are not final, we are unsure that all proposed temporary and permanent impacts to aquatic resources have been identified. As we progress in the review of the overall project, please be sure to clearly (1) Identify the purpose of each impact to waters of the United States, (2) Identify if any proposed temporary impacts would occur within forested wetlands and whether they would be restored to their pre-existing cover type, (3) identify whether any utility line relocation work, noise barrier installation, drainage system cleaning and improvements, or pedestrian and bicycle use facilities would involve additional impacts to waters of the United States, (4) Identify and quality any proposed temporary impacts to streams or other open water areas (i.e. ponds), (5) Identify the duration of temporary impacts to aquatic resources and how these aquatic resources would be restored, and (6) Identify any measures that are proposed to be taken to prevent the spread of invasive species in the project vicinity Response 4: The following information will be clarified as indicated: (1) The purpose of each impact will be documented during the permitting process. (2) Temporary impacts are identified in Section 4.4.1 of the DEIS. Temporary impacts by plant community classification and the type of restoration proposed for each impact will be documented during the permitting process. (3) Wetland impacts for all proposed project work, including utility relocations, noise barrier installation, drainage, and pedestrian facilities have been accounted for in Section 4.4.1 of the DEIS.August 2014 Final Design Report / Environmental Impact Statement PIN 1721.51 (4) Temporary impacts to streams or other open water areas are identified in Section 4.4.2 of the DEIS and will be refined and documented during the permitting process. (5) The duration and restoration of temporary impacts to aquatic resources will be documented as part of the permitting process. (6) Proposed invasive species management is discussed in Section 4.4.9 of the DEIS and will be refined for each phase of the project and documented during the permitting process. Comment 5: We also recommend that you keep detailed records of all efforts taken to avoid and minimize impacts to waters of the United States to the maximum extent practicable and then provide this record to us to help determine whether the proposed activities meet our Clean Water Act 404(b)(1) Guidelines. Response 5: A summary of the efforts made to avoid and/or minimize impacts to waters of the United States has been prepared and included in the EO 11990 Findings Statement as part of the permitting process. Comment 6: The project involves the extension of existing culverts, some of which convey streams that have been identified as either perennial or relatively permanent waters. The existing culverts are noted as being reinforced concrete pipes between 24Ó and 30Ó in diameter. The sizes of these culverts seem inadequate to effectively manage water flows and their extension could exacerbate existing conditions. Please be sure to address this issue when seeking approval from this office for their extension. The site inspection recommended above should include visits to streams where culvert extensions or any new culverts are proposed. Response 6: Several tributaries flow through the project area. Each of these channels is currently conveyed under the highway in small diameter (24-36 inch) culvert pipes, and these culverts are relatively flat and slow flowing. As stated in DEIS Section 4.4.5 - Floodplains, there is no documented history of flooding at any of these crossings. It is anticipated that the existing culverts have sufficient capacity and that the proposed culverts associated with each alternative will be sized accordingly. In addition, the hydraulics of the existing and proposed culverts will be evaluated as part of the Phase 2 permitting process. Comment 7: Although this office has agreed that the NYSDOT should pursue compensatory wetland mitigation at Wetland Mitigation Area 13 (as identified in the DEIS), we cannot concur with the amount and type of proposed compensatory mitigation at this time, and whether all types of mitigation needed for this project can be accomplished at this site. As noted above, we are unsure that all impacts that could require compensatory mitigation have been identified. Additional mitigation may be required for the permanent or long term conversion of forested wetlands into other covers types needed for temporary impacts or other long term temporary impacts. Specific types and amounts of mitigation needed to compensate for the difficult to replace stream impacts need to be identified. Response 7: A site visit with the ACOE will be conducted during the summer of 2014 in order to complete the Jurisdictional Determination (JD) and make a final determination of the amount and type of proposed compensatory mitigation required. Once the amount and type of proposed compensatory wetland mitigation has been agreed upon, a wetland mitigation plan will be developed and submitted as part of the permitting process. Comment 8: The DEIS also does not demonstrate why compensatory mitigation to offset the loss of open water area should not be required. Please continue to coordinate with this office to help develop a comprehensive plan that would adequately compensate for the loss of waters of the United States that area associated with this project. Response 8: Impacts to open waters cannot be mitigated through the creation of open waters within the project study area due to conflicts with the Albany County Airport Authority's Wildlife Hazard Management Plan which recommends consideration of wildlife attractants within 5 miles of the airport if the attractant could cause hazardous wildlife movement into or across the approach or departure airspace. As such, NYSDOT proposes to mitigate open water impacts with creation of shallow emergent marsh wetlands at a 1:1 impact to mitigation ratio. Comment 9: Please also be reminded that we expect the NYSDOT to develop an acceptable plan that provides for the long term protection of the mitigation site(s). The New York District has previously informed the NYSDOT that the use of the ÒCertification StatementÓ as currently written is not legally sufficient. Response 9: NYSDOT will coordinate with ACOE to develop a plan for long-term protection of the proposed wetland mitigation site and resolve issues with the current Certification Statement.August 2014 Final Design Report / Environmental Impact Statement PIN 1721.51 Andrew L. Raddant, Regional Environmental Officer, U.S. Department of the Interior Comment 10: The U.S. Department of the Interior (Department) has reviewed the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Interstate 87, Exit 4 Access Improvements, Albany County, New York. The Department's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service provided comments on the DEIS/Scoping Document in January and are attached here. The Department has no additional comments at this time. Response 10: Comment noted. Comments received from the Department's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (US FWS) have been addressed under the US FWS comments below. David Stilwell, Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Comment 11: We recommend that DOT visit our website at http://www.fws.gov/northeast/nyfo/es/section7.htm and follow the step-by-step instructions to obtain an official species list; information about listed, proposed, and candidate species; and steps to complete initial assessments of whether a species may be present and impacted by the proposed action. This information should be included in the EIS for our review. Response 11: The official species list has been obtained for the project and is included in the Final EIS. The website was consulted prior to development of the DEIS and again prior to issuance of the FEIS. Comment 12: Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires federal agencies, in consultation with the Service, to ensure that any action they authorize, fund, or carry out is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat. A Biological Assessment (BA) of the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts must be prepared for all federal actions that may affect listed species. The Service is available to provide technical assistance in the preparation of the BA. Response 12: As noted in Section 4.4.9 of the DEIS, the proposed project will have "No Effect" on the identified species with the exception of the northern long-eared bat. Anticipated tree removals for the project have been documented in the "batch" project list that will be sent to US FWS for concurrence. In addition, tree clearing activities will only occur between October 31st and April 1st. See Comment 13 for response specific to the Northern Long-Eared Bat. Comment 13: Pursuant to Section 7(a)(4) of the ESA, federal action agencies are required to confer with the Service if their proposed action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the northern long-eared bat (50 CFR 402.10(a)). Response 13: For the purposes of coordinating northern long-eared bat impacts for the project, anticipated potential bat roost tree removals have been documented in the "batch" project list that was sent to US FWS for concurrence. FHWA made a determination of ÒMay Effect, not likely to Adversely EffectÓ on May 9, 2014, and the US FWS concurred with the FHWA determination on May 15, 2014. In addition, tree clearing activities will only occur between October 31st and April 1st. Comment 14: Action agencies may also voluntarily confer with the Service if the proposed action may affect a proposed species. Species proposed for listing are not afforded protection under the ESA; however, as soon as a listing becomes effective, the prohibition against jeopardizing its continued existence and "take" applies regardless of an action's stage of completion. Response 14: Comment noted. Comment 15: Until the proposed project is complete, we recommend that you check our website every 90 days from the date of this letter to ensure that listed species presence/absence information for the proposed project is current. Response 15: NYSDOT has been checking, and will continue to check, the US FWS website periodically to ensure the listed species presence/absence information for the proposed project is current. Comment 16: As you are aware, bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) were federally-delisted in 2007, but remain protected under the MBTA, the BGEPA, and by the State of New York as a threatened species. The Service recommends that if eagles are found within the project area prior to commencing work, the DOT and FHWA should follow the National Bald Eagle management Guidelines found on our website and contact the Service and NYSDEC to determine if a permit is required.August 2014 Final Design Report / Environmental Impact Statement PIN 1721.51 Response 16: No bald eagles have been observed in the project area to date. If they are observed during design or construction, NYSDOT will contact the appropriate agencies to determine if a permit is required. Sukhbir Gill, Environmental Specialist, Federal Aviation Administration Comment 17: The FAA should be listed as a Cooperating Agency on this EIS since the FAA has a Federal Action of releasing land for the connector road and flyover ramp; it is not explicitly stated as such anywhere in the document. The FAA must approve a change to Albany International AirportÕs (ALB) Airport Layout Plan (ALP) to depict the land release associated with the preferred alternative as it falls, in part, within the airport property line on land owned by Albany County Airport Authority (ACAA). Response 17: The FAA's NEPA agency status has been revised to cooperating agency since the project will potentially involve construction within the Navigable Airspace. The FEIS and SAFETEA-LU Coordination Plan have been updated to reflect the change in the FAA's NEPA agency status. Comment 18: The proposed alternative descriptions in Chapter 3 need to be revised to include a brief discussion of our AgencyÕs actions for each alternative. Response 18: A discussion of FAA actions has been added to Section 3.3.2.4. Comment 19: DEIS Section 3.3.2.4 Ð Airports, Railroad Stations, and Ports: There is no mention of the amount of land that will be acquired from ACAA for the connector road/flyover ramps. This pertinent information needs to be incorporated in this section, along with a drawing depicting the proposed project. Response 19: The amount of land required and the current land owner for the Diamond and Flyover Alternatives is included in Section 3.2.1 of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. This information is also shown graphically on Exhibits 4.2.1 i and 4.2.1 j. Comment 20: DEIS Section 3.3.2.4 Ð Airports, Railroad Stations, and Ports (p. 3-49): The first paragraph states that "Potential conflict between construction equipment, e.g. a tall crane that will erect bridge girders, and the flight paths of aircraft using the Albany International Airport have been considered and no conflicts are expected." The proximity of the construction to the Runway 1 threshold and extended centerline raise concerns over possible impacts to Runway 1 approaches and Runway 19 departures. Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 77, Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace, requires each person proposing any kind of construction or alteration described in FAR Part 77.13 (a) to give adequate Notice to the Administrator. It specifies the locations and dimensions for which Notice is required and prescribes the form and manner of the Notice. Go to www.oeaaa.faa.gov for instructions on how to file the required Notice electronically. Response 20: Reference to the anticipated requirement to provide adequate Notice to the Administrator prior to any project construction (FAA forms 7460-1 and 7460-2) has been added to Section 3.3.2.4. The need to complete these forms will be assessed during final design. Comment 21: The analyses requested in comments from 2011, along with information regarding construction phasing and duration from the overall construction schedule, will help determine if there are any temporary impacts to operations that will require operational or procedural changes to ALB. These additional changes, based on their duration, could result in additional connected Federal Actions on behalf of the FAA and could drive additional environmental impacts that would need to be disclosed in the EIS. Response 21: Comments received in 2011 regarding impacts to the Runway Protection Zone (RPZ) have been addressed and the need to complete FAA forms 7460-1 and 7460-2 will be assessed during final design. No temporary or permanent impacts to operations that will require operational or procedural changes at Albany International Airport are anticipated as a result of the proposed project. Comment 22: DEIS Section 4.1.2 Ð Coordination with Agencies (p. 4-1): FAA should be listed as a Cooperating agency and not participating. Response 22: The FAA's NEPA agency status has been revised to cooperating agency since the project will potentially involve construction within the Navigable Airspace. The FEIS and SAFETEA-LU Coordination Plan have been updated to reflect the change in the FAA's NEPA agency status. Comment 23: DEIS Section 4.4.1 Ð Wetlands (p. 4-13): Based on the review of this section, FAA is concerned with the location that has been chosen to mitigate impacts to wetlands for the proposed project. FAA Advisory CircularAugust 2014 Final Design Report / Environmental Impact Statement PIN 1721.51 (AC) 150/5200-33B, Hazardous Wildlife Attractants on or near Airports, August 28, 2007, provides guidance on certain land uses that have the potential to attract hazardous wildlife on or near public-use airports. FAA program offices and airport sponsors are strongly encouraged not to create wetland sites located within 10,000 feet of a runway that serves turbine-powered aircraft. Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 139 (14 CFR 139), Section 139.337 requires certificated airports having a wildlife hazard problem to assess wildlife through a Wildlife Hazard Assessment (WHA) and to develop and implement a Wildlife Hazard Management Plan (WHMP) to manage and control wildlife. As per ALBÕs WHMP approved on December 11, 2013, it recommends consideration of wildlife attractants out to 5 statute (statute mile is 5,280 feet) miles of the airport if the attractant could cause hazardous wildlife movement into or across the approach or departure airspace. In accordance with its Airport Certification Manual (ACM) and the requirements of 14 CFR Part 139.337, ALB will take immediate action to alleviate wildlife hazards whenever they are detected. We recommend the ACAA and DOT work together with the AirportÕs Wildlife Biologist, USDA-Wildlife Services, to review the mitigation plan and make sure it follows the recommendations as approved in the WHMP. Response 23: The proposed wetland mitigation does not include the creation of open water. The detailed mitigation plans, developed as part of the permitting process, will be developed with consideration for the airport's concerns for wildlife attractants, and efforts to avoid and/or minimize the proposed wetlands' attractiveness to waterfowl will be made. In addition, NYSDOT will coordinate with the Airport's wildlife biologist during development of the wetland mitigation plan. Nancy Danzig, Director, Planning and Program Development, Federal Transit Administration, Region 2 Comment 24: The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) received a copy of the Draft Design Report / Environmental Impact Statement dated January 2014. I understand that FTA is a participating agency, and as such, received a copy to review. As there is no transit interest in this project, FTA will not be providing comments. Response 24: Comment noted. Nancy Baker, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Comment 25: On the wetland (aerial) map submitted, the "SCE Delineated Wetlands" line does not appear to match the "Mapped NYSDEC Wetlands" line. For instance, the area to the rear of parcels on Watervliet Shaker Road (Panel 4) has a linear wetland that was delineated, connecting the wetlands behind the Desmond Hotel to the wetlands along Watervliet Shaker Road near the Airport. However, this isn't shown within the lines depicting NYS Freshwater Wetlands. There are several areas on the map that show delineated wetlands not within the State regulated Freshwater Wetland area. Response 25: The mapped NYSDEC wetland boundaries were shown similar to the National wetland inventory mapping boundaries, to depict what current mapping indicates. The delineated wetland boundaries reflect what was actually observed and delineated in the field. Comment 26: Since the delineated area and NYS Freshwater Wetland areas do not match, what is being considered "wetland" for purposes of calculating impacts? It would be helpful to have one map that shows delineated (regulated) wetlands with the proposed impacts on an overlay, or imposed on that map. Response 26: Direct and indirect permanent and temporary impacts were calculated based on the delineated boundaries. The plans in Appendix A of the DEIS (and FEIS) show the wetland impacts for the preferred alternative. The 100-foot adjacent area was also applied to the actual boundaries that were delineated. Comment 27: Wetland staff have not received a complete wetland delineation map for approval. Response 27: A figure that clearly depicts the boundaries of wetlands that would be regulated by the NYSDEC, with a corresponding table, and overall project area will be prepared as part of the permit process and submitted for the boundary validation. Elizabeth Novak, Director, Office of Transportation Planning & Environmental Services, New York State Thruway Authority Comment 28: We have reviewed the DEIS and the Authority has no comments at this time. Based on the scope of work, there do not appear to be any impacts or effects to the New York State Thruway System.August 2014 Final Design Report / Environmental Impact Statement PIN 1721.51 Response 28: Comment noted. James Mearkle, Traffic Engineer, Albany County Department of Public Works Comment 29: It hasnÕt been officially approved yet, but we have applied for funding from CDTCÕs Pavement Preservation for Non-State Roads Set-Aside to resurface Albany Shaker Road between Wolf Road and Watervliet Shaker Road in 2015. We are planning on in-place recycling with a thin overlay. Will any construction on CR 151 (Albany-Shaker Road) be included in Phase 1? If so, we will meet your construction limits. If it will be five years from now in phase 2, we may overlay the pavement under the bridges. In either case, some degree of work zone traffic control coordination will be required. Response 29: No pavement reconstruction work on CR 151 (Albany-Shaker Road) is currently included in Phase 1. The proposed reconstruction and widening on Albany-Shaker Road will be completed during Phase 2 of construction. Comment 30: According to ALIS, this area exhibits some of the worst safety performance on our system. Has a safety analysis been performed, using the AASHTO Highway Safety Manual or a similar procedure? The proposed changes to the CR 153 (Old Wolf Road) intersection should help, but the CR 151/SR 910B (Albany-Shaker Road/Wolf Road) intersection gets the brunt of it. Response 30: An accident analysis was performed for the project area, as described in Section 2.3.1.8 and in Appendix F (Traffic Analysis). The accident history investigation was conducted by NYSDOT Region 1 using data from the Accident Location Information System (ALIS) system and using standard NYSDOT procedures for evaluating accident history and safety. The Albany-Shaker Road intersections with Old Wolf Road and Wolf Road both had accident rates that exceeded the statewide averages for similar facilities. The predominant accident type was rear-end accidents, which typically correlates to traffic congestion. The proposed project will reduce the traffic volumes at both of these intersections which will improve operations and safety. There are additional geometric improvements as well which also improve operations and reduce congestion. Comment 31: Will the westbound left turn phasing onto SR 910B (Wolf Road) be protected only? If not, it would be better to remove the negative offset, so drivers will be able to see around the opposing left turn queue. Response 31: The Albany-Shaker Road westbound left-turn onto Old Wolf Road is proposed to maintain the protected/permitted left-turn phasing for the Albany-Shaker Road westbound left-turn movement as it provides better level of service. Signal operations are continuously under review by the Region. The use of a permitted only phase for left turns onto Wolf Road will be evaluated once the project has been constructed. Comment 32: Currently, the right turn from Albany Shaker Road to SR 910B (Wolf Road) is served by a dedicated right turn lane and a through/right lane. You only show the right turn lane. If this will be adequate for the demand, it may resolve some of the confusion and conflicts we hear about between this movement and the opposing left turn. Response 32: It is proposed to maintain the eastbound shared through/right-turn lane in addition to the exclusive right-turn lane. Comment 33: With the relocation of the existing southbound off ramp, we anticipate a significant drop in volumes on CR 153 (Old Wolf Road). According to our counts, the AADT is 15,500 vpd south of the ramp intersection, and 5000 north of it. Will the dual left turn lane still be warranted? This could be an opportunity to offset some of the added impervious area. Response 33: Removal of the existing dual left-turn lane and resulting reduction of the pavement width on the Old Wolf Road approach to Albany-Shaker Road will be evaluated during final design. Comment 34: Will the northbound CDTA bus stop in front of the old EngelÕs Farm stand be relocated? If not, it should have sidewalk access to Wolf Road. Response 34: NYSDOT will coordinate with the Capital District Transportation Authority (CDTA) during final design of Phase 2 to determine the need for relocating, placing new or removing bus stops along Albany- Shaker Road within the project study area. Comment 35: A crosswalk should be provided across the northbound on-ramp, connecting the existing sidewalk in front of the Times Union building to the proposed sidewalk under the bridge. Response 35: A crosswalk has been added to the project across the existing Exit 4 NB entrance ramp.August 2014 Final Design Report / Environmental Impact Statement PIN 1721.51 Comment 36: At the southeast end of the side path, how will conflicts be managed between through bicyclists proceeding from the path to the bike lanes, and motor vehicles turning right onto the new ramp? Will they have separate signal phases? Response 36: A trail head will be located at the end of the multi-use path. Motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists will be required to follow the rules of a traffic signal as they do at any other intersection. Comment 37: From the northwest end of the new side path, there is a half mile gap to the Shaker Path. The easiest remedy is probably a signed bike route along the former Watervliet Shaker Road alignment (Meeting House Road, the path by the Ann Lee Pond, Heritage Lane) and Airline Drive to the south terminus of the trail. Could this be included in the project? Response 37: NYSDOT will coordinate with the Capital District Transportation Committee (CDTC) to develop signage for bicyclists between the Crossings at Colonie and Mohawk-Hudson Bikeway. The need for guide signs within the project limits along the shared-use path and connection along Meeting House Road to the existing Albany-Shaker Road trail system will be evaluated during final design. Comment 38: Where ROW and wetlands allow, can more snow storage be provided between the roadway and sidewalk than the proposed 3 feet buffer? Your HDM section 3.2.11.1 calls for more than that. Response 38: The need to avoid wetland impacts and ROW impacts led to the 3 foot offset. Providing additional width between the roadway and sidewalk will result in greater impacts to these features. Comment 39: For the purposes of Highway Law ¤140(18), will the side path be considered a sidewalk or a multiuse path? Response 39: The proposed pedestrian/bicycle facility along Albany-Shaker Road from the proposed flyover ramp intersection to the airport entrance is proposed to be a multi-use path. Comment 40: There are errors on Exhibits 2.3.2.2, 2.3.2.5a and 4.4.13c in the draft design report: a. The illustrations show multi-use paths along Airline Drive and the east-west segment of Heritage Lane. These are sidewalks. b. The trails within the Ann Lee Preserve are unsurfaced nature paths, not shared use paths. Response 40: Exhibits 2.3.2.2 and 4.4.13 c have been revised to show the existing facilities along Airline Drive and Heritage Lane as sidewalks, and the trails within Ann Lee Pond Nature and Historic Preserve as nature paths. No changes have been made to Exhibit 2.3.2.5 a since it does not denote what type of trail/sidewalk is provided, only that a pedestrian facility is present. Comment 41: Much of the project area drains to the Ann Lee Pond, a NYSDEC Section 303(d) impaired waterbody. As the owners of the Ann Lee Pond Preserve, we are very interested in protecting this resource. Please keep us informed about water quality measures in this watershed. Response 41: As noted in Section 4.4.8 of the DEIS, the proposed project includes construction of stormwater ponds and dry swales to provide water quantity storage and water quality treatment. In addition, runoff resulting from construction activities will be evaluated as part of the State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) permit. Joseph LaCivita, Director, Planning and Economic Development Department, Town of Colonie Comment 42: With the elimination of the parallel access ramp between Exits 5 and 4 southbound, improvements to Old Wolf Road (i.e., center turning lane, bicycle/pedestrian accommodations, additional lanes, shoulders, etc.) will be necessary to accommodate the increase in diverted traffic. As you may be aware, this portion of the NYS Route 155 is in dire need of reconstruction with rutted and failing pavement, lack of shoulders and a cross section that neither supports the volume or speed of traffic that currently uses it. Response 42: CR 155 (Old Wolf Road) is owned and maintained by Albany County. The traffic analyses completed using future no-build and build traffic volumes were developed by Capital District Transportation Committee (CDTC) and do not indicate that any capacity improvements along Old Wolf Road would be necessary as a result of the proposed project. With the elimination of the C-D road between Exit 5 and 4, the proposed project reduces the volumes on Old Wolf Road by 37 to 46% between Terminal Drive and Albany- Shaker Road. Therefore, reconstruction of this roadway is not within the scope of the project.August 2014 Final Design Report / Environmental Impact Statement PIN 1721.51 Comment 43: The construction of the southerly extension of Maxwell Road from Albany-Shaker Road to Marcus Boulevard should be included within the scope of the project and completed prior to I-87 lane closures. The completion of this segment of roadway will provide a north/south parallel route to Wolf Road which is vital to reducing traffic volume on Wolf Road and its intersections, especially during construction. Response 43: The Town of Colonie has indicated that future plans within the town include extension of Maxwell Road from the Maxwell Road roundabout constructed in 2010 to Marcus Boulevard (Wolf Road Service Road) and further extension of the Wolf Road Service Road to Aviation Road. As such, future traffic volumes forecasts modeled by CDTC include construction of the Wolf Road Service Road. However, the Wolf Road Service Road is not a part of the I-87 Exit 4 project. Comment 44: Bicycle and pedestrian usage continues to increase in this vicinity as throughout the Town. The proposed 10 ft. wide shared use path will be a great addition to the east-west bicycle and pedestrian linkages between the existing networks of Wolf Road and the Ann Lee Pond Nature and Historic Preserve. Unfortunately, the proposed westerly terminus is 1,500 ft. short of the most logical terminus point at the intersection of Heritage Lane and Albany-Shaker Road. The extension to this point would tie into the existing bicycle/pedestrian improvements, including multi-use trails, constructed with the Albany-Shaker Road / Watervliet-Shaker Road improvements of 2003-2004. This extension of the westerly terminus point would allow connectivity to the Mohawk- Hudson Bike Trail, the sidewalks along Troy-Schenectady Road as well as the multi-use path along Albany-Shaker and Watervliet-Shaker Roads. Response 44: Extension of the proposed pedestrian/bicycle facilities to Heritage Lane is beyond the scope of the project; however, an on-road route along Meeting House Road will provide a connection to the existing Albany-Shaker Road trail system. The need for guide signs for the shared-use path and connection along Meeting House Road to the existing Albany-Shaker Road trail system will be evaluated during final design. Comment 45: Allow excess right-of-way from abandoned ramps to be available for private development. Response 45: Abandoned right-of-way will be addressed as a part of the NYSDOTÕs surplus property disposal process. Comment 46: Due to the project's close proximity to the Ann Lee Pond and Shaker Creek watershed, we request the design include enhanced phosphorus criteria for the stormwater management in addition to the standard linear stormwater practices typical for roadways. Response 46: The project is not located within a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Watershed. Ann Lee Pond / Stump Pond is listed as a 303(d) waterbody segment with verified impairments that are required to be addressed by a segment / pollutant-specific TMDL. However, this project does not directly discharge into Ann Lee Pond; the nearest discharge point is approximately 0.7 miles from Ann Lee Pond, and therefore, does not require water quality treatment practices to reduce pollutant and phosphorus loadings. Standard practices, as defined by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Standards and Specifications for Erosion and Sediment Control (ÒBlue BookÓ), will be used to meet water quantity volume, water quality volume, and runoff reduction volume requirements for the proposed project. Comment 47: The bridge abutments should have an architectural design element similar to the design used at Exit 6. Response 47: The use of architectural treatments on the I-87 bridge abutments will be explored during final design. Ivan Vamos, New York State Bicycling Coalition / CDTC Bike-Pedestrian Advisory Board Comment 48: The shared use path along the south and southwest side of Albany-Shaker Road is an excellent feature of the project, providing a much needed connection to attractions along the route and to an underutilized trail segment built with an earlier phase of Albany-Shaker Road (CR 151) project to the north and west and the many destinations to the east linking to commercial, cultural and recreational attractions. Response 48: Comment noted. Comment 49: Improvements to the sidewalks along Albany-Shaker Road and Wolf Road and the improved connections between the new shared use path and destinations such as hotels, restaurants, the library, the Crossings Park can greatly improve the attraction of the area for visitors, commuters and others.August 2014 Final Design Report / Environmental Impact Statement PIN 1721.51 Response 49: Comment noted. Comment 50: Intersections such as the ones at Wolf Road and the junction of the flyover ramps and Albany-Shaker Road will require extra attention to safely accommodate heavy use by many modes of travel. We hope that the rideable shoulders on Albany-Shaker Road will also get the improvements (and clear marking) as noted in the project features, since use along this route can be expected to increase. Response 50: Traffic control details to manage conflicts between vehicles and bicyclists at the southern end of the shared-use path will be explored during final design. Comment 51: The people bicycling or walking along the new shared use path who are destined to the airport will use the path until it ends, then cross Albany-Shaker Road at a traffic light and enter the airport complex. Some connections through the parking and to the terminal are probably needed at that location. Response 51: The entrance into Albany International Airport is outside of the project study area and improvements to the pedestrian facilities between Albany-Shaker Road and the airport terminal are outside of the scope of the proposed project. In addition, the parking area at the airport is owned and maintained by Albany County Airport Authority, and as the owner, any projects would need to be progressed by the Authority. Comment 52: The problem will be those bicyclists and pedestrians who arrive at the end of the trail in search of the next trail segment. That little used, but existing trail segment can be accessed via a difficult to find trailhead next to NYS Route 155, and then the trail segment is located parallel to and to the west of new CR 151. Most of the walkers and riders at the ÒendÓ of the new trail to be built with Exit 4, when faced with the dilemma of no shown path to the next trail segment, will proceed north, as counter-flow traffic along the southeast bound limited access four lanes of Albany-Shaker Road until they find an entrance road that may look like it can connect to the existing trail link. This will create a dangerous situation and perhaps a nuisance to some property owners. The obvious solution is to route those wishing to continue along the trails but are not headed to the airport to turn west on Meeting House Road, past the Shaker Historic attractions and probably proceed along Ann Lee Pond Park, Heritage Lane, and perhaps Airline Drive (one block each) to the existing shared use trail and bridge over NYS Route 155. While this is a pleasant ride / walk along low volume roads, the appearance of the route can be confusing and perceived as the entrance to a private farm-like complex (that after all was the historic use of the property). Unless the route is well marked and somewhat improved, bicyclists and pedestrians who are unfamiliar with the connection will avoid it and confront a dangerous alternative a little further north at the end of the new trail. Response 52: The need for guide signs for the shared-use path and connection along Meeting House Road to the existing Albany-Shaker Road trail system will be evaluated during final design. Comment 53: The need is to develop a design and project that will tie these two important trail segments together. The markings and signs should be designed and implemented with Exit 4 and be in keeping with the historic and natural character of the area, while carrying the clear message recommending the safe through-travel route. Your consultant team for the next phase of the Exit 4 project can add at a very small increment to the design costs involved for this task. We hope this small but most important added component of the Exit 4 project can be added to the design and implementation work being undertaken along with the major phases of the interchange and trail projects scheduled for 2019. Response 53: The need for guide signs for the shared-use path and connection along Meeting House Road to the existing Albany-Shaker Road trail system will be evaluated during final design. Tyler Desmond, The Desmond Hotel Comment 54: The project doesnÕt include any consideration for a left turn out of the Desmond. Response 54: The Desmond driveway was analyzed in Synchro for the proposed ETC+20 condition. During the peak hours it is estimated that the westbound left out of and into the driveway will operate at LOS C or better, assuming vehicles will turn to and from the westbound travel lane rather than the hatched median. A sensitivity analysis was also run to determine what percentage the westbound traffic distribution can be increased (to and from the driveway) before degrading to a LOS E. It was determined that the westbound trips out of and into the driveway can be increased by approximately 55% and 45% during the AM and PM peaks, respectively.August 2014 Final Design Report / Environmental Impact Statement PIN 1721.51 Anne Wyre, N and D Restaurants Comment 55: N and D Restaurants, Inc. is the owner of a strip of land that the State of New York will be acquiring for a temporary easement pertaining to the above project. Is it possible that you can give me the name of the restaurant and address of the affected property as that would be most helpful? Response 55: Two restaurants are located on the affected property at 178 Wolf Road, The Olive Garden and Red Lobster. Sheila Duncan, Sunoco Comment 56: I agree with Mr. Eagan from Albany Airport that navigating the area is a concern. Getting people in and out of my store in a timely manner will be helpful if the traffic is under better control. However, you are diverting all traffic off I-87 north up Wolf Rd without an option to go left. So, a median (for NB Wolf Rd traffic heading back onto 87N) to turn into my store that stretches beyond that exit would be imperative to safely allow vehicles to turn into my location to fuel up first. Removing the light at 4N will hopefully allow this. Response 56: The Flyover alternative does not include widening of Wolf Road; however, the existing two-way left turn lane on Wolf Road south of the Exit 4 NB exit ramp and the left-turn lane at the Albany-Shaker Road/Wolf Road intersection will be maintained. Access to businesses at this intersection will be essentially the same as the existing conditions for vehicles traveling to/from I-87 SB and to I-87 NB. Access to businesses at this intersection will improve for vehicles traveling from I-87 NB since they will be able to access these businesses with right in/out movements from both Albany-Shaker Road and Wolf Road. Comment 57: We have out of town travelers who need to know where to fuel up. DOT highway signs are my biggest request. Without them my business will be in great jeopardy. It is an ÒairportÓ store more than anything and the Exit 4N is cutting me off. Response 57: Although service signs were previously allowed at I-87 Exit 4, current policy prohibits the use of specific service signs in urban areas. More information regarding the DepartmentÕs policy on service signs can be found on at https://www.dot.ny.gov/programs/nys-signs. Julie Tidd, Pyramid Brokerage Comment 58: I attended the public forum last night and there were several large aerials on display which I cannot find on the www.dot.ny.gov/i87exit4 web page. I am particularly interested in the one that displayed all the way up to the changes on exit 5. Would you please share where I can locate these pictures. Response 58: Maps and plans showing the Flyover Alternative are available online in Appendix A of the DEIS at https://www.dot.ny.gov/regional-offices/region1/projects/i87exit4/reports-documents. Kerry Bytner, Resident Comment 59: I own a home in the Village of Colonie on a dead end street off Sunset Blvd that backs up to the Northway where N.Y. State replaced the bridge over Sand Creek Road a few years ago. While the bridge replacement was much needed, no one checked after it was completed. Anytime anything larger than a passenger vehicle hits the new span, the noise it makes echoes through our neighborhood. Looking at those concrete spans, I can see the crown in them. I understand the difference in elevation from the median to the outside edge of pavement, but itÕs the difference north to south that I think is making the noise that, at times, is very disturbing to myself and some neighbors I have spoken with. I also believe the noise to be enhanced by the high water table we experience in those months as you can feel it in the ground. I would like to invite you or one of your engineers to visit our neighborhood and see for yourself the distractions which I attribute to the new bridge. I have lived here for 16 yrs. and have never been bothered by the traffic noise such as Jake brakes on large trucks and the occasional group of motorcycles traveling the Northway, but this noise is something I don't believe I will ever get used to. I would appreciate any information you have or any help you can give myself and my neighbors. Response 59: The I-87 bridges over Sand Creek Road are not within the proposed project limits, and existing conditions and noise at this location are not within the scope of the project. However, concerns with noise at this location have been provided to the NYSDOT Bridge Maintenance Engineer.August 2014 Final Design Report / Environmental Impact Statement PIN 1721.51 Lyn Lamanna, Resident Comment 60: I attended the public hearing on the I87 exit 4 project. I am glad the bridges over Albany Shaker Rd are finally being replaced. My concern is that the access roads and traffic congestion issues are not being addressed until 2019. The traffic is going to get worse with the addition of 3 more hotels and Whole Foods Supermarket in the Wolf Road Area. A dedicated ramp from I87 to the airport would help improve the economic development of the area. The Global Foundry expansion being on example of additional airport usage. I understand the funding is not currently available for the redesign of the access roads. Would it be possible to do smaller pieces of the project as money comes available? Extending the Exit 4 on ramp to the Exit 5 off ramp would be an example as the state owns the small portion of the land needed to extend the ramp. This would help ease the congestion at the intersection of Wolf Rd. Albany Shaker Rd and I87 Exit 4. It would help eliminate the backup on I87 at Exit 4 with the traffic having more room to merge. I would like to see Phase II to start sooner than 2019. I know there is support from the Albany International Airport, the Town of Colonie, Albany County, and the surrounding counties that use the airport. I believe that if all the concerned parties worked together they could come up with the funding needed. We got 8 counties. the Town of Colonie, the City of Albany, the Airport Authority, the state and the federal governments, 35 million is not a lot when it is divided among all the interested parties after all the cost is only going to increase the longer it takes. Assemblymen Phil Steck and Senator Neil Breslin are in the best positions to work with all the interested parties to develop a funding plan. I know compared to other urban congestion areas in the state the I87 exit 4 issues are not as severe. This is the Capital District. We need to make a good impression on people flying in to the capital of New York. The airport needs a direct access ramp from the interstate. It has been talked about for years and it is time to get it done and stop being a joke of the region to groups flying in to perform at SPAC, The Times Union Center, Proctors, Palace, and the new Convention center. Response 60: NYSDOT is open to moving the Phase 2 construction forward sooner if project funding becomes available. Michele Polito, Resident Comment 61: Adding the new Exit 4 on the Northway will increase traffic congestion. The northbound Wolf Road traffic going south on the Northway will still have the two lights to go through at the Albany-Shaker Road intersection. The eastbound traffic on Albany-Shaker Road going north on the Northway will still have the same route plus one more traffic signal. But by moving the north and south lanes of I-87 closer together and as far west as possible, there should be enough room for the I-87 northbound Exit 4 to still empty onto Wolf Road. The attached sketch is one suggestion that could solve the congestion at the I-87 Albany-Shaker Road intersection. Response 61: Over 50 alternatives were developed during the project scoping process. The alternatives evaluated in the DEIS and the preferred alternative were selected based on their ability to meet the project objectives, minimize environmental impacts, and minimize project costs. The traffic analyses contained in Section 3.3.1.7 of the DEIS show that the preferred alternative provides considerable improvements in traffic operations compared to existing conditions. Steve Kohn, Resident Comment 62: When Part II happens, will a roundabout be used at the new intersection on Albany Shaker Road, to be located 1,000 feet west of where Albany-Shaker Road and Old Wolf Road now meet? Response 62: The feasibility of a roundabout at the Albany-Shaker Road & new Exit 4 ramps intersection was evaluated and determined to be infeasible due to high traffic volumes at conflict points in the roundabout. As a result, a roundabout is not proposed at this location.August 2014 Final Design Report / Environmental Impact Statement PIN 1721.51 Ted Thompson, Resident Comment 63: Once the access roads and ramps between Exit 5SB and Exit 4SB have been eliminated, try to return as much of this land as possible to taxable status, i.e. private property. Response 63: Abandoned right-of-way will be addressed as a part of the NYSDOTÕs surplus property disposal process. Comment 64: Try to use roundabouts at as many intersections as possible. Response 64: The feasibility of roundabouts at proposed intersections within the project limits was evaluated. The results of these analyses indicated that roundabouts are not a feasible alternative at any intersections within the project area due to high traffic volumes and right-of-way restrictions. Therefore, no roundabouts are currently proposed as part of the project. Comment 65: Push forward as fast as possible on Phase 2. Since our current Gov. has shown an apparent lack of concern for upstate, urge you to seek as much Federal help as possible from Tonko, Gillibrand, and Schumer. Response 65: NYSDOT is open to moving the Phase 2 construction forward sooner if project funding becomes available. Gerard Houser, Resident Comment 66: Please include me in full support of the proposed road improvements at the Albany International Airport. Response 66: Comment noted. Darlene McGraw, Resident Comment 67: You seem to have sufficient plans for vehicles, what about pedestrians like myself that travel near and under the bridge areas? This area has more pedestrians and bus stops also (accessible, disabled, sidewalks, clear, well lit, slow speed limits, etc.). Response 67: The Flyover alternative includes construction of 5 ft. bike lanes and 5 ft. sidewalks along both sides on Albany-Shaker Road between Wolf Road and the flyover ramps, which includes the area under the I-87 bridges.From: Knutson, Lingard [mailto:Knutson.Lingard@epa.gov] Sent: Monday, July 28, 2014 9:04 AM To: Masi, John (DOT) Cc: Robert.Davies@dot.gov; omar.elkassed@dot.gov; Ian.Weibel@dot.gov; Hitt, Dan (DOT); Kligerman, Thomas (DOT); Trichilo, Angelo (DOT); Goetke, Diane S.

Please see our italicized resolution beneath your comment listed below in which you have requested additional information regarding our construction practices within the Sole Source Aquifer (Schenectady-Niskayuna Aquifer System). Comment 2. EPA requires more information concerning ramp/bridge supports construction and depth prior to completing our review under Section 1424(c). If the pilings penetrate the aquifer, what precautions will be taken during and after construction to insure that the annular space around the supports will not open the aquifer to contamination? Will the annular space be sealed, for example with bentonite or an equivalent sealant? RESPONSE: NYSDOT plans to proceed with this project in two phases. Phase I of this project will be to replace the aging Interstate 87 (I-87) Bridges over Albany-Shaker Road. Phase II of this project will involve access improvements and reconfiguration of the I-87, Exit 4 Interchange which will include the construction of a flyover bridge. Phase I of this project is scheduled for a fall 2014 Letting. Phase II of this project has a projected Letting of the fall of 2019. Our Main Office NYSDOT Ð Geotechnical Engineering Bureau has offered the following response to your comment: ÒThe proposed abutments will be supported on piles that extend to an estimated elevation of 232 feet. We have assumed ground water is at elevation 297 feet.Judy-Ann Mitchell, EPA From: J. Masi, NYSDOT 7/25/2014 Page 2 of 2 The proposed piles are cast in place concrete piles. These are constructed by first driving a closed end steel casing into the ground and then filling it with concrete. The steel casing is completely sealed. Since these are displacement piles, the soil directly around each pile will be densified as the casing is driven into the ground, therefore no annular space will exist. This densification essentially seals the area around each pile. After the piles are completed, a concrete footing will be poured encompassing the entire area around the piles.Ó Phase II of this project does not have this level of detail at the present time due to forecasted date of the proposed letting. Coordination with EPA on the proposed Flyover Bridge will begin as project design and details are developed. We would like to ask that you please respond by letter or email to indicate that your comment(s) on the DEIS have been addressed to your satisfaction. If you have any questions regarding this project, or need additional information, please contact John Masi, Project Manager, by phone at (518) 485-9636 or by email at John.Masi@dot.ny.gov. Thank you in advance for your cooperation and coordination! Sincerely, John Masi Project Manager NYSDOT Region 1 cc: L.

To confirm our discussions, the ACAA appreciates your understanding and assurance that the proposed .15 acre forested wetland and balance of 1.85 acres of emergent/meadow will be designed to assure that no open water or other wildlife attractant will be created and that tree plantings will be willow or similar low-growth tree vegetation which will not impinge the Runway 01 approach surface owned by the Airport Authority to assure ongoing FAR Part 77 conformance. Consequently, the proposed total area of mitigation wetlands comprising approximately two acres on State owned property does not appear to present any potential adverse effect on Airport operations or Airport Wildlife Hazard Mitigation Plan as prepared by USDA ccÕd. Please reply to confirm receipt and adequacy of this concurrence and advise whether I may provide any further information or assistance. Thank you. Best regards, Stephen Iachetta Department of Planning & Engineering 518-242-2238 direct 378-5968 mobile Albany County Airport Authority Administration Building, Suite 205 Albany International Airport Albany, New York 12212-1057 From: Steve Iachetta Sent: Thursday, August 14, 2014 1:51 PM To: Masi, John (DOT) Cc: Preusser, Kenneth J ; 'sukhbir.gill@faa.gov'; John A.

As we discussed, I would recommend that the closure occur after 8 am on a Saturday and reopen late on Sunday. Weekdays and Saturdays between 4:00 am and 8:00 am are our busiest times with the most amount of departing flights leaving in the early morning hours. We would also advise that the closure should not take place during any of the holiday peak periods such as during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday period, nor during Spring break for the area high schools (February) and colleges(March). We also suggest that included on the detour signs that the airport be designated, preferably in words rather than symbols. You may consider adding a couple of variable message boards to help the travelers navigate their way to the airport. We look forward to the improvements afforded with the completion of Phase I of this project. Thank you. John A.

AT welcomed everyone to the meeting and introductions were made. 2. DG stated that one purpose of the meeting will be to separate the ACOEÕs comments into those which pertain to the DEIS and those that are only relevant to the permit. 3. LE presented a map of the Flyover Alternative showing the proposed wetland impact areas and pointed out that the impact quantities have been refined since the DEIS was released to the public to incorporate a shift of the I-87 mainline into the median. Although the current impact quantities are less than those included in the DEIS, the higher impact quantities will be included in the FEIS to present a conservative quantity of wetland impacts. 4. LE stated that temporary wetland impacts have also been quantified in the DEIS assuming 10 feet of temporary impacts beyond the proposed slope limits. 5. CD stated that the impacts quantification looks good, but that she is looking for documentation of avoidance and minimization of wetland impacts. 6. LE stated that the alignment was altered and embankment slopes steepened to avoid and/or minimize impacts and that these measures will be documented as part of the permitting process. 7. CD stated that the avoidance and/or minimization measures should be documented in the EIS. 8. LE stated that stream restoration will be proposed where existing culverts are proposed to be removed along the Exit 5-4 C-D road that is also being removed as part of the project. 9. DG stated that the proposed mitigation package also includes protection/preservation of Shaker Creek at the wetland mitigation site. 10. CD asked if NYSDOT can protect restored open channels by establishing a riparian area around stream banks for long-term protection. DG stated that long-term protection can be discussed during the permitting process. Interstate 87 (I-87) Exit 4 Page 2 April 10, 2014 Access Improvements 11. CD stated that ACOE is open to providing some leeway to resolve issues with the Certification Statement. 12. CD asked how DOT wants to handle the Jurisdictional Determination and field work. DG stated that the immediate need is at the bridge replacement (Phase I) and wetland mitigation site. 13. CD stated that if the DOT can document operational independence, the two construction phases could be permitted separately. CD suggested that DOT review the Nationwide definitions of operational independence required to be documented for permit (separate from the DEIS and FHWAÕs definition of independent utility). 14. TS asked if there is a way to get credit for wetland mitigation for Phase II construction impacts and still construct the wetland mitigation for both phases during Phase I construction. 15. CD stated that itÕs possible, but difficult because the Phase II impacts wouldnÕt be fully evaluated until that construction phase is permitted. DOT would be constructing the mitigation area for Phase II at their own risk that it would be enough. 16. AT stated that Phase II is anticipated to begin construction in 2019, but could be earlier if funding becomes available. 17. AT stated that the DOT will most likely design the entire mitigation site now, but only construct the mitigation area required for Phase I under a Nationwide Permit and apply for an Individual Permit for Phase II later. 18. JM stated that the entire wetland mitigation site will be purchased as part of Phase I, so the protection/preservation benefits would be provided as part of Phase I construction. 19. CD stated that pictures of areas for Phase I will be sufficient and that no site visit will be necessary. 20. BG stated that tree removals for Northern Long Eared Bat impacts from the project were sent to US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) for concurrence. 21. DG stated that the DOT is finalizing the Section 106 process. BD stated that there are no Section 106 issues for Phase I. 22. BD stated that the Record of Decision (ROD) will cover the entire project (not separate for each phase). 23. CD stated that ACOE is more stringent in Albany County regarding open water impacts because it is heavily developed and there is limited open water left. 24. DG asked if ACOE would consider replacement of open water with emergent wetlands since open water is not acceptable given the proximity of the project to the airport. 25. CD stated that since emergent wetlands possess functional value, they could be considered appropriate mitigation for open water impacts. The following discussion was had regarding the comments included in ACOEÕs March 29, 2014 letter. Comment 1. DG stated that field work for the Jurisdictional Determination (JD) can be done this summer and that a preliminary JD will meet the needs of DOT. Comment 2. DG stated that the DOT is okay with separate permits for the two construction phases. It is anticipated that the Phase I mitigation will be completed concurrently with Phase I construction. AT stated that the DOT will need a projection for the right of way since the purchase will not be complete until the end of 2014. Comment 3. DG stated that the mitigation plans will include avoiding damage to existing trees where possible. DG stated that a culvert could be installed to allow access to the mitigation site directly from I-87, and the area of the culvert could be restored after the monitoring period is over. CD stated that the reason for each wetland impacts needs to be documented for the permit. Interstate 87 (I-87) Exit 4 Page 3 April 10, 2014 Access Improvements Comment 4. AT stated that there are no known concerns at the existing culverts. LE stated that although they have a small diameter, many of the culverts are flat and the streams are slow flowing. In addition, the Phase II SPDES practices have been designed to address flows. DG stated that the hydraulics of the culverts would be evaluated for the Phase II permit. Comment 5. DG stated that a site visit will be conducted over the summer. A list of mitigation measures for stream impacts is included in the DEIS, but the actual location of the mitigation measures canÕt be determined specifically yet. TS stated that the legal group is working with ACOE to resolve issues with the Certification Statement without affecting project schedules, but there is an issue because DOT doesnÕt have deeds to properties. Conditional approval can be granted for Phase I. BD stated that once the comments have been addressed and a response returned to ACOE, FHWA will be looking for a response from ACOE stating that all of their concerns with the DEIS have been adequately addressed. Please report any additions or corrections in writing within ten (10) calendar days to the undersigned at CHA. ________________________________ Lisa Westrick, P.E. Project Engineer lmw/LMW c: Attendees D.

Joan McDonald REGIONALDIRECTOR COMMISSIONER Region One Design, POD 2-3 - 50 Wolf Road - Albany, NY 12232 July 25, 2014 Department of the Army US Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: CENAN-OP-RU Upstate Regulatory Field Office 1 Buffington Street, Building 10, 3rd Fl. North Watervliet, New York 12189-4000RE: DEIS Agency Comments from 03/26/2014 PIN 1721.51; I-87, Exit 4 Access Improvements Project Town of Colonie, Albany County Dear Ms. Gitchell, This letter is to address your comment letter of March 26, 2014 referencing our January 2014 Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Interstate 87, Exit 4 Access Improvements Project. Please see our italicized resolutions beneath each comment summary and comment number as indicated in your March 26, 2014 letter. Also, please see the attached meeting minutes of our April 10, 2014 meeting with NYSDOT (Main office and Region One), FHWA, CHA and Christine Delorier (USACE). This meeting was held to discuss the DEIS comments from USACE and to provide information and background to help resolve the outstanding issues. Comments 1. We recommend that we conduct a site inspection of the project area with you this spring to verify the extent of waters of the United States in the project area, and to determine with you whether an approved or preliminary jurisdictional determination is appropriate for this project. RESPONSE: NYSDOT plans to proceed with a preliminary Jurisdictional Determination. A site visit with the USACE will be scheduled during the summer of 2014. (See attached meeting minutes General Discussion Item #12) 2. According to the DEIS, the NYSDOT plans to seek confirmation of Nationwide Permit Number 14 for Phase I of the project, and then seek an individual Department of the Army permit for Phase II of the project. Based upon the information received to date, weAmy L. Gitchel, USACE From: J. Masi, NYSDOT 7/25/2014 Page 2 of 5 cannot concur at this time that separate review of the proposed impacts to waters of the United States for each project phase is appropriate in this case. Should the NYSDOT continue to seek separate authorizations for each phase, we recommend that the NYSDOT submit to this office as soon as possible, justification as to why you believe the reviews should be separated and have independent utility. RESPONSE: As part of the permitting process, NYSDOT will prepare and submit justification that the two construction phases have operational independence. (See attached meeting minutes General Discussion Item #13) In addition, it was indicated to this office that the NYSDOT planned to complete during Phase II of the project, any required compensatory mitigation needed to offset impacts to waters of the United States that would occur during Phase I construction. Given the timeframes between Phase I and II construction, the lack of confirmed funding for Phase II construction, and our regulations at 33 CFR Part 332.3(m), we would not approve this proposal. As stated in 33 CFR Part 332.3(m), implementation of the compensatory mitigation project shall be, to the maximum extent practicable, in advance of or concurrent with the activity causing the authorized impacts. RESPONSE: Mitigation for Phase 1 (replacement of the I-87 bridges over Albany-Shaker Road) wetland impacts will be completed during Phase 1 construction. Mitigation for Phase 2 construction (new interchange ramps) wetland impacts will be completed during Phase 2 construction. (See attached meeting minutes General Discussion Item #14 & 15) 3. While we recognize that the work description and plans contained in the DEIS are not final, we are unsure that all proposed temporary and permanent impacts to aquatic resources have been identified. As we progress in the review of the overall project, please be sure to clearly identify the purpose of each impact to waters of the United States, identify if any proposed temporary impacts would occur within forested wetlands and whether they would be restored to their pre-existing cover type, identify whether any utility line relocation work, noise barrier installation, drainage system cleaning and improvements, or pedestrian and bicycle use facilities would involve additional impacts to waters of the United States, identify and quality any proposed temporary impacts to streams or other open water areas (i.e. ponds), identify the duration of temporary impacts to aquatic resources and how these aquatic resources would be restored, and identify any measures that are proposed to be taken to prevent the spread of invasive species in the project vicinity. RESPONSE: We have reviewed all permanent and temporary impacts to be sure that all impacts have been identified and accounted for. We can offer the following in response: a. The purpose of each impact will be documented during the permitting process. b. Temporary impacts are identified in Section 4.4.1 of the EIS. Temporary impacts by plant community classification and the type of restoration proposed for each impact will be documented during the permitting process. c. Wetland impacts for all proposed project work, including utility relocations, noise barrier installation, drainage, and pedestrian facilities have been accounted for in Section 4.4.1 of the EIS. d. Temporary impacts to streams or other open water areas are identified in Section 4.4.2 of the EIS and will be refined and documented during the permitting process.Amy L. Gitchel, USACE From: J. Masi, NYSDOT 7/25/2014 Page 3 of 5 e. The duration and restoration of temporary impacts to aquatic resources will be documented as part of the permitting process. f. Proposed invasive species management is discussed in Section 4.4.9 of the EIS and will be refined for each phase of the project and documented during the permitting process. We also recommend that you keep detailed records of all efforts taken to avoid and minimize impacts to waters of the United States to the maximum extent practicable and then provide this record to us to help determine whether the proposed activities meet our Clean Water Act 404(b)(1) Guidelines. RESPONSE: A summary of the efforts made to avoid and/or minimize impacts to waters of the United States has been prepared and will be documented as part of the permitting process. (See attached meeting minutes General Discussion Item #6 & 7) 4. The project involves the extension of existing culverts, some of which convey streams that have been identified as either perennial or relatively permanent waters. The existing culverts are noted as being reinforced concrete pipes between 24Ó and 30Ó in diameter. The sizes of these culverts seem inadequate to effectively manage water flows and their extension could exacerbate existing conditions. Please be sure to address this issue when seeking approval from this office for their extension. The site inspection recommended above should include visits to streams where culvert extensions or any new culverts are proposed. RESPONSE: Several tributaries flow through the project area. Each of these channels is currently conveyed under the highway in small diameter (24-36 inch) culvert pipes and these culverts are relatively flat and slow flowing. As stated in DEIS Section 4.4.5 - Floodplains, there is no documented history of flooding at any of these crossings. It is anticipated that the existing culverts have sufficient capacity and that the proposed culverts associated with each alternative will be sized accordingly. In addition, the hydraulics of the existing and proposed culverts will be evaluated as part of the Phase 2 permitting process. 5. Although this office has agreed that the NYSDOT should pursue compensatory wetland mitigation at Wetland Mitigation Area 13 (as identified in the DEIS), we cannot concur with the amount and type of proposed compensatory mitigation at this time, and whether all types of mitigation needed for this project can be accomplished at this site. As noted above, we are unsure that all impacts that could require compensatory mitigation have been identified. Additional mitigation may be required for the permanent or long term conversion of forested wetlands into other covers types needed for temporary impacts or other long term temporary impacts. Specific types and amounts of mitigation needed to compensate for the difficult to replace stream impacts need to be identified. RESPONSE: A site visit with the ACOE will be conducted during the summer of 2014 in order to complete the Jurisdictional Determination (JD) and make a final determination of the amount and type of proposed compensatory mitigation required. Once the amount and type of proposed compensatory wetland mitigation has been agreed upon, a wetland mitigation plan will be developed and submitted as part of the permitting process.Amy L. Gitchel, USACE From: J. Masi, NYSDOT 7/25/2014 Page 4 of 5 Although the final determination of wetland impacts and required mitigation will not be made until the site visit with ACOE, our analysis of the proposed mitigation site shows that it can accommodate the required mitigation. After a more thorough investigation of methods to minimize wetland impacts, we have reduced the total area of impact to 1.72 acres. The impacts consist of 0.10 acres of forested wetland and 1.62 acres of emergent and wet meadow wetland. The proposed mitigation site can accommodate 1.79 acres of created wetland. This area represents the actual created wetland area with additional area for grading and creation of a berm as a buffer between the created wetland area and the remaining residential property to the east. In addition to the created wetland, the proposed mitigation site will include preservation of several acres of wetland and some stream restoration in Shaker Creek within the parcel. Stream impacts will be mitigated via restoration of streams in the area occupied by the existing ramps and collector-distributor (CD) road that comprise the Exit 4 southbound exit ramp and Exit 5 southbound entrance ramp. Several streams in this area were placed in culverts when the ramps and CD road were built. Since these roadways will be removed during construction Phase II (which is when the stream impacts will occur), the existing culverts can be removed, and the streams can be restored. The project will impact 474 linear feet of stream. Over 500 feet of stream is available for restoration in the area of the CD road through removal of the existing culverts and restoration of the stream channels. The DEIS also does not demonstrate why compensatory mitigation to offset the loss of open water area should not be required. Please continue to coordinate with this office to help develop a comprehensive plan that would adequately compensate for the loss of waters of the United States that area associated with this project. RESPONSE: Impacts to open waters cannot be mitigated through the creation of open waters within the project study area due to conflicts with the Albany County Airport Authority's Wildlife Hazard Management Plan which recommends consideration of wildlife attractants out to 5 miles of the airport if the attractant could cause hazardous wildlife movement into or across the approach or departure airspace. As such, NYSDOT proposes to mitigation open water impacts with creation of shallow emergent marsh wetlands at a 1:1 impact to mitigation ratio. (See attached meeting minutes General Discussion Item #23 to 25) Please also be reminded that we expect the NYSDOT to develop an acceptable plan that provides for the long term protection of the mitigation site(s). The New York District has previously informed the NYSDOT that the use of the ÒCertification StatementÓ as currently written is not legally sufficient. RESPONSE: NYSDOT is coordinating with USACE to develop a plan for long-term protection of the proposed wetland mitigation site and resolve issues with the current Certification Statement. This project intends to follow any interim guidance that is reached from said coordination.Amy L. Gitchel, USACE From: J.
