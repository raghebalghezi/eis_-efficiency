Draft Environmental Impact Statement
U.S. Department of State
January 2014
Washington, D.C.
DOS-DC-EIS-14-01-D
The U.S. Department of State (DOS) proposes to develop a Foreign Missions Center (FMC) on the northwest
portion of the former Walter Reed Army Medical Center on 16th Street in Northwest Washington, DC. DOS
is seeking to obtain approximately 43.5 acres from the Army to redevelop the site for the construction of new
chancery buildings by foreign governments. DOS is able to acquire land under the Foreign Missions Act of
1982 (U.S.C. 4301-4316), which facilitates the conduct of diplomacy and consular operations between the
United States and foreign governments.
This Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was prepared in accordance with the National Environmental
Policy Act 42 U.S.C. 4321-4347 and examines the potential environmental impacts of a “no-action” alternative
and six alternatives to develop the FMC. The purpose of this EIS is to provide DOS, other agencies, and the
public with a full accounting of the potential environmental impacts prior to decision-making. It serves as
the primary document to facilitate review of the proposed action by federal, District of Columbia, and local
agencies, and the public.
After careful consideration of a range of reasonable alternatives DOS has identified an action alternative
that it believes would best satisfy the purpose and needs of the study, would fulfill its statutory mission and
responsibilities, and has the least adverse environmental impact.
Comments on this Draft EIS are due by March 31, 2014 and should be sent to the address below.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Department of State (DOS) is the federal executive agency responsible for the international
relations of the United States. DOS has a number of domestic and international responsibilities
associated with the establishment and operation of foreign missions in the United States. DOS is
responsible for assisting foreign missions with identifying properties on which they may locate
and operate chanceries in the United States.
The availability of adequate space for the construction and operation of chanceries by foreign
missions has been a long-standing challenge in Washington, DC. In anticipation of needing
to develop another site similar to the International Chancery Center (ICC), DOS undertook a
multiyear evaluation of available land parcels within Washington, DC and concluded that the
former Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) site was best suited to support the Foreign
Missions Center (FMC) concept.

PROJECT OVERVIEW—for additional information, see DEIS section 1.1
Proposed Action—for additional information, see DEIS section 1.2

The proposed action is to prepare a Master Plan for the long-term development of a FMC on
approximately 43.5 acres of the former WRAMC site at 16th Street, between Aspen Street and
Alaska Avenue in Washington, DC (exhibit S.1). The proposed action consists of assignment of
federal land to foreign governments for the purpose of constructing and operating new chancery
facilities. DOS would manage the FMC, including maintaining common areas. In support of
the Master Plan, design guidelines are being developed to assist foreign missions with the
development of lots. Each foreign mission design would be subject to the local jurisdictional
approval process for the design and construction of its facilities.
The proposed FMC was conceptually planned to complement the campus character and be
consistent with current and future adjacent land uses by:
1. Designing each lot access point to be placed on internal roadways of the campus;
2. Allowing public access to the public areas within the site;
3. Developing a reuse program for one historic building including the potential for reuse of
other historic buildings;
4. Maintaining a 30-foot setback between the southern boundary of the site and historic Main
Drive;
5. Emphasizing vehicular and pedestrian connections between the DOS portion and the adjacent
land uses;
6. Maintaining a 50-foot vegetated buffer on the west boundary of the site; and
7. Preserving the tree canopy to the maximum extent possible.

Although the potential exists for 24 individual lots, DOS anticipates 10 to 15 chanceries to be
established at the FMC, as countries would have the option to combine multiple lots if desired.
The lots would range in size. The lots south of Dahlia Street are envisioned to be larger with the
expectation that foreign missions assigned to that area may construct several buildings, creating
a compound. The lots north of Dahlia Street are envisioned to be closer together, creating a
more urban-like density. Each foreign mission would be responsible for meeting all parking
needs (employee and visitor) on its individual lot. Street parking on the internal FMC roadways
will not be permitted. Specific lot development restrictions (such as minimal building setbacks,
building lot coverage, maximum building height, and floor to area ratio) would be dependent
upon the lot’s location.
Foreign missions would fully fund DOS’s upfront infrastructure development costs through the
revenue generated by the assignment of the lots. Cost effectiveness measures for the FMC include
maximizing the number of lots available for assignment, re-using existing roadway locations,
and minimizing maintenance-intensive public features. To allow for cost-neutral funding, the
proposed action envisions implementation in phases over approximately 20 years; funds from
one phase would help finance the development costs for the next phase. The phased approach
would optimize lot size and site design flexibility.

Purpose—for additional information, see DEIS section 1.3
The purpose of the proposed action is to prepare a master plan for the long-term development
of a Foreign Missions Center, under authorities of the Foreign Missions Act of 1982, on the site
of the former WRAMC in the District of Columbia. The master plan is intended to guide the
development of a cohesive campus by establishing design and land-use planning principles for
the construction of new buildings, roadways, open green space, and utilities, while minimizing
environmental impacts.

Need—for additional information, see DEIS section 1.3
The need for the proposed action is based on increased and high demand for foreign mission
facilities in the District of Columbia, a lack of large sites for foreign mission development or
redevelopment in the District, and the need for land to use in property exchanges with other
countries. This scarcity has impacted DOS’s ability to acquire properties in foreign capitals.
DOS has an urgent need to meet the demand from foreign missions for modern and secure
facilities within the nation’s capital. The collapse in the 1990s of both the Soviet Union and
Yugoslavia resulted in the creation of 21 new countries. Further, the rapid growth and prominence
of countries such as Brazil, China, India, and Vietnam has had a significant impact on the
diplomatic presence of such governments, as well as on DOS’s reciprocal presence and operations
in those countries.
In accordance with the Foreign Missions Act, DOS enters into property exchange agreements
with other countries, whereby property is provided to foreign governments for the establishment

Page iii

Environmental Impact Statement

of missions in exchange for DOS receiving similar property within their countries. However,
the lack of suitable land for development or redevelopment and a full ICC have inhibited DOS’s
ability to reciprocate.
DOS has a need to resolve stalled attempts to acquire property in certain countries to construct
adequate and secure facilities for the conduct of American diplomacy and consular operations.

SCOPING AND EARLY COORDINATION—for additional
information, see DEIS sections 1.7 and 4.1

Scoping letters were mailed in June 2012 to agencies with jurisdiction over features in the study
area or an interest in the study and its results, in accordance with the procedural provisions of
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the DOS’s requirements and policies for early
coordination.
A public scoping meeting was held July 19, 2012, in the District of Columbia. It was an open
house with displays, a presentation, and an area for public comments and questions to be
submitted for consideration in the planning of the proposed action and preparation of the EIS.
During the 30-day scoping period, the key issues of concern identified by the public were the
preservation of trees and open space, traffic impacts, noise impacts, historic preservation and
security.
The master plan study was developed in conjunction with federal and district agencies with
jurisdiction over features or an interest in the study area through a series of meetings.
In compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA),
consulting parties were identified to consult on potential effects to historic resources and measures
to minimize and mitigate them. Consulting parties included the DC-HPO, NCPC, ACHP, The
Committee of 100 on the Federal City, and The Alliance to Preserve the Civil War Defenses of
Washington.

ALTERNATIVES RETAINED FOR FURTHER
CONSIDERATION—for additional information, see DEIS section 2.3
The DOS identified, developed, and analyzed the No Action Alternative and six action alternatives
that could potentially satisfy the proposed action’s purpose and needs. Alternatives were developed
through collaborative planning and design work sessions with other federal and district agencies
with direct or indirect jurisdiction over the proposed action, or an interest or special expertise,
at key milestones to receive feedback and suggestions for improvement.
Components common to the action alternatives consisted of cost-neutral funding, phasing, a
minimum 50-year design life for utilities, on-lot stormwater management, parking considerations,
and street design. Site and individual lot development parameters (size, floor area ratio, building
coverage and height restrictions) developed for each campus zone would not vary between the

Page iv

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

action alternatives. Under the action alternatives, the existing historic perimeter fence would be
retained and the existing landscape on the west boundary enhanced to create a vegetated buffer,
and maximize the tree canopy in this area. Access points for individual lots would be placed
on internal roadways.
During the alternatives development process, six action alternatives were considered and five
were dismissed. One action alternative and the No Action Alternative were retained for further
consideration and more detailed analysis.
DOS identified a Preferred Action Alternative, which it believes would best fulfill its statutory
mission and responsibilities, while giving consideration to economic, environmental, technical
and other factors. In identifying its Preferred Action Alternative, DOS believes it has identified
the environmentally preferable alternative because it best meets the purpose and needs of the
study; causes the least damage to the biological and physical environment; and best protects,
preserves, and enhances the historic, cultural, and natural resources of the study area.

The No Action Alternative—for additional information, see DEIS section 2.3.1
Under the No Action Alternative, DOS would not take ownership of the 43.5 acre portion of
the former WRAMC and would not create a master plan to develop the FMC. DOS would
continue to face challenges in facilitating the provision of adequate and secure facilities for
foreign missions. The lack of readily available parcels within the District of Columbia for
the development of foreign mission facilities would persist, and the high demand for foreign
mission facilities would continue to grow. DOS's inability to reciprocally acquire properties in
other countries would increase, and delays in updating U.S. diplomatic and consular properties
abroad to meet modern security requirements would continue.
The No Action Alternative was retained for detailed study and the consequences of the No Action
Alternative were fully developed for the year 2032 to demonstrate the full impact of taking no
action. This provides a baseline comparison with the action alternatives. The year 2032 represents
the completion of the planned build out of the FMC over a 20-year period beginning with the
initiation of the EIS process in 2012.

Alternative 1: Preferred Action Alternative—for additional information, see
DEIS section 2.3.2

Alternative 1 was identified as the Preferred Action Alternative because it furthers the purpose
of the project and satisfies the needs for the project while best maintaining and enhancing the
existing site character of the former WRAMC; addressing community concerns raised during
scoping; minimizing potential impacts to cultural resources; and maximizing marketability by
allowing the greatest flexibility in developing the site (exhibit S.2).
The Preferred Action Alternative would provide up to 24 lots for chancery development. In the
northwest quadrant, historic Building 57/Memorial Chapel would be retained for adaptive reuse.

Green space would surround the chapel and existing trees of good condition in the quadrant
would remain undisturbed.
On the eastern portion of the site, historic Building 52/Medical Warehouse and Clinic, historic
Building 40/Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and historic Building 41/Old Red Cross
Building could remain for potential adaptive reuse, depending on marketability. The location of
13th Place would either remain the same, or be moved slightly to the east to align with Building
41, which would require the provision of a new entry in the existing perimeter fence. These
variations for 13th Place provide flexibility to adjust parcel sizes to support the marketability
and programmatic requirements of interested foreign missions.
Under the Preferred Action Alternative, Dahlia Street and 14th Street would be developed as
boulevards supporting pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular traffic connections to the surrounding
neighborhoods. In the southwest quadrant, the boulevard landscaping bordering 14th Street
would be widened to create green space, replacing the existing parking lot. This low-lying
green space would assist with the filtration of rain water runoff from the FMC and support DC
stormwater management practices.

AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT AND IMPACTS TO THE
NATURAL AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT—for additional
information, see DEIS section 3.0

DOS developed a study area of approximately 350 acres for the consideration of potential
impacts to the social and economic environments in the area; a smaller area was used for the
consideration of potential impacts to the natural environment. The study area not only covers

Page ix

Environmental Impact Statement

the land that would be used for the Preferred Action Alternative, but also the area that would
potentially experience direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts from it.

Vegetation—for additional information, see DEIS section 3.3
A detailed tree inventory of the area potentially affected by the Preferred Action Alternative
was performed; approximately 700 trees were identified, and the tree sizes were recorded by
diameter at breast height (dbh) measured 4.5 feet above the ground (exhibit S.4).
The No Action Alternative would not impact vegetation.
The Preferred Action Alternative includes the preservation of a considerable number of Special
Trees providing canopy coverage and a 50-foot wide vegetative buffer along Alaska Avenue
and Fern Street. The Preferred Action Alternative would impact vegetation by removing trees.
The removal of trees in the District of Columbia is regulated by the Urban Forest Preservation
Act of 2002. As a federal agency, DOS is not required to comply with this District of Columbia
regulation; however, it will emphasize retaining the tree canopy in the development of the site.

Traffic and Transportation Facilities—for additional information, see DEIS
section 3.6

The streets in the study area are generally designed as a grid pattern, with a few roads that bisect
the network diagonally. Intersections are at regular intervals and most streets in the study area
provide two-way travel. The street network provides good traffic circulation throughout it,
allowing for multiple routing options for drivers and dispersing vehicles throughout the study
area. The primary streets in the study area are: 13th Street, 14th Street, 16th Street, Alaska
Avenue, Aspen Street, Dahlia Street, Fern Street, Georgia Avenue, and Luzon Avenue.
On-street parking is provided throughout the study area along all streets. Most parking spaces
require residential parking permits, though some spaces are metered or unregulated. Other
on-street parking is generally prohibited during peak periods (typically 7:00 to 9:30 am and
4:00 to 6:30 pm) but unregulated during off-peak periods.
Vehicular access for the Preferred Action Alternative would be provided at four intersections
along the border of the FMC portion and at the Dahlia Street and Main Drive entrances to the
DC-LRA. The driveways would be stop-controlled, with the exception of the one provided along
16th Street. Access points where bus service is anticipated would be designed to Washington
Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority (WMATA) Bus Stop guidelines.
The No Action Alternative would not impact parking.
The Preferred Action Alternative would require that the majority of parking be provided in
below-grade lots. Existing buildings that are reused would be required to develop independent

below-grade parking solutions and new buildings would need to incorporate parking within
their lot in below-grade structures. Under the Preferred Alternative, on-street parking on internal
FMC roadways would not be permitted. Current parking allowances on internal FMC roadways
would be removed upon implementation of the Preferred Action Alternative.
The existing conditions in and around the former WRAMC were characterized to provide a
foundation for assessing the transportation implications of the Preferred Action Alternative. This
was determined by examining the peak traffic hours. The “peak hour” represents the worst-case
scenario, when the system traffic volumes are the highest. The use of a typical weekday morning
and afternoon peak hours ensures that conclusions regarding adverse impacts and their respective
mitigation measures would apply to the vast majority of the time the roads are used in the study
area. Traffic counts were conducted at 13 intersections between the hours of 6:30 and 9:30 a.m.
and between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m. on typical weekdays including normal operations of other
major traffic generators in the study area (traffic counts will be updated in the spring of 2014).
The No Action Alternative includes the traffic generated by other developments near the study
area and inherent growth on the roads. Growth from these two sources was added to the existing
traffic volumes to determine the traffic projections for the future No Action Alternative.
Trip generation for the chanceries was estimated based on existing traffic volumes collected
adjacent to the ICC (exhibit S.5). The Preferred Action Alternative was considered to have an
impact at an intersection if the capacity analyses showed a delay greater than 80 seconds at
an intersection or along an approach with the proposed action where one does not exist in the
future conditions for the No Action Alternative. The Preferred Action Alternative would result
in a delay greater than 80 seconds at the following intersections and approaches adjacent to the
former WRAMC:
◊

16th Street and Alaska Avenue

◊

16th Street and Main Drive (year 2032 Northbound approach, PM peak hour)

◊

16th Street and Aspen Street/Sherrill Drive

◊

Georgia Avenue and Aspen Street (year 2031 Eastbound approach, AM peak hour)

The Preferred Action Alternative would result in a delay greater than 80 seconds at the following
intersections and approaches near the former WRAMC:

Environmental Impact Statement

In each case where the Preferred Action Alternative would result in a delay greater than 80
seconds at an intersection and approach, signal retiming or minor changes in a lane approaching
an intersection would improve the traffic flow at the intersection.
Heavy vehicle accessibility to the former WRAMC is intended to occur from Georgia Avenue
and 16th Street. Given these access points, each of the driveways along Georgia Avenue and
16th Street would be required to be designed to meet DDOT acceptable standards for heavy
vehicle accessibility including providing adequate turning radii, limiting visual impediments,
and ensuring traffic does not oppose vehicles entering and exiting the former WRAMC. Service
for trash, recycling, and deliveries would occur regularly. Chancery building design would
focus loading/unloading operations away from public streets and major pedestrian access-ways.
The No Action Alternative would not impact transit services.
The Preferred Action Alternative would increase use in both Metrorail and Metrobus. Most
pedestrians accessing the former WRAMC arrive from adjacent residential neighborhoods to the
north and south, bus stops along 16th Street and Georgia Avenue, or from the Takoma Metrorail
Station. Nearly all streets in the study area have sidewalks, planted buffers between sidewalks
and the curb, and on-street parking that provide an additional buffer between pedestrians and
vehicular traffic. Existing deficiencies are along Aspen Street which provides sidewalks only
in sections along the southern portion of the road and Luzon Avenue which does not provide
sidewalks on the eastern side of the road.
The No Action Alternative would not impact pedestrian facilities.
Development on the former WRAMC would result in increased pedestrian traffic. Increased
pedestrian activity along sidewalks and at intersections may warrant upgrades or changes to
existing facilities to mitigate impacts.
The Preferred Action Alternative would provide pedestrian walkways on federal governmentowned streets. DOS would coordinate with DDOT to support the provision of pedestrian
facilities at access points, including crosswalks, curb ramps, and pedestrian signals at signalized
intersections.
The former WRAMC is served by an area with multi-use trails, signed bicycle routes, and local
streets that accommodate cycling. The bicycle network generally provides good conditions for
local trips and there are several routes for trips between the study area and Silver Spring, Takoma
Park, and other destinations in Northwest Washington, DC.
The Preferred Action Alternative would impact bicycle facilities by increasing demand for Capital
Bikeshare docks and facilities in or near the former WRAMC, new cycling routes, extensions
to existing cycling routes, and increased safety and visibility for cyclists.

Noise—for additional information, see DEIS section 3.8
Noise measurements and concurrent traffic counts were conducted throughout the study area
(traffic counts will be updated in the spring of 2014).
The Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) Traffic Noise Model (TNM), Version 2.5, which
predicts noise levels at selected locations based on traffic data, roadway design, topographic
features, and the relationship of the analysis site to nearby roadways, was used to model potential
noise impacts for the No Action and Preferred Alternatives. The percentages of automobiles,
medium trucks, and heavy trucks used in the FHWA’s TNM were developed from review of
traffic classification data obtained during the noise measurement periods corresponding to the
periods of highest noise levels.
Under the No Action and Preferred Action Alternatives, noise levels in the study area are predicted
to remain constant at Activity Category B (residential level) for most sites modeled. Noise levels
are predicted to increase to Activity Category C (institutional level, e.g., schools and recreation
areas) at 14 of the 58 sites modeled. The majority of the impacted receptors are along Georgia
Avenue. These “increase over existing” noise levels were generally the result of normal traffic
growth predicted to occur between 2012 and 2032. Therefore, projected noise impacts do not
differ perceptibly between the No Action and Preferred Action Alternatives.
Based on the amount of direct access along the corridor and limited right of way, constructing
noise barriers is not feasible.

Cultural Resources—for additional information, see DEIS section 3.12
The NHPA established a program to preserve historic properties throughout the country. Section
106 of the NHPA, as amended, requires that federal agencies review undertakings for their
impact on significant historic resources. The term historic includes architectural, archeological,
and landscape resources. A significant historic resource is one that is either listed or determined
eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The NRHP is the federally
maintained list of properties recognized for their significance in American history, architecture,
archaeology, engineering, and culture. The criteria for evaluating the eligibility of properties
for inclusion on the NRHP are established by the Secretary of the Interior.
The NRHP lists individual properties as well as historic districts. When a historic district is
nominated, the submission includes an evaluation of every structure within the district boundary
and identifies each as either a contributing resource to the historic district or a non-contributing
resource. The Section 106 process includes the evaluation of potential adverse effects on all
contributing resources. Within a historic district, some contributing resources may also be
considered individually eligible for listing at either the federal or state level.

Section 106 Process—for additional information, see DEIS section 3.12.1

Prior to the initiation of the current study, the closure of the WRAMC, under the 2005 Base
Realignment and Closure Act (BRAC) process, made that undertaking subject to review under

Page xv

Environmental Impact Statement

Section 106 of the NHPA. The Department of the Army Section 106 process was initiated in
February 2010. An assessment was developed identifying the historic resources within the
WRAMC and consulting parties were identified. This process included a series of public meetings
between March and August 2010.
The outcome of the Army Section 106 process was a Programmatic Agreement (PA) executed between
the Army, the DC-HPO and the ACHP. The PA, signed in January 2013, includes a series of stipulations
that take into account the effects of the Army undertaking on the identified historic properties.

Historic Significance of WRAMC—for additional information, see DEIS section 3.12.2
The former WRAMC has been determined as eligible for listing on the NRHP as a historic
district. The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for the aboveground historic resources is comprised
of the entire WRAMC facility and extends approximately 1,250 feet (four city blocks) to the
north and west. It extends into Rock Creek Park along 16th Street, and is bounded to the north
by Hemlock Street, until its intersection with 13th Street. East of 13th Street it is enclosed by
Fern Street to Georgia Avenue in the east and Aspen Street to the south (exhibits S.6 & S.7).
The WRAMC Historic District is eligible for the NRHP due to its significance in the field of military
medicine and its architecture and design. The Walter Reed General Hospital, one of the oldest
general military hospitals in the country, played a key role in the treatment and rehabilitation of
America’s soldiers in all major U.S. conflicts since World War I. The Army Medical School was
responsible for training Army physicians in military medicine and public health and advancing
military medical care through research. The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) is internationally renowned for its research on pathology and the study of disease.
The period of significance for the historic district has been determined to start in 1909, the
opening date of the Main Hospital Building, and ends in 1956. The end date relates to changes
within the military medical structure that resulted in similar or parallel installations being created
elsewhere in the United States.

Rock Creek Park—for additional information, see DEIS section 3.12.2.2

Rock Creek Park was established in 1890 as one of the first federal parks. The park is combined
with the Potomac Parkway as a single historic district resource, encompassing the rim and gorge
of Rock Creek from the District of Columbia boundary to the Potomac River, including a short
segment along the River. This historic resource, with a period of significance between 1828 and
1951, was listed on the NRHP in 2005.

Effects to Historic Resources—for additional information, see DEIS section 3.12.3

Efforts to avoid and minimize effects to historic resources include reusing Building 57/Memorial
Chapel. DOS would market individually eligible Buildings 40, 41 and 52 for potential reuse on
site as chanceries.
The No Action Alternative would not effect historic resources. Over time, the No Action
Alternative would result in the continued deterioration of historic resources.

and 17. Implementation of the Preferred Action Alternative would result in an adverse effect
to the WRAMC Historic District. The integrity of an historic district is based on the setting,
design and association of the component parts. These are linked to the identifiable boundary,
the arterial system within the campus, and the surviving resources constructed between 1909
and 1956. Removal of the historic buildings located within the boundary of the FMC site would
reduce the visual integrity of the campus setting for the remaining individually eligible buildings.
The Preferred Action Alternative may have an adverse effect on the following individually
eligible resources:
◊

Buildings 40, 41, and 52. The Preferred Action Alternative incorporates the potential
reuse of all or a portion of Buildings 40, 41, and 52. Reuse of these buildings would be
contingent upon identifying a foreign mission interested in the rehabilitation and reuse to
accommodate an acceptable program. If the entire building or a portion of the building is
reused, modifications would be required to the building to comply with code, incorporate
programmatic needs, and provide necessary support spaces. These modifications could
have an adverse effect on character defining features. Removal or replacement of features
could have an adverse effect on the materials and workmanship of the resource.

◊

Building 57 – Memorial Chapel. The Preferred Action Alternative provides for the
reuse of Building 57. The programmatic use of the facility has not been finalized. Prior
to any reuse, modifications would be required to comply with building code, incorporate
programmatic needs and provide necessary support spaces (toilet rooms, kitchenette,
etc.). These modifications could have an adverse effect on character defining features.
Removal or replacement of features could have an adverse effect on the materials and
workmanship of the resource.

◊

Perimeter Fence. The Preferred Action Alternative retains the perimeter fence on 16th Street,
Alaska Avenue and Fern Street within the boundary of the proposed FMC. Existing gates and
gate posts at Main Drive (north side of the gate), Dahlia Street and 14th Street would remain
in the their current locations. The Preferred Action Alternative and one variation would shift
13th Place to the east, affecting the existing gate and fence at Fern Street. The gate and fence
would need to be modified and reconfigured at this location, possibly altering the integrity of
the location, setting and/or design of the fence as it relates to the overall campus plan.

The Preferred Action Alternative would result in adverse effects to the following resources:
◊

Building 54 – AFIP. Implementation of the Preferred Action Alternative would result
in the removal of Building 54, which would eliminate the building’s historic location,
setting, design, materials, workmanship, feeling and association with other historic
district buildings.

Environmental Impact Statement

◊

Building 53 – Post Theater. Implementation of the Preferred Action Alternative would
result in the removal of Building 53, which would eliminate the building’s historic
location, setting, design, materials, workmanship, feeling and association with other
historic district buildings.

Mitigation—for additional information, see DEIS section 3.12

Mitigation strategies would be fully developed and documented through the Section 106 process,
which is planned to result in the execution of a PA. Mitigation strategies for historic buildings
being retained would include:
◊

Detailed listing and documentation of character defining features (exterior and interior)

◊

Design guidelines for acceptable modifications

◊

Design review of all proposed modifications

Mitigation strategies for historic buildings being removed could include documentation of the
building prior to partial or total removal including historic research, drawings and photographs.

Archaeological Resources—for additional information, see DEIS section 3.12.4

The APE for archaeological resources is comprised of the 43.5 acres to be transferred to DOS at the
northwest corner of the WRAMC facility. It is bound to the west by 16th Street, to the northwest
by Alaska Avenue, to the north by Fern Street, to the east by Building 2/Heaton Pavilion and
Building 1/Main Hospital, and to the south by Main Drive. The latter two boundaries (to the east
and south) are within the former WRAMC, the former three boundaries (west to north) mark the
limits of WRAMC.
A Phase 1A archaeological investigation has been initiated. The goal of the Phase IA investigation
is to assess the potential for the property to contain archaeological resources eligible for listing
on the NRHP.
Seven known archaeological sites with prehistoric components are mapped within approximately
2,500 feet of the APE, all within Rock Creek Park. Due to these factors, undisturbed areas should
be considered to have a high probability for prehistoric and later archaeological deposits. The
Phase IA investigation would determine the extent of area with archaeological potential within
the property.
The No Action Alternative would not affect archaeological resources.
The Preferred Action Alternative has the potential to affect archaeological resources present in
areas of ground disturbance. This would include building foundations, buried utilities, and other
infrastructure that is placed within intact sediments. Should archaeological investigations not
be concluded prior to the execution of the PA for the project, stipulations would be included in
that document for the treatment of archaeological resources within the APE.

Economic Analysis—for additional information, see DEIS section 3.10
The Preferred Action Alternative would have a positive economic impact on the regional economy.
Economic impacts of the Preferred Alternative were calculated using the Regional Input-Output
Modeling System (RIMS II), published by the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic
Analysis. Impacts were measured at the regional level, defined as the Washington Primary
Metropolitan Statistical Area (PMSA), which consists of 25 jurisdictions in the Washington, DC
region. The economic change resulting from the Preferred Alternative was measured in number of
jobs created, earnings associated with the employment change, as well as consumer expenditures,
or the spending that would flow through the regional economy per year. The jobs associated
with the construction of the FMC are a one-time impact and do not represent an ongoing change
to regional employment, while the jobs created from chancery operation represent a permanent
impact to the regional economy.
Construction of the FMC under the Preferred Alternative would create an estimated 3,053 temporary
jobs, the equivalent of $131 million in wages paid, and as much as $109 million in consumer
expenditures resulting from the new employment.
Operation of the FMC under the Preferred Action Alternative would generate an estimated 3,410
permanent jobs. It is expected that the overwhelming majority of these jobs (2,524) would be
filled by foreign nationals either relocated from current chancery facilities in Washington, D.C.
or not previously residing in the country. The remainder would be indirect employment (886).
Indirect employment refers to the number of employees who are not employed by the foreign
missions, but are jobs created or supported as a result of increased demand for goods and services
as a result of the FMC’s economic impact. This employment would result in an estimated $206
million in earnings and as much as $172 million in consumer expenditures within the region.

Security—for additional information, see DEIS section 2.1
The FMC would be an open site with no restrictions to vehicular, bicycle or pedestrian traffic
within the public areas. Each foreign mission may have a security fence enclosing its lot. The
existing historic perimeter fence will remain, unless 13th Place is moved. If 13th Place is moved,
the historic fence would be moved to compensate for, and fill, the hole that may be created.

AREAS OF CONTROVERSY—for additional information, see DEIS sections
1.7 and 4.1

Substantial public interest in the proposed action exists; however, no areas of controversy have
been identified. Key issues of concern identified during the scoping process were incorporated
into the development of alternatives and the evaluation criteria used to select the Preferred
Action Alternative.

ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED—for additional information, see DEIS section 3.12
One issue would be resolved after the circulation of the DEIS: the completion of the process for
complying with the NHPA Section 106. The DOS formally initiated the Section 106 process for
the proposed action and identified consulting parties in a June 2012 letter to the ACHP. DOS
has met with representatives of ACHP and DC-HPO to review the intent of the proposed action
as it relates to the form of agreement that would be developed to memorialize any stipulations
for historic resources on the FMC site. Since the end product of the proposed action would
be a Master Plan that would be used for FMC development, the parties agreed that the most
appropriate form of agreement would be a PA. A kick-off meeting to discuss the process and
possible content for a PA was held in January 2013. Should archaeological investigations not
be concluded prior to the execution of a PA, stipulations could be included in that document for
the treatment of any archaeological resources within the APE.

GLOSSARY
Affected Environment – The physical features and land area(s) to be influenced or impacted by a
proposed action under consideration. This term can also refer to various social and environmental
factors and conditions pertinent to an area.
Agency Coordination – A general term referring to the process whereby government agencies
are afforded an opportunity to review and comment on a proposed action.
Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) – The total yearly volume in both directions of travel
divided by the number of days in the year.
Archaeological Sites – Places in which past peoples left physical evidence of their occupation.
Archaeological sites may include ruins and foundations of historic-era buildings and structures, or
surface ruins and/or underground deposits of Native American occupation debris such as artifacts,
food remains (shells and bones), and former dwelling structures. Important archaeological sites
can qualify as “historic properties.”
Attainment Area – A geographic area in which levels of a criteria air pollutant meet the
health-based primary standard (i.e., National Ambient Air Quality Standard) for the pollutant.
Attainment areas are defined using federal pollutant limits set by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.
Average Daily Traffic (ADT) – The total volume of vehicle travel during a given time period
(in whole days), greater than one day and less than one year, divided by the number of days in
that time period.
Best Management Practices (BMPs) – Techniques and measures employed during and after
construction to treat surface runoff and protect receiving water quality.
Chancery – The principal offices and annexes (including ancillary offices and support facilities)
of a foreign mission used for diplomatic or related purposes; includes the site and any buildings
on the site which are used for such purposes.
Comment Period – The duration of time during which written comments or responses may
be submitted to an agency that has distributed a document for review and comment. It can be
applicable to all types of documents that are circulated as well as to formal presentations, such
as those that may be given by officials at a public hearing.
Conceptual Mitigation – The early, generalized identification of design, operational, construction,
or other measures considered to avoid, minimize, or compensate for anticipated environmental
consequences. Typically, conceptual mitigation represents ideas discussed before the concluding
stages of an environmental study.

Environmental Impact Statement

Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations – Directives issued by the Federal
Council on Environmental Quality, published in 40 CFR 1500-1508, which governs the
implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the development and
issuance of environmental policy and procedure for federal actions by public agencies. The
regulations contain definitions, spell out applicability and responsibilities, and mandate certain
processes and procedures for state agencies with programs that use federal aid funds.
Criteria Pollutants – Six pollutants for which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has
established national ambient air quality standards to protect human health, as required by the
1970 amendments to the Clean Air Act. These pollutants include ozone, carbon monoxide, total
suspended particulates, sulfur dioxide, lead, and nitrogen oxide.
Cultural Resources – Historic properties, archaeological sites, Native American cultural
resources, cultural institutions, ways of life, culturally valued viewsheds, places of cultural
association, and other valued places and social institutions.
Cumulative Impacts – Impacts on the environment that result from the incremental impact of
a project when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless
of which agency or person undertakes other such actions.
Daily Traffic Volume – The number of vehicles that use a given roadway in both directions
during a 24-hour period.
dB – Decibel, a unit of measurement of sound level which expresses relative difference in power
or intensity, usually between two acoustic or electric signals, equal to 10 times the common
logarithm of the ratio of the two levels.
dBA – An abbreviation for A-weighted decibel. A decibel is a unit used to describe sound-pressure
levels on a logarithmic scale. For a community noise-impact assessment, an A-weighted frequency
filter is used to approximate the way humans hear sound.
Deciduous – Refers to woody vegetation, such as oak or maple trees, that shed their leaves after
the growing season.
Direct Impacts – The immediate effects on the social, economic, and physical environment
caused by the construction and operation of a proposed action. These impacts are usually
experienced within the immediate vicinity of the proposed action.
Disadvantaged Population – A group of people, living in one area, that has a median income
below the federal poverty level or that exhibits other indicators of economic disadvantage.
Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) – The document prepared by a federal agency
in accordance with National Environmental Policy Act regulations (22 CFR Part 161). These
regulations require that the DEIS evaluate all reasonable alternatives considered; discuss the

Page xxxii

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

reasons that alternatives have been eliminated from detailed study; and summarize the studies,
reviews, consultations, and coordination required by environmental laws and Executive Orders.
Endangered Species – According to the Federal Endangered Species Act of 1973, endangered
species are any species in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its
natural range or territory.
Environment – The complex of social, natural, and cultural conditions that are present in the
physical surroundings.
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) – A document prepared by a Federal agency when
undertaking a “major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”
An EIS is to serve as an action-forcing device to insure that the policies and goals defined in
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) are infused into the ongoing programs and
actions of the Federal Government. Agencies shall focus on significant environmental issues
and alternatives and shall reduce paperwork and the accumulation of extraneous background
data, per 40 CFR Section 1502.1.
Environmental Feature – A general term to denote resources or objects. Features may include
natural or physical resources, important structures, community facilities, topographic features,
and certain other land uses.
Environmental Justice – The fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless
of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development and implementation
of federal actions in accordance with applicable environmental laws, regulations, and policies.
Fair treatment means that no group of people, including racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic group
should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences resulting from
industrial, municipal, and commercial operations or the execution of federal, state, local, and
tribal programs and policies.
Federal Register – A daily publication of the U.S. Government Printing Office that contains
notices, announcements, rulemaking, and other official pronouncements of the administrative
agencies of the U.S. Government. Various announcements and findings related to specific
environmental matters and proposed actions and activities appear in this publication.
Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) – The document prepared after circulation
of a DEIS (or Supplemental DEIS) and consideration of comments received. The National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations (22 CFR Part 161) requires that the FEIS identify
a preferred alternative, evaluate all reasonable alternatives considered, discuss and respond to
substantive comments on the DEIS, summarize public involvement, and describe the mitigation
measures that will be incorporated into the proposed action.
Floodplain – The level area adjoining a river channel that is inundated during periods of high
water flow.

of the United States or which engages in some aspect of the conduct of international affairs of
such territory or political entity, including any real property of such a mission and including the
personnel of such a mission.
Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) – A gas that absorbs infrared radiation in the atmosphere. Greenhouse
gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride.
Hazardous Substance – Byproducts of society that can pose a substantial or potential hazard to
human health or the environment when improperly managed. A hazardous substance possesses

special lists prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency available in the Code of
Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 261.
Historic Properties – Places that are eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places, or local landmarks. These properties can include districts, sites, buildings, structures,
objects, and landscapes significant in American history, prehistory, architecture, archaeology,
engineering, and culture. Historic properties can also include traditional cultural properties.
Hourly Traffic Volume – The number of vehicles that use a given road during a 1-hour period.
Indirect Effects (or secondary impacts) – Effects caused by a given action occurring later in
time or farther removed in distance but that are reasonably foreseeable (e.g., induced changes
to land-use patterns, population density, and growth rate).
Lead Agency – The federal project proponent with primary responsibility for preparing an
environmental document.
Level of Detail – A general term referring to the amount of data collected and the scale, scope,
extent, and degree to which item-by-item particulars and refinements of specific points are
necessary or desirable in carrying out a study. Level of detail is an important factor in the quality
of a study, overall study costs, and length of time needed to perform study work.

or federally funded action is available to public officials and citizens before decisions are made
and before actions are taken.
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) – The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966
(NHPA) is the core legislation regarding the preservation of historic and cultural properties in
the United States. The NHPA created many familiar components of preservation in the United
States, such as the National Register of Historic Places, State Historic Preservation Officers/
Offices (SHPOs), and federal stewardship programs regarding federally owned or managed
historic properties.
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) – A list of structures, sites, and districts of national
historical significance as determined by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation under
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended.
No Action Alternative – The no action alternative is the baseline to which all other alternatives
are compared; it demonstrates the consequences of taking no action.
Noise Abatement Measures – Actions that reduce noise impacts. Noise-abatement measures
can be management measures, alteration of horizontal and vertical alignments, acquisition of
property rights for construction of noise barriers, construction of noise barriers, acquisition of real
property or interest for buffer zones, or noise insulation of public-use or nonprofit institutional
structures.
Peak Hour – The hour of the day when traffic volume on a given roadway is highest. A separate
peak hour can be defined for morning and evening periods.
Peak-hour Leq (equivalent sound level) – Represents the noisiest hour of the day/night and
usually occurs during peak periods of motor-vehicle traffic. The Leq is the equivalent sound-level
measurement, which means it averages background and short-term transient sound levels and
provides a uniform method for comparing sound levels that vary over time.

1.0 PURPOSE AND NEED
1.1

OVERVIEW

The Department of State (DOS) is the federal executive agency
responsible for the international relations of the United States.
DOS has a number of domestic and international responsibilities associated with the establishment and operation of foreign
missions in the United States. In this regard, DOS is responsible
for assisting foreign missions with identifying properties on which
they may locate and operate chanceries in the United States.
Due to the ever increasing scarcity of suitable properties
within the District of Columbia, combined with DOS’s need
for properties in foreign nations of considerable size, the
establishment of a new chancery enclave is central to the
achievement of a number of goals:

Chapter 1 details the underlying purpose
and needs to which the projects sponsors
are responding with alternatives in
Chapter 2. Chapter 1 provides an
overview of the decision makers and
decision-making process and provides
a foundation for the remainder of the
document.

A “chancery” is the principal offices of
a foreign mission used for diplomatic or
related purposes, and annexes to such
offices (including ancillary offices and
support facilities), and includes the site
and any buildings on the site which are
used for such purposes.

◊

Protecting Americans: Several thousand U.S.
government employees work at facilities that need
to be replaced in nations where site acquisitions are
complicated by the lack of reciprocal parcels within the
District of Columbia. This project would allow DOS to
leverage the availability of “chancery ready” parcels to
speed and/or finalize the acquisition of safe and secure
facilities from which to conduct American diplomatic
and consular operations.

◊

Growing the American Economy: Research proves that
one U.S. job is created by every 65 tourist visas issued
from a U.S. embassy or consular post abroad. The DOS
can leverage this project to speed the acquisition of new
locations in select countries where visa demand is strong
and expected to grow, yet current building constraints
inhibit DOS’s ability to address this demand efficiently.

◊

Location of Foreign Chanceries in New Areas of the District of Columbia: The majority
of the foreign missions in the District of Columbia are heavily concentrated along
Massachusetts Avenue, and the Sheridan-Kalorama neighborhood. This project would
expand desirable chancery locations further into the District to generate economic benefits
for the city and enhance both existing and proposed developments.

A “foreign mission” is any mission
to or agency or entity in the United
States which is involved in diplomatic,
consular or other activities of, or which
is substantially owned or effectively
controlled by, a foreign government; or
an organization representing a territory
or political entity which has been granted
diplomatic or other official privileges
and immunities under the laws of the
United States or which engages in some
aspect of the conduct of international
affairs of such territory or political
entity, including any real property of
such a mission and the personnel of
such a mission.

The availability of adequate space for the construction and operation of chanceries by foreign
missions has been a long-standing challenge in the District of Columbia. An initial response to this
issue came with the passage of the International Chancery Act of 1968, which authorized DOS to
undertake the redevelopment of the former campus of the National Bureau of Standards, located

Environmental Impact Statement

Foreign Missions Act of 1982
The Foreign Missions Act of 1982,
22 U.S.C. 4301-4316, reaffirms the
federal government’s jurisdiction
over the operation of foreign missions
and international organizations in
the United States. The Act resulted
in the establishment of the Office of
Foreign Missions (OFM) within DOS
to review and control the operations
of foreign missions in the United
States and the benefits that are made
available to them. It empowers
OFM to set the terms and conditions
whereby benefits may be provided
to foreign missions. It establishes
procedures and criteria governing the
location, replacement, or expansion
of chanceries in Washington, DC.
The Act authorizes DOS to acquire
property in the United States for the
establishment of property exchange
agreements with foreign governments,
whereby the U.S. government would
reciprocally obtain a site abroad that
is of equal benefit.

near the intersection of Connecticut Avenue and Van Ness
Street, as the International Chancery Center (ICC); the ICC
started construction in 1968. All parcels within the ICC are
fully assigned. In anticipation of needing another site similar
to the ICC, DOS undertook a multiyear evaluation of available
land parcels within the District of Columbia and concluded that
the former Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) site
was best suited to support a chancery center concept.

1.2 DESCRIPTION OF THE
PROPOSED ACTION
The proposed action is to prepare a Master Plan for the
long-term development of a Foreign Missions Center (FMC)
on approximately 43.5 acres of the former WRAMC site
at 16th Street, between Aspen Street and Alaska Avenue in
the District of Columbia (exhibit 1.1). The proposed action
consists of assignment of federal land to foreign missions
for the purpose of constructing and operating new chancery
facilities (exhibit 1.2). DOS would manage the FMC, including
maintaining common areas. In support of the Master Plan,
design guidelines are being developed to assist foreign missions
with the development of their lot. Each foreign mission design
would be subject to the local jurisdictional approval process
for the design and construction of mission facilities.

The proposed FMC was conceptually planned to complement the campus character and be
consistent with current and future adjacent land uses by:
1. Designing each lot access point to be placed on internal roadways of the campus;
2. Allowing public access to the public areas within the site;
3. Developing a re-use program for one historic building and maximizing the potential for
re-use of other historic buildings;
4. Maintaining a 30-foot setback between the Southern boundary of the site and historic
Main Drive;
5. Emphasizing vehicular and pedestrian connections between the DOS portion and the adjacent
land uses; and
6. Maintaining a 50-foot vegetated buffer on the west boundary of the site, and preserving the
tree canopy to the maximum extent possible.

Although the potential exists for 24 individual lots, DOS anticipates 10 to 15 chanceries to
be established at the FMC, as countries would have the option to combine lots if desired. The
lots would range in size. The lots south of Dahlia Street are envisioned to be larger with the
expectation that foreign missions may construct several buildings, creating a compound (exhibit
1.3). The lots north of Dahlia Street are envisioned to be closer together, creating a more urban
density. Each foreign mission would be responsible for meeting parking needs (employee and
visitor) on its individual lot. The design guidelines will promote a majority of parking to be
below grade. On-street parking on internal FMC roadways would not be permitted. Specific lot
development restrictions (such as minimal building setbacks, building lot coverage, maximum
building height, and floor to area ratio) would be dependent upon the lot’s location (exhibits
1.4 and 1.5).
The primary vehicle entrance would be at the intersection of Main Drive and 14th Street. Other
vehicle entrances would be at Alaska Avenue and 14th Street, Alaska Avenue and Dahlia Street,
13th Place and Fern Street, and Dahlia Street. Streets internal to the FMC would be private,
and owned and maintained by the federal government. Primary streets (14th Street and Dahlia
Street) would consist of one travel lane and one bike lane in each direction. Secondary streets
(13th Place) would consist of one travel lane in each direction. Wider sidewalks would be located
on both sides of primary streets, and regular-size sidewalks would be located on both sides of
secondary streets. Intersections would be controlled with stop signs. The FMC would be open
to public transit.
The existing historic perimeter fence along the 16th Street, Alaska Avenue, and Fern Street
frontages would be retained. Each foreign mission would be responsible for the perimeter security
of its individual lot. Fencing standards for individual lots would be developed in coordination
with the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) and the National Capital Planning Commission
(NCPC) as part of the design guidelines.
Utilities at the FMC would include domestic water, stormwater drainage and treatment, sanitary
sewerage, data and telecommunications, electrical power, natural gas, and street lighting.
Stormwater would be managed at the FMC as a whole and on-site at each lot, including
opportunities for grey water re-use and bio-retention gardens. The stormwater system for roads
would connect to the District of Columbia system. Utilities would be underground within the
street/sidewalk right-of-way (ROW). Utility service would be provided to each lot.
Foreign missions would fully fund DOS’s upfront infrastructure development costs through the
revenue generated from the assignment of lots. Cost effectiveness measures for the FMC include
maximizing the number of lots available for assignment, re-using existing roadway locations,
and minimizing maintenance-intensive public features. To allow for cost-neutral funding, the
proposed action envisions implementation in phases; funds from the assignment of land during
one phase would finance the development costs for it and the next phase. The phased approach
would optimize lot size and site design.
The proposed action would be built over approximately 20 years (exhibit 1.6).

PURPOSE AND NEED

The purpose of the proposed action is to prepare a master plan for the long-term development
of a Foreign Missions Center, under authorities of the Foreign Missions Act of 1982, on the site
of the former WRAMC in the District of Columbia. The master plan is intended to guide the
development of a cohesive campus by establishing design and land-use planning principles for
the construction of new buildings, roadways, open green space, and utilities, while minimizing
environmental impacts.
The need for the proposed action is based on increased and high demand for foreign mission
facilities in the District of Columbia, a lack of large sites for foreign mission development or
redevelopment in the District, and the need for land to use in property exchanges with other
countries. The proposed action is needed primarily to address the increasing scarcity of suitable
properties within the District to locate the operations of foreign missions. This scarcity has
impacted DOS’s ability to acquire properties in foreign nations.

Increased and High Demand for Foreign Mission Facilities in the
District of Columbia
DOS has an urgent need to meet the demand from foreign missions for modern and secure
facilities within the nation’s capital. The District of Columbia is one of the smallest national

capitals, but is home to more foreign missions than any other city in the world. There are
approximately186 foreign missions and 31 headquarters or offices of international organizations
in the northwest quadrant of the city, heavily concentrated along Massachusetts Avenue, the
Sheridan-Kalorama neighborhood, and at the full ICC.
The collapse in the 1990s of both the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia resulted in the creation of
21 new countries, all of which quickly moved to establish diplomatic missions in the District
of Columbia. Many are located in small, historic townhouses in the Sheridan-Kalorama and
Massachusetts Avenue areas. Two decades later, many of these countries have outgrown the
small facilities acquired in the very early days of their histories. Further, the rapid growth and
prominence in the past decade of countries such as Brazil, China, India, and Vietnam has had
a significant impact on the diplomatic presence of such governments, as well as on DOS’s
reciprocal presence and operations in those countries.

Lack of Property for Development or Redevelopment of Foreign
Mission Facilities in the District of Columbia
There is a lack of property within the District of Columbia for the development or redevelopment
of foreign missions facilities. The Foreign Missions Act states that chanceries shall be able
to locate, as a matter of right, in an area which is zoned commercial, industrial, waterfront
or mixed-use. Properties that fail to meet these criteria require the consent of the District of
Columbia’s Board of Zoning Adjustment (BZA). The BZA is required by Congress to make its
decision based upon several factors, including: 1) historic preservation, 2) adequacy of off-street
or other parking and the extent to which the area would be served by public transportation, and
3) the extent to which the area is capable of being adequately protected, as determined by DOS.
Due to these zoning requirements and the limited supply of undeveloped or re-developable
parcels within the District of Columbia, the ability of foreign missions to identify appropriate
sites is becoming incrementally more challenging each year.
The ICC successfully allowed foreign missions to locate their chanceries in a purpose-built
community, which was designed to both address the modern needs of such operations and
to mitigate possible negative impacts such facilities may have, or be perceived to have, to
neighboring properties and citizens. The ICC has proven to be a highly successful model for
balancing the federal government’s need to accommodate foreign mission facilities with the
concerns of citizens about the location and operation of foreign missions in the District of
Columbia. With the ICC fully assigned, DOS has a need to create a second ICC-type location.

Reciprocity Difficulties
In accordance with the Foreign Missions Act, DOS enters into property exchange agreements
with other countries, whereby property is provided to foreign governments for the establishment
of missions in exchange for DOS receiving similar property within their countries. The lack of
suitable land for development or redevelopment and a full ICC have inhibited DOS’s ability to
reciprocally acquire property abroad to house its diplomatic and consular facilities.

Page 10

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

The construction of the new U.S. chancery in Beijing and the Chinese chancery in the District of
Columbia provides an example of how reciprocity functions. During the 1990s, U.S. chancery
facilities in Beijing were identified as not meeting functional, safety, or security standards.
With buildings on three distinct compounds and embassy offices located at 20 sites around
Beijing, there was a need to co-locate personnel onto a single compound. In addition, the
demand for consular services in Beijing was increasing. After initiating planning with the
Chinese government, the new U.S. chancery in Beijing was constructed, and opened in August
2008 on a 10-acre site in China’s Third Diplomatic Enclave. Simultaneously, DOS was able to
provide China with land in the ICC for their new chancery, which also opened in 2008. Planning
and construction of the U.S. and Chinese chanceries was governed by a series of reciprocal
agreements and memoranda between the two countries. Without the ability to accommodate
China’s construction needs at the ICC, DOS’s efforts to construct a new U.S. chancery in Beijing
would most likely not have been successful.
As foreign governments continue to face greater difficulty identifying properties within the District
of Columbia that are either available for chancery use or are viewed by foreign governments
as being suitable for modern embassy operations, DOS faces a number of new challenges in its
attempts to reciprocally acquire properties in other countries. DOS has a need to resolve stalled
attempts to acquire property in certain countries to construct adequate and secure facilities for
the conduct of American diplomacy and consular operations.

1.4

OTHER ACTIONS

The Department of the Army is dividing the former WRAMC into two proposed developments. About
43.5 acres of the westerly portion of the campus would be developed by DOS for the FMC. The
remaining 66.5 acres would be developed by the District of Columbia’s WRAMC Local Redevelopment
Authority (DC-LRA) as a mixed-use development (exhibit 1.7). The proposed DC-LRA plan has
been created to respond to the physical and market conditions of potential new uses of the property.
The proposed DC-LRA reuse plan creates a site that is re-connected with the neighborhood
community and includes uses that are compatible with existing and proposed functions in the
area. The DC-LRA envisions the site as a mix of open spaces and retail, residential uses with
diverse housing options, commercial offices, institutional spaces, medical care facilities and
cultural and community uses.

1.5

FEDERAL DECISIONS AND ACTIONS

DOS is the lead federal agency for the proposed action. DOS, with input from the public and
other federal and district agencies, would decide future actions in accordance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and related legislation and Presidential Executive Orders
(EOs). The NEPA requires federal agencies to consider the potential impacts to the natural and
human environment from their actions as part of their decision-making process, and to disclose
the potential impacts in a document that is circulated for public review. The NEPA process is
intended to help public officials make decisions based on an understanding of the environmental

consequences and to take actions that protect, restore, and enhance the environment (40 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 1500.1).
Several federal agencies participated in the alternatives development process by providing
informal recommendations to DOS. These agencies were the CFA, the NCPC, and the Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP). The CFA is an independent agency established in
1910 by Act of Congress charged with giving expert advice to the President, Congress and the
heads of departments and agencies of the Federal and District of Columbia governments on
matters of design and aesthetics as they affect the Federal interest and preserve the dignity of
the Nation’s capital. Within the District of Columbia community, the Commission advises on
design matters affecting the WRAMC and Rock Creek Park, as well as other private sector
areas adjacent to federal interests. Under 45 CFR § 2101.1(a), CFA comments and advises on
the plans and the merits of the designs before final approval or action for public buildings to be
erected in the city by the Federal government.
Under 40 U.S.C. § 8722, NCPC has approval authority over site and building designs for federal
public buildings in the District of Columbia and its metropolitan area, and uses NCPC-approved
master plans and policies found in the Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital as the basis
for subsequent reviews and approvals.
The ACHP is an independent federal agency that administers historic preservation matters and
oversees the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) Section 106 review process (review
of impacts on historic properties).
District agencies that participated in the alternatives development process by providing informal
recommendations to DOS were the DC Historic Preservation Office (DC-HPO) and the DC-LRA.
The DC-HPO promotes stewardship of the District of Columbia’s historic and cultural resources
through planning, protection, and public education. DC-HPO is part of the DC Office of Planning
and serves as the staff for the Historic Preservation Review Board and the Mayor’s Agent for
historic preservation. DC-HPO implements federal historic preservation programs as the State
Historic Preservation Office for the District of Columbia, responsible for protecting the city’s
unique historical, archaeological, architectural, and cultural resources. This responsibility is
shared with each federal agency that administers properties or undertakes construction activities
within the city. In accordance with the Base Realignment and Closure Act (BRAC) law, the
District of Columbia established the DC-LRA by Mayoral Order 2006-21. The District of
Columbia is the only jurisdiction comprising the LRA and is recognized by the Department of
Defense, Office of Economic Adjustment. The Mayor of the District of Columbia established
the Walter Reed LRA Committee to oversee the preparation of its Reuse Plan which was created
by the District government and is administered by the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning
and Economic Development (DMPED). The DC-LRA is overseeing the redevelopment of the
other portion of the WRAMC site.

Environmental Impact Statement

1.6 PURPOSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
STATEMENT (EIS)
The purpose of this EIS is to provide DOS and the public with a full accounting of the potential
environmental impacts of the alternatives developed for meeting the proposed action’s purpose
and needs. The EIS serves as the primary document to facilitate review of the proposed
action by federal, state and local agencies and the public. It is intended to provide a full and
fair discussion of the potential significant environmental impacts from the proposed action
and inform decision makers and the public of reasonable alternatives that would avoid or
minimize adverse impacts or enhance the quality of the human environment (40 CFR Part
1502.1). An EIS must briefly discuss the purpose and needs for the proposed action, the range
of alternatives considered, the resultant environmental impacts from the proposed action, and
the agencies and people consulted during the planning of the proposed action. The ultimate
objective of this EIS is to identify a solution that furthers the proposed action’s purpose,
satisfies the needs of the proposed action, and minimizes adverse environmental and social
impacts at an affordable cost.
The EIS is first circulated publicly as a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS). Following
publication of the DEIS, a public hearing is held to solicit additional public input into the planning
and decision-making process (exhibit 1.8). Additionally public input is accepted during the 45-day
comment period following publication of the DEIS. Comments

SCOPE OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

Public participation is integral to the preparation of an EIS. This section summarizes the issues
and concerns that were identified during the public scoping process held from June 18 through
August 10, 2012 and where those issues are addressed in this EIS (exhibit 1.9). Scoping is
a process for determining the range of issues to be addressed in an EIS and for identifying
significant issues associated with the alternatives (40 CFR Part 1501.7). The objectives of the
scoping process are to notify those interested—other federal, district, and local agencies, tribes,
and other groups—about the alternatives being considered; solicit comments about environmental
issues, alternatives, and other items of interest; and consider those comments in the preparation
of the EIS.
Scoping for the EIS began with DOS issuing its notice of intent to prepare an EIS, which
was published in the Federal Register June 18, 2012. The notice of intent invited individuals,
organizations, and agencies to submit comments concerning the scope of the EIS. The comment
period ended on August 10, 2012, and DOS considered the comments received in defining the
scope of the analysis performed and documented in the EIS.
A public scoping meeting was held July 19, 2012, in the District of Columbia. This meeting consisted
of an open house with displays, a presentation, and time for public comments and questions to
be considered in the planning of the proposed action and preparation of the EIS. Approximately
55 people attended the scoping meeting including residents, community leaders, members of the
press, elected officials, and District of Columbia government agency representatives.

voluntarily pledge to work with
other chanceries and the District
3.8.2 Pedestrian
of Columbia’s Department of
Transportation (DDOT) to locate
and Bicycle
one or more Capitol Bike share

stations on areas they are leasing.
Use this pledge as one of the criteria
for determining which countries
would receive leases.

Countries wishing to locate on the FMC would be encouraged to
work with other missions and DDOT to provide a Capitol Bike
share station. The proposed action would accommodate bicycles
through the inclusion of short- and long-term bicycle parking. DOS’s
proposed action consists of:
•
Ensuring internal roads accommodate bicycle travel; and
•
Providing crosswalks and all-way stops at FMC entrances.

Is there a perimeter fence going
in place between the District of
Columbia and the foreign mission
centers for security issues?

1.2 Description
of the Proposed
Action

The existing historic perimeter fence along the 16th Street, Alaska
Avenue, and Fern Street frontages would be retained. Fencing
standards for individual chanceries would be developed as part of
FMC design guidelines.

How many entrances and exits are
planned?

3.8.1 Vehicle
Traffic

Vehicular access to the FMC would be provided at five locations:
Main Drive, Fern Street, two locations along Alaska Avenue, and
Dahlia Street.

Would there be security on the site?

1.2 Description
of the Proposed
Action

The U.S. Secret Service is responsible for security of foreign
missions and would patrol the area.

What country’s chanceries would be
See Remarks
located at the FMC?

The specific countries that could locate at the FMC are unknown.
Construction of the FMC would create an estimated 3,053 temporary
jobs within the regional economy, the equivalent of $131 million in
wages paid, and as much as $109 million in consumer expenditures
resulting from the new employment.

Support local business during the
design and construction phase.

3.10
Socioeconomics

Would the public have access to the
site and would there be walking and
biking trails?

3.8.2 Pedestrian
and Bicycle
Facilities

The FMC would be open to the public, with pedestrian and bicycle
access.

Why is this site appealing to the
DOS for the chanceries? Are there
other sites available?

2.1 Selection of
the WRAMC as
the Site for the
FMC

After years of considering the suitability of other locations
throughout the District of Columbia, DOS concluded the former
WRAMC site was the most viable option given its size, location, and
opportunity for purpose-built chanceries.

Consider the traffic issues during
all phases of the project, including
truck traffic.

3.8
Transportation

The potential traffic impacts of the proposed action have been
considered.

Address the impacts to public
parking for neighbors.

3.8.1 Vehicle
Traffic

Existing buildings that are reused would be required to develop
independent parking solutions, and new buildings would be required
to incorporate parking within their parcel boundaries. On-street
parking would not be permitted.

To the extent that chancery employees support retail businesses or
choose to reside within the study area, the FMC would have a slight
positive effect on local businesses.

2.0 ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS
DOS identified, developed, and analyzed the No Action
Alternative and six action alternatives that could
potentially satisfy the proposed action’s purpose and
needs. In developing and analyzing alternatives, DOS
consulted with regulatory and resource agencies at the
Federal and district levels and with the public. During the
alternatives development process, five action alternatives
were dismissed because they did not meet the needs and
requirements as well as the Preferred Action Alternative
did.
DOS has identified a Preferred Action Alternative which
it considers would best fulfill its statutory mission and
responsibilities, while giving consideration to economic,
environmental, technical, and other factors. In identifying
its Preferred Action Alternative, DOS judges it has identified
the environmentally preferable alternative because it best
meets the purpose and needs for the study; causes the least
damage to the biological and physical environment; and
best protects, preserves, and enhances the historic, cultural,
and natural resources of the study area. The Preferred
Action Alternative and No Action Alternative were retained
for further consideration and more detailed analysis.

2.1 SELECTION OF WRAMC AS
PROPOSED FMC SITE
The site selection process for a new FMC was conducted by
DOS and the NCPC. In 2003, NCPC completed the Foreign
Missions in the District of Columbia Future Location
Analysis, which identified opportunities and recommended
regulatory changes to guide the future location of foreign
missions within the District of Columbia. The analysis
recommended creating a new chancery center. Potential
FMC sites identified in the analysis consisted of:

Chapter 2 presents the alternatives
analysis. It introduces the range of
reasonable action alternatives developed
to meet the study's purpose and needs
and identifies DOS’s preferred action
alternative for further study. It identifies
those alternatives retained for or
dismissed from more detailed study
and the reasons for their retention or
dismissal.

The regulations on implementing the
NEPA (40 CFR 1502.14) require that
the lead agency:
a.

Rigorously explore and objectively
evaluate all reasonable alternatives
and briefly discuss the reasons for
elimination of alternatives from
detailed study.

b.

Devote substantial treatment to each
alternative considered in detail,
including the proposed action, so
that reviewers may evaluate their
comparative merits.

c.

Include reasonable alternatives not
within the jurisdiction of the lead
agency.

d.

Include the alternative of no action.

e.

Identify the agency’s preferred
alternative or alternatives, if one
or more exists, in the DEIS and
identify such alternative in the
FEIS, unless another law prohibits
the expression of such a preference.

f.

Include appropriate mitigation
measures not already included in
the proposed action or alternatives.

◊

U.S. Naval Security Station, Nebraska and
Massachusetts Avenue—38 acres.

◊

St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, Alabama Avenue, SE, undefined acreage available resulting
from a planned redevelopment of the campus.

Page 23

Environmental Impact Statement

◊

Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH), North Capital Street & Michigan Avenue—77
acres.

◊

South Capitol Street Corridor/Anacostia River waterfront, specifically the Southeast
Federal Center (10 acres) and the Anacostia Naval Station (14 acres). These areas offered
potential for smaller or “mini” FMC campuses.

The U.S. Naval Security Station was subsequently dismissed from further consideration due to
the presence of the newly established, and rapidly expanding, U.S. Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) at that location.
St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, formerly owned by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
was turned over to the General Services Administration (GSA) as excess property in 2004. In
2007, GSA issued a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS to redevelop the St. Elizabeth’s Campus
to house the headquarters of DHS. Given the planned redevelopment by GSA, St. Elizabeth’s
was dismissed from consideration for a FMC (NCPC, 2003).
Based on the conclusions of the Future Location Analysis, NCPC revised the Federal Elements
of the Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital in 2006. The plan lists two potential sites
for a new chancery center: the AFRH and the South Capitol Street Corridor. The Plan cites
the possibility for either federally owned and/or privately owned sites along the South Capitol
Street Corridor.
DOS developed criteria for selecting a site. The criteria stated that a future center must:
◊

Be located in the District of Columbia;

◊

Be a minimum of 15 acres in size;

◊

Be a contiguous parcel of land to create a campus setting that will meet security and
marketability/desirability needs;

◊

Have existing utility infrastructure; and

◊

Provide convenient access to major traffic arteries and amenities.

Federally owned property in the South Capitol Street Corridor/Anacostia River waterfront was
subsequently dismissed from further consideration by DOS and NCPC because security and
marketability needs identified by DOS for the new center would be better met by a larger site
(>15 acres) with general similarity to the ICC.
The District of Columbia government, which has a continuing concern regarding the loss of
property from the tax roll due to federal ownership, supported the development of a new FMC
on federal land, which is already tax exempt. Therefore, due to: 1) local government preference,

Page 24

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

2) the rapidly rising cost of private land in the District of Columbia during the national housing
and economic expansion, and 3) the limited availability of sufficiently large parcels, privately
owned property (both in the South Capitol Street Corridor and the investigation of other privately
owned sites) was dismissed from further consideration (NCPC, 2006).
In 2005, the Department of Defense announced the closure of the WRAMC as part of the BRAC
process. WRAMC met the size and federal ownership criteria for a new center and was added
into consideration in March 2006.
DOS and NCPC dismissed the AFRH from further consideration and selected WRAMC as
the preferred location because the WRAMC site is more marketable than the AFRH site; the
WRAMC site is closer to existing concentrations of chanceries; and, at WRAMC, the DC-LRA
site would provide desirable amenities in a pedestrian-accessible adjacent location.

2.2 MASTER PLAN ALTERNATIVES IDENTIFICATION
AND DEVELOPMENT
DOS identified and developed potential design alternatives for WRAMC through collaborative
planning and design work sessions with other federal and district agencies with direct or indirect
jurisdiction over the proposed action, or an interest or special expertise, at key milestones to
receive feedback and suggestions for improvement. The first four work sessions focused on
individual components that would compose the range of reasonable action alternatives considered
for furthering the study purpose and fulfilling the needs. Components common to the action
alternatives consisted of cost-neutral funding, a minimum 50-year design life for utilities, on-lot
stormwater management, parking guidelines, and street design (see Section 1.2).
Site and individual lot development parameters (size, floor area ratio, building coverage and height
restrictions) developed for each campus zone would not vary between the action alternatives.
Under the action alternatives, the existing historic perimeter fence along 16th Street, Alaska
Avenue, and Fern Street would be retained. The existing landscape on the west boundary of
the site would be enhanced to create a 50-foot vegetated buffer, and the tree canopy would be
preserved to the extent reasonably possible. Access to individual lots would be internal to the
campus.
The conditions in the study area and environmental features on the site of the former WRAMC
were reviewed with work session participants to inform the alternatives identification process,
with an emphasis on cultural resources, vegetation, topography, site contamination, other land
use planning initiatives, and traffic.
The components that varied between the action alternatives were presented at the work sessions
and consisted of:
◊

Options for phasing development – To allow for cost-neutral funding, the proposed
action would be developed in phases, in which assignment of lots in one phase would

Page 25

Environmental Impact Statement

finance infrastructure development for that phase and for some of the next phase. Phasing
also allows the most time for marketing historic buildings for reuse. Options for phasing
development were identified and evaluated during the alternatives analysis.
◊

Street layout – Street layouts were considered to maximize site efficiency.

◊

Green space design – A strong preference was expressed by DOS and other Federal and
District agencies to incorporate green space as an amenity for increasing the marketability
and desirability of the FMC. Designs for green space were identified and evaluated.

◊

Site access – The number and location of access points were identified and evaluated to
provide the most efficient traffic flow and vehicle and pedestrian connections between
the FMC and the DC-LRA development and the surrounding neighborhoods.

Early in the process of identifying, developing, and analyzing alternatives that could potentially
further the proposed action’s purpose and satisfy its needs, assessment criteria were developed
to help differentiate the alternatives (exhibit 2.1). The assessment criteria consisted of: 1)
maintaining and enhancing the existing site character, 2) responsiveness to the concerns raised
during scoping, 3) minimizing the potential impacts to cultural resources, and 4) maximizing the
marketability of the FMC as a whole and individual parcels by allowing development flexibility.

2.3 ALTERNATIVES RETAINED FOR FURTHER
CONSIDERATION AND DETAILED STUDY
Two alternatives were retained for further consideration and detailed study: the No Action
Alternative and the Preferred Action Alternative.

Creates a denser zone north of Dahlia Street and a less dense zone south of Dahlia Street,
complementing the proposed DC-LRA zoning.
Provides a strong east-west connection between DC-LRA and FMC portions of the former
WRAMC by vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian travel via Dahlia Street.
Creates a landscaped park around Memorial Chapel, enhancing the site buffer and historic
building setting.
Maximizes tree preservation on the western half of the site.
Provides an open campus with vehicular and pedestrian connectivity between adjacent
communities, the FMC, and the DC-LRA property.
Retains historic Building 57/Memorial Chapel for adaptive reuse.
Allows for the potential reuse of individually eligible historic resources: Building 40 (Walter
Reed Army Institute of Research), Building 41 (Old Red Cross Building), and Building 52
(Medical Ward). Viability of reuse is dependent upon marketability.
Alternative reviewed and supported by coordinating Federal cultural resource agencies (NCPC,
CFA).
The variety of lot sizes provides options for DOS to market to foreign missions; parcels can
easily be combined to form larger lots.
The boulevard design of Dahlia and 14th Streets provides parity between lots; all lots have
important street frontage and orientation.

2.3.1 No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, DOS would not take ownership of the 43.5 acre portion of
the former WRAMC and would not create a master plan to develop the FMC. DOS would face
continued challenge in facilitating the provision of adequate and secure facilities for foreign
missions. The lack of readily available parcels within the District of Columbia for the development
of foreign mission facilities would persist, and the high demand for foreign mission facilities
would continue to grow. DOS's inability to reciprocally acquire properties in other countries
would increase and a delay in updating U.S. diplomatic and consular properties abroad to meet
modern security requirements would continue.
The No Action Alternative was retained for detailed study and the consequences of the No
Action Alternative were fully developed for the year 2032 to demonstrate the full impact of
taking no action. This provides a baseline comparison with the action alternatives. The year 2032
represents the completion of the planned build out of the FMC over an approximate 20-year
period beginning with the initiation of the EIS process in 2012.

2.3.2 Alternative 1: Preferred Action Alternative
The Preferred Action Alternative would provide a maximum of 24 lots for chancery development
(exhibit 2.2). In the northwest quadrant, historic Building 57/Memorial Chapel would be retained
for adaptive reuse. Green space would surround the chapel and existing trees of good condition
in the quadrant would remain undisturbed.
On the eastern portion of the site, historic Building 52/Medical Warehouse and Clinic, Building
40/Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and historic Building 41/Old Red Cross Building
could remain for potential adaptive reuse, depending on marketability. The location of 13th Place
would either remain the same, or be moved slightly to the east, in alignment with Building 41
(requiring the provision of a new entry in the existing perimeter fence). These variations for 13th
Place provide flexibility to adjust parcel sizes to support the marketability and programmatic
requirements of interested foreign missions.
Under the Preferred Action Alternative, Dahlia Street and 14th Street would be developed as
boulevards supporting pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular traffic connections to the surrounding
neighborhoods. In the southwest quadrant, the boulevard landscaping bordering 14th Street
would be widened to create green space replacing the existing parking lot. This low-lying green
space would assist with the filtration of rain water from the FMC reducing stormwater runoff.

2.4 IDENTIFICATION OF DOS’S PREFERRED
ALTERNATIVE
Alternative 1 was identified as the Preferred Action Alternative because it furthers the purpose
of the project and satisfies the needs for the project while best: 1) maintaining and enhancing the
existing site character of the former WRAMC; 2) addressing community concerns raised during

scoping; 3) minimizing potential impacts to cultural resources; and 4) maximizing marketability
by allowing the greatest flexibility in developing the site.
The No Action Alternative would not further the purpose of the project to prepare a master plan to
establish a FMC at the former WRAMC. The No Action Alternative would not satisfy the project needs
to: 1) reduce the increasingly high demand for foreign mission facilities in the District of Columbia; 2)
increase the supply of readily available parcels for development or redevelopment of foreign mission
facilities; nor 3) improve DOS’s ability to reciprocally acquire properties in other countries.

2.5 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BUT ELIMINATED
FROM DETAILED STUDY
Five other action alternatives were developed during the alternatives identification process but
dismissed from further consideration and detailed study.

2.5.1 Alternative 2
In the northwest quadrant, Alternative 2 would retain Historic Building 57/Memorial Chapel for
adaptive reuse, and provide two lots for development (exhibit 2.3). In the southwest quadrant,
Alternative 2 would provide up to five lots. The existing cul-de-sac would be converted to a
one-way access road surrounding an orthogonal open space.
In the northeast quadrant, Elder Street would be extended from the DC-LRA site west to 14th
Street. 13th Place would be moved to the east and terminated at Elder Street. Several lots would
be organized around a central linear green space. Historic Building 52/Medical Warehouse and
Clinic could remain for potential adaptive reuse.
Alternative 2 would provide east-west and north-south linear green spaces in the southeast
quadrant. Historic Building 41/Old Red Cross Building and an historic portion of Building 40/
Walter Reed Army Institute of Research could remain for potential adaptive reuse. Lots along
Main Drive would be accessed from Main Drive.
Alternative 2 was eliminated from further consideration and detailed study because:

Page 30

◊

Extending Elder Street to 14th Street would have created an unsafe traffic pattern by
locating the intersection too close to the FMC entrance at the intersection of 14th Street
and Alaska Avenue.

◊

In the northwest quadrant, the two parcels surrounding Historic Building 57/Memorial
Chapel would result in a greater impact to cultural resources by: 1) creating visual
incompatibility in proximity to the historic building, 2) obscuring views of the chapel from
the surrounding areas, and 3) obscuring perspectives looking outwards from the building.

◊

The smaller lots sizes planned for the western half of the site would result in greater loss
of significant trees.

◊

The alternative reduces marketability of the FMC by designing a layout that lacks a
strong front door presence for many lots, and by locating green space where it would
be perceived as private to adjacent chanceries and not a feature of the overall campus.

2.5.2 Alternative 3
In the northwest quadrant, Alternative 3 would retain Historic Building 57/Memorial Chapel for
adaptive reuse, and provide two lots for development (exhibit 2.4). In the southwest quadrant,
Alternative 3 would provide up to five lots. The existing cul-de-sac would be moved to the east
and widened.
In the northeast quadrant, linear green space would extend between Fern Street and Dahlia Street.
Historic Building 52/Medical Warehouse and Clinic could remain for potential adaptive reuse.
Alternative 3 would provide east-west and north-south linear green spaces in the southeast
quadrant. Historic Building 41/Old Red Cross Building could remain for potential adaptive
reuse. Because the linear green space would be centered to the west of the historic Building 40/
Walter Reed Army Institute of Research axis, Building 40 would be removed. Lots along Main
Drive would be accessed from Main Drive.
Alternative 3 was eliminated from further consideration and detailed study because:
◊

In the northwest quadrant, the two parcels surrounding Historic Building 57/Memorial
Chapel would result in a greater impact to cultural resources by: 1) creating visual
incompatibility in proximity to the historic building, 2) obscuring views of the chapel from
surrounding areas, and 3) obscuring perspectives looking outwards from the building.

2.5.3 Alternative 4
In the northwest quadrant, Historic Building 57/Memorial Chapel would be retained for adaptive
reuse. Open green space would surround the chapel and existing trees in the quadrant would
remain undisturbed (exhibit 2.5). In the southwest quadrant, Alternative 4 would provide up to
six lots. The existing cul-de-sac would be moved to the east and converted to a one-way access
road surrounding a square open space.

Alternative 4 would create boulevards extending north to south along 14th Street and 13th Place.
13th Place would be extended south to Main Drive. In the southwest quadrant, the boulevard
landscaping bordering 14th Street to the west would be widened to create green space across
the existing steep slope.
Because of the street layout, lot sizes under Alternative 4 would be relatively uniform. On the
eastern portion of the site, historic Building 52/Medical Warehouse and Clinic and historic
Building 41/Old Red Cross Building could remain for potential adaptive reuse.
Alternative 4 was eliminated from further consideration and detailed study because:
◊

The proposed intersection of 13th Place and Main Drive would create an unsafe traffic
pattern because of the amount of traffic volume created and its location in proximity to
other intersections along Main Drive.

◊

The proposed extension of 13th Place south of Dahlia Street would be close to Historic
Building 41/Old Red Cross Building and could result in a cultural resource impact by
reducing the building’s reuse potential.

◊

The smaller lot sizes planned for the southwest quadrant would result in greater loss of
significant trees.

◊

The site layout design would reduce marketability of the FMC by providing uniform lot
sizes that lack flexibility for foreign missions who desire multiple adjacent lots.

2.5.4 Alternative 5
In the northwest quadrant, Alternative 5 would retain Historic Building 57/Memorial Chapel for
adaptive reuse, and provide two lots for development (exhibit 2.6). In the southwest quadrant,
Alternative 5 would provide up to four lots. The existing cul-de-sac would be removed. Dahlia
Street would dead end before reaching Alaska Avenue.
In the eastern portion of the site, a single large open green space would be created north of Dahlia
Street. Historic Building 52/Medical Warehouse and Clinic and historic Building 41/Old Red
Cross Building could remain for potential adaptive reuse. In the southeast quadrant, fewer and
larger parcels would be provided in comparison to other alternatives.
Alternative 5 was eliminated from further consideration and detailed study because:
◊

In the northwest quadrant, the two parcels surrounding Historic Building 57/Memorial
Chapel would result in a greater impact to cultural resources by: 1) creating visual
incompatibility in proximity to the historic building, 2) obscuring views of the chapel from
surrounding areas, and 3) obscuring perspectives looking outwards from the building.

◊

The dead end on Dahlia Street before Alaska Avenue does not provide efficient vehicular
connectivity between the FMC and the surrounding neighborhoods and important street
connections.

◊

The green space design does not maximize site efficiency or marketability of the campus
because the location reduces desirable street frontage available for chanceries and few
parcels are oriented to the green space.

2.5.5 Alternative 6
In the northwest quadrant, Alternative 6 would retain Historic Building 57/Memorial Chapel for
adaptive reuse, and provide two lots for development (exhibit 2.7). In the southwest quadrant,
Alternative 6 would provide up to six lots. The existing cul-de-sac would be moved to the east
and converted to a one-way access road surrounding a square open space.
Two additional square open green spaces would be created in the eastern half of the site. Historic
Building 52/Medical Warehouse and Clinic and historic Building 41/Old Red Cross Building
could remain for potential adaptive reuse. In the southeast quadrant, 13th Place would be
extended south to Main Drive.
Alternative 6 was eliminated from further consideration and detailed study because:
◊

In the northwest quadrant, the two parcels surrounding Historic Building 57/Memorial
Chapel would result in a greater impact to cultural resources by: 1) creating visual

The site layout design would reduce marketability of the FMC campus by: 1) providing
uniform lot sizes that lack flexibility for chanceries who desire multiple adjacent lots,
and 2) orienting only a limited number of lots to the squares of desirable green space.

3.0 AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT
AND ENVIRONMENTAL
CONSEQUENCES
This chapter identifies the affected environment, potential
environmental consequences, mitigation measures, and
commitments associated with the implementation of the No
Action and Preferred Action Alternatives retained for further
consideration and detailed analysis. Potential impacts—both
beneficial and adverse—were identified and, where possible,
quantified through studies of the natural, social, and economic
environments. Potential impacts include the direct impacts,
indirect impacts, and cumulative impacts of the No Action and
Preferred Action Alternatives.

Chapter 3 is an inventory of
the affected environment and a
discussion of consequences and
potential mitigation measures
resulting from the alternatives
retained for detailed study. It
succinctly describes the physical,
biological, social, and economic
environments of the area to be
affected by the alternatives. It
describes the impacts of the
alternatives; the adverse effects that
cannot be avoided if implemented;
the relationship between short-term
uses of the human environment and
the maintenance and enhancement
of long-term productivity; and
any irreversible or irretrievable
commitments of resources that
would result if an alternative is
implemented (40 CFR part 1502.16).

DOS developed a study area of approximately 350 acres for the
consideration of potential impacts to the social and economic
environments in the area; a smaller area was used for the
consideration of potential impacts to the natural environment
(exhibit 3.1). The study area not only covers the land that
would be used for the Preferred Action Alternative, but also
the area that would potentially experience direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts from it.

Only those resources that have the potential to be impacted by the Preferred Action Alternative
were analyzed. The following resources were not evaluated in this EIS:
◊

Wetlands – Wetlands are those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water
or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal
circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated
soil conditions. Wetlands generally consist of swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas
(USACE, 1987). No wetlands or other Waters of the U.S. are found on the site of the
former WRAMC.

◊

Wild and Scenic Rivers – The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System was created
from the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1271, et seq.) of 1968 to preserve
certain rivers with outstanding natural, cultural, and recreational values in a free-flowing
condition for the enjoyment of present and future generations. River segments designated
by Congress or the U.S. Department of the Interior are classified as wild river areas,
scenic river areas, or recreational river areas. The Act requires federal agencies to consider
impacts of proposed actions on designated river segments. No wild or scenic rivers are
in the study area.

3.1

PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY

The physical geography or physiography of an area is a description of the physical features of
the natural landscape. The physical geography and geology of the study area may influence
the alternatives development and selection process as natural landforms and geologic features
may determine the extent of environmental features and potential constraints to development
or extraordinary engineering solutions.
The study area is along the eastern edge of the Piedmont Physiographic Province of the
Appalachian Highlands. The Piedmont’s topography is characterized by gently rolling hills
and level uplands strongly dissected by streams that have steep valley walls (USGS, 2012).
The original topography of the study area has been extensively altered by grading and construction
to create an urban and suburban area. The study area has an elevation range of over 100 feet,
from 244 feet above mean sea level (MSL) near 16th Street to 352 feet above MSL near 14th
Street and Alaska Avenue. The study area slopes to the south and west towards Rock Creek.
Some steep slopes (over 30 percent) are found in the study area.
The No Action and Preferred Action Alternatives would not alter the existing physical geography
of the study area. No substantial change in the profile or elevation of land within the study area
would be likely to occur from the Preferred Action Alternative.

3.1.1 Climate
The District of Columbia is in the humid subtropical climate zone and has four distinct seasons.
Summers are hot and humid with daily high temperatures in July and August averaging in the high
80 to low 90 degrees Fahrenheit range. Spring and fall are mild with high temperatures in April
and October averaging in the high 60 degrees Fahrenheit. The average temperature in winter is
38 degrees Fahrenheit from mid-December to mid-February. The average annual precipitation
in this area is approximately 40 inches of rain and average snowfall is 16 inches (NOAA, 2012).
The No Action and Preferred Action Alternatives would not impact, nor be affected by, the
climate of the study area. The Preferred Action Alternative is not of a nature or scale to alter
existing climate patterns.

3.1.2 Soils
According to the Soil Surveys for the District of Columbia, there are eight soil associations in
the study area: Chillum-Urban Complex, Glenelg Variant, Manor Loam, Manor-Urban Land
Complex, Urban Land-Chillum Complex, Urban Land-Manor Complex, Udorthents, and
Urban Land (USDA, 1976). The predominant soil associations underlying the study area are
Manor-Urban Land Complex, Urban Land-Chillum Complex, and Urban Land-Manor Complex.
These soil associations are approximately 10 to 50 feet thick over metamorphic bedrock, and
have been disturbed by grading and construction of buildings. These soil associations are
moderately sloping, well drained, silty, and micaceous with a small amount of silty alluvium.

Page 41

Environmental Impact Statement

The permeability of these soil associations is between 0.6 and 2.0 inches per hour. There are no
hydric soils or soils with hydric inclusions in the study area.
The No Action and Preferred Action Alternatives would not impact the remaining undisturbed
soils in the study area as the areas of steep slopes would be protected from further development.

3.1.3 Geology
The study area is along the boundary between the Piedmont Physiographic Province on the
northwest and the Coastal Plain Physiographic Province on the southeast. Bedrock of the Laurel
Formation underlies the study area. The Laurel Formation is a gray, medium- to coarse-grained,
moderately to well-foliated muscovite-biotite-quartz schist and gneiss and contains garnets and
staurolite. Well records indicate that depth to bedrock is greater than 40 feet (Johnston, 1964).
The formation weathers to form deep clayey to silty residual soils. Drillability of the rock is
moderate. Overbreak of the rock during excavation is mostly moderate, but may be excessive
depending on the orientation of excavation to joint systems (USGS, 1967).
No unique engineering constraints to construction are posed by the bedrock geology.
The No Action and Preferred Action Alternatives would not impact the geology of the study
area. The Preferred Alternative consists of the redevelopment of an urban area.

3.2

WATER RESOURCES

3.2.1 Surface Waters

The study area is in the drainage basin of Rock Creek (exhibit 3.1). Rock Creek originates in
Montgomery County, Maryland, flows south through the District of Columbia, and discharges
to the Potomac River approximately five miles south of the study area. Surface runoff in the
study area is collected by overland flow and an extensive storm sewer system and is discharged
to Rock Creek.
The District Department of the Environment (DDOE) groups waters into Beneficial Use Classes.
Rock Creek is classified as a Class B, C, D, and E stream. Class B waters are protected for
secondary contact recreation and aesthetic enjoyment; Class C waters are protected for fish,
shellfish, and wildlife; Class D waters are protected for human health related to consumption of
fish and shellfish; and Class E waters are protected for navigation (DC Municipal Regulations
and DC Register, 2010).
Rock Creek is designated as Special Waters of the District of Columbia (SWDC). Special
waters are those that are of water quality better than needed for the current use or have scenic or
aesthetic importance. The water quality in SWDC designated segments of surface waters shall
be maintained at or above the current level by implementing the following: (a) existing nonpoint
source discharges, stormwater discharges and storm sewer discharges to SWDC segment shall
be controlled through implementation of best management practices and regulator programs; (b)

Page 42

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

construction or development projects in which a SWDC designated segment is located, which
may lead to pollution of the water, shall be permitted on a case-by-case basis to ensure that there
are no long-term adverse water quality effects and that no impairment of the designated uses
of the segment occurs; or (c) short-term degradation of water quality in a SWDC segment due
to construction projects may be permitted provided that prior notice is given to the public and
other local and federal government agencies, and provided that the builder of the construction
project submits a report to the DDOE which summarizes the views, significant comments,
criticisms and suggestions of the public and other local and federal government agencies and sets
forth the specific responses in terms of modifications of the proposed action or an explanation
for rejection of proposals made by the public and other local and federal government agencies
(DCWASA, 2013).
Section 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act and the EPA implementing regulations direct
each state to identify and list waters, known as water quality limited segments, in which current
required controls of a specified substance are inadequate to achieve water quality standards
(WQSs). For each water quality limited segment, the state is to either establish a Total Maximum
Daily Load (TMDL) of the specified substance that the waterbody can receive without violating
WQSs, or demonstrate that WQSs are being met. Rock Creek is listed on the Section 303(d)
list of impaired waters for 2010 and has an established TMDL for bacteria and organics and
metals (DCWASA, 2013).
Rock Creek’s water quality is impaired from sedimentation and other forms of non-point source
pollution and from limited point source pollutants within its highly urbanized watershed. Two
major sources of pollution are stormwater runoff and combined sewer overflows (CSOs); 28
CSOs drain directly into Rock Creek. Those 28 CSOs discharge an estimated 52 million gallons
of untreated water into the creek every year, the majority of which comes from the large CSO
outfall at Piney Branch. These discharges are a major source of damage to Rock Creek. The
District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (DCWASA) has a stormwater discharge permit
issued by the EPA for improving its stormwater management to improve water quality in Rock
Creek. In 2009, the DCWASA began replacing portions of the combined sewer with separate
storm sewers. At the time of this writing, the project is under construction (DCWASA, 2013).
The stormwater drainage system for the site of the former WRAMC and Preferred Action
Alternative consists of catch basins, curb inlets, yard drains, manholes, sand filters, and 10- to
approximately 36-inch-diameter pipelines that discharge to the District of Columbia’s Luzon
Avenue storm drainage tunnel. The tunnel, which enters the site of the former WRAMC at
Georgia Avenue and Dahlia Street, runs southwest under the Rose Garden and discharges into
Rock Creek Park.
The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires federal agencies to provide national
leadership to reduce water quality problems from stormwater runoff. Section 438 specifically
mentions that projects “….involving a federal facility with a footprint that exceeds 5,000 square
feet shall use site planning, design, construction, and maintenance strategies for the property to

Page 43

Environmental Impact Statement

maintain or restore, to the maximum extent technically feasible, the predevelopment hydrology
of the property with regard to the temperature, rate, volume, and duration of flow.”
The No Action Alternative would not impact surface waters.
The Preferred Action Alternative would not impact surface waters. The water quantity controls
for the Preferred Action Alternative would be in accordance with the District of Columbia
Stormwater Management Guidelines and with Section 438 of the Energy Independence and
Security Act of 2007.
Stormwater would be managed on-site at each individual chancery and on the site as a whole,
including potential grey water re-use and bio-retention gardens. The stormwater system for road
infrastructure would connect to the District of Columbia system.
The Preferred Action Alternative would not be allowed to increase the peak rate of stormwater
runoff. The Preferred Action Alternative would be required to reduce the developed peak
flows to predevelopment conditions through detention, reuse, and low impact development. To
accommodate the infrastructure improvements outside of individual lots (i.e., roads, walks, open
space, etc.); detention/water quality improvement areas would be designated adjacent to roads.
With the incorporation of rainwater harvesting and water quality improvement measures into the
network, peak discharge quantities can be controlled and managed to satisfy local regulations.
Each individual parcel would be required to address stormwater requirements either via an
independent facility or a centralized facility.
The stormwater management practices that would be implemented as part of the Preferred Action
Alternative would have a long-term indirect beneficial impact on surface water by reducing
stormwater runoff, improving water quality, and helping to comply with the TMDLs established
for metals and bacteria.

3.2.2 Groundwater
Groundwater movement in the bedrock is primarily through secondary openings such as faults,
joints, and bedding and cleavage planes. The water table is generally less than 50 feet in depth
and unconfined. Well yields in the Laurel Formation range from 0.8 to 30 gallons per minute
(gpm) and average 10 gpm. The average well depth is 198 feet. There are no known private well
users in the study area (Johnston, 1964).
The No Action and Preferred Action Alternatives would not impact groundwater. The proposed
action under the Preferred Alternative consists of the redevelopment of an urban area.

3.2.3 Floodplains
Federal protection of floodplains is afforded by Executive Order (EO) 11988, “Floodplain
Management,” and implemented under 44 CFR 9.00. These regulations direct federal agencies

Page 44

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

to undertake actions to avoid impacts on floodplain areas by structures built in flood-prone
areas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has primary responsibility for
identifying flood-prone areas.
According to FEMA, the western portion of the study area along Rock Creek is prone to inundation
by a 100-year flood (i.e., an area that has a one percent chance of becoming inundated by peak
flows during a given year) (exhibit 3.1).
The No Action and Preferred Action Alternatives would not impact floodplains and would be
in compliance with EO 11988. The Preferred Action Alternative does not propose to construct
structures in flood-prone areas.

3.3

VEGETATION

The study area has a diversity of vegetation. A detailed tree inventory of the area potentially affected
by the Preferred Action Alternative was performed in late winter of 2013 and approximately
700 trees were identified and the tree sizes were recorded by diameter at breast height (dbh)
measured 4.5 feet above the ground (exhibit 3.2).
The removal of trees in the District of Columbia is regulated by the Urban Forest Preservation
Act of 2002. The act was passed by the Council of the District of Columbia and is administered
by the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) through its Urban Forestry Administration.
The purpose of the act is to protect the District of Columbia urban forest on both public and
private land. Trees with a circumference of 55 inches or more are classed as special trees. Special
trees cannot be cut down, topped or destroyed without a permit issued by the Mayor’s office and
mitigated using one of two options (DDOT, 2013):
1. Replacement trees using the formula:
Inches of circumference ÷ 3.14(pi) = Inches in diameter
Inches in diameter ÷ 2 inches = number of two-inch caliper replacement trees
2. Monetary payment to the Tree Fund of $35 per inch of circumference.
The regulation requires that an International Society of Arboriculture Certified Arborist inspects
each tree and makes a determination as to the quality of the tree. Trees designated as hazardous
or in poor quality do not typically need to be mitigated. As a federal agency, DOS is not required
to comply with this District of Columbia regulation; however, DOS will emphasize retaining
the tree canopy in the development of the site.
The wooded areas are second growth forests, as original forest no longer exists. These areas
contain vegetation common to the region and are predominantly composed of mature Oak and
Tulip Poplar trees. Many of them are more than 100 years old and measure 50 inches in dbh
(exhibit 3.2). Native trees consist of Red Oak, Tulip Poplar, Red Maple, American Elm, American
Holly, Black Walnut, Black Cherry, Hickory, and Southern Magnolia.

The understory in the wooded areas consists of shrubs, poor quality turf, and dense patches of
invasive species. Frequently encountered invasive species are English Ivy, Winged Euonymus,
Norway Maple, and Mock Orange. None of these areas contain native understory; only the
overstory is characteristic of a native canopy and forest cover.
The eastern portion of the area potentially affected by the Preferred Action Alternative is
maintained landscape. While the majority of this vegetation has been planted within the last 20
years, a few areas of mature vegetation remain. Consistent with practices of the International
Society of Aboriculture, the tree inventory did not identify individual trees in this area less than
8-inch dbh. Species in this area consist of Red Maple, Kousa Dogwood, London Plane Tree,
American Holly, American Linden, Pin Oak, Willow Oak, Loblolly Pine, Bradford Pear, and
Kwanzan Cherry.
Along areas of the western and northern perimeters of the area potentially affected by the
Preferred Action Alternative, evergreen species have been planted for screening. The evergreen
species are predominantly Eastern Hemlock trees but also consist of Leyland Cypress, Black
Pine, and Eastern White Pine.
The No Action Alternative would not impact vegetation.
The Preferred Action Alternative includes the preservation of a considerable number of Special
Trees providing canopy coverage and a 50-foot wide vegetative buffer along Alaska Avenue
and Fern Street. The Preferred Action Alternative would impact vegetation by removing trees.

3.4

WILDLIFE

Wildlife in the study area is limited to those species adapted to living in an urban environment.
Species of birds typical of urban settings consist of the House Sparrow, Bluejay, European
Starling, Northern Cardinal, Common Crow, Gray Catbird, Mockingbird, Mourning Dove, and
pigeon. Mammal species common to urban environments consist of the Eastern Gray Squirrel,
mice, rats, opossum and raccoons.
The No Action Alternative would not impact wildlife. The Preferred Action Alternative would not
permanently impact wildlife because it consists of the redevelopment of an urban site. Species
found in the study area are adapted to the urban environment. Some wildlife may be temporarily
displaced by construction activities.

3.5 THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES AND
SPECIES OF CONSERVATION CONCERN
The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended, provides protection for those
species that are listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA. The ESA grants the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service (USFWS) prime responsibility in administering the species designations and
protections granted under the Act. “Endangered” means that a species is in danger of extinction

Page 47

Environmental Impact Statement

throughout all or a significant portion of its range. “Threatened” means that a species is likely
to become endangered in the foreseeable future.
“Critical habitat” is a term defined and used in the ESA to designate a specific geographic area(s)
that is essential for the conservation of a threatened or endangered species and that may require
special management and protection. Critical habitat may include an area that is not currently
occupied by the species but would be needed for its recovery.
The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668-668c) enacted in 1940 protects bald
and golden eagles. The Act prohibits anyone, without a permit issued by the Secretary of the
Interior, from “taking” bald and golden eagles, including their parts, nests, or eggs. The Act
defines take as “pursue, shoot, shoot at, poison, wound, kill, capture, trap, collect, molest, or
disturb.” According to the USFWS, bald eagles have the potential to occur within the study area.
In addition to immediate impacts, this definition covers impacts that result from human-induced
alterations initiated around a previously used nest site during a time when eagles are not present
if, on the eagle’s return, such alterations agitate or bother an eagle to a degree that interferes
with or interrupts normal breeding, feeding, or sheltering habits and causes injury, death, or nest
abandonment (USFWS, 2013).
According to the USFWS, the Hay’s Spring amphipod is listed as endangered in the District of
Columbia (USFWS, 2012). The Hay’s Spring amphipod is a federally endangered species that is
endemic to the springs of Rock Creek Park. There is little known about the biology, population
dynamics, or ecological community of this amphipod. It spends its life in a shallow groundwater
zone, moving in water that percolates among sand grains and gravel until it is flushed out by
large volumes of water into a spring.
According to the DDOE, there are no threatened or endangered species, and no ecologically
sensitive habitats in the study area (DDOE, 2012).
The No Action and Preferred Action Alternatives would not impact threatened and endangered
species, species of conservation concern, protected species, or critical habitat (USFWS, 2013;
DDOE, 2012).

3.6

TRANSPORTATION

3.6.1 Vehicle Traffic
3.6.1.1 Streets
The streets in the study area are designed as a grid pattern, with a few roads that bisect the
network diagonally. Intersections are at regular intervals and most streets in the study area provide
two-way travel. The street network provides good traffic circulation throughout the study area,
allowing for multiple routing options for drivers and dispersing vehicles.
The primary streets in the study area:

Page 48

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

13th Street is a two-lane north-south local road that is bisected by the former WRAMC, connecting
with Fern Street to the north and Aspen Street to the south. Average daily traffic volumes for
13th Street are not available. Limited parking is available along both sides of the street.
14th Street is a two-lane north-south road that passes through the former WRAMC. South of
Aspen Street, 14th Street is classified as a minor arterial with a dedicated bicycle lane in each
travel direction. Average daily traffic volumes along this portion of 14th Street are approximately
6,100 vehicles per day southbound. North of Alaska Avenue, 14th Street is a two-lane local road
with an average daily traffic volume of 2,700 vehicles. A portion of 14th Street south of Alaska
Avenue traverses the former WRAMC to Main Drive.
16th Street is a four-lane north-south principal arterial that borders a portion of the western
edge of the former WRAMC. It has an average daily traffic volume of 31,000 vehicles per day
south of Aspen Street. 16th Street has a median, which is converted into center left-turn lanes
at several intersections. Limited parking is available along both sides of the street, although
parking is generally prohibited during peak hours.
Alaska Avenue is a four-lane northeast-southwest principal arterial that borders the northwestern
edge of the former WRAMC. It has an average daily traffic volume of 4,700 vehicles per day
north of Fern Street. Limited parking is available along both sides of the street.
Aspen Street is a two-lane east-west road that borders the southern edge of the former WRAMC.
West of Georgia Avenue, Aspen Street is classified as a minor arterial with an average daily
traffic volume of 4,700 vehicles per day near its intersection with 16th Street. East of Georgia
Avenue, the street is classified as a minor arterial with an average daily traffic volume of 3,600
vehicles. On-street parking is available along both sides of Aspen Street.
Dahlia Street is a two-lane east-west local road that runs through the former WRAMC. It has
an average daily traffic volume of 2,200 vehicles east of Piney Branch Road. Limited parking
is available along both sides of the street.
Fern Street is a two-lane east-west local road that borders the northern edge of the former
WRAMC. It has an average daily traffic volume of 2,200 vehicles near its intersection with 16th
Street and 1,000 vehicles per day near its intersection with Georgia Avenue. Limited parking is
available along both sides of the street.
Georgia Avenue is a four-lane north-south principal arterial that borders the eastern edge of
the former WRAMC. It has an average daily traffic volume of 27,100 vehicles south of Aspen
Street. Georgia Avenue has a wide right-most lane to accommodate heavy vehicle traffic along
the corridor. Limited parking is available along both sides of the street, but parking is generally
prohibited at these locations during peak hours.

Page 49

Environmental Impact Statement

Luzon Avenue is a two-lane northeast-southwest local road in the southern part of the study area.
Average daily traffic volumes for Luzon Street are not available. Limited parking is available
along both sides of the street.
Access to the former WRAMC was provided through gates; several of these gates have been
closed following the relocation of the WRAMC. Currently, only the gate at 16th Street and Main
Drive is operational and provides access to the remaining on-site uses.
On-street parking is provided throughout the study area along all streets. Most parking spaces
require residential parking permits, though some spaces are metered or unregulated. Other
on-street parking is generally prohibited during peak periods (typically 7:00 to 9:30 am and
4:00 to 6:30 pm) but unregulated during off-peak periods.
Vehicular access for the Preferred Action Alternative would be provided at four intersections
along the border of the former WRAMC and at the Dahlia Street and Main Drive entrances
to the DC-LRA. The proposed access points correspond to previously used, and now closed,
access locations from the former WRAMC. The Dahlia Street access point at Alaska Avenue
was closed by the Army in 2001, but the plan proposes that this be reopened.
Two entrances/exits to the Preferred Action Alternative are provided along Alaska Avenue, one
along Fern Street, and one along 16th Street. The driveways would be stop-controlled, with the
exception of the one provided along 16th Street.
Access points where bus service is anticipated would be designed to Washington Metropolitan
Area Transit Authority (WMATA) guidelines.
The No Action Alternative would not impact parking.
The Preferred Action Alternative would require that a majority of parking be provided in
below-grade lots. Existing buildings that are reused would be required to develop independent
below-grade parking solutions and new buildings would need to incorporate parking within their
lot in below-grade structures. Under the Preferred Alternative, on-street parking within internal
FMC roadways would not be permitted. Current parking allowances on internal FMC roadways
would be removed upon implementation of the Preferred Action Alternative.

3.6.1.2

Existing and Projected Demand

The existing conditions in and around the former WRAMC were characterized to provide a
foundation for assessing the transportation implications of the Preferred Action Alternative. This
was determined by examining the peak traffic hours. The “peak hour” represents the worst-case
scenario, when the system traffic volumes are the highest. The use of a typical weekday morning
and afternoon peak hours are used to ensure that conclusions regarding adverse impacts and
their respective mitigation measures would apply to the vast majority of time roads are used.

Page 50

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

Traffic counts were conducted at 13 intersections between the hours of 6:30 and 9:30 a.m. and
between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday and Wednesday, December 6–7, 2011 (traffic counts
will be updated in the spring of 2014). Additional traffic volumes were collected on Tuesday
and Wednesday, June 5–6, 2012. Each of these count dates represent typical weekdays when the
District of Columbia public school systems were in session. These typical weekdays represent
time periods that include normal operation for other major traffic generators in the study area
(exhibit 3.3).
The No Action Alternative includes the traffic generated by other developments near the study
area and inherent growth on the roads. Growth from these two sources was added to the existing
traffic volumes to determine the traffic projections for the future No Action Alternative.
The DC-LRA development would generate approximately 1,916 and 2,197 trips during the
morning and afternoon peak hours, respectively (exhibit 3.4). Other developments near the
former WRAMC that would be completed by 2032 consist of:
◊

The Walmart on Georgia Avenue – 5929 Georgia Avenue

◊

Beacon Center (new mixed use development) – 6100 Georgia Avenue

◊

Takoma Central (new apartment building) – 235-255 Carroll Street

◊

Takoma Park (new apartment buildings) – 6924 Willow Street

Trips generated by the other developments were estimated using the methodology outlined in
Institute of Transportation Engineers’ (ITE) Trip Generation, 8th Edition. In addition to the other
developments, other traffic increases due to inherent growth on the streets were accounted for
with a 0.5 percent per year growth rate compounded annually. This rate was estimated based
on a comparison between existing and past average annual weekday traffic volumes obtained
from DDOT for 2006–2009. This growth rate was applied to streets and intersections, with the
exception of turning movements entering and exiting the former WRAMC at the intersection
of 16th Street and Main Drive.
The traffic volumes generated by other developments and the inherent growth were added to the
existing (2012) traffic volumes to establish the future (2032) traffic volumes for the No Action
Alternative (exhibit 3.5).
Trip generation for the chanceries was estimated based on existing traffic volumes collected
adjacent to the ICC.
Due to the ICC’s proximity to the Van Ness–UDC Metrorail Station (one quarter to one half
of a mile, depending on the chancery), it is likely that a significant number of trips occur via
transit. As transit ridership information is not available for the ICC, data was obtained from the
WMATA Ridership Survey. It is anticipated that the mode split of the chanceries would operate

similar to an office development. As a result, the commute mode share at office sites as listed
in the WMATA study was used. However, no office sites reviewed in the WMATA Ridership
Survey are near the Van Ness–UDC Metrorail station, so comparable data from two office sites
near the Friendship Heights Metrorail Station was selected.
The two office sites selected from the WMATA Ridership Survey have an automobile mode
share of 67 percent and 57 percent. To provide a conservative estimate, it was estimated that
the ICC would have an automobile mode share of 57 percent, which was used to extrapolate the
total number of trips generated by the ICC. Based on this mode share, the total number of trips
generated by the ICC was calculated to be approximately 296 inbound and 53 outbound (349
total) during the morning peak hour and 256 inbound and 318 outbound (574 total) during the
afternoon peak hour, without transit use.
The total trip generation estimates for the ICC were used to project the trip generation for the
FMC. The total number of trips generated by the ICC was grown based on a ratio of the total
square footage of the FMC (approximately 1.26 million SF) to the total square footage of
the ICC (approximately 1.1 million SF). This calculation yields a total of approximately 340
inbound and 60 outbound (400 total) trips during the morning peak hour and 293 inbound and
364 outbound (657 total) trips during the afternoon peak hour for the FMC, without transit use
(exhibits 3.6 and 3.7).
Existing traffic volumes and travel patterns were analyzed to determine the trip distribution
for the trips added by the Preferred Action Alternative. The traffic volumes for the Preferred
Action Alternative were calculated by adding the development-generated traffic volumes to
the future (2032) for the No Action Alternative. Thus, the future condition for the Preferred
Action Alternative includes traffic generated by existing volumes, the growth percentage, other
development, and the proposed action (exhibit 3.8).
A software program (Synchro Version 7.0) was used to analyze the intersections in the study
area. The results of the capacity analyses are expressed in delay (seconds per vehicle) for each
approach. The capacity analyses were based on: 1) peak hour traffic volumes; 2) lane use and
traffic controls; and 3) Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) methodologies (using Synchro 7

software). The HCM does not give guidelines for calculating the average delay for a two-way
stop-controlled intersection, as the approaches without stop signs would technically have no
delay (exhibit 3.9).
The Preferred Action Alternative was considered to have an impact at an intersection if the
capacity analyses showed a delay greater than 80 seconds at an intersection or along an approach
with the proposed action where one does not exist in the future conditions for the No Action
Alternative. This condition would exist at the intersection of 16th Street and Main Drive.
Exhibit 3.10 summarizes the results of the capacity analyses for those locations and scenarios
with considerable delays (greater than 80 seconds).

The northbound delays at this intersection are due to the addition of site
traffic as well as existing timing and lane configurations. Constructing
a 50-foot northbound right turn lane and retiming the signal during the
afternoon peak period would alleviate the delay and allow the intersection
and approach to operate under acceptable conditions during the total future
afternoon scenario. The District of Columbia and DOS should coordinate
the installation of a 50-foot northbound right-turn lane as well as an
updated signal timing to ensure the most efficient operation in the future
following the construction of the FMC Master Plan.

The NB and overall intersection delays at this intersection are due to the
existing timing and lane configurations. The addition of the background
growth, trips generated by the background developments, and the
site-generated trips exacerbates the existing failing operation on the NB
approach. Constructing a 200-foot NB right-turn lane would alleviate the
delay and allow the intersection and approach to operate under acceptable
conditions during all scenarios. The intersection does not operate under
acceptable conditions in the morning peak hour due to the addition of the
trips generated by the Preferred Action Alternative. Retiming the intersection
improves operation and allows all approaches to operate under acceptable
conditions. The District of Columbia and DOS should coordinate the
retiming of the signal to ensure the most efficient operation in the future.

The EB and WB delays at this intersection during the afternoon peak period
are due to the existing timing and lane configurations. The addition of the
background growth, trips generated by the background developments, and
the site-generated trips exacerbates the existing poor conditions on the EB
and WB approaches. Retiming the intersection alleviates the poor conditions
during the afternoon peak period. Additionally, an all-red phase should be
added during the morning and afternoon peak periods in the existing and
background conditions. The addition of traffic generated by the background
developments during the morning peak period causes the intersection to
operate under poor conditions. These delays are mitigated by constructing
a 70-foot SB right-turn lane extended from the existing bus lay-by, as well
as retiming the intersection. Even with these improvements, the intersection
does not operate under acceptable conditions in the afternoon peak hour due
to the addition of the trips generated by the Preferred Action Alternative.
Retiming the intersection improves the operation and allows all approaches
to operate under acceptable conditions. The District of Columbia and DOS
should coordinate the retiming of the signal to ensure the most efficient
operation in the future.

The EB delays on Aspen Street at this intersection are due to the existing
timing and lane configurations. The addition of the background growth, trips
generated by the background developments, and the site-generated trips
exacerbates the existing failing operation on the EB approach. This delay can
be mitigated by removing approximately 200-feet of on-street parking on
Aspen Street to allow for separate left-turn and through/right-turn lanes. This
intersection would be studied as WRAMC is redeveloped to determine if
additional improvements are necessary.

The delays at this intersection are due to the existing split-phase timing at
these two intersections, which are controlled by one controller. The addition
of the background growth, trips generated by the background developments,
and the site-generated trips exacerbates the existing failing operation.
Removing the split phase and retiming the signal while maintaining existing
pedestrian minimum green times will allow the intersection and approach to
operate under acceptable conditions during all scenarios, with the exception
of the southbound approach of 16th St. during the afternoon peak in the total
future scenario. The District of Columbia and DOS should coordinate the
update of the signal timing and future lane configurations to ensure the
most efficient operation in the future following the construction of the
FMC Mast Plan.
The northbound delays along Piney Branch Rd. are due to the addition of
the site-generated traffic at the intersection. Due to the proposed addition
of all-way stop control included in the Transportation Impact Study for the
DC-LRA Reuse Plan, the northbound approach operates under unacceptable
conditions during the afternoon peak hour in the total future conditions.
However, no improvements are recommended in conjunction with the FMC
Master Plan. Additional turn lanes do not improve the operation of the
intersection, however, a traffic signal could. A signal warrant analysis should
be performed at full build-out of the site to determine if a new signal may
be warranted. It is recommended that this intersection be closely studied
after the FMC Master Plan has been implemented in order to determine if
additional mitigation measures are necessary.

The delays at this intersection are due to the addition of the site-generated
traffic at the intersection. However, constructing a 50-foot westbound right
turn lane allows it to operate under acceptable conditions. The District of
Columbia and DOS should coordinate the update of the signal timing to
ensure the most efficient operation in the future following construction
of the FMC Master Plan. Additionally, this intersection should be closely
studied after the FMC Master plan has been implemented in order to
determine if additional mitigation measures are necessary.

3.6.1.3

Heavy Vehicles

Heavy vehicle accessibility to the former WRAMC is intended to occur from Georgia Avenue
and 16th Street. Given these access points, each of the driveways along Georgia Avenue and
16th Street would be required to be designed to meet DDOT acceptable standards for heavy
vehicle accessibility including providing adequate turning radii, limiting visual impediments,
and ensuring traffic does not oppose vehicles entering and exiting the former WRAMC. The
DDOT guidelines for restricting backing maneuvers to or from publicly maintained roads,
providing loading services within alleys where available, and sharing loading access with
vehicular driveways would be followed.
The No Action Alternative would not impact heavy vehicle operations.
The Preferred Action Alternative would increase travel by heavy vehicles. Service for trash,
recycling, and deliveries would occur regularly. Overall, many of the heavy vehicle operations
would occur with a standard single unit vehicle, but the Preferred Action Alternative would need
to account for access by larger articulated vehicles.
In support of the Preferred Action Alternative, DOS would perform the following to improve
heavy vehicle operations:
◊

Heavy vehicle traffic should be limited on local streets by providing a Transportation
Management Plan for the development which would instruct deliveries and loading
operations to the approved heavy vehicle corridors through this portion of the District
of Columbia.

◊

Ensure construction of internal roadways are built to conformance with DDOT standards
and would support the necessary heavy vehicles anticipated to travel the roadway system.

◊

Design pertinent intersections to support the turning maneuvers for the largest design
vehicle expected to visit the FMC.

◊

Loading operations for buildings would be designed to occur from dedicated receiving and
loading areas that are screened from the primary streets. These operations would require
heavy vehicles to pull-in and pull-out of any loading area. Backing along sidewalks or
crosswalks would not be permitted.

3.6.1.4

Car-Sharing

Car-sharing is provided in the District of Columbia and the study area by Zipcar. Available
vehicles are primarily adjacent to the Takoma Metrorail Station. Zipcar is a private company
that allows registered users to reserve cars for a minimum of 30 minutes up to several days
(exhibit 3.11).
The No Action and Preferred Action Alternatives would not impact car-sharing.

3.6.2 Crash Analysis
A safety analysis was performed using DDOT accident data from 2008 to 2010 to determine if
there was a high accident rate at intersections in the study area. This data included all signalized
intersections adjacent to the former WRAMC, except for intersections that previously operated as
WRAMC gates. For intersections, the accident rate is measured in accidents per million-entering
vehicles (MEV) (exhibit 3.12).
According to the ITE’s Transportation Impact Analysis, an accident rate of 1.0 or higher is an
indication that further study is required. A crash rate over 1.0 does not necessarily mean there
is a substantial problem at an intersection, but rather it is a threshold used to identify which
intersections may have higher crash rates due to operational, geometric, or other issues. The
four intersections with crash rates over 1.0 are:
◊

Georgia Avenue & Van Buren Street – The majority of crashes at this intersection were
sideswiped vehicles and rear end crashes. Sideswipe crashes can often occur when a
vehicle going straight through an intersection makes a last-second lane change to get
around a vehicle waiting for a gap to make a left turn from a shared through/left lane; as
is the case in this location since it does not have separate turning lanes. Elevated rear-end
collision rates are typical at intersections controlled by a traffic signal. A significant
number of crashes involving pedestrians were observed.

◊

Georgia Avenue & Aspen Street – The majority of crashes at this intersection were
sideswiped vehicles and rear end crashes.

◊

Georgia Avenue & Dahlia Street – The majority of crashes at this intersection were rear
end crashes, with 12 of the 27 crashes classified in this way. A significant number of
crashes involving pedestrians were observed as well.

◊

Georgia Avenue & Geranium Street – The crash report data shows a high number of rear
end and sideswipe crashes. Potential reasons for these crashes are the high volume of
vehicular activity at this intersection, the high amount of turning traffic, and the lack of
turn lanes on Georgia Avenue.

The No Action and Preferred Action Alternatives would not change commuting patterns or
operations or geometry of these intersections which would result in no changes to the crash rates
in the study area. However, the changes introduced by the Preferred Action Alternative would
have an impact on pedestrian crossings of Georgia Avenue and 16th Street. As the crash data
shows pedestrian crashes at a number of intersections along Georgia Avenue and 16th Street,
DOS would coordinate with the DDOT to consider adding leading pedestrian intervals to the
signalized intersections.

3.6.3 Transit Service
The former WRAMC is served by heavy rail and local bus service. These transit services
provide local, city-wide, and regional transit connections and link the former WRAMC with
major cultural, residential, employment, and commercial destinations throughout the region
(exhibit 3.13).

3.6.3.1

Metrorail Service

The Takoma Station, a multimodal transportation hub on the Metrorail Red Line, is the closest
Metrorail station. Located approximately one mile from the former WRAMC, the station portal is
at Cedar Street/Carroll Street immediately west of Eastern Avenue. Approximately 58 short-term
metered parking spaces, 38 bike racks, 60 bike lockers, 9 bus bays, and 4 car-sharing spaces
available at the station were counted.
The Metrorail Red Line connects the former WRAMC to Silver Spring and Glenmont, Maryland,
to the north and to downtown Washington, DC, Union Station, Chinatown/Gallery Place, and
Metro Center to the south. Trains run frequently during the morning and afternoon peak hours,
approximately every three minutes during weekday peak hours, 5–6 minutes during weekday
non-peak hour, every 12–15 minutes on weekday evenings after 7:00 p.m., and 5–15 minutes
on the weekends.

3.6.3.2

Metrobus Service

The former WRAMC is serviced by six Metrobus lines with nine distinct routes. Bus stops are
along streets adjacent to the former WRAMC, including 16th Street, Alaska Avenue, Aspen
Street, and Georgia Avenue, and other streets within two or three blocks.
The 14th Street Line (Routes 52, 53, and 54) provides service along 14th Street to the south.
They operate between Takoma Station, Butternut Street, Aspen Street, 14th Street, and L’Enfant
Plaza. The routes make stops adjacent to the former WRAMC on Georgia Avenue, Aspen Street,
and 14th Street. Buses run every 10-20 minutes and approximately every 30 minutes in the late
evening and early morning.
The Georgia Avenue Metro Extra Line (Route 79) provides limited-stop bus service along
Georgia Avenue in the study area and runs from the Silver Spring Metrorail station (Red Line)
to the Archives-Navy Memorial/Penn Quarter Metrorail station (Yellow and Green Lines) and
serves four Metrorail stations. Buses run every 10–12 minutes on weekdays from 6:00 am to
7:00 pm. Although this bus has limited-stop service, it stops adjacent to the former WRAMC
at Dahlia Street.
The Georgia Avenue-7th Street Line (Line 70) runs the same route of the Metro Extra Route 79,
though it continues to the L’Enfant Plaza Metrorail station (Yellow, Green, Blue, and Orange
Lines), Waterfront Metrorail station (Green Line), and Fort McNair. It has frequent stops along
Georgia Avenue in the study area. Buses operate every 10–15 minutes and approximately every
30 minutes in the late evening and early morning.
The 16th Street Express (Route S9) has limited stops along 16th Street in the study area,
connecting the Silver Spring Metrorail station, Columbia Heights Metrorail station (Yellow and
Green Lines), and McPherson Square Metrorail station (Blue and Orange Lines). The closest
Metrobus stop to the south is at Somerset Place, approximately 1/3 mile from the southwest
corner of the former WRAMC. The closest stop to the north is at Kalmia Road, which is less
than a half mile from the northeast corner of the former WRAMC. Service is provided every 10
minutes from 6:30 am to 10:00 am and 3:00 pm to 7:00 pm on weekdays.
The 16th Street Lines (Routes S2 and S4) connect the Silver Spring Metrorail station to the north
and Federal Triangle Metrorail station (Blue and Orange Lines) to the south. Both lines travel
along 16th Street; however, the S2 travels along Alaska Avenue south of the former WRAMC
and Eastern Avenue north of the former WRAMC. Both lines have headways of approximately
every 15 to 20 minutes on weekdays and weekends.
The Deal Junior High School Line (Route D31) only operates Monday through Friday when
public schools are open. The bus runs once in the morning peak (7:45 am) and once in the
afternoon (3:55 pm). This line runs along 16th Street in the study area and connects to Deal
Junior High School at Nebraska Avenue and Fort Drive.

3.6.3.3

Future Transit Service

DDOT has developed a plan to identify transit challenges and opportunities and to recommend
investments. This is outlined in the DC’s Transit Future System Plan published by DDOT in
April 2010. This plan includes the reestablishment of streetcar service throughout the District
of Columbia and in the vicinity of the Preferred Action Alternative.
The streetcar system plan includes one route that travels along Georgia Avenue and Butternut
Street. The future planned route named the “Takoma Metrorail Station to Buzzard Point Line”,
would connect the former WRAMC to areas in the District of Columbia including Buzzard Point,
Southwest Waterfront, Chinatown, Metro Center, U Street, and the Georgia Avenue corridor. The
Takoma Metrorail Station to Buzzard Point Line is projected to be completed in 2020. Given that
redevelopment is expected to attract many transit riders, an orphan line which initially would not
connect to the remaining streetcar network is being considered, connecting the former WRAMC
to the Takoma, Silver Spring or Georgia Avenue Metrorail stations. This connection would likely
require a dedicated streetcar maintenance facility within the former WRAMC.
The Metro Extra limited-stop bus service element of the plan includes one new route (Route
59) that travels near the former WRAMC along 14th Street. The new limited-stop bus service
would consist of high-frequency buses using specially marked vehicles, operated by WMATA,
which would supplement the four Metro Extra routes that operate along Georgia Avenue, 16th
Street, Wisconsin Avenue, and Pennsylvania Avenue.
The future planned corridor near the former WRAMC is along 14th Street, which would connect
the Takoma Metrorail Station, Aspen Street, WRAMC, Columbia Heights, the U Street corridor
and Downtown at Pennsylvania Avenue. Metro Extra runs along Georgia Avenue as Route 79.
The District of Columbia Circulator plans to provide service as part of its long term (Fiscal
Year (FY) 2019-2020) planning efforts. The added service would connect Tenleytown to Silver
Spring by way of Rock Creek Park and Georgia Avenue. While a formal route has yet to be
determined, this Circulator is planned to provide enhanced bus service to the upper Northwest
portions of the District of Columbia.
The No Action Alternative would not impact transit services.
The Preferred Action Alternative would increase use in both Metrorail and Metrobus. In support
of the Preferred Action Alternative, DOS would perform the following to increase transit usage:

Page 70

◊

Coordinate with DDOT and the LRA Reuse Plan team on future streetcar and other
long-term transit improvements;

◊

During the development, review transit facilities along 16th Street and Alaska Avenue
for potential improvements and consolidation;

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

◊

As part of the planning process between DDOT, WMATA, and the LRA development
team, provide assistance in the service modification for transit lines and streetcar servicing
the streets interior to WRAMC; and

◊

In locations where available and appropriate, coordinate with WMATA to provide bus
shelters, bus stops and layover areas along the boundary of FMC and within and along
the boundary of former WRAMC.

3.6.4 Pedestrian Facilities
Most pedestrians accessing the former WRAMC arrive from adjacent residential neighborhoods
to the north and south, bus stops along 16th Street and Georgia Avenue, or from the Takoma
Metrorail Station. Nearly all streets in the study area have sidewalks, planted buffers between
sidewalks and the curb, and on-street parking that provide an additional buffer between pedestrians
and vehicular traffic. Existing deficiencies are along Aspen Street which provides sidewalks only
in sections along the southern portion of the road and Luzon Avenue which does not provide
sidewalks on the eastern side of the road.
A range of pedestrian facilities exist in the study area adjacent to the former WRAMC. Crosswalks,
curb ramps, and pedestrian signal heads with countdown displays are provided at some signalized
intersections. Many unsignalized intersections have crosswalks and curb ramps. Along 16th Street
between Aspen Street and Alaska Avenue, most intersections have crosswalks and curb ramps
for north-south movements and a crosswalk on either the north or south side of the intersection
for pedestrians crossing 16th Street. Sidewalks, crosswalks, and curb ramps are provided along
Georgia Avenue in the study area. The sidewalk along the western side of Georgia Avenue is in
poor condition; walking conditions along Fern Street and Alaska Avenue are similar.
At intersections along Aspen Street, crosswalks and curb ramps are provided for east-west
movements on the south side of the street. Most of the intersections along Aspen Street do not
accommodate north-south movements because there are no sidewalks along the north side of
Aspen Street despite the presence of bus stops on the northern side of the street.
The Takoma Metrorail station is approximately one mile from the former WRAMC. The bus
stops along Georgia Avenue and 16th Street serve bus routes that provide local and express
service between the study area and Silver Spring to the north and downtown Washington, DC,
to the south. Pedestrians access these bus stops along the local pedestrian network that borders
the former WRAMC and within the residential neighborhoods adjacent to the former WRAMC.
There is some pedestrian activity between the residential neighborhoods and the former WRAMC
and the Takoma Metrorail station. However, pedestrians must navigate around the former
WRAMC if they are traveling between neighborhoods to the west and the Takoma station.
Georgia Avenue is the primary commercial corridor within the study area. Commercial activities
are concentrated north of Fern Street and south of Van Buren Street. There is pedestrian activity
through the study area due to these commercial uses, primarily during the midday lunch period

Page 71

Environmental Impact Statement

and evening dinner period. Additionally, as part of future improvements along Aspen Street
provided in conjunction with the DC-LRA Reuse Plan, improved pedestrian facilities along
the north side of the street would be completed by connecting Georgia Avenue to 16th Street.
The No Action Alternative would not impact pedestrian facilities.
The Preferred Action Alternative would add to pedestrian traffic in the study area. In support
of the Preferred Action Alternative, DOS would perform the following to improve pedestrian
facilities:
◊

Improve pedestrian conditions along east-west and north-south pedestrian routes within
the FMC. Recommended improvements include expanding sidewalk widths, removing
obstructions, installing and upgrading crosswalks at intersections, and installing traffic
calming measures, such as speed tables, decorative pavers, bulb outs at intersections, and
the like. These would include improving pedestrian accessibility at the reopened gates
and in the open spaces areas along 16th Street, Alaska Avenue, Fern Street, Georgia
Avenue, and Aspen Street.

◊

Add east-west and north-south pedestrian connections through the FMC to provide
better access and routing between the FMC and the surrounding neighborhood. New
routing options and crossing locations would help disperse pedestrian traffic, which
would mitigate the impact of increased pedestrian volumes to any one intersection or
sidewalk segment. It would reduce the need to make significant changes to intersections
that would attract additional pedestrian volumes warranting new traffic control devices
or changes to intersection geometry.

3.6.5 Bicycle Facilities
The former WRAMC is served by multi-use trails, signed bicycle routes, and local streets that
accommodate cycling. The bicycle network generally provides good conditions for local trips
and there are several routes for trips between the study area and Silver Spring, Takoma Park,
and other destinations in Northwest Washington, DC.
There are multi-use trails within cycling distance of the site, including the Metropolitan Branch
Trail, which links Silver Spring and Union Station, and the Rock Creek Parkway Trail, which
connects Maryland with the Georgetown waterfront and the National Mall. These facilities foster
good cycling conditions for bicycle commuting and recreational riding. Some major destinations
within a three mile ride include Columbia Heights and Chevy Chase Circle. It is approximately
1.75 miles to Silver Spring and 2.5 miles to the Georgia Avenue Metrorail stations.
Bicycle activity is highest along the multi-use trails and streets with designated bike lanes.
Multi-use trails and bike lanes encourage cycling by providing separate facilities that give
cyclists an elevated sense of safety due to increased visibility and designated pathways. The
highest observed bicycle volumes in the study area were along 16th Street and Georgia Avenue.

Page 72

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

Cyclists typically use street signs, parking meters, or similar objects to secure their bicycles.
Most of the bicycle traffic on 16th Street was along the sidewalk. While the sidewalk in this
area is not designated for cycling, it is wide in most locations and DDOT permits bicycles on
sidewalks outside of the Central Business District. Traffic conditions along 16th Street, with its
hard curbs and high travel speeds, make riding undesirable.
The Capital Bikeshare was launched in September 2010 to replace the DC SmartBike program.
This program has placed over 175 bicycle-share stations across the District of Columbia, and
Arlington and Alexandria, VA, with over 1,670 bicycles provided. At the time data was collected,
no Capital Bikeshare stations existed in the study area. However, several potential stations have
been identified for placement by DDOT and the system is continually expanding.
The No Action Alternative would not impact bicycle facilities.
The Preferred Action Alternative would impact bicycle facilities by increasing demand for
bicycle parking and storage, demand for Capital Bikeshare docks and facilities in or near the
former WRAMC and increased safety and visibility for cyclists. In support of the Preferred
Action Alternative, DOS would perform the following to improve bicycle facilities:
◊

Ensure roadways internal to the FMC accommodate bicycle travel;

◊

All shared-use trails shall be designed to a minimum of 10 feet wide to accommodate
bicycle and pedestrian activities;

◊

Recommend bicycle facilities be extended by the District of Columbia at the northern
edge of the former WRAMC campus;

◊

Provide crosswalks and all-way stops at FMC entrances to ensure bicycle access; and

◊

Encourage through each Chancery Transportation Management Plan that each foreign
mission provide the bicycle commuter benefit to employees, and provide bike racks.

3.7

AIR QUALITY

The No Action and Preferred Alternatives would not negatively impact the air quality of the
study area.
Federal air quality policies are regulated through the federal Clean Air Act (CAA). Pursuant to
this act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established National Ambient Air
Quality Standards (NAAQS) for the following air pollutants (termed “criteria” pollutants): carbon
monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), respirable particulate
matter defined as particulate matter less than 10 micrometers in aerodynamic diameter (PM10),
fine particulate matter defined as particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5),
and lead (exhibit 3.14). There are two types of NAAQS for criteria air pollutants:

Page 73

Environmental Impact Statement

◊

Primary standards are designed to protect public health, including sensitive populations
such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly.

◊

Secondary standards are designed to protect public welfare and the environment by
preventing visibility impairment or damage to crops, vegetation, and buildings.

EPA designates regions and counties based on whether the area is complying with the NAAQS. A
region that is meeting the air quality standard for a pollutant is designated as being in “attainment”
for that pollutant. If the region is not meeting the air quality standard, it is designated as being
in “nonattainment” for that pollutant. Areas that were previously designated as nonattainment
areas but have recently met the standard are designated as “maintenance” areas. The study area

Notes:
(1) Final rule signed October 15, 2008. The 1978 lead standard (1.5 µg/m3 as a quarterly average) remains in effect until one year after an
area is designated for the 2008 standard, except that in areas designated nonattainment for the 1978, the 1978 standard remains in effect until
implementation plans to attain or maintain the 2008 standard are approved.
(2) Official level of the annual NO2 standard is 0.053 ppm, equal to 53 ppb, shown for the purpose of clearer comparison to the 1-hour
standard.
(3) Final rule signed March 12, 2008. 1997 ozone standard (0.08 ppm, annual fourth-highest daily maximum 8-hour concentration, averaged
over 3 years) and related implementation rules remain in place. In 1997, EPA revoked the 1-hour ozone standard (0.12 ppm, not to be
exceeded more than once per year) in all areas, although some areas have continued obligations under that standard (“anti-backsliding”).
1-hour ozone standard is attained when the expected number of days per calendar year with maximum hourly average concentrations above
0.12 ppm is less than or equal to 1.
(4) Final rule signed June 2, 2010. The 1971 annual and 24-hour SO2 standards were revoked in that same rulemaking. However, these
standards remain in effect until one year after an area is designated for the 2010 standard, except in areas designated nonattainment for the
1971 standards, where the 1971 standards remain in effect until implementation plans to attain or maintain the 2010 standard are approved.

is designated a nonattainment area for ozone and PM2.5 and a maintenance area for CO. The
study area is in attainment for other criteria pollutants.
The CAA was amended in 1977 to require each state to maintain a State Implementation Plan
(SIP) for achieving compliance with the NAAQS. In 1990, the CAA was amended to strengthen
regulation of both stationary and motor vehicle emission sources. Conformity to the SIP is
defined under the 1990 CAA amendments as “conformity to an implementation plan’s purpose
of eliminating or reducing the severity and number of violations of the national ambient air
quality standards and achieving expeditious attainment of such standards.”

3.7.1 Transportation Conformity
Transportation conformity is an analytical process required for federally funded transportation
plans, programs, or projects. Air quality provisions in the CAA, Title 40 of the CFR, Parts 51
and 93 and transportation planning provisions of Title 23 and Title 49 of the United States Code,
are intended to ensure that integrated transportation and air quality planning occurs in the areas
designated by EPA as nonattainment or maintenance for ambient levels of CO, O3, NO2, PM2.5,
and PM10. Transportation conformity requires two conformity determinations: regional conformity
determination and project-level conformity determination in nonattainment and maintenance areas
for ozone, CO, PM2.5, and PM10. The demonstration of project-level conformity consists of showing
that the proposed action is listed in, and consistent with, a conforming regional transportation plan
and transportation improvement plan (TIP). Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments
(MWCOG) is the local agency that prepares the Constrained Long Range Plan (CLRP).
The CLRP identifies regionally significant transportation projects and programs that are planned
in the Washington metropolitan area between 2012 and 2040. The MWCOG prepares the air
quality conformity analysis for the CLRP and TIP.

3.7.2 Regional Conformity
The proposed action is in a federal nonattainment area for O3 and PM2.5 and a maintenance
area for CO; therefore, transportation conformity is applicable to these pollutants. Regional
conformity applies to long-range metropolitan transportation plans, shorter-term metropolitan
TIPs, and transportation projects funded or approved by the Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA) or Federal Transit Administration. The Air Quality Conformity Determination of the
2012 CLRP and the FY 2013–2018 TIP for the Washington Metropolitan Region was approved
in July 2012. The analysis demonstrates that mobile source emissions, estimated for the TIP and
for each analysis year of the long-range plan, adhere to emissions budgets.
For regional conformity, MWCOG performs modeling that includes proposed actions that are
considered regionally significant. The roads within the study area are in this category and were
not included in the regional highway network. Therefore, the proposed action is considered “not
regionally significant” for the purposes of regional air quality.

Environmental Impact Statement

The District of Columbia, the State of Maryland, and the Commonwealth of Virginia submitted
a draft maintenance plan in October 2012 for the District of Columbia-MD-VA 1997 fine
particulate (PM2.5) nonattainment area to the EPA in support of the District of Columbia-MD-VA
redesignation request for that standard (MWCOG, 2012). The maintenance plan demonstrates
that PM2.5 air quality in the District of Columbia-MD-VA area would remain compliant with the
1997 PM2.5 NAAQS, as measured by a monitoring network that meets federal requirements. The
plan includes mobile vehicle emissions budgets for the interim year of 2017 and the out year of
2025. It contains contingency measures that would be implemented in the unlikely event that
the area experiences an exceedance of the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS.

3.7.3 PM2.5 Hot Spot Analysis
On a local scale, a PM2.5 hot spot analysis is not required to demonstrate project-level conformity
according to the Transportation Conformity Guidance for Qualitative Hot-Spot Analyses in
PM2.5 and PM10 Nonattainment and Maintenance Areas. On March 10, 2006, the EPA published
a final rule that established transportation conformity criteria and procedures for determining
which proposed actions must be analyzed for local impacts in PM2.5 and PM10 nonattainment
and maintenance areas. The proposed action is in the District of Columbia, PM2.5 nonattainment
area, so the conformity criteria for local impacts were reviewed. According to 40 CFR 93.123(b)
(1), proposed actions of air quality concern that meet one of the following criteria requires a
PM2.5 hot-spot analysis:
◊

New or expanded highway projects that have a significant number of or significant
increase in diesel vehicles;

◊

Projects affecting intersections that have significant delays with a significant number of
diesel vehicles;

◊

New bus and rail terminals and transfer points that have a significant number of diesel
vehicles congregating at a single location;

◊

Expanded bus and rail terminals and transfer points that significantly increase the number
of diesel vehicles congregating at a single location; and

◊

Projects in or affecting locations, areas, or categories of sites which are identified in the
PM2.5 or PM10 applicable implementation plan or implementation plan submission, as
sites of violation or possible violation.

The vehicles using the roads in the study area are primarily gasoline-fueled vehicles. The
proposed action would not: have a significant increase in diesel vehicles; have an increase in
traffic volumes due to a significant number of diesel vehicles; include expanded diesel bus or
rail terminals that would significantly increase the number of diesel vehicles; or affect sites
identified in the implementation plan. Therefore, the project is not a proposed action of air
quality concern according to 40 CFR 93.123(b)(1); a hot-spot analysis for PM2.5 is not required;

Page 76

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

and conformity requirements have been met. The proposed action meets the requirements of
40 CFR 93.116 because it would not cause or contribute to a new localized PM2.5 violation or
increase the frequency or severity of a PM2.5 violation.

3.7.4 Mobile Source Air Toxic Analysis
FHWA Interim Guidance Update on Mobile Source Air Toxic [MSAT] Analysis in NEPA (2012)
describes how to evaluate MSAT emissions for transportation projects. FHWA developed a tiered
approach for analyzing MSATs, depending on specific circumstances. FHWA has identified
three levels of analysis:
◊

No analysis for actions with no potential for meaningful MSAT effects

◊

Qualitative analysis for actions with low potential MSAT effects

◊

Quantitative analysis to differentiate alternatives for actions with higher potential MSAT
effects

The projected annual average daily traffic for the proposed action would be less than 140,000
to 150,000 in the year 2032. Therefore, the proposed action does not meet the criteria for higher
potential MSAT effects and would be classified as having a low potential for MSAT effects
(second level).
For the Preferred Action Alternative, the amount of MSATs emitted would be proportional to
the vehicle miles traveled (VMT). The VMT estimated for the Preferred Action Alternative
is slightly higher than that for the No Action Alternative because the proposed action attracts
vehicles that would not otherwise occur in the study area. This increase in VMT means MSATs
in the study area under the Preferred Action Alternative would probably be higher than under
the No Action Alternative.
For the No Action and Preferred Action Alternatives, emissions are virtually certain to be
lower in the year 2032 than at present levels, as a result of the EPA’s national control programs
that are projected to reduce annual MSAT emissions by over 80 percent from 2010 to 2050.
Local conditions may differ from these national projections in terms of fleet mix and turnover,
VMT growth rates, and local control measures. However, the magnitude of the EPA-projected
reductions is so great (even after accounting for VMT growth) that MSAT emissions in the study
area are likely to be lower in the future.

3.8

NOISE

Noise is generally defined as unwanted sound. Sound is all around us; it becomes noise when
it interferes with normal activities such as speech, concentration, or sleep. Ambient noise (the
existing background noise environment) can be generated by a number of noise sources, including
mobile sources, such as automobiles and trucks, and stationary sources, such as construction sites,

Page 77

Environmental Impact Statement

machinery, or industrial operations. There is an existing and variable level of natural ambient
noise from sources such as wind, streams and rivers, and wildlife.
The physical characteristics of sound consist of intensity, frequency, and duration. Sound is
created by acoustic energy, which produces pressure waves that travel through the air and are
sensed by the eardrum. As the acoustic energy increases, the intensity or amplitude of these
pressure waves increase, and the ear senses louder noise. The unit used to measure the intensity
of sound is the decibel (dB).
Sound is measured with instruments that record instantaneous sound levels in dB. A-weighted
sound level measurements (dB(A)) are used to characterize sound levels that can be sensed by
the human ear. A-weighting emphasizes sounds in the range of human hearing (USEPA 1974).
The typical measurement for quieter sounds, such as rustling leaves or a quiet room, is from
20 to 30 dB(A) (exhibit 3.15). Conversational speech is commonly 60 dB(A), and a residential
lawn mower measures approximately 98 dB(A). Sound levels expressed herein are A-weighted.
Noise abatement was evaluated using DDOT and FHWA criteria. DDOT Noise Abatement
Criteria (NAC) for specific land use
Exhibit 3.15 - Noise Level Comparisons
activities were used in the evaluation of
traffic noise. These criteria are based on
criteria established in Title 23 CFR, Part
772, U.S. Department of Transportation,
FHWA, Procedures for Abatement of
Highway Traffic Noise and Construction
Noise, and guidelines for “increase over
existing” noise levels as set forth in
DDOT Publication District Department
of Transportation Noise Policy, dated
January 10, 2011. Predicted noise levels
were determined using Version 2.5 of
FHWA Traffic Noise Model (TNM).
Noise levels are A-weighted hourly
equivalent noise levels in decibels
(Leq (h) dB(A)). The hourly Leq, or
equivalent sound level, is the level of
constant sound that, in an hour, would
contain the same acoustic energy as the
time-varying sound (i.e., the fluctuating
sound levels of traffic noise are
represented in terms of a steady-state
noise level of the same energy content).
A-weighting simulates the response of
the human ear to noise. FHWA and

Page 78

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

DDOT define noise impact based upon seven activity categories (exhibit 3.16). Individual sites
in a given activity category are designated as noise sensitive receptors.
Ambient noise measurements were conducted throughout the study area. Within each noise
sensitive area, short-term (20 minute duration) noise measurements and concurrent traffic counts
were taken (exhibit 3.17).
Short-term measurements were taken at various times of the day and did not necessarily represent
the noisiest condition at a particular measurement site. In addition, measurement sites were
positioned to enable validation of the noise prediction model and to define existing noise levels
for second-row residences. Measurements were used primarily for purposes of noise model
validation, with year 2012 peak hour traffic volumes assumed in the prediction of worst-case
existing noise levels. Measured existing Leq noise levels at short-term measurement sites ranged
from 49 to 68 dB(A) (exhibit 3.18).
Using the traffic data obtained with the short-term noise measurements, noise levels were
modeled and compared to measured noise levels. Measured versus modeled noise levels were
within the acceptable 3 dB(A) range (except at Sites M-7 and M-8 where measured noise levels
were elevated due to background noise that included ambulance sirens and helicopter flying).
The results of the validation process was used to “build” FHWA TNM Version 2.5, used for
purposes of modeling potential noise impacts for the No Action and Preferred Alternatives.

Note: Traffic counts will be updated in the spring of 2014

FHWA TNM predicts noise levels at selected locations based on traffic data, roadway design,
topographic features, and the relationship of the analysis site to nearby roadways. The percentages
of automobiles, medium trucks, and heavy trucks used in the FHWA TNM were developed from
review of traffic classification data obtained during the noise measurement periods corresponding
to the periods of highest noise levels.
The noise levels from the future year were compared to the absolute NAC levels (66 dB(A)) and
to the increases over existing year noise levels using DDOT’s NAC to determine if there would
be any noise impacts (exhibit 3.19). Noise impacts were identified based on predicted exterior
noise levels exceeding the absolute 66 dB(A) criteria level for Activity Category B.
Under the No Action and Preferred Action Alternatives, noise levels in the study area are predicted
to remain constant at Activity Category B (residential level) for most sites modeled. Noise levels
are predicted to increase to Activity Category C (institutional level, e.g., schools and recreation
areas) at 14 of the 58 sites modeled. The majority of the impacted receptors are along Georgia
Avenue. These “increase over existing” noise levels were generally the result of normal traffic
growth predicted to occur between 2012 and 2032. Therefore, projected noise impacts do not
differ perceptibly between the No Action and Preferred Action Alternatives.

Consideration of noise abatement was required for receptors with future noise levels that exceeded
66 dB(A). Noise abatement on non-controlled or partial access control highways usually is not
feasible; most of the District has existing roadways with a narrow right of way. The District also
has a historic character with view sheds of national importance. Based on the amount of direct
access along the corridor and limited right of way, constructing noise barriers is not feasible.

LAND USE, AESTHETICS AND VISUAL RESOURCES

Land use, zoning, and public policy information was obtained from the District of Columbia
Office of Planning, the DC-LRA, and NCPC.

3.9.1 Land Use and Zoning
3.9.1.1 Existing Land Use and Zoning

The study area contains a mixture of institutional, residential, commercial, transportation, and parks
and open space land uses (exhibit 3.20). Land use on the former WRAMC consists of buildings,
parking areas, small wooded areas and mowed lawn. The roads bordering the former WRAMC are
Alaska Avenue and 16th Street to the west and Fern Street to the north. To the east and south, the
study area consists of a vacant portion of the former WRAMC, as well as Georgia Avenue, which
borders the overall campus to the east and Aspen Street, which borders the campus to the south.
The neighborhoods of Shepherd Park, Takoma and Brightwood surround the former WRAMC.

The study area includes approximately 80 acres of Rock Creek Park to the west of 16th Street.
The former WRAMC is surrounded on its northern and southern boundaries by predominantly
low density residential land use, consisting of established neighborhoods of detached, single
family homes. Interspersed in these areas are small, community-oriented institutions such as
recreation centers and religious institutions. South of Aspen Street, there is an area of higher
density residential (3- to 5-story apartment buildings) along 14th Street. Georgia Avenue is the
primary commercial area for this part of the District. Land use along Georgia Avenue consists
of a mixture of commercial and higher density residential (row houses and low-rise apartment
buildings). Fronting Georgia Avenue, between Aspen and Dahlia Streets, are apartment buildings
and a motel. North of Dahlia Street, a row of houses faces Georgia Avenue. Further to the east
of Georgia Avenue, single-family residential land use predominates.
According to the District of Columbia Office of Zoning (2012), the study area contains three
residential zoning designations:
◊

R-1-B. Areas to the north and south are zoned R-1-B, which permits high-density (50-foot
lot width, 5,000 square foot minimum lot size), single-family detached housing.

◊

R-5-B. The eastern portion of the study area, parallel to Georgia Avenue, is zoned R-5-B,
a general residential zone permitting medium density (maximum lot occupancy of 60%)
single-family dwellings, flats, and apartment buildings.

◊

R-5-A. In the southwestern portion of the study area, land surrounding the intersection of
Aspen Street and 14th Street is zoned R-5-A, a residential zone permitting lower density
(maximum lot occupancy of 40%) single family dwellings, flats and apartment buildings.

Development in the study area is regulated by the District of Columbia Zoning Commission
and the Board of Zoning Adjustment (BZA). In cases where the BZA is performing functions
regarding foreign mission and chancery applications, the composition of the Board consists of

three mayoral appointees, the Director of the U.S. National Park Service or designee, and the
Executive Director of NCPC.
The No Action Alternative would not result in a change to land use. Land use at the former
WRAMC would continue to consist of buildings, parking areas, small wooded areas and mowed
lawn. The long-term presence of a large vacant institutional campus would likely have a negative
effect on the study area by making adjacent residential and commercial areas less desirable.
The Preferred Action Alternative would impact the 43.5 acres of land at the former WRAMC by
converting vacant institutional land to active institutional land. The Preferred Action Alternative
would likely have a positive effect on other study area land uses by making adjacent residential
and commercial areas more desirable.

3.9.1.2

Future Land Use

Three planning initiatives would affect future land use in the study area:
The Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital (DC Office of Planning, 2006) – The
plan is divided into two sets of elements—District Elements and Federal Elements. The District
Elements are developed by the DC Office of Planning and the Federal Elements are developed
by NCPC. The Federal Elements section of the plan includes policies to guide the location of
facilities belonging to foreign governments and international organizations and ensure that their
development is compatible with adjacent neighborhood uses.
The District Elements section of the plan divides the District into ten planning areas. The
Rock Creek East planning area encompasses the project study area. The master plan focuses
on continued improvements and redevelopment along Georgia Avenue. For the Upper Georgia
Avenue/Walter Reed area, the plan focuses on the development of walkable shopping districts
along Georgia Avenue, organized into commercial “nodes” that support the residential and
commercial communities in the area. Improved transit access to this area is a critical component
of the master plan. The plan cites the need to incorporate the redevelopment of WRAMC into
future land use planning for the area.
Upper Georgia Avenue Great Streets Redevelopment Plan (DC Office of Planning, 2008)
– This plan outlines the framework for future development and revitalization of Georgia Avenue
from Decatur Street to Eastern Avenue, spurred by the District’s Great Streets Initiative. For the
section of Georgia Avenue abutting the former WRAMC, the plan recommendations are as follows:
◊

Reconnect WRAMC with the community, through street activating uses fronting Georgia
Avenue.

◊

Consider construction of a new parking garage, wrapped with ground floor retail.

◊

Redevelopment must recognize strict site security requirements of any new federal tenant.

Page 87

Environmental Impact Statement

◊

New pocket parks and greenways would enhance the look of the corridor and provide
safe pedestrian connections.

◊

Consider relocating Engine Company #22 to the southeast corner of former WRAMC.

Walter Reed Army Medical Center Small Area Plan Draft (Walter Reed DC-LRA, 2012) –
This plan proposes a redevelopment framework for the 66.5 acre portion of the former WRAMC
to be transferred to the DC-LRA (exhibit 1.7). The plan is being developed as a precursor to
new proposed zoning amendments and development guidelines for the DC-LRA portion of the
former WRAMC.
The DC-LRA plan stresses the importance of maintaining the existing site character, as well as
complementing the adjacent land uses, by creating five horizontally stratified character areas.
These areas are based upon the historic building types and uses, whose location was determined
largely by topography. The reuse plan envisions that these character areas would continue across
the entire campus, encompassing the study area. From north to south, the character areas consist
of:
◊

Neighborhood scale (residential density)

◊

City/urban block (maximum density)

◊

Axial; formal

◊

Pastoral/lyrical/open space/park land

◊

Perimeter scale with topographical variety

The plan proposes medium density residential and mixed use of retail and offices in the eastern
portion of the former WRAMC. The southern portion of the former WRAMC is proposed to
contain more medium density residential, a proposed charter school, and mixed-use creative.
In the southeastern portion of the campus, below Dahlia Street, the plan proposes a major open
space area.
The No Action Alternative would not impact future land use.
The Preferred Action Alternative would have a positive effect on future land use by supporting
planned redevelopment at the DC-LRA portion of the former WRAMC. The FMC would be
a large employment center adjacent to the DC-LRA development. Employees would likely
patronize the retail and food service businesses planned for the DC-LRA development, and some
might choose to reside in the planned residential portion of the development.

3.9.1.3

Community Facilities and Services

Community facilities within the study area consist of two education facilities, six places of
worship, a library, and three recreation areas/parks (exhibit 3.21). The study area is served by
DC Public Schools; the 45,000-student public school district for the Washington, DC, elementary
and middle school facilities are at the Takoma Education Campus on Dahlia Street immediately
to the east of the study area. Coolidge High School, southeast of the study area on 5th Street,
also serves students in the study area (DC Public Schools, 2012).
Emergency service facilities are located outside the study area in the Brightwood community.
Fire protection and EMS services for the study area are provided by Engine Company #22 at
5760 Georgia Avenue. Police service is provided by the DC Metropolitan Police Department,
District 4 at 6001 Georgia Avenue.
Parks and recreation facilities in the study area primarily consist of Rock Creek Park, a 2,800 acre
park managed by the National Park Service. Rock Creek Park contains an extensive pedestrian/
bicycle/horseback riding trail system, playground and picnic areas, tennis courts, boat rentals,
and amphitheater. The park contains historic buildings and exhibits and provides educational
opportunities based on the natural and cultural resources present (NPS, 2012). Other park
and recreation facilities in the study area include a small memorial park and the Fort Stevens
Recreation Center. Facilities at the recreation center include tennis and basketball courts, baseball
fields and a recreation building.
The No Action Alternative would not impact community facilities and services.
The Preferred Action Alternative would not impact education facilities, places of worship,
libraries, or recreation areas/parks. The Preferred Action Alternative would impact emergency
response services, which would be responsible for providing emergency service to the FMC.

3.9.2 Visual Resources and Aesthetics
Visual character is a composite description of the visual elements of an area, considering the
form, scale, and diversity of man-made and natural landscape features. Visual sensitivity is
considered as high, moderate, or low based on the potential for the public to discern and tolerate
visual change, considering existing visual quality and based on three interrelated criteria: unity,
intactness, and vividness.
Unity pertains to how well individual elements visually relate to one another—visual unity
is achieved in a landscape when a person can establish a visual connection between every
component within a given viewshed.
Intactness pertains to the integrity of a landscape, or the degree to which the landscape is free
from incongruent features that detract from the otherwise established visual pattern.
Vividness relates to the presence of distinctive landscape features, such as topography, colors,
or patterns that combine to form a striking or memorable visual pattern within the viewshed.
Within the study area, public thoroughfares border the former WRAMC campus on all sides,
providing separation and some buffering between the institutional and surrounding residential
land uses. In general, existing institutional buildings and landscaping are visually compatible
with the adjacent residential development, except along the southern campus boundary, where
maintenance facilities, including two tall industrial stacks, conflict visually with residential
areas. The largest institutional buildings are set in the interior of the former WRAMC to reduce
their visibility from residential areas. Rock Creek Park is considered a visually sensitive area;
however, the topography of the park is such that the former WRAMC is not visible from interior
park trails.
The No Action Alternative would not impact visual resources and aesthetics.
The Preferred Action Alternative would have minor impacts on visual resources and aesthetics.
Construction and construction sites are usually considered unattractive and would have a
short-term impact on views from surrounding areas.
After the FMC is constructed, views of the site of the former WRAMC from surrounding areas
would be similar to current views of institutional land. The Preferred Action Alternative would
be designed to retain historic campus character. Site development would be visually consistent
with current and future adjacent land uses. Specific lot development characteristics would be
dependent upon the lot’s location.

3.10 SOCIOECONOMICS
The analysis of socioeconomics considered the six census tracts that fall within the study area.
The following is a brief description of the demographic characteristics of the study area compared
with the District of Columbia overall.

Page 90

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

Current population and labor force trends were identified using data from the U.S. Census Bureau. To
identify potential future population and labor force trends, data was obtained from the Cooperative
Forecasting program administered by the MWCOG. The program publishes a series of forecasts,
or “rounds,” which provide land use activity forecasts for employment, population, and households
by five year increments, typically covering a 20- to 30-year timeframe (MWCOG, 2013).

Data was compiled using traffic analysis zones (TAZs), the geographical boundaries used within
the MWCOG employment model. The boundaries are highly similar to census tract boundaries.
Therefore, it was considered methodologically appropriate to present future employment data
using TAZ boundaries.

3.10.1

Population

The population of the study area and the District of Columbia have grown over the past decade
(exhibit 3.22). Population grew at a slightly slower rate in the study area (3.7 percent) than in
DC overall (5.7 percent). The study area accounted for 3.6 percent of total population in the
District of Columbia in 2010 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2013a, 2013c).
Based on land availability, planning policies, and regional growth trends, the study area is projected
to experience modest growth between 2010 and 2035 (exhibit 3.23). Population in DC is expected
to increase by 23 percent over the 25-year period and population in the study area is projected to
grow by 24 percent, reaching approximately 30,200 in 2035 (MWCOG, 2013). The population
forecasts presume that the federal government and the DC-LRA would proceed with redevelopment
of the former WRAMC; this growth represents approximately 82 percent of the total for the study
area. Most of the remaining growth is projected to occur near the Metro station in Takoma and
along Georgia Avenue, consistent with the adopted Small Area Plans for each location.

3.10.2

Housing

The study area has a high rate of home ownership in comparison to the District of Columbia
overall (exhibit 3.24). There is a lower percentage of vacant residences, and a corresponding
higher rate of occupied units in the study area than are found in DC (U.S. Census Bureau, 2013b).
Single-family homes are the largest type of housing in the study area followed by multi-family
housing, while the predominant housing structure in DC is multi-family housing (exhibit 3.25).
The study area has a higher rate of detached single-family homes than in DC, but has a lower
rate of attached single-family homes than in DC (U.S. Census Bureau, 2013b).
Within the study area, the average length of time for residing in the same housing unit exceeds
the District of Columbia, overall. Residents in the study area stay in owner-occupied residences
an average of 17 years, and stay in renter-occupied units an average of seven years (exhibit 3.26)
(U.S. Census Bureau, 2013b).

Economic Activity, Employment and Income

Between 2000 and 2010, the labor force in the study area grew by 31 percent, a faster rate of
growth than in the District of Columbia overall (11 percent) (exhibit 3.27). The percentage of
the population in the study area not participating in the labor force fell over the decade at a
faster rate than in the District of Columbia. The proportion of the labor force in the study area
employed in the armed forces decreased from 2000–2010 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2013a, 2013b).
The number of employed persons grew in both the study area and the District of Columbia
overall from 2000–2010 (exhibit 3.28). In 2000, the unemployment rate in the study area was
substantially lower (6.1 percent) than the District of Columbia overall (10.8 percent). By the
end of the decade, the unemployment rate in the study area had risen substantially, due largely
to the national recession of 2007–2009. The District of Columbia unemployment rate, which
had fallen sharply after 2000, rose during the national recession, but remained lower than at the

beginning of the decade. By 2010, the unemployment rate in the study area was slightly higher
than the District of Columbia overall (U.S. Census Bureau, 2013a, 2013b).
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), overall unemployment in the District of
Columbia decreased in 2012 from 2010 levels (BLS, 2013). While BLS data varies in collection
methodology from the Census Bureau, the regional trend in unemployment can be demonstrated.
The District of Columbia Department of Employment Services (DCDES) publishes a list of
the top 200 firms in the District. Exhibit 3.29 shows the 15 largest firms (ranked by size of
workforce) identified by DCDES. Educational institutions and hospitals are the predominant
largest non-government employers. In addition to the organizations listed, District of Columbia
Public Schools and the District of Columbia government are large employers (DCDES, 2013).
The number of jobs in the study area is expected to decrease from approximately 14,103 today
to 12,834 in 2035 (MWCOG, 2012a). These forecasts presume a sharp drop in employment
between 2010 and 2020 as federal jobs at Walter Reed Hospital are repositioned. However,

they presume that most of these jobs would be replaced in the long run by new jobs on the
site of the former WRAMC as employment begins to increase slowly from 2020 to 2035; and
that additional employment growth would occur on Georgia Avenue, Kennedy Street, in the
Washington Hospital Center complex, at the Armed Forces Retirement Home, and in other
established business districts within the Planning Area (exhibit 3.30).
Median household income in the District of Columbia and the study area are summarized in
exhibit 3.31. Income is shown in inflation-adjusted 2012 dollars, to allow comparison between
time periods. Median household income in the District of Columbia increased over the decade
from 1999–2010. In contrast, the median income in the study area decreased substantially,
although it remained higher than the District overall. The median household income in the study
area was 39 percent greater than the District of Columbia’s in 1999 and 12 percent greater in
2010 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2013a, 2013b).

consumer expenditures in the regional economy. MWCOG employment projections assume
FMC redevelopment would occur, so employment growth due to the FMC is captured within
the MWCOG estimates.
As federal government property leased to foreign missions, chanceries would not generate tax
revenue for the District. However, to the extent that chancery employees support study area
retail businesses or choose to reside within the study area, the FMC would have a slight positive
effect on study area tax revenue.
Employment, earnings and consumer expenditure impacts of the Preferred Action Alternative
were calculated using the Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II), published by
the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis. Input-output analysis is used for
measuring the economic impacts of development, as well as public investments or programs.
RIMS II provides estimates of the dollar value impacts to various sectors of the economy (outputs)
that are caused by spending in other areas (inputs).
Impacts were measured at the regional level, defined as the Washington Primary Metropolitan
Statistical Area. The Washington Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area (PMSA) consists of 25
jurisdictions in the Washington, DC region (exhibit 3.32).

Page 95

Environmental Impact Statement

Economic impacts are classified as direct or indirect. The direct impacts are a result of economic
activity attributed to the project itself or occurring inside the footprint of the project. For example,
jobs located in the proposed chancery buildings would be considered a direct economic impact.
Indirect impacts refer to the impacts that occur as a result of the direct impacts. For example,
furniture purchased by a chancery would be considered an indirect impact of the project. Indirect
impacts include induced impacts, which result when the earnings of construction workers and
chancery employees, as well as growth in earnings at suppliers, lead to further sales for businesses
that provide consumer goods and services.
The Preferred Action Alternative would result in new employment both from the construction of
the FMC and from operation of future chanceries. The jobs associated with the construction of
the project are a one-time impact and do not represent an ongoing change to regional employment,
while the jobs created from chancery operation represent a permanent impact to the regional
economy.
The economic change resulting from the Preferred Alternative was measured in number of jobs
created. The impacts are also described in terms of earnings associated with the employment
change, as well as consumer expenditures, or the spending that would flow through the regional
economy per year as a result of the Preferred Alternative. It is important to note that these are
alternative measurements of the same impact and should not be added together.
The analysis used the following assumptions:

Market conditions were not considered or predicted. The proposed action was assumed
to be financially feasible and sufficient demand was assumed to be present for each
component of the development. Financial feasibility may change over time and could
impact phasing, square footage of each building, and the need for public support for
infrastructure improvements.

◊

The analysis did not distinguish between new jobs created and existing jobs relocated from
elsewhere nearby, but did assume that all employees directly employed in the chanceries
would be foreign nationals not previously residing in the country.

◊

Because of extraterritoriality laws and bilateral agreements, it was assumed that the
District of Columbia would not collect any property taxes from the foreign missions.

Temporary Impacts from Construction

Construction costs used in the analysis were based on a cost report prepared for the project
(Morris Wade Associates 2013). Costs were calculated for the full build out of the proposed
FMC, which would total approximately 1.26 million square feet of new construction. The
$617 million construction cost includes horizontal construction costs of $115 million and
vertical construction costs of $502 million (exhibit 3.33). Horizontal construction consists of the
demolition of any existing structures, as well as site preparation, including grading, installing
infrastructure, and paving roadways. Vertical construction consists of the development of the
new chancery structures, estimated to cost on average $400 per square foot, equivalent to a
high-end office property in the Washington, DC, metro area. The average wage for construction
employees was based on the BLS wage estimate for the Washington PMSA construction sector
as of May 2012.
Construction of the FMC under the Preferred Action Alternative would create an estimated 3,053
temporary jobs, the equivalent of $131 million in wages paid, and as much as $109 million in
consumer expenditures resulting from the new employment (exhibits 3.33, 3.34 and 3.35).

Permanent Impacts from FMC Operation

Operation of the FMC under the Preferred Action Alternative would generate an estimated 3,410
permanent jobs. It is expected that the overwhelming majority of these jobs (2,524) would be
filled by foreign nationals either relocated from current chancery facilities in Washington, D.C.
or not previously residing in the country. The remainder would be indirect employment (886).
Indirect employment refers to the number of employees who are not employed by the foreign
missions, but are jobs created or supported as a result of increased demand for goods and services
as a result of the FMC’s economic impact. This employment would result in an estimated $206
million in earnings and as much as $172 million in consumer expenditures within the region
(exhibits 3.36, 3.37, 3.38 and 3.39).

Environmental Impact Statement

3.11 MINORITY AND DISADVANTAGED POPULATIONS
Environmental Justice (EJ) is defined by the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice as:
“…the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless
of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development
and implementation of federal actions in accordance with applicable
environmental laws, regulations, and policies. Fair treatment means that
no group of people, including racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic group
should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental
consequences resulting from industrial, municipal, and commercial
operations or the execution of federal, state, local, and tribal programs
and policies” (USEPA, 1998).
EO 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and
Low-Income Populations directs federal agencies to take appropriate and necessary steps to
identify and address disproportionately high and adverse environmental effects of federal agency
actions on minority and low-income populations.
For the analysis of populations afforded consideration and protection under EJ, a minority
population is defined as a readily identifiable group or groups of minority persons who live
in geographic proximity. Minority persons include an individual who identifies as a Black or
African American, Hispanic or Latino, Asian or Asian-American, American Indian or Alaska
Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or who identifies as a multi-racial (two or more
races) individual.
For the purposes of EJ analysis, low-income populations were defined as a readily identifiable
group of persons whose income is at or below the poverty level, as determined by the U.S.
Census Bureau, which develops poverty thresholds that are applied to per capita income data,
and used to determine poverty status.
The general methodology for addressing EO 12898 consists of:
◊

Identifying thresholds for determining EJ populations within the study area;

◊

Identifying disproportionately high and adverse effects on EJ populations that would
potentially result from the proposed project; and

◊

Determining whether the adverse effects are disproportionate in relation to other
populations within the study area.

The study area for the EJ analysis consisted of 18 census block groups within or immediately
adjacent to the former WRAMC for the analysis of percent minority; and six census tracts within
or immediately adjacent to the former WRAMC for the analysis of percent low income. A census
tract is a geographic unit of analysis which typically contains 4,000 people. A block group is

Page 100

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

a geographic unit of analysis which typically contains between 600 and 3,000 people (U.S.
Census Bureau, 2013d). The block groups and census tracts were analyzed to identify affected
populations and/or EJ-related issues that may not be apparent at a larger geographic scale.
Minority population data and low-income population data (derived as the percent of total
population living below the corresponding economic poverty level) were obtained from the U.S.
Census American Community Survey five-year average data for 2006-2010.
The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) guidance for determining EJ populations calls for
defining specific thresholds, which are used to identify “meaningfully greater” concentrations
of minority and low-income residents than can be found in a larger reference population (CEQ,
1997). For this study, the larger reference populations were defined as the study area overall,
as well as the District of Columbia. An EJ population was considered to be present in a census
tract or block group when the percent of minority residents exceeded 61 percent, or the percent
of low-income residents exceeded 12 percent. These thresholds correspond to the percent of
minority and low-income residents found in the larger reference populations (exhibit 3.40).
Minority and low-income characteristics of each study area were analyzed to identify geographic
locations that are considered as EJ populations. Through application of the 61 percent minority
population threshold, 17 of the 18 block groups were identified as EJ populations (exhibit 3.41).
Through the application of the 12 percent below poverty threshold, three of the six census tracts
were identified as EJ populations (exhibit 3.42). Additionally, of the six census tracts, three
exceeded both the minority and low income thresholds.
Of the total population in the study area of approximately 22,047, approximately 20,626 residents
(94 percent) reside in block group areas identified as an EJ population (U.S. Census Bureau,
2013b).
EO 13166, Limited English Proficiency (LEP) requires federal agencies to ensure that they take
reasonable steps to provide meaningful access for LEP individuals.
For the purposes of this analysis, linguistically isolated households were defined as a household
in which all members 14 years and older speak a non-English language at home and speak
English less than “very well.”

The study area for this analysis consisted of 18 census block groups within or immediately
adjacent to the Walter Reed campus for the analysis of linguistically isolated populations.
Linguistically isolated population data were obtained from the U.S. Census American Community
Survey five-year average data for 2006–2010. The District of Columbia’s linguistically isolated
population is approximately 2.5 percent and the study area’s linguistically isolated population is
approximately 8.5 percent. Eight of the 18 block groups were identified as having linguistically
isolated households greater than 2.5 percent (exhibit 3.43).
EO 12898 defines a disproportionately high and adverse effect upon EJ communities as an effect
that is predominantly borne by, or would be suffered by, an environmental justice population
and that is appreciably more severe and greater in magnitude than adverse effects suffered by
a non-EJ population.
The No Action Alternative would not result in adverse effects to populations afforded consideration
and protection under EJ.
The Preferred Action Alternative would not result in adverse effects to populations afforded
consideration and protection under EJ that would exceed those effects predicted to be borne
by non-EJ populations. No disproportionate comparative indirect and cumulative effects of the
proposed action between EJ and non-EJ populations were identified.

Environmental Impact Statement

An additional focus of EO 12898 is to solicit meaningful participation of the public in the project
development process, with an emphasis on meaningful exchange with minority and low-income
populations. Concerns and issues raised by community members during the scoping process
were carefully considered in the development of the Preferred Action Alternative’s elements
and potential mitigation strategies. Detailed public outreach activities are described in Chapter
4: Coordination and Consultation. As the master plan is implemented for the FMC, DOS is
committed to provide outreach to citizens as needed on temporary impacts resulting from
construction activities, such as changes to traffic patterns.

3.12 CULTURAL RESOURCES
The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA) established a program to preserve historic
properties throughout the country. Section 106 of the NHPA, as amended, requires that federal agencies
review undertakings for their impact on significant historic resources. The term historic includes
architectural, archeological, and landscape resources. A significant historic resource is one that is either
listed or determined eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Section
106 also provides an opportunity for the public and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation
(ACHP) to comment on undertakings. The appropriate State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO)
advises and assists federal agencies in carrying out their Section 106 responsibilities.
The National Register of Historic Places is the federally maintained list of properties recognized
for their significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering and culture.
The criteria for evaluating the eligibility of properties for inclusion on the National Register are
established by the Secretary of the Interior. There are four criteria.
Criterion A – associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
Criterion B – associated with the lives of significant persons in our past; or
Criterion C – embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction,
or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
Criterion D – has yielded or may be likely to yield information important in history or prehistory.
Parallel to the National Register are listings that are developed and maintained at the state and
local level. The District of Columbia Historic Preservation Office (DC-HPO), which functions
as the SHPO for the District of Columbia, maintains the District of Columbia Inventory of
Historic Sites. A property can be listed on one or both the National Register and the District
of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites. Acceptance on one does not automatically result in
acceptance on the other.

Page 104

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

Both the National Register and the District of Columbia Inventory list individual properties as
well as historic districts. When a historic district is nominated, the nomination form includes
an evaluation of every structure within the district boundary and identifies each as either a
contributing resource to the historic district or a non-contributing resource. The Section 106
process includes the evaluation of potential adverse effects on all individually eligible and
contributing resources. Within a historic district, some contributing resources may also be
considered as individually eligible for listing at either the federal or state level.
Prior to the initiation of the current Section 106 process, a determination of eligibility was made
for a National Register Historic District encompassing the entire historic Walter Reed Army
Medical Center campus. The period of significance for the eligible district is 1909 to 1956 and
includes 27 contributing resources (buildings) of which 11 have been identified as individually
eligible. There are also contributing landscape resources and structures.

3.12.1

Section 106 Process of the NHPA

The Section 106 Process for the WRAMC consists of two
parts: the Section 106 Process and resultant Programmatic
Agreement (PA) for the Army Base Realignment and
Closure Commission (BRAC) undertaking, and the Section
106 Process and projected PA for the DOS FMC Master
Plan undertaking.

A Programmatic Agreement is an
agreement between parties establishing a
program for compliance with Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act.

3.12.1.1 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC)
undertaking
Prior to the initiation of the current study, the closure of the WRAMC under the 2005 BRAC
made that undertaking subject to review under Section 106 of the NHPA. The Department of
the Army Section 106 process was initiated in February 2010. An assessment was developed
identifying the historic resources within the WRAMC and consulting parties were identified.
This process included a series of public meetings between March and August 2010. A final
assessment report was issued on November 3, 2011.
The outcome of the Army Section 106 process was a PA executed between the Army, the DC-HPO
and the ACHP. The PA, signed in January 2013, includes a series of stipulations that take into
account the effects of the Army undertaking on the identified historic properties. Following are
the stipulations that relate to aboveground historic properties.
◊

Interim Property Maintenance. Avoid adverse effects to historic properties prior to transfer
of parcels containing historic property by keeping the buildings weather-tight, ventilating
the buildings, maintaining the interior environment between fifty-five (55) and eighty-five
(85) degrees Fahrenheit, and providing physical security and fire protection.

Page 105

Environmental Impact Statement

◊

Nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Submit an Application for (DC)
Historic Landmark or Historic District Designation concurrently with a National Register
nomination for the WRAMC Historic District.

◊

Photographic Documentation. Take between 70 and 100 large-format black-and-white
general landscape views of the installation and submit them to the Library of Congress
and the HPO.

◊

Interpretive Materials. Develop a self-guided walking tour with interpretive panels for
portions of the WRAMC that would be accessible to the public after transfer from Army
control.

◊

Existing Conditions Document. Perform existing conditions photography of each principal
façade of each eligible building and select copies (floor plans, facades, roof plans, details
of character defining features) of as-built drawings. A separate report shall be generated
for each historic building and provided to the recipient of historic property at transfer.

◊

Environmental Remediation. In the event that remediation is required prior to transfer
and if historic properties may be affected, the Army shall take actions necessary to assure
protection of human health and the environment and when possible implement measures
to avoid, minimize or mitigate adverse effects on historic properties.

Under the proposed action, ownership of the 43.5-acre FMC site would be transferred from
the Army to DOS. When property transfer occurs, the Army PA and these stipulations would
terminate. A new PA based on the proposed undertaking by DOS would be developed and could
incorporate certain stipulations from the Army PA that are appropriate for the new undertaking.

3.12.1.2 FMC Master Plan undertaking

A request to initiate the Section 106 process for the proposed DOS undertaking was issued
formally to the DC-HPO on June 22, 2012. Invitations to become consulting parties to the DOS
Section 106 process were sent to the following parties (who were identified based on the list of
Army Section 106 process consulting parties):

A public scoping meeting for the DEIS was held on July 19, 2012, and potential effects to
cultural resources were identified as a public and agency concern. Public comments focused on
keeping the chapel, having an open and accessible campus, maintaining the existing landscape
buffer along 16th and Alaska, and addressing traffic impacts.
On January 22, 2013, a meeting was held with DOS, DC-HPO and the ACHP to review the status of
the project, outline future public participation opportunities, and determine the form of agreement
that would be developed to memorialize stipulations regarding effects to historic resources.
Since the end-product of the undertaking would be a Master Plan used for the development and
build-out of the FMC, the parties agreed that the most appropriate form of agreement to embody

Page 107

Environmental Impact Statement

mitigation measures would be a PA. DOS, with DC-HPO and ACHP, will prepare the PA for the
undertaking and continue to work with and seek input from the other consulting parties.

A public meeting focused on the Section 106 process was held on June 18, 2013. The meeting
outlined the findings regarding the assessment of historic resources, described the proposed
action and presented a preliminary analysis of potential adverse effects of the undertaking on
aboveground historic resources.
The Committee of 100 on the Federal City noted the following:
◊

It may be possible to reuse Buildings 40 and 54 as chanceries.

◊

It may be possible to retain and reuse the residential house(s).

◊

It strongly supports retaining the historic chapel.

◊

The PA should include a stipulation that any major alterations or new construction be
reviewed by the DC Historic Preservation Board.

◊

The Battle of Fort Stevens was fought on and near the former WRAMC.

◊

Interpretive materials and signage should be provided to educate others on the history
of the property from the Civil War to present day.

◊

A social history for the former WRAMC should be prepared to include the modern history
beyond the 1956 period of significance.

The APCWDW noted the following:
◊

There are concerns about the preservation of open space within the FMC.

◊

The former WRAMC was part of the 1864 Battle of Fort Stevens. While the period of
significance for the proposed historic district is 1909–1956, the site is linked to important
historic activities prior to 1909.

◊

Interpretive materials and signage should be provided to educate others on the history of
the property, from the Civil War to present day. The signage should be consistent with
the signs the Army would provide for the portion of the former WRAMC redeveloped
by the DC-LRA.

3.12.2

Historic Resources

Regulations for implementation of the NHPA, as amended, require definition of an area of
potential effects (APE) for federal undertakings affecting historic resources. Per 36 CFR Part

Page 108

800, Protection of Historic Properties, the APE is defined as “the geographic area or areas
within which an undertaking may directly or indirectly cause changes in the character or use
of historic properties, if such properties exist. The APE is influenced by the scale and nature of
the undertaking and may be different for different kinds of effects caused by the undertaking”
(36 CFR 800.16(d)).
The APE for the aboveground historic resources is comprised of the entire WRAMC facility
and extends approximately 1,250 feet (four city blocks) to the north and west (exhibit 3.44).
It extends into Rock Creek Park along 16th Street, is bounded to the north by Hemlock Street,
until its intersection with 13th Street. East of 13th Street it is enclosed by Fern Street to Georgia
Avenue in the east and Aspen Street to the south. The latter boundaries (to the east and south)
are the boundaries of the former WRAMC.

3.12.2.1 WRAMC Historic District

The former WRAMC (also known as, and also referred to as, “the post”) has been determined
as eligible for listing on the NRHP as a historic district (exhibit 3.45). The period of significance
for the historic district starts in 1909, the opening date of the Main Hospital Building, and ends
in 1956. The end date relates to changes within the military medical structure that resulted in
similar or parallel installations being created elsewhere in the United States. The boundary of
the historic district includes the entire historic campus of the WRAMC, from 16th Street to
Georgia Avenue and from Aspen Street to Fern Street.
All structures that existed or were constructed within the period of significance are considered
contributing resources to the WRAMC historic district. In addition, several of the contributing
resources (structures) to the district have been identified as individually eligible for listing, as
they embody the distinctive characteristics of a type or period.

History of the WRAMC

Since the WRAMC opened in May 1909, rapid development has occurred on the campus and
in the surrounding neighborhoods. In contrast to the current site density, the setting was rural
when the campus first opened, but rapidly began to urbanize under the demands placed on the
facility and the District of Columbia, by World Wars I and II.
Insurance maps from the first decade of the 20th century show the area east of Rock Creek Park
in the northern portion of the District as open with a single paved road, Georgia (or Brightwood)
Avenue, running north-south and the small “village” of Takoma Park located further east near
Eastern Avenue. The land located between Georgia Avenue and Rock Creek Park was almost
completely undeveloped with the exception of several residential structures. While the future
street grid is shown on the maps, the few roads that existed were unpaved and many of these
roads bisected parcels of privately owned land.
Prior to the WRAMC development of the property, J. D. Cameron was identified as the owner
of a land parcel that extended from Georgia Avenue on the east to 16th Street on the west, with

a boundary south of what became Aspen Street and an angled northern boundary. By 1907, the
eastern portion of Cameron’s property had been divided off and labeled “United States”. This
roughly trapezoidal shaped property became the site of the Walter Reed General Hospital. The
initial campus developed rapidly, with Building 1 (Main Hospital) opening in 1909. Within two
years there were nine more brick buildings and a few wood frame structures.
The period of U.S. engagement in World War I, 1917–1918, saw an explosion of wood framed
buildings constructed at the Hospital. The western property boundary was pushed to 16th Street.
While the northern boundary of the property was still shown as an angled line, with the city
street grid and sub-divided properties to the north, hospital buildings were already constructed
north of this boundary. The buildings corresponded to the street grid, particularly Dahlia Street
and 13th Street, but the capacity needs of the Hospital were not satisfied within the existing
boundary and further expansion of the property was required.
Maps from the inter-war years represent the boundary of the site as it exists today, with the
northern edge extended to Alaska and Fern Avenues. Many of the World War I era wood frame
structures were removed during this period, and new brick buildings constructed. The organization
of the campus plan assumed a more picturesque arrangement south of Building 1, focused on the
curvilinear “Main Road”. However, north of Building 1, Dahlia Street established a hard edge
beyond which the city street grid was retained. Significant new buildings constructed during
this period include Building 40, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (1923 and 1932),
Building 41, the Red Cross Building (1927 and 1944) and Building 57, the Memorial Chapel
(1931).
World War II initiated a second period of increased construction. The most intense development
occurred in the northeast corner of the campus, north of Dahlia Street and east of 14th Street.
Tightly spaced hospital wards and barracks filled the site and began to displace the historic street
grid. While Dogwood Street and a portion of 13th Street survived, other streets are interrupted
and become internal circulation pathways. The intensity of the construction activity on the
eastern portion of the site is counterbalanced by the more open, smaller scale development to
the west. Houses used as Officers’ Quarters were located on Dogwood, 14th and 15th Streets.
These houses were originally constructed outside the WRAMC boundary and annexed as the
property expanded to the west and north. Overall, the separation of the campus from the city
street grid is firmly established.
The most significant construction at the WRAMC between World War II and the end of the
period of significance in 1956 was Building 54, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP),
constructed in 1954. While Building 54 was larger in scale and bulkier in mass than older campus
buildings, an effort was made to integrate it with the existing street grid. It was situated facing
14th Street with Dahlia Street to its south. The site for Building 54 was already occupied by a
number of other structures. Five of these were residential structures which were relocated to
the south and west of the Chapel.

The WRAMC historic district is clearly delineated by a perimeter fence and gates that identify
the boundary of the military installation. While there are a wide range of building types and
architectural styles on the campus, the contributing resources are primarily Colonial Revival and
Georgian Revival style constructed of red brick with limestone detailing. The development and
expansion of the campus over time was not based on a single master plan; instead, the location
of buildings and their inter-relationship resulted in a campus environment that uses open space
along with vehicular and pedestrian pathways as organizing elements. The growth and ongoing
redevelopment of the campus resulted in key resources acting as focal points and contributing
resources providing the connective tissue. The property functions as a visually cohesive campus
that represents the full history of development at the WRAMC.

Historic Significance of WRAMC

The WRAMC Historic District is eligible for the NRHP due to its significance in the field of
military medicine (Criterion A) and its architecture and design (Criterion C). The Walter Reed
General Hospital, one of the oldest general military hospitals in the country, has played a key
role in the treatment and rehabilitation of America’s soldiers in all major U.S. conflicts since
World War I. The Army Medical School has been responsible for training Army physicians in
military medicine and public health and advancing military medical care through research. The
AFIP is internationally renowned for its research on pathology and the study of disease.
The core institutions that became the WRAMC date to the 19th century. In 1862, Surgeon
General William A. Hammond first conceived of the need for a military medical reservation in
the District of Columbia, including a permanent hospital, a medical school to train the Army’s
surgeons, and a medical museum. His concerns were fueled by the unprecedented needs posed
by the Civil War. While Hammond’s overall plan was not approved, the Army Medical Museum
and Library was established in 1862 and located downtown. The Museum was established to
reduce the loss of life in warfare through the scientific study of medical specimens.
The second component of what became the WRAMC was the Army Medical School. In 1893,
the War Department issued an order calling for the establishment of an Army Medical School in
the District of Columbia. The mission of the school was to provide specialized training for newly
commissioned doctors prior to their entrance into the medical corps. It was initially located in
the same facility downtown as the Museum and Library.
The final WRAMC component established was the General Hospital. In 1898 the post hospital
at the Washington Barracks (present-day Fort McNair in southwest Washington, DC) was
designated as the Army General Hospital. The Commander of the General Hospital from 1898
to 1907 was Colonel William C. Borden, who became the driving force behind the consolidation
of the hospital and training facilities at the future WRAMC. While Colonel Borden proposed
a fully consolidated campus including the Hospital, Medical School and Museum, the initial
appropriations limited the campus to just the hospital in 1909. The rapid development of WRAMC
over the next fifty years resulted in a campus that fulfilled and eventually surpassed Borden’s

Page 113

Environmental Impact Statement

original vision, incorporating both medical care and research facilities that were at the forefront
of 20th century advances in the medical field.

WRAMC Historic District Individually Eligible Resources

Building 1 - Main Hospital. The oldest section of the Main Hospital is in the Georgian Revival
style and dates to 1909. It has been expanded with additions on all but the south-facing façade.
The additions were made to expand the patient, medical, and administrative capacities of the
building. Building 1 is eligible under Criterion A for the contributions to the military and medicine
and most of the additions, as well as the original structure, are eligible under Criterion C for their
architecture and design within the Georgian Revival architectural style and period.
Building 7 - Barracks. Constructed in 1910 as men’s barracks, this building is part of the original
core of the campus along with the Main Hospital. This building is eligible under Criterion A
as part of the development of the WRAMC and under Criterion C as an example of Georgian
Revival design which contributes to the overall campus and the historic district.
Building 8 - Officer Quarters 1. Constructed in 1910 as officer housing, this building is part
of the original core of the campus along with the Main Hospital. This building is eligible under
Criterion A as part of the development of the WRAMC and under Criterion C as an example
of Colonial Revival design which contributes to the overall campus and the historic district.
Building 9 - Officer Quarters 2. Constructed in 1910 as officer housing, this building is part
of the original core of the campus along with the Main Hospital. This building is eligible under
Criterion A as part of the development of the WRAMC and under Criterion C as an example
of Colonial Revival design which contributes to the overall campus and the historic district.
Building 11 - Delano Hall. The original portion of Delano Hall is the east wing, dating to 1929.
It was expanded with the center section in 1931 and the west wing in 1933. Built to house nurses,
the building is dedicated to Jane A. Delano, Superintendent of the Army Nurse’s Corps and
leader in Red Cross nursing. The building is significant under Criterion A as representative of
installation support functions and nursing quarters. Building 11 is also eligible under Criterion
C for its architecture and design within the Georgian Revival architectural style and period.
Building 12 - Army Nurse Corps Home. Constructed in 1911, Building 12 was the first
dedicated housing on post for nurses. This building is eligible under Criterion A as part of the
development of the WRAMC and Criterion C as an example of Georgian Revival design which
contributes to the overall campus and the historic district.
Building 17 - Doss Memorial Hall. Doss Memorial Hall was constructed in 1920 and added to
in 1944. Originally the Catholic Service Club, later uses include the Services Club, PX Cafeteria,
and Hostess House. It most recently served as a guest house for wounded soldiers and their
families and also contained the Army Community Services Center. Building 17 is eligible under

Page 114

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

Criterion A as it is significant in the area of military community service function. It is eligible
under Criterion C as an example of Colonial Revival Style.
Building 40 - Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR). Building 40 consists of three
components constructed under different building campaigns. The south wing was constructed
in 1923, the center and north wings in 1932 and the west wing in 1962. Originally constructed
to house the Army Medical School, it was designated as WRAIR in 1955. Many of the most
important medical advances associated with the WRAMC were researched in this building.
The building is eligible under Criterion A for its critical role in the history of the WRAMC
and Criterion C as an excellent example of classical revival architecture that contributes to the
coherence of the campus and the historic district. In addition to the exterior of the building,
some interior spaces including the lobbies, the auditorium and the public corridors have been
identified as character defining features of the building.
Building 41 - Red Cross Building. The first section of Building 41 was constructed in 1927
with the addition of a solarium on the south side in 1944. Building 41 was the location for
many social and recreational functions for the patients at WRAMC. Many nationally famous
entertainers performed on the stage in the main hall. Building 41 is eligible under Criterion A
due to its association with the development of the post and Criterion C as a significant example
of the Colonial Revival style which contributes to the overall campus and the historic district.
Building 52 - Hospital Ward. This hospital ward, constructed in 1930, is the last extant example
of a building type that was once plentiful at the WRAMC as well as many other hospitals
constructed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Long and thin in plan with arcaded verandas
on three sides, these buildings provided both isolation for the wards as well as abundant air and
light. The architecture embodies the advancing scientific concepts of the medical profession.
This structure is eligible under Criterion A as the surviving example of a building type that was
critical to the development history of the campus and Criterion C as an example of Georgian
Revival design which contributes to the overall campus and the historic district.
Building 54 - Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP). The main block of the AFIP was
constructed in 1955 with an addition to the south added outside the period of significance in 1972.
An excellent example of Cold War era design, the facility housed research activities that were at
the cutting edge of the period. This building expands the architectural language of the campus to
include the “modern” vocabulary. The building is eligible under Criterion A as the first structure built
by the unified Armed Forces, and an internationally important facility for research into the causes,
processes and effects of disease. It is eligible under Criterion C as an example of “Brutalist” concrete
construction in an institutional setting and for the board-formed patterning of the concrete facades.
Building 57 - Memorial Chapel. Memorial Chapel was constructed in 1931 with funding raised by
the Red Cross Gray Ladies. This is the only structure that was built on the campus devoted solely
to religious use. In addition to being constructed within the period of significance the building is
eligible under Criterion A as a critical part of the development of the campus and for its connection
to the larger community. It is also eligible under Criterion C as a significant example of English

Page 115

Country Gothic style design. In addition to the exterior of the building there are interior elements
that have been identified as character defining features including the stained glass windows.

WRAMC Historic District Contributing Resources

Perimeter Fence. The former WRAMC is organized similarly to most military installations. The
perimeter boundary of the post is identified by a fence or barrier with entry points signified by
gates. The perimeter fence at the WRAMC extends around the entire installation and has been
modified over time to accommodate new programmatic needs and technologies. Two lengths
of the perimeter fence have been identified as a contributing element as part of the cultural
landscape. The first consists of the fence from the southwest corner of the site, at the intersection
of 16th Street and Aspen Street, north along 16th Street, northeast on Alaska Avenue between
16th Street and Fern Street and east on Fern Street to the 13th Street gate. The second starts at the
southeast corner of the site at the intersection of Georgia Avenue and Aspen Street and extends
north to a point between Butternut and Dahlia Streets. Fence posts at the 16th Street entry date
to 1924 and those at the Georgia Avenue and Aspen Street entries date to 1942. Iron fencing
around the facility dates to c. 1940–1942. The perimeter fence is significant under Criterion A
for its association with the development of the WRAMC and Criterion C for its design as part
of the architectural character of the overall campus.
Main Drive. The Main Drive was created in three episodes, all within the period of significance.
The portion from the Butternut Street entry to Building 1 was part of the original site development
in 1909. The portion of Main Drive from Building 1 to Building 17 was constructed during the
WWI expansion in 1918, while the remaining portion that extended it to the 16th Street entry,
including the circle in front of Building 17, was added in 1933. The Main Drive is significant under
Criterion A for association with the WRAMC and its integration of landscape, views, buildings,
vehicular and pedestrian circulation, and landscape features within the installation’s overall Georgian
Revival-style. The drive contributes to the historic district as part of the cultural landscape.
Landscape Elements. Structure 60, the ellipse in front of Building 1 that encircles the Hoff
Memorial Fountain, is a contributing element to the historic district. The ellipse was part of the
initial 1909 construction with the fountain, pavements, and urns added in 1935. The extant fountain
is a c. 1994 replica that is not a contributing element, falling outside the period of significance.
The ellipse, urns, steps, and landscaping are eligible under Criterion C as contributing elements
to the district as part of the cultural landscape.
The landscape and elements south of Building 1 and the view shed within the area are also
contributing elements as part of the cultural landscape. The elements include Structure 44/
Pergola, Structure 45/Bandstand, Structure 46/Rose Garden Fountain, walkways, cherry trees
and the sunken garden, stairs leading down to the area, and garden objects that date from 1920
to 1956. The area and elements have been used for military and medical ceremonies, as well as
for recreational and therapeutic functions.

Buildings 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, 29, 29A, 30 and 35 - Officers Quarters. These eight residential
structures (and one garage, 29A) located on the west side of the campus were constructed circa
1915–1919. They were constructed outside the WRAMC but were annexed as the post expanded
to the north and west. Three of the structures remain on their original sites (21, 25 and 29).
The other five structures were originally located east of 14th Street between Dahlia and Fern
Streets. They were relocated to their current sites in 1954 as Building 54 was being constructed.
These buildings are contributing elements to the historic district and eligible under Criterion A
as representative of the development of the WRAMC campus.
Building 15 – Central Heating Plant. The Central Heating Plant was constructed in three primary
phases: 1918, 1919 and 1977. The structure is significant under Criteria A as representative of
the development of the WRAMC campus. It is a contributing building to the proposed WRAMC
Historic District.
Building 31 – Oil Storage Warehouse. The Oil Storage Warehouse was constructed in
three primary phases: 1921, 1941 and 1971. The structure is significant under Criteria A as
representative of the development of the WRAMC campus. It is a contributing building to the
proposed WRAMC Historic District.
Building 38 – Guard House. Building 38 was originally constructed as a guard house and
modified to accommodate other programmatic uses over time. The first section was constructed
in 1922 with additions in 1928, 1944, 1992 and 2004. The structure is significant under Criteria
A as representative of the development of the WRAMC campus. It is a contributing building to
the proposed WRAMC Historic District.
Building 53 – Post Theater. The Post Theater was constructed in 1950 and is therefore considered
a contributing building and is eligible under Criterion A as representative of the development
of the WRAMC campus.
Building 82 – PX Gas Station. Building 82 was originally the PX Gas Station. It was constructed
in 1940 with a two-bay addition in 1958. The structure is significant under Criteria A as
representative of the development of the WRAMC campus. It is a contributing building to the
proposed WRAMC Historic District.
Building 84 – Equipment Shed. The equipment shed was constructed in 1942. The structure
is significant under Criteria A as representative of the development of the WRAMC campus. It
is a contributing building to the proposed WRAMC Historic District.
Building 90 – Post Fire Station. The post Fire Station was constructed in 1946 with an addition
in 1995. The structure is significant under Criteria A as representative of the development of
the WRAMC campus. It is a contributing building to the proposed WRAMC Historic District.

3.12.2.2 Rock Creek Park

A portion of Rock Creek Park is located within the APE immediately to the west of the WRAMC.
Rock Creek Park was established in 1890 as one of the first federal parks. The Park is combined
with the Potomac Parkway as a single historic district resource, encompassing the rim and
gorge of Rock Creek from the District of Columbia boundary to the Potomac River, including
a short segment along the River. The property comprises approximately 180 acres, and varies
in width from a few feet at the southern end to more than 500 feet near the northern end. The
park includes a trail network through the environs, much of which follows historic bridle trails.
It also incorporates industrial structures, with the earliest dating to 1828. The Rock Creek and
Potomac Parkway, which runs north-south through the park, was authorized for construction in
1913. Construction was completed by 1936. The Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway Historic
District is significant under Criterion A for community planning and development as well as
recreation and Criterion C for the landscape architecture and engineering. This historic resource,
with a period of significance between 1828 and 1951, was listed on the NRHP in 2005.

3.12.3

Effects to Historic Resources

DOS has documented the potential effects of the Preferred Action Alternative and is working to
develop appropriate mitigation strategies. Meetings are being held with the DOS, DC-HPO, the
consulting parties, and the ACHP to identify mitigation strategies and incorporate these into a PA.
DOS would market individually eligible Buildings 40, 41 and 52 for potential reuse onsite as
chanceries. Building 57 would be retained with a reuse plan developed by DOS.
The No Action Alternative would not effect historic resources. Over time, the No Action
alternative would result in the continued deterioration of the historic resources.

Rock Creek Park

The Preferred Action Alternative would have no effect on Rock Creek Park. The Preferred Action
Alternative retains the configuration of the WRAMC at the western boundary along 16th Street
adjacent to Rock Creek Park. The existing historic perimeter fence and gate would be retained
and the boundary reinforced with a landscaped buffer along 16th Street and Alaska Avenue.

WRAMC Historic District

Implementation of the Preferred Action Alternative would result in an adverse effect to the
WRAMC Historic District. The integrity of an historic district is based on the setting, design
and association of the component parts. These are linked to the identifiable boundary, the arterial
system within the campus and the surviving resources constructed between 1909 and 1956.
The boundary and arterial system would be retained and reinforced as part of the proposed
undertaking. The Preferred Action Alternative would retain the primary vehicular arteries of
Dahlia Street (east-west) and 14th Street (north-south) and reinforce them through the proposed

Page 118

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

lot subdivisions. A secondary vehicular artery, 13th Place, may be shifted to the east but would
continue to serve as a connector between Fern Street and Dahlia Street. All non-contributing
structures within the FMC project boundary would be removed to provide lots for new construction.
Both individually eligible (Building 54) and contributing resources (Building 53 and the
residential structures) would be removed. One individually eligible resource (Building 57)
would be retained and a reuse plan would be developed for the building. Other individually
eligible resources (Buildings 40, 41 and 52) may be retained or may be removed in whole or in
part. The range of potential effects on these three buildings is addressed below. The loss of both
contributing and individually eligible resources would have an adverse effect on the integrity of
the historic district’s setting, design and association of the component elements.

WRAMC Historic District Individually Eligible Resources

The Preferred Action Alternative would have no adverse effect on individually eligible Buildings
1, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 17. These resources are located outside the project area boundary of the
proposed FMC and would not be physically altered by the proposed action. The Preferred Action
Alternative would result in the loss of some identified historic buildings within the project area
boundary of the proposed FMC. Removal of the historic buildings would reduce the visual
integrity of the campus setting for the remaining individually eligible buildings.
The Preferred Action Alternative may have an adverse effect on individually eligible Buildings 40,
41, and 52. The Preferred Action Alternative incorporates the potential reuse of all or a portion of
Buildings 40, 41, and 52. Reuse of these buildings would be contingent upon identifying a foreign
mission interested in rehabilitation and reuse to accommodate an acceptable program. If the entire
building or a portion of the building is reused, modifications would be required to the building to
comply with code, incorporate programmatic needs and provide necessary support spaces. These
modifications could have an adverse effect on character defining features. Removal or replacement
of features could have an adverse effect on the materials and workmanship of the resource.
Full or partial removal of Buildings 40, 41 and 52 would result in an adverse effect by altering or
eliminating the buildings’ existing historic location, setting, design, materials, workmanship, feeling
and association with other historic district buildings. In the case of Building 52, the setting has already
been modified from its original intent as one of a repetitive building type linked to the Main Hospital.
The Preferred Action Alternative provides for the reuse of Building 57/Memorial Chapel, but
may have an adverse effect on the resource. The programmatic use of the facility has not been
finalized. Prior to reuse, modifications would be required to comply with building code, incorporate
programmatic needs and provide necessary support spaces (toilet rooms, kitchenette, etc.). These
modifications could have an adverse effect on character defining features. Removal or replacement
of features could have an adverse effect on the materials and workmanship of the resource.
The Preferred Action Alternative would result in an adverse effect to Building 54 AFIP.
Implementation of the Preferred Action Alternative would result in the removal of Building 54,

Page 119

Environmental Impact Statement

which would eliminate the building’s historic location, setting, design, materials, workmanship,
feeling and association with other historic district buildings.

WRAMC Historic District Contributing Resources

The Preferred Action Alternative would have no adverse effect on Buildings 15, 31, 38, 82, 84
and 90. These resources are located outside the project area boundary of the proposed FMC site
and would not be physically altered by the proposed action.
The Preferred Action Alternative would result in the loss of some identified historic buildings
within the project area boundary of the proposed FMC. Removal of the historic buildings would
reduce the visual integrity of the campus setting for the remaining contributing resources.
The Preferred Action Alternative would result in an adverse effect to Buildings 19, 21, 22, 25,
26, 29, 29A, 30 and 35/Officers Quarters by removing or relocating the buildings. Five of the
buildings (19, 22, 26, 30 and 35) are not on their original sites, indicating a history of these
residential scale buildings being relocated to accommodate new development on the campus.
Reuse of the buildings outside the boundary of the proposed FMC may be pursued. Removal or
relocation would adversely affect the association of these buildings to the campus.
The Preferred Action Alternative would result in an adverse effect to Building 53/Post Theater by
removing the building. Removal would adversely affect the association of the building to the campus.
The Preferred Action Alternative may result in an adverse effect to the perimeter fence. The
Preferred Action Alternative retains the perimeter fence on 16th Street, Alaska Avenue and Fern
Street within the project area boundary of the proposed FMC. Existing gates and gate posts at
Main Drive (north side of the gate), Dahlia Street and 14th Street would remain in the their
current locations. The Preferred Action Alternative and one variation would shift 13th Place
to the east, effecting the existing gate and fence at Fern Street. The gate and fence would need
to be modified and reconfigured at this location, possibly altering the integrity of the location,
setting and/or design of the fence as it relates to the overall campus plan.
If 13th Place is moved to the east under the Preferred Action Alternative, DOS would document
the existing fence configuration prior to modifications, and develop a design for the reconfigured
fence and entrance that is sympathetic to the historic design.
The Preferred Action Alternative would have no adverse effect on Main Drive. The Preferred Action
Alternative includes curb cuts to the northern edge of Main Drive for access to new construction.
The configuration and detailing of the north side of Main Drive would not be changed.
The Preferred Action Alternative would have no adverse effects on the landscape elements to the south
of Building 1. These elements are not directly adjacent to the proposed undertaking and would not be
modified. The view shed from Building 1 is primarily looking south, away from the proposed FMC.

Page 120

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

Mitigation strategies would be fully developed and documented through the Section 106 process,
which is planned to result in the execution of a PA. Mitigation strategies for historic buildings
being retained would include:
◊

Detailed listing and documentation of character defining features (exterior and interior)

◊

Design guidelines for acceptable modifications

◊

Design review of all proposed modifications

Mitigation strategies for historic buildings being removed would include:
◊

Documentation of the building prior to partial or total removal including historic research,
drawings and photographs in accordance with EO 11593.

3.12.4

Archaeological Resources

The APE for archaeological resources is comprised of the 43.5 acres to be transferred to DOS at the
northwest corner of the WRAMC facility. It is bound to the west by 16th Street, to the northwest by
Alaska Avenue, to the north by Fern Street, to the east by Building 2/Heaton Pavilion and Building 1/
Main Hospital, and to the south by Main Drive. The latter two boundaries (to the east and south) are
within the former WRAMC, the former three boundaries (west to north) mark the limits of WRAMC.
A Phase 1A archaeological investigation has been initiated. To date, secondary source material has been
reviewed to develop a plan for subsurface inspection of open spaces to assess the level of disturbance
to the natural and cultural stratigraphy and determine the presence of or likelihood for paleosols that
could contain buried prehistoric archaeological deposits. The goal of the Phase IA investigation is to
assess the potential for the property to contain archaeological resources eligible for listing on the NRHP.
The intersection of north-south running 14th Street and east-west running Dahlia Street serves to
divide the APE into quadrants. Research and observations to date suggest that the eastern quadrants
are largely disturbed, but undeveloped areas could still contain intact archaeological deposits.
The northwest quadrant contains only two buildings, Building 21 Officers Quarters #7 and
Building 57/the Memorial Chapel. The area between the rear of the buildings, Dahlia Street,
and Alaska Avenue has been identified as potentially containing paleosols, or buried soil strata
which has the potential to contain evidence for prehistoric human activity. Approximately 75
percent of the southwest quadrant is considered to have the potential for containing paleosols.
Seven known archaeological sites with prehistoric components are mapped within approximately
2,500 feet of the APE, all within Rock Creek Park. Due to these factors, undisturbed areas should
be considered to have a high probability for prehistoric and later archaeological deposits. The Phase
IA investigation will determine the extent of area with archaeological potential within the property.

Environmental Impact Statement

While there was activity throughout the period of the Civil War across the District of Columbia
region, there was only one engagement of Union and Confederate forces that took place within
the boundary of the District. On July 11–12, 1864, the “Battle of Fort Stevens” occurred over an
area that includes the WRAMC (exhibit 3.46). Fort Stevens is located approximately 3,500 feet
south-southeast of the site. This battle is significant for its location within the national capitol,
the direct involvement of the President and that both Union and Confederate soldiers were killed
and laid to rest in the vicinity of the battle.
Development and modifications at the WRAMC and in the surrounding neighborhood have
significantly changed the appearance of the area from the time of the Battle of Fort Stevens.
The topography of the WRAMC has been systematically modified over the last century as
buildings, roadways and other features were constructed, moved and demolished. The creeks
have disappeared with the line of Cameron Creek becoming the location of the primary storm
drainage line running through the site, known as the “Luzon Tunnel.”
While development has altered the site of the battle, there have been artifacts recovered from the
WRAMC site in the intervening years. While the focal point of the battle was along the axis of Seventh
Street Turnpike (Georgia Avenue), outside the APE, troops were located over a much broader front and
battle activity most likely occurred across the entire property that became the WRAMC with the heaviest
concentration of activity occurring south of the July 12th Confederate picket line (Dahlia Street).
The No Action Alternative would not affect archaeological resources.
The Preferred Action Alternative has the potential to effect archaeological resources present in
areas of ground disturbance. This would include building foundations, buried utilities, and other
infrastructure that is placed within intact sediments. Should archaeological investigations not
be concluded prior to the execution of the PA for the project, stipulations would be included in
that document for the treatment of archaeological resources within the APE.

3.12.5

Traditional Cultural Properties

No known traditional cultural properties exist in the study area.
The No Action and the Preferred Action Alternatives would not affect traditional cultural
properties.

3.13 PETROLEUM TANKS AND HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES
The primary regulations that apply to petroleum and other potentially hazardous substances in
the study area are:

Product Stored

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

There were seven storage tanks remaining on the site of the former WRAMC (exhibit 3.48) (U.S.
Army Garrison WRAMC, 2006, 2010, 2013; Craig, 2013). The tanks have secondary containment
and are monitored by a 24-hour service for leaks (Fromal and Pierce, pers. comm., 2012):
◊

MP-17 is a 70-gallon capacity aboveground storage tank (AST) under the emergency
diesel generator for Building 32.

◊

MP-19 is a 4,550-gallon diesel fuel AST inside a walled area on the northern end of the
loading dock for Building 54.

◊

MP-16 is a 200-gallon AST underneath the emergency generator for Building 20.

◊

MP-30 is a 6,000-gallon UST east of Building 54.

◊

MP-29 is a 2,500-gallon UST east of Building 54.

◊

Unknown 1 is a 125-gallon diesel fuel AST for a generator in the mechanical room of
Building T-2.

◊

Unknown 2 is an auxiliary 100-gallon diesel fuel AST day tank for a generator in Building
T-2.

Both the No Action and Preferred Action Alternatives would represent a decrease in potential
uncontrolled storage tank petroleum releases, as compared to when WRAMC was an operational
Army Garrison, and no significant change from the current conditions.
Under the No Action Alternative, two USTs and five ASTs would remain at the site of the former
WRAMC. The tanks are used to store diesel fuel to operate electrical generators. These tanks are
double-walled and are continuously monitored for leaks by a leak detection system, except for the
auxiliary AST Unknown 2 which is empty and is disconnected from the primary tank. The tanks
would continue to be maintained in accordance with storage tank and air pollutant regulations.
The Preferred Action Alternative would result in the removal of the storage tanks and decommissioning of the generators. It is reasonable to anticipate some generators for electricity would
be installed; however, it is likely these would be smaller than the existing generators and would
have smaller fuel tanks associated with them.

3.13.2

Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)

PCBs were historically used in electrical transformers as a dielectric fluid and coolant at the site
of the former WRAMC. Historically, there were spills of PCB dielectric fluid and coolant that
resulted in contaminated areas both inside the buildings and in outside areas (U.S. Army Garrison
WRAMC, 2006, 2010, 2013). Several contaminated areas (PCB impacted soils, transformer vaults,

and transformer pads) remain on the Property (exhibit 3.48). These areas have been remediated
to meet “low occupancy area” cleanup levels (U.S. Army Garrison WRAMC, 2006, 2010, 2013).
Currently, there are no transformers using PCB dielectric fluid and coolant at the site of the
former WRAMC (U.S. Army Garrison WRAMC, 2013).
PCB contamination areas that have been identified outside of buildings are:
◊

PCB-contaminated soil was identified during the construction of the Rumbaugh Garage
in 1992, in an area adjacent to the garage (U.S. Army Garrison WRAMC, 2006). The
source of the PCBs was a subsurface transformer vault that had been installed at the
site in 1961. The transformer and the vault were removed during the construction of the
Rumbaugh Garage. Remediation of the PCB contamination was performed in accordance
with the regulations to meet “low occupancy area” cleanup levels (U.S. Army Garrison
WRAMC, 2006, 2010, 2013); however, additional impacted soil was present in the
bottom of the excavation.

◊

An area adjacent to Building 40 was impacted by PCBs due to historical pumping of
rainwater from a below ground transformer vault onto the grass (U.S. Army Garrison
WRAMC, 2006). In accordance with regulations, two feet of PCB-contaminated soil
was excavated from a roughly 50-by-50-foot area to achieve the commercial/industrial
cleanup level of 25 parts per million (ppm) PCBs (Tidewater, Inc., 2007).

◊

The two concrete transformer pads on the east side of Building 40 (north and south) and
soils surrounding the pads tested above the PCB action levels for a “low occupancy area”
(U.S. Army Garrison WRAMC, 2013). The Army stated that the transformer pads have
been remediated in accordance to regulations, and the Army plans to remediate the soils
adjacent to the transformer pads in the future (Craig, 2013).

◊

Eight underground transformer vaults are on the site of the former WRAMC (U.S.
Army Garrison WRAMC, 2013). These vaults historically had contained PCB oil cooled
electrical transformers that in some cases leaked into the vault. Some of these vaults
accumulate rainwater and periodically need to be pumped out to remove the water. The
concrete in some of the vaults is impacted by PCBs.

PCB contamination areas that have been identified inside the buildings are:
◊

A transformer exploded in the basement of Building 54, spraying the floor with PCB oil.
The area was investigated in accordance with the regulations and was designated a “low
occupancy area” (U.S. Army Garrison WRAMC, 2013).

◊

The machine shop in the basement of Building 40 was found to be contaminated with
PCB oil. The area was remediated in accordance with the regulations and was designated
a “low occupancy area” (U.S. Army Garrison WRAMC, 2013).

Page 127

Environmental Impact Statement

Under the No Action Alternative, the PCB impacted areas would remain in place.
The Preferred Action Alternative would result in the removal of PCB impacted soil and other
materials in accordance with the regulations.

3.13.3

Asbestos

The District of Columbia Municipal Regulations have requirements for the control of asbestos
(Rule 20-800 Control of Asbestos).
The Occupational Safety and Health Agency has established regulations for asbestos exposure that
address demolition of buildings containing asbestos, removal of asbestos, and its transportation
and disposal (29 CFR 1926.1101 Asbestos).
Asbestos Containing Material (ACM) has been identified in buildings 19, 21, 25, 29, 40, 41, 52,
53, 54, 57, and T-2 (U.S. Army Garrison WRAMC, 2006). The Army is performing additional
inspections that will provide more information concerning the location of ACM in buildings.
A network of steam tunnels used to heat the buildings exists beneath the site of the former
WRAMC. The steam tunnels were insulated using ACM. The main tunnels have been abated
by encapsulation, but the smaller laterals have not been abated (U.S. Army, 2006).
Under the No Action Alternative, ACM would remain in buildings and the steam tunnels.
The Preferred Action Alternative would result in the removal and disposal of ACM from buildings
and steam tunnels in accordance with the regulations.

3.13.4

Lead-Based Paint

Residential dwellings have been investigated by the Army for paints containing lead. The Army
has conducted remediation efforts for lead-based paint in many of the buildings (U.S. Army
Garrison WRAMC, 2006). Some non-residential buildings at the site of the former WRAMC
site are presumed to have lead-based paint because they were built before the ban on lead in
paints took effect in 1978.
Under the No Action Alternative, lead-based paint would remain in some of the buildings on
the site of the former WRAMC, at least for the short-term.
The Preferred Action Alternative would require building demolition in accordance with lead-based
paint regulations. Buildings to be re-used may require testing and remediation in accordance
with the regulations, depending on the future use of the building.

3.14 ENERGY
In 2006, the District of Columbia government passed the Green Building Act requiring publicly
funded new building construction to meet various Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
(LEED) requirements. In 2010, in response to EO 13514 Federal Leadership in Environmental,
Energy, and Economic Performance, DOS developed an agency sustainability plan that requires
new construction and renovations achieve a minimum LEED Gold certification along with
other agency-wide sustainability measures. EO 13514 includes the goal of a zero-net-energy
building for federal facilities by 2030. A net-zero-energy building is a general term applied to
a building using zero carbon emissions annually. The zero energy consumption principle is
gaining considerable interest as renewable energy harvesting is a means of significantly reducing
Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). With the exception of the reuse of Building 57/Memorial Chapel,
the proposed building reuse and/or new buildings would be designed, constructed and occupied
by a foreign mission. Foreign missions are not subject to these regulations, executive orders, or
guidelines; however the design guidelines for the development of the FMC would encourage
foreign missions to design to these sustainable design principles.
The LEED rating system created by the U.S. Green Building Council is the most widely used
and recognized sustainability standard in the U.S. to achieve the requirements of EO 13514.
Recognized internationally, the LEED certification system provides third-party verification that
a building or community is designed and built using strategies for improving performance across
metrics involving: energy savings, water efficiency, CO2 emissions reduction, improved indoor
environmental quality, and stewardship of resources. There are other sustainability rating systems
both in North America and around the world. Since the lots on the FMC would be developed
by foreign missions, these other rating systems may be used by the designers of the chanceries
to implement sustainable design.
The design guidelines for the FMC would encourage sustainable principles to promote
sustainability across five major credit categories:
◊

Sustainable Sites – encourages strategies that minimize the impact on ecosystems
and water resources (e.g., public transportation access, low-emitting and fuel efficient
vehicles).

◊

Water Efficiency – promotes smarter use of water, inside and out, to reduce potable
water consumption (e.g., water use reduction, water efficient landscaping).

◊

Energy and Atmosphere – promotes better building energy performance through
innovative strategies (e.g., on-site renewable energy, green power).

◊

Materials and Resources – encourages using sustainable building materials and reducing
waste (e.g., storage and collection of recyclables, materials reuse).

◊

Indoor Environmental Quality – promotes better indoor air quality and access to
daylight and views (e.g., increased ventilation, low-emitting materials).

Page 129

Environmental Impact Statement

The No Action Alternative would not impact energy use or conservation.
The Preferred Action Alternative, to comply with EO 13514, would require that the construction
of federal buildings meet LEED Gold standards and be more energy efficient than the existing
buildings. In the future, energy sources that do not produce GHGs would be sought and used
to comply with the net-zero-energy standards for buildings set forth in EO 13514 for federal
buildings. In addition, design guidelines for the FMC would recommend that each chancery
building be designed and constructed to meet LEED Gold certification standards or an equivalent
standard. These measures would reduce the amount of emissions produced by the Preferred
Action Alternative.

3.15 CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS
Earthwork, including clearing and grubbing, excavating, grading, embankment formation, and
stockpiling, would be required during the construction of the Preferred Action Alternative.
Exposed soils may result in the potential for increased site erosion and sedimentation impacts to
nearby water resources. Some of the best management practices (BMPs) that may be implemented
are:
◊

Conducting earthwork activities during a known dry season;

◊

Diverting stormwater that originates off-site away from the construction area;

◊

Minimizing the extent and duration of exposed soils by using temporary or permanent
seeding or mulching;

◊

Constructing temporary sedimentation basins;

◊

Establishing a designated equipment cleaning/washing area with measures for the
treatment of runoff prior to discharge; and

◊

Establishing an emergency response spill contingency plan.

Each individual parcel would be required to address construction BMPs and follow procedures
established in the Design Guidelines.
Localized short-term potential impacts that may occur during construction of the Preferred
Action Alternative are impacts to air, noise, vibration, traffic, and aesthetics.
Air quality impacts from construction activities would be temporary and are primarily associated
with the operation of diesel-powered equipment and the generation of fugitive dust from
excavation and earth moving activities. Air emissions from construction equipment can be
minimized by properly maintaining engines. Fugitive dust could be generated as trucks travel to
and from the construction site, and from the handling of cement, aggregate and other materials.

Page 130

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

The effect of fugitive dust would vary depending on weather conditions during periods of earth
moving activities.
Noise impacts from construction activities are a function of the noise generated by construction
equipment, the location of construction, the sensitivity of adjacent land uses, and the timing and
duration of the noise generating activity. The dominant source of noise from most construction
equipment is the diesel engine.
Construction can result in varying degrees of ground vibration, depending on the equipment and
methods employed. Operation of construction equipment causes vibrations that spread through
the ground and diminish in strength with distance. Buildings in the immediate vicinity of the
construction site respond to these vibrations with varying results ranging from no perceptible
effects at the lowest levels, low rumbling sounds and perceptible vibrations at moderate levels,
and slight damage to foundations at the highest levels.
Maintenance of traffic and construction staging would be planned and scheduled to minimize
traffic delays. Signage could be used to notify motorists of road closures and detours. Access
to local residences and businesses in the vicinity of the construction site could be maintained.
Temporary disruptions in access would be coordinated with residents and business owners.
Residents along designated truck haul routes may have to contend with the day-to-day hauling
activities associated with the construction site.
Temporary visual impacts attributed to construction activities would be greatest for those residents
immediately adjacent to the construction site. Views of heavy equipment and material stockpiles
would be commonplace for the duration of the construction activities. Fugitive dust may impede
visual quality during limited periods.
Particular attention should be given to the maintenance of public safety during the duration of
construction, given the normal hazards associated with construction. Public access to construction
sites should be prohibited to the extent possible. This can be accomplished with temporary
fencing, warning signs, or other safety precautions.

3.16 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SHORT-TERM
USE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE MAINTENANCE
AND ENHANCEMENT OF LONG-TERM PRODUCTIVITY
The No Action Alternative would not have short-term uses of the environment that would result
in impacts.

The Preferred Action Alternative would result in short-term uses of the environment. Short-term
uses of the human environment would occur during construction. Construction of the Preferred
Action Alternative would require a staging area, stockpiling area, roadway construction, and
temporary traffic increase around the construction areas. Additional short-term impacts would
be: air quality degradation from increased emissions from construction vehicles and activities,

Page 131

Environmental Impact Statement

noise impacts, other socioeconomic and community impacts from construction vehicles (possible
roadway obstructions or minor traffic detours), and wastes from construction.
The proposed action is undertaken with consideration of the current and future requirements of
the FMC. The projected benefits from property to be developed and/or redeveloped for use as
foreign missions within the District of Columbia provided by the Preferred Action Alternative
outweigh the local short-term impacts and use of resources. The proposed action is consistent
with the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity for the study area and region.

3.17 IRREVERSIBLE AND IRRETRIEVABLE
COMMITMENTS OF RESOURCES
Implementation of the Preferred Action Alternative involves a commitment of a range of natural,
physical, human, and fiscal resources. Land used in the construction of the Preferred Action
Alternative is considered an irreversible commitment during the time period that the land is
used. However, if a greater need arises for use of the land, the land can be converted to another
use. There is no reason to believe such a conversion would be necessary or desirable.
Fossil fuels, labor, and construction materials such as cement, aggregate, and bituminous material
would be expended during construction. Additionally, labor and natural resources would be
used in the fabrication and preparation of construction materials. These materials are generally
not retrievable. However, they are not in short supply and their use would not have an adverse
effect upon continued availability of these resources.
The commitment of these resources is based on the concept that the U.S. Government and
foreign governments would benefit by the Preferred Action Alternative’s provision of additional
property to be developed and/or redeveloped for use as foreign missions within the District of
Columbia. Supplying parcels for development would help to satisfy the high demand for foreign
mission facilities in the District and provide the U.S. Government/DOS with land to leverage for
reciprocal sites to build new, safer facilities overseas. The benefits are anticipated to outweigh
the opportunity cost of commitment of these resources.

3.18 INDIRECT AND CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
3.18.1

Indirect Impacts

Indirect (or secondary) impacts are defined as those that are
“…caused by the action and are later in time or farther removed in
distance but are still reasonably foreseeable. Indirect impacts include
growth-inducing impacts and other impacts related to induced changes
in the pattern of land use, population density or growth rate, and
related impacts on air and water and other natural systems, including
ecosystems” (40 CFR 1508.8b).

Page 132

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

Exhibit 3.49 - Approximate Distances of Indirect Effect Zones

The Preferred Action Alternative creates an indirect-effect zone in which indirect impacts extend
beyond the former WRAMC and the immediate surrounding areas (exhibit 3.49).
An increase in the potential for sediment loading and roadway contaminants introduced to
surface waters exists for the Preferred Action Alternative. Erosion from slopes could affect water
quality in surface waters during construction. Impacts from sedimentation caused by construction
would be temporary. Chemicals and pollutants from increased traffic create indirect impacts
particularly to surface waters and aquatic systems. As part of winter maintenance, anti-icing
chemicals with chlorides (i.e., primarily rock salt) are used to combat the effects of snow, sleet,
and ice. Salt from a road is introduced into surface waters when runoff occurs and flows are
carried into rivers and streams.
The stormwater management practices that would be implemented with the Preferred Action
Alternative would have a long-term indirect beneficial impact on surface water by reducing
stormwater runoff, improving water quality, and helping to comply with the TMDLs established
for metals and bacteria (section 3.2.1).

3.18.2

Cumulative Impacts

Consideration of cumulative effects consists of an assessment of the total effect on a resource or
ecosystem from past, present, and future actions that have altered the quantity, quality, or context
of those resources within a broad geographic scope. Under the CEQ regulations, cumulative
effects are defined as:

Page 133

Environmental Impact Statement

“…the impact on the environment which results from the incremental
impact of the actions regardless of what agency (federal or non-federal)
or person undertakes such other actions. Cumulative effects can result
from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place
over a period of time” (40 CFR 1508.7).
The cumulative-effects analysis considers the aggregate effects of direct and indirect impacts—
from federal, non-federal, public, or private actions—on the quality or quantity of a resource.
The intent of the cumulative effects analysis is to determine the magnitude and significance of
cumulative effects, both beneficial and adverse, and to determine the contribution of the proposed
action to those aggregate effects. Contributions to cumulative effects from the Preferred Action
Alternative on resources would be limited to those derived from direct and indirect impacts
of the proposed action. Because the proposed action would not result in significant direct or
indirect impact to resources, the cumulative effects analysis for the proposed action was limited
to climate change and surface waters from stormwater, as these are the resources which would
be affected by direct and indirect effects of the Preferred Action Alternative. No other resources
were considered in the analysis of cumulative effects.
The study area used for the analysis of potential cumulative impacts is approximately 1,795
acres and consists of six census tracts near the former WRAMC that encompass the Brightwood,
Colonial Village, Shepherd Park, and Takoma neighborhoods (exhibit 3.50).

3.18.2.1 Development

The year 1977 was used as the timeframe for the consideration of past actions. Building 2/
Heaton Pavillion and associated below-grade parking was constructed and ready for occupancy
on September 26, 1977. There were 5,500 rooms covering 28 acres of floor space. It offered
accommodations for 250 patients, admitting more than 14,000 a year. Over 60 clinics served
approximately 750,000 patient visits per year.
There has been some development in the study area since 1977. Past development consists of:

The Rumbaugh Garage which was built in 1993 to provide staff parking for the former
WRAMC. The garage contained 1,135 parking spaces on five levels.

◊

Fisher House #2, built in 1996, a two-story residence that provided accommodations
for Wounded Warriors and their families and was designed to resemble a free-standing
home. The rectilinear layout accommodates 5,017 square feet of floor area divided
between two floors.

◊

The Mologne House, constructed in 1997 to provide hotel style guest accommodations
for Wounded Warriors, their families, and other guests. The four-story 95,600 square foot
building provides 200 rooms in a combination of efficiencies and dormitories.

two floors.

Present development consists of public and governmental actions and known private-sector
development projects.
The eastern half of the former WRAMC is planned for redevelopment and reuse of existing
buildings. This redevelopment would provide a mix of uses pursuant to the goals developed in
conjunction with the community and the District of Columbia. The site of the former WRAMC
would have a mix of quality open spaces and retail, residential uses with diverse housing options,
commercial office and/or institutional space, medical care, and cultural and community uses. The
proposed development consists of 1,945,000 square feet of residential development; 767,000
square feet of office development; 212,000 square feet of retail development; and 176,400 square
feet of other development (DC Office of Planning, 2012).
A Walmart at Georgia Avenue and Missouri Avenue would consist of a 105,000 square foot
center and 345 underground parking spaces for employees and customers (Walmart, 2013).
Other development consists of Takoma Park’s historic main street business district and Takoma
Metro Station with the development of 150 rental apartments, 50 of which would be affordable
to people making below 60 percent of area median income (Level2Development, 2013).
The development of the Beacon Center on Georgia Avenue, which is a mixed-use project along
Georgia Avenue, wraps around the existing Emory United Methodist Church. Plans call for
58,000 square feet of new church space, two residential buildings totaling 91 units of affordable
housing, and retail space along Georgia Avenue.
The Takoma Park development is located at 6924 Willow Street. The proposed development
consists of two apartment buildings totaling 76 units with 25,000 square feet of green space.
There is no other present development within the study area.
The build out year for the Preferred Action Alternative is 2032; therefore the year 2032 was the
limit of the future time frame for reasonably foreseeable future actions.
Reasonably foreseeable development consists of the Engine 22 Firehouse Replacement and
new DC Streetcar corridors and extensions. A site for the new Engine 22 has been selected on
the southeast corner of Georgia Avenue and Butternut Street for a 30,000 square foot four bay

Page 136

Foreign Missions Center at the Former Walter Reed Army Medical Center

facility that can provide the community with Fire and EMS Service and provide underground
parking. Construction is anticipated to be completed in 2015.
The DDOT, in partnership with the WMATA, has developed the “DC’s Transit Future System
Plan” to establish a network of new streetcar lines operating in eight corridors. The extension
of the Georgia Avenue to Buzzard Point Streetcar Line (Phase 2) further north to Takoma would
extend streetcar service further north along Georgia Avenue and connect to the Takoma Metrorail
Station. It is expected to be completed by 2018 (DDOE, 2010).
No other reasonably foreseeable future development is anticipated within the study area.

3.18.2.2 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions

Contributions to cumulative resource effects from implementation of the Preferred Action
Alternative are limited to regional GHGs and stormwater concerns.
Natural processes and human activities affect GHGs. Prominent GHGs include CO2, methane,
O3, water vapor, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons. The accumulation of GHG in the
atmosphere affects the Earth’s temperature. Emissions from human activities have caused the
atmospheric concentrations of heat-trapping GHG to increase significantly. These gases prevent
heat from escaping to space, somewhat like the glass panels of a greenhouse. This accumulation
has contributed to an increase in the temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere known as climate
change. Climate change is defined by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change as: a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that
alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate
variability observed over a comparable time period (EPA, 2008).
In February 2010, the CEQ released its Draft Guidance on Consideration of the Effects of
Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions. The draft guidance proposes that projected
annual emissions of 25,000 metric tons of GHG be used as an indicator that a proposed action
may warrant analysis under NEPA for greenhouse gas emissions and climate change impacts.
The draft guidance specifically indicates that this reference point is not an absolute threshold,
but a reference point for analysis. The draft guidance recommends that agencies should seek to
include a discussion on measures that would reduce emissions and to discuss the link between
the project’s emissions and climate change from a qualitative perspective.
The District of Columbia completed a GHG emissions inventory in 2010 for the calendar year
2006. During 2006, the District of Columbia’s GHG emissions totaled 10.5 million metric tons
of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e), or 18 tons CO2e for each resident. This value is lower than
the national average of 19.6 CO2e per capita, but higher than other major cities due to energy use
by the District of Columbia’s large day-time population of federal and other workers. Exhibit 3.51
provides a breakdown of emissions by sector, including: buildings (residential, non-residential,
and federal); vehicles (indicated as VMT or vehicle miles traveled); mass transit (Metro); and
waste; and it provides a breakdown of the specific energy sources of GHG emissions, including

electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, vehicle fuel (gasoline and diesel), kerosene, and emissions from
solid waste. Electricity consumption is the largest driver of GHG emissions.
Reducing building energy use is a challenge central to the success of the Climate Action Plan.
To capitalize on the many benefits of energy efficiency and climate protection, the District of
Columbia has committed to reduce its emissions by 20 percent below 2006 levels by 2012, 30
percent below 2006 levels by 2020, and 80 percent below 2006 levels by 2050 (Government of
the District of Columbia, 2010).
The 2012 and 2020 targets have been modeled to be attainable based on what the District of
Columbia has already implemented, or has planned or proposed. Reductions in 2050 have
considerably more uncertainty surrounding them, but rely on the best information available at
the time of this writing pertaining to future changes to building codes, vehicle fuel efficiency
standards, and other innovations over the next 40 years (Government of the District of Columbia,
2010).
Climate change is likely to continue as GHG emissions are warming the planet in ways that will
have impacts on natural resources, energy use, ecosystems, economic activity, and potentially on
the quality of life. The aggregated effect of the reasonably foreseeable future actions identified
in this document would not contribute to the cumulative effects of climate change as these
actions are small in scope.
The No Action and Preferred Action Alternatives would not impact GHG emissions. The
Preferred Action Alternative may result in a slight negative effect on air quality as the proposed
action would allow more traffic in the area (see section 3.8).

3.18.2.3 Stormwater Management

Stormwater impacts have been and would continue to be influenced by land use and development.
The cumulative effect of the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future impacts consists
of an increase in impervious surfaces.
The site of the former WRAMC has a significant extent of impervious cover, accounting for
approximately 23.4 acres, or 52 percent of the area.
The DC-LRA project proposed to capture, treat, and reuse stormwater and achieve full water
reuse by 2050 through the use of a bio-retention pond, rain gardens, and curbside bio-retention
areas. This would reduce stormwater runoff to pre-developed conditions and therefore relieve
the projects of any downstream impacts. The Preferred Action Alternative would increase
impervious surfaces to approximately 35 acres. However, the Preferred Action Alternative would
be required to reduce the developed peak flows from the site of the former WRAMC to predevelopment conditions through detention, reuse, and low impact development. To accommodate
the infrastructure improvements outside of individual lots (i.e., roads, walks, open space, etc.);
detention/water quality improvement areas would be designated adjacent to the road network.
With the incorporation of rainwater harvesting and water quality improvement measures into
the network, peak discharge quantities can readily be controlled and managed to satisfy local
regulation requirements. Therefore, no constraints created by the level of development for the
site of the former WRAMC are anticipated by the storm drainage system. Each individual parcel
would be required to address stormwater requirements.

4.0 COORDINATION AND CONSULTATION
Public participation is an integral component to the
preparation of an EIS. During the process of planning
and developing the proposed action and preparing an EIS,
public participation begins with scoping of issues and key
concerns to be addressed in the analysis and documentation
and concludes with the ROD (see section 1.5).

Chapter 4 summarizes the coordination
and consultation activities performed for
this study among the federal, state, and
local agencies and the public.

Scoping is a process for determining the range of issues to be addressed in an EIS and for
identifying potentially significant issues associated with the alternatives (40 CFR Part 1501.7).
The objectives of the scoping process are to notify interested people—other federal, state,
and local agencies, tribes, and other groups—about the alternatives being considered, solicit
comments about environmental issues, alternatives, and other items of interest, and consider
those comments in the analysis and preparation of the EIS.

4.1

SCOPING

At the beginning of the study, scoping letters were mailed to 18 agencies with jurisdiction over
features within the study area or an interest in the study and its results, in accordance with the
procedural provisions of NEPA and DOS’s requirements and policies for early coordination.
Letters, accompanied by a map of the study area, description of the purpose and needs, and an
outline of the study were mailed in June 2012 to notify the appropriate agencies of the study to be
performed, request specific information, and encourage participation in the study by identifying
areas of initial concern (exhibit 4.1).
DOS held a public scoping meeting on July 19, 2012, in the District of Columbia. The public
scoping meeting was an open house with displays, a presentation, and time for public comments
and questions to be submitted for consideration in the planning of the proposed action and
preparation of the EIS. Approximately 55 people attended including residents, community
leaders, members of the press, elected officials, and District of Columbia government agency
representatives.
The open house consisted of staffed exhibits with information pertaining to the planned FMC
and the NEPA process. Comments were collected at each station and separate comment stations
were available for participants to submit comments electronically on laptops or on comment
cards. During the scoping process, the key issues of concern identified were the preservation
of trees and open space, traffic impacts, security, and historic preservation (see section 1.7).

4.2

AGENCY COORDINATION

Agency coordination is a general term referring to the process whereby government agencies
are afforded an opportunity to review and comment on the proposed action at various points in
the study and at key milestones.

Meeting

August 15, 2012

Discussion and Results
The purpose of this meeting was to initiate discussions with Federal and District agencies and
to receive comments and feedback on the planning and development of the proposed action. A
presentation was shown consisting of an overview of the proposed action, existing buildings at the
former WRAMC, the NEPA process, transportation issues, and the landscape and topography of
the former WRAMC. Agency feedback emphasized the need for: 1) providing opportunities for
reuse of historic buildings, 2) maintaining trees on western site border, 3) maintaining a relationship
between DC-LRA and FMC campuses and keeping the existing street grid, 4) maintaining the historic
perimeter fence, designing additional fencing to be compatible with the historic fence, and minimizing
the visual impact of interior fencing, and 5) respecting historic site use and DC-LRA density zones.
Attendees: DOS, NCPC, DMPED, ACHP, CFA
The purpose of this meeting was to develop a proposed conceptual framework for density and massing
on the site, create parameters for site utility development, and brainstorm concepts for potential adaptive
reuse of historic buildings. Historic buildings were discussed, and a reuse potential rating was assigned
based on the following criteria:

The buildings with the highest reuse potential rating were Buildings 57, 52, and 41. Building 40 also had
a moderately high reuse rating.
Attendees: DOS, NCPC

November 5, 2012

The purpose of this meeting was to review the progress and status of the study and to seek feedback
on the planning and development of the proposed action. Federal and District agencies provided
feedback on the proposed action. CFA recommended developing the axial connection between
Building 40 and Building 1, keeping the historic perimeter fence, and developing potential open
spaces between buildings to create campus character. The CFA expressed that the cost model
should not be the only driver of site design, and that some early concepts for discussion appeared
too suburban in character. The DC-LRA expressed concern about potential additional traffic along
Main Drive and the residential areas to the north and south of the FMC and requested coordination
between DOS and DC-LRA teams for potential east-west site connections. The NCPC expressed
potential concern about the option to restrict cross-site vehicle traffic on Dahlia Street. NCPC
suggested studying a campus quad model, possibly developing a commemoration space between
Buildings 40 and 1, and possibly repurposing Buildings 40 and 54. The DC-HPO commented
that the campus was not historically outward facing and stated the importance of reflecting how
buildings relate to each other and to the main internal streets.

Meeting

November 14, 2012

Discussion and Results
The purpose of this meeting was to develop and discuss some preliminary concepts for future
discussions: 1) developing on a “clean” site, 2) retaining Buildings 41, 52 and 57, and 3) retaining
historically significant buildings, landscapes, and cultural elements. Four preliminary concepts were
developed:
◊◊ Suburban/ICC model - Chanceries are accessed from internal DOS-owned streets
◊◊ Urban/Massachusetts Avenue model - Based on the idea that many chancery lots have
addresses on both existing and proposed public street
◊◊ Retain eligible buildings model - Based on retaining the individually eligible, historic
WRAMC buildings
◊◊ Hybrid model - Combines characteristics of the above models, and lots should front
primary roads
Attendees: DOS, DC-LRA

November 27, 2012

The purpose of this meeting was to further develop and discuss some preliminary concepts
including the preferred elements of each. The discussions of preliminary concepts focused on cost
effectiveness, ability to address community concerns raised during scoping, and effects on cultural
resources (i.e., potential for adaptive building reuse, maintaining the historic street grid and the
historic open character of campus). The results of this discussion were used to develop a broad
range of reasonable alternatives.
Attendees: DOS, DC-LRA

January 22, 2013

The purpose of the meeting was to develop a roadmap for NHPA Section 106 consultation with
input from DC-HPO and ACHP, as well as initiate discussion on the structure of a PA for the
former WRAMC. ACHP recommended the PA reference existing approval processes (e.g., NCPC
process). Known factors should be documented in clauses and written to allow flexibility for the
future. Unknown factors should be accounted for in PA clauses, such as: 1) the potential for a
separate Section 106 undertaking if a parcel is sold in a fee simple acquisition to a foreign country,
2) underground artifacts that may be discovered during construction, and 3) the potential for a given
historic building to be removed versus repurposed.
Attendees: DOS, ACHP, DC-HPO

April 16, 2013

The purpose of the meeting was to further analyze the range of reasonable alternatives. Agencies
provided feedback that action alternatives should: 1) create a strong front door presence for
chanceries along primary streets, 2) orient open green space to the front of chancery lots, and 3)
maintain historic context of Historic Building 57/Memorial Chapel by not overshadowing the
building with chanceries and consider surrounding it with green space. The results of this meeting
were used to refine the range of reasonable alternatives 1–6 and provide the DOS with criteria for
narrowing the range of alternatives.
Attendees: DOS, CFA, NCPC, DC-HPO

May 6, 2013

The purpose of the meeting was to further refine the range of reasonable alternatives. The
development and analysis of alternatives focused on strong street frontage and green spaces. The
Chapel was retained with green spaces, reusing Dahlia and 14th Streets would be appropriate,
and using Dahlia Street as the main spine linking FMC with DC-LRA was good. CFA applauded
keeping the chapel and surrounding it with green space.
Attendees: DOS, CFA

May 23, 2013

The purpose of the meeting was to further refine the range of reasonable alternatives with the
NCPC. Discussions and decisions concluded that the proposed plan made sense and is flexible to
accommodate potential differing needs of future foreign missions, and considered keeping both the
Chapel with green spaces and having Dahlia Street as a main street with green space along 14th
were good ideas. NCPC liked and saw the improved access to DC-LRA development as embracing
good urban planning and connectivity with the surrounding neighbors.

Discussion and Results
The purpose of the meeting was to further refine the range of reasonable alternatives with CFA. CFA
provided feedback that developing both 14th Street and Dahlia Street as major roads was desirable
and leaving the area around the Chapel as green space was good. Comments were that the design
was a real improvement; it was pleasing, natural, logical, worked well, and had a campus feel.

June 3, 2013

Attendees: DOS, CFA

November 14, 2013

The purpose of the meeting was to review the project status with the National Park Service
(NPS), Rock Creek Conservancy (RCC) and DC-LRA and receive feedback. NPS requested to
be a consulting party for Section 106, and that future connections between the WRAMC site and
Rock Creek Park be considered. NPS, DC-LRA and DOS will coordinate to determine potential
access locations. RCC requested that DOS and DC-LRA accommodate informational signage and/
or information kiosks about Rock Creek Park on the WRAMC site. DOS and DC-LRA agreed to
consider placing informational signage at one or more locations to be determined in the future.
Attendees: DOS, DC-LRA, NPS, RCC
The purpose of the meeting was to update CFA on the project status and receive feedback on
proposed design guidelines. CFA recommended that foreign mission fences should use established
height/height ranges, dark colors, a specified range of appropriate materials, and achieve desired
variety at gates or entrances. The design guidelines should recognize the heritage of the garden area
between Buildings 1, 40 and 41.

December 3, 2013

Attendees: DOS, CFA
The purpose of the meeting was to update NCPC on the project status and receive feedback
on proposed design guidelines. NCPC noted that the design guidelines were moving in a good
direction, and that architectural guidelines for new structures should be varied, based on proximity
to historic structures.

4.3

The purpose of the meeting was to further coordinate traffic issues with DDOT. The current 2010
traffic counts will be updated; however, the results are expected to be very similar to the 2010
counts. ICC design guidelines allow 1:1 parking ratio; DDOT would like to see a lower ratio for
FMC parking. The design team will work with NCPC to develop design guidelines using 1:1 ratio
as the worst case scenario and the following criteria:
◊◊ There will be no on-street parking allowed at the FMC
◊◊ Each foreign mission will be responsible for providing parking resources to satisfy both
proposed and future staffing levels as well as visitors. Foreign missions will need to
either house their entire employee parking on-site, or substitute alternative transportation
measures. Parking must be accommodated on each lot(s) and concealed from view in
structured parking. Visitor parking may include 4-8 surface parking spaces depending on
lot size. Where only one building is constructed, structured parking shall be underground.
If multiple buildings are planned, aboveground structured parking may be in an adjacent
structure on the lot
◊◊ During the design approval process, each foreign mission shall submit a transportation/
parking management plan for review and approval by NCPC. Plans may include
alternative transportation options in lieu of providing 100% of parking requirements on
site. Sustainable transportation plans incorporating alternative transportation are highly
encouraged.

CONSULTING PARTIES

In compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA, consulting parties were identified to consult on
potential effects to historic resources and measures to minimize and mitigate the effects. Letters
were sent to the following parties notifying them of the undertaking and asking for their interest

PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT

A public meeting was held at Tifereth Israel Temple on 16th Street, on June 18, 2013. The purpose
of the meeting was to introduce the process of complying with Section 106 of the NHPA and
receive feedback and stakeholder concerns related to historic and archaeological resources. The
meeting consisted of a presentation on the historic significance of WRAMC and a question and
answer session. The approximately 60 attendees were comprised of members of the public and
the following government and community groups:
◊ National Capital Planning Commission ◊ Brightwood Community Association
(NCPC)
◊ The Committee of 100 on the Federal City ◊ Shepherd Park Community Association
◊ Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic ◊ DC Historic Preservation Office (DC-HPO)
Development (DMPED)
◊ Advisory Neighborhood Commission 4A

◊ Advisory Neighborhood Commission 4B

◊ DC's Walter Reed Army Medical Center ◊ The Alliance to Preserve the Civil War
Local Redevelopment Authority (DC-LRA)
Defenses of Washington (APCWDW)
◊ Executive Office of the Mayor

◊ Walter Reed Society

The APCWDW and The Committee of 100 on the Federal City noted that the WRAMC can be
viewed as “sacred ground” because of the Civil War Battle of Fort Stevens. They emphasized the
need to preserve open space on the campus, and provide interpretive signage on historic resources.
DOS noted that additional research would occur to understand the level of sensitivity of the FMC
site with regard to historic and prehistoric activity, and information would be incorporated into
the master plan. DOS would support the signage program being created as a stipulation of the
Army PA and incorporate the signage program into the master plan.
The Committee of 100 on the Federal City urged DOS to consider retaining or reusing the
Officer’s Quarters buildings. DOS noted that while the quarters are not marketable for reuse as
chanceries, possible mitigation options are being considered for the buildings to be relocated
(as five of them were in 1954) for reuse by others.
A meeting was held with Advisory Neighborhood Commission 4B on November 25, 2013. The
meeting consisted of a brief presentation on the project status and question and answer session.
Approximately 50 participants attended.
A meeting was held with Advisory Neighborhood Commission Single Member District 4A01
on December 2, 2013. The meeting consisted of a brief presentation on the project status and
question and answer session. Approximately 40 participants attended.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Notice of Availability of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for
the Foreign Missions Center at the former Walter Reed Army Medical
Center, Washington, DC
AGENCY: U.S. Department of State
ACTION: Notice of Availability
SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of State (DOS) announces the availability of the
Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) on the master plan for the long-term
development of a Foreign Missions Center, under authorities of the Foreign Missions Act
of 1982, on the site of the former Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) in the
District of Columbia. Actions evaluated in the master plan consist of assignment of
federal land to foreign missions for the purpose of constructing and operating new
chancery facilities. Consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of
1969, as amended, regulations developed by the Council on Environmental Quality (40
CFR 1500), and DOS regulations for implementing NEPA (22 CFR 161), DOS has
prepared a DEIS on the alternatives considered in the master plan. In addition, the DOS is
carrying out the Section 106 review process under the National Historic Preservation Act
of 1966, through which it consults with interested parties on the potential effect of the
proposed undertaking on identified historic properties.
The master plan is intended to guide the development of a cohesive campus by
establishing design and land-use planning principles for the construction of new
buildings, roadways, open green space, and utilities, while minimizing environmental
impacts. The DEIS analyzes the potential impacts associated with a no action alternative
and six action alternatives that could potentially satisfy the purpose and need defined in
the DEIS and master plan.

DATES: This notice announces the opening of the public comment process the DOS
will use to gather input from the public on the proposed project. Please note that the
public comment period will close on March 31, 2014.

ADDRESSES: Requests for information on the DEIS should be directed to Geoffrey
Hunt, Department of State, A/OPR/RPM, HST Room 1264, Washington, D.C. 205201264, Tel. (202) 351-9077.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A “chancery” is the principal offices of a foreign mission used for diplomatic or related
purposes, and annexes to such offices (including ancillary offices and support facilities),
and includes the site and any buildings on the site which are used for such purposes. A
“foreign mission” is any mission to or agency or entity in the United States which is
involved in diplomatic, consular or other activities of, or which is substantially owned or

effectively controlled by, a foreign government; or an organization representing a
territory or political entity which has been granted diplomatic or other official privileges
and immunities under the laws of the United States or which engages in some aspect of
the conduct of international affairs of such territory or political entity, including any real
property of such a mission and the personnel of such a mission.
The need for the project is based on increased and high demand for foreign mission
facilities in the District of Columbia, a lack of large sites for foreign mission
development or redevelopment in the District of Columbia, and the need for land to use
in property exchanges with other countries. The proposed foreign missions center is
needed to primarily address the increasing scarcity of suitable properties within the
District of Columbia to locate the operations of foreign missions. This scarcity has
impacted, in certain cases, the DOS’s ability to acquire properties of considerable size in
foreign capitals nations.
Alternatives Considered
The DOS identified, developed, and analyzed the No Action Alternative and six action
alternatives that could potentially satisfy the proposed action’s purpose and need. One
action alternative, Alternative 1, and the No Action Alternative, were retained for
detailed study. The alternatives were selected in coordination with the U.S. Commission
of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission.
Alternative 1 would provide up to 24 lots for chancery development, retain the historic
Memorial Chapel building for adaptive reuse, and potentially retain other buildings for
adaptive reuse, depending on marketability. Dahlia Street and 14th Street would be
developed as connections to the surrounding neighborhoods. The existing historic
perimeter fence along 16th Street and Alaska Avenue would remain. The existing
landscape on the western boundary of the site would be enhanced to create a 50-foot
vegetated buffer, maximizing the tree canopy in that area. Access to individual lots would
be internal to the former WRAMC campus.
The No Action Alternative was included to provide a basis for comparison to the action
alternative described above as required by the NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1002.14(d)).
After careful consideration of the alternatives developed in response to the study’s
purpose and needs and in coordination with jurisdictional and interested agencies, DOS
has identified Alternative 1 as its Preferred Action Alternative because it best satisfies the
study purpose and needs, would fulfill their statutory mission and responsibilities, and
has the least adverse environmental impact.
Public Comment / Distribution
You are encouraged to become involved in this process and provide your comments or
concerns about the proposed project. The public comment period provides the public with
an opportunity to present comments regarding the content and findings of the DEIS for
the Foreign Missions Center at the former Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The DEIS
is available to the public at the website:

http://www.state.gov/ofm/property/fmc/index.htm. The DOS sends information related to
this environmental review to individuals, organizations, and government entities
interested in and/or potentially affected by the proposed project and maintains a
distribution list for this purpose. The distribution list includes: federal, state, and local
government representatives and agencies; elected officials; environmental and public
interest groups; other interested parties; and local libraries and newspapers. Copies are
being distributed for public review at the Advisory Neighborhood Commission 4A and
4B offices, the Juanita E. Thornton-Shepherd Park Library, the Takoma Park
Neighborhood Library, and the Petworth Neighborhood Library.
DOS invites individuals, organizations and agencies to submit comments. DOS requests
comments on the DEIS that focus on the potential environmental impacts of the proposed
project, reasonable alternatives, and measures to further avoid or lessen environmental
impacts. The public comment period starts with the publication of this notice in the
Federal Register and will continue through March 31, 2104. DOS will consider and
respond to comments received on the DEIS in preparing the Final EIS. Comments may
be submitted by email to: FMC.info@state.gov or by U.S. mail to: Geoffrey Hunt,
