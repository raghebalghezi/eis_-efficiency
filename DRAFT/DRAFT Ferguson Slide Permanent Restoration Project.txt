Summary
The proposed project is a joint project by the California Department of Transportation
(Caltrans) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and is subject to state
and federal environmental review requirements. Project documentation, therefore, has
been prepared in compliance with both the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Caltrans is the lead
agency under CEQA and NEPA. In addition, FHWA’s responsibility for
environmental review, consultation, and any other action required in accordance with
applicable federal laws for this project is being, or has been, carried-out by Caltrans
under its assumption of responsibility pursuant to 23 United States Code (USC) 327.
Following receipt of comments from the public and reviewing agencies, a Final
Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement (EIR/EIS) will be
prepared. Caltrans may undertake additional environmental and/or engineering
studies to address comments. The Final Environmental Impact Report/Environmental
Impact Statement will include responses to comments received on the Draft
Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement and will identify the
preferred alternative. Following circulation of the Final Environmental Impact
Report/Environmental Impact Statement, if the decision is made to approve the
project, a Notice of Determination will be published for compliance with CEQA, and
a Record of Decision will be published for compliance with NEPA.
Overview of Project Area
The project is located on State Route 140 in Mariposa County, from 8 miles east of
Briceburg, a small community anchored by a Bureau of Land Management Visitor
Center, to 7.6 miles west of El Portal (post miles 42.0 and 42.7) where the Ferguson
rockslide covered the highway with 798,000 tons of rock and debris in April 2006.
Within the limits of the proposed project and prior to the Ferguson rockslide, State
Route 140 was a two-lane, undivided highway. Following the rockslide and the
completion of a temporary detour, State Route 140 now bridges across the Merced
River, follows an old railroad grade, and then bridges back across the Merced River
to bypass the rockslide, as a one-lane road. This bypass route provides for onedirectional traffic that is controlled by traffic signals. The Merced River flows
alongside the highway within the project area, as it does throughout the Merced River
Canyon. There are no other proposed or ongoing projects within the project vicinity.

Summary

Purpose and Need
The first rockslides within the Merced River Canyon began on April 29, 2006. Since
April 2006, rockslides have damaged and blocked a portion of State Route 140
between Mariposa and El Portal. The Ferguson rockslide closed State Route 140 to
traffic from 8 miles east of Briceburg to 7.6 miles west of El Portal.
The purpose of the project is to reopen and restore full highway access between
Mariposa and El Portal via State Route 140. Full highway access for this portion of
State Route 140 means a two-lane, all-weather highway that would accommodate all
types of vehicles with some restrictions on vehicle length. The route would return to
its previous status as a California Legal Advisory Truck Route with a 32-foot
kingpin-to-rear-axle restriction. Other length restrictions include: 45 feet for single
vehicle, 60 feet for a combination vehicle, and 35 feet for a towed vehicle from hitch
to rear bumper. Currently, motorists use a temporary, one-lane bypass route to avoid
the portion of State Route 140 that was closed by the Ferguson rockslide. This bypass
route restricts vehicles over 45 feet total length from traveling along State Route 140.
It also requires that traffic stop and queue before entering the one-lane bypass route
when the traffic signal indicates the way is clear. Restoration of State Route 140
would eliminate the detour and provide full access to all traffic on State Route 140
between the town of Mariposa and Yosemite National Park. Yosemite National Park
and communities in Mariposa County rely heavily on this access for many types of
transportation that serve tourism and residents of the area. State Route 140 is an
essential link in supplying goods and services to the Mariposa, El Portal and
Yosemite communities. Two build alternatives and the No-Build Alternative are
being considered.
Proposed Action
Caltrans proposes to restore full highway access between Mariposa and Yosemite via
State Route 140 in Mariposa County, California, by repairing or permanently
bypassing the portion of State Route 140 that was blocked and damaged by the
Ferguson rockslide.
The existing detour was constructed during a declared emergency and was designed
as a temporary solution to the closure of State Route 140. Caltrans has an agreement
with the U.S. Forest Service that the pavement and structures used for the detour
would be removed once a permanent solution could be constructed. Removing these
structures and returning Incline Road to its pre-emergency condition are part of the

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  vi

Summary

proposed action. The total length of the project area is 0.7 mile. The following build
alternatives are being proposed:
Alternative R (Rockshed/Tunnel)
This alternative would construct a rockshed/tunnel (cut-and-cover tunnel) through the
talus (the debris deposited below the slide) of the slide along the existing State Route
140 alignment and grade.
Alternative T-3 (Tunnel under Slide Realignment)
This alternative would realign the highway by constructing a 2,200-foot-long tunnel
under the area of the slide.
No-Build Alternative
The No-Build Alternative would leave State Route 140 damaged and blocked by the
Ferguson rockslide. As a result of the No-Build Alternative, the temporary detour
would continue to function as State Route 140. Either general wear or damage from
flooding in a high water year would eventually require the removal of the bridges,
supporting structures, and the detour pavement, leading to the permanent closure of
State Route 140 at the section damaged by the rockslide.
The No-Build Alternative requires the same environmental analysis as the proposed
build alternatives.
Common to Build and No-Build Alternatives
In 2006 and in 2008, Caltrans installed temporary detours around the slide under a
state of emergency. Impacts from these emergency projects were identified and
presented in a Categorical Exclusion/Categorical Exemption (Appendix J), and it was
agreed that they would be mitigated with the permanent solution.
The mitigation for impacts from the emergency projects will be added to the
mitigation identified for whichever alternative is ultimately selected.
Project Impacts
The following table summarizes the potential impacts that would result from
construction of each build alternative. For comparison purposes, the existing
condition of the project area includes the temporary bridges and detour and is the
same as the No-Build Alternative in the short term.

Proposed Project

Introduction

The proposed project is a joint effort by the California Department of Transportation
(Caltrans) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and is subject to state
and federal environmental review requirements. Project documentation, therefore, has
been prepared in compliance with both the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). FHWA’s responsibility
for environmental review, consultation, and any other action required in accordance
with applicable federal laws for this project is being, or has been, carried-out by
Caltrans under its assumption of responsibility pursuant to 23 United States Code
(USC) 327. Caltrans is the lead agency under CEQA and NEPA.
Since April 2006, rockslides have damaged and blocked a portion of State Route 140
between Mariposa and El Portal in Mariposa County. The Ferguson rockslide closed
State Route 140 to traffic from 8 miles east of Briceburg to 7.6 miles west of El
Portal. Caltrans proposes to restore full highway access between the communities of
Mariposa and Yosemite via State Route 140 by repairing or permanently bypassing
the portion of the highway that was damaged by the Ferguson rockslide. The total
length of the project area is 0.7 mile. Figures 1-1 and 1-2 show the project vicinity
and location.
The project area consists mostly of steeply rolling hills that support a mixed oak
woodland forest made up of oak trees and pine trees ranging from seedlings to adult
trees. The ground is a mix of low broadleaf evergreen shrubs and grasses. Rock
outcroppings are common. The existing highway, — Incline Road (also known as the
Yosemite Valley Railroad Grade), — and the electric transmission lines are the main
human-made elements in the project area. The roadway and associated cut slopes
parallel the Merced River. The segment of the Merced River that flows through the
project area is classified as recreational (the least restrictive of the three
classifications attributed to segments of Wild and Scenic Rivers) because of the
presence of the highway and Incline Road, which provide access to the recreational
activities on the river.
Communities in the affected area include Mariposa, Midpines, and Briceburg on the
west side of the rockslide, and Yosemite Village and El Portal on the east side of the
rockslide. Within the limits of the proposed project and prior to the Ferguson

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  1

Chapter 1  Proposed Project

rockslide, State Route 140 was a two-lane, undivided highway. Following the
rockslide and completion of a temporary detour, the current State Route 140 bridges
the Merced River twice, bypassing the rockslide as a one-lane road. This bypass route
provides for one-way traffic that is controlled by traffic signals.
The first rockslides in the area began on April 29, 2006. The slide debris was
removed, and installation of steel drapery on the slide face began. On May 10, 2006,
Caltrans decided instead to install a rockfall barrier along the eastbound shoulder of
the road. The barrier was completed on May 14, 2006, but numerous large rocks fell
from another area on the east side of the slide, preventing the highway from opening
to two-way traffic. On May 16, 2006, geologists concluded that the landslide mass
was moving. The rockfall barrier was then moved to the center of the road, restricting
traffic to one-way control. The road was opened the morning of May 25, 2006 and
closed again by that evening due to another significant slide that damaged the rockfall
barrier. By May 28, 2006, major sections of the 20-foot-high rockfall barrier had been
completely covered; by then, the slide buried the highway and extended about 30 feet
into the Merced River.
In April 2006, following the first rockslide, a State of Emergency in Mariposa County
was declared by the Governor, and Caltrans was directed to request federal assistance
to reopen State Route 140. On June 17, 2006, Caltrans received approval to proceed
with the construction of a temporary detour around the slide. On August 10, 2006, the
FHWA accepted the State of Emergency and approved the use of a Categorical
Exclusion under NEPA to permit Caltrans to construct two temporary bridges over
the Merced River and a temporary single-lane detour along Incline Road.
In August 2006, Caltrans completed construction of the temporary detour that
bypassed the rockslide and, on August 18, reopened State Route 140 to vehicles less
than 28 feet long. The temporary detour consisted of two single-lane bridges that
crossed the Merced River upstream and downstream of the rockslide and connected to
a single-lane paved section of Incline Road directly across the river from the
rockslide. Traffic was controlled on this single-lane detour by signals that allowed the
passage of one-way traffic. Highway travelers experienced up to a 15-minute delay
getting through the detour. Closure of State Route 140 and the restricted vehicle
length on the temporary detour created hardships for residents and businesses in the
area and prevented tour buses and many recreational travelers from using State Route
140 to enter Yosemite National Park.

Chapter 1  Proposed Project

When the temporary detour was opened, Caltrans began work on a permanent
solution to restore State Route 140. Various alternatives were developed and studied
and then circulated to the public through an Initial Study/Environmental Assessment.
Comments that were received from the public and regulatory agencies indicated the
project could significantly affect the Merced Wild and Scenic River. Caltrans
concluded that an Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement
(EIR/EIS) would be necessary to evaluate a greater range of alternatives and their
effect on the river, extending the environmental documentation process beyond what
had been originally expected.
Mariposa County had already seen a drop in tourism-generated revenue, mostly due
to the vehicle length restriction on the temporary detour, which prevented many tour
buses and recreational vehicles from traveling to Yosemite on State Route 140.
Because the decision to prepare an Environmental Impact Report/Environmental
Impact Statement further delayed a permanent solution, Caltrans, regulatory agencies,
and Mariposa County officials began working on another temporary solution that
would accommodate vehicles of greater lengths. The new, longer-term temporary
solution involved construction of two temporary bridges across the Merced River on a
skewed alignment next to the existing temporary bridges. The first set of temporary
bridges was then removed. The skewed alignment of the new temporary bridges
allowed for a larger turning radius that could accommodate vehicles up to 45 feet
long. Traffic was still controlled through this new single-lane detour by signals. The
project was completed in June 2008.
In November 2010, Caltrans published a Draft Environmental Impact
Report/Environmental Impact Statement with six build alternatives and the No-Build
Alternative. The build alternatives included bridge configurations (C, T, and S) from
the November 2007 Initial Study/Environmental Assessment, plus a new bridge
alterative (S-2), a rockshed/tunnel alternative (R), and a tunnel behind the slide
alternative (T-3). Comments received from agencies and the public indicated a strong
objection to any bridge alternative because of the potential impact to the Merced
River, which is designated as a Wild and Scenic River.
Since the release of the November 2010 Draft Environmental Impact
Report/Environmental Impact Statement, Caltrans has been working with the U.S.
Forest Service to analyze the impacts to the Merced River. Mariposa County worked
with Assembly Member Kristin Olsen in the introduction of Assembly Bill (AB)
1973, which would allow the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to issue a
Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  3

Chapter 1  Proposed Project

one-time-only authorization of incidental take of the limestone salamander, a fully
protected species. Under the California Endangered Species Act, a take includes hunt,
pursue, catch, capture, or kill, or attempt to hunt, pursue, catch, capture, or kill.
Without this legislation, neither Alternative R nor T-3—the only alternatives that do
not include bridges (which the public objected to)—could be chosen as a preferred
alternative. With this legislation, Alternatives R and T-3 become feasible.
Additionally, the various bridge alternatives were no longer considered feasible
because of the impacts to the Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act
resource – the recreational aspects of the Wild and Scenic River. An alternative that
impacts a Section 4(f) resource can only be considered if there is no prudent and
feasible alternative to using the land. For this reason, all bridge alternatives have
subsequently been removed from further consideration.
This additional information and removal of build alternatives requires that the Draft
Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement be re-circulated to the
public for Caltrans to make a responsible decision.
State Route 140 is the preferred route for entering Yosemite National Park for many
travelers because other highways, such as Routes 41 and 120, are more difficult to
maneuver and are subject to harsh weather during winter. Communities along State
Route 140 have established businesses that rely on travelers through the area for some
or most of their sales.
The current project is funded in the State Highway Operation and Protection Plan for
fiscal year 2015/2016 under the Major Damage Permanent Restoration Program
(201.131). The project has been approved for emergency relief assistance as part of a
declared disaster under Damage Assessment Form number JMD-CT10-001-0,
approved by FHWA on September 26, 2006. A supplemental Damage Assessment
Form number JMD-CT10-001-1 was approved on April 24, 2008 to support changes
to the temporary detour. A revised Damage Assessment Form will be prepared for the
construction and support costs on the permanent restoration project when a preferred
alternative is selected.

1.2

Purpose and Need

1.2.1 Purpose
The purpose of the project is to restore full access to State Route 140 to provide a
reliable route within the limits of the Ferguson rockslide area and to keep State Route

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  4

Chapter 1  Proposed Project

140 open to vehicular and bicycle traffic, including large commercial trucks,
emergency vehicles, and recreational vehicles.
1.2.2 Need
Currently, motorists must use a temporary one-lane detour route to bypass the section
of State Route 140 that was blocked and damaged by the Ferguson rockslide. The
project is needed because access to Yosemite National Park and the community of El
Portal has been severely restricted, resulting in significant economic losses to those
areas and the surrounding community. The reduction in tourist travel through the
county resulted in the Governor declaring a State of Emergency for Mariposa County.
State Route 140 is an important all-weather transportation link to Yosemite National
Park. It is also a school bus route allowing children in El Portal and Yosemite
National Park to attend school in Mariposa.
Before State Route 140 was blocked by the rockslide, the route had full highway
access and could accommodate all types of vehicles with some restrictions on vehicle
length. It was a California Legal Advisory Truck Route with a 32-foot kingpin-torear-axle restriction. Other length restrictions include: 45 feet for a single vehicle, 60
feet for a combination vehicle, and 35 feet for a towed vehicle from hitch to rear
bumper. The detour was designed to be a temporary solution, which restricted its use
to essential traffic. Caltrans entered into an agreement with the U.S. Forest Service
stating that the structures used for the detour would be removed once a permanent
solution could be constructed.
When the highway was initially closed, an estimated 2.5 hours were added to a oneway trip between Mariposa and Yosemite or El Portal. Mariposa residents working in
Yosemite Valley, for example, saw their commutes become as much as 90 miles
longer each way. Motorists who would have used State Route 140 had to travel on
either State Route 41 or 120, routes that are harder to maneuver with larger vehicles.
These alternate routes require motorists to drive longer distances and to do so in harsh
weather conditions during winter. When the temporary detour opened, travel time for
vehicles less than 28 feet long decreased substantially, but motorists could still expect
delays up to 15 minutes in either direction by a stoplight that controls one-way traffic
on the single-lane detour.
With the new temporary bridges, vehicles up to 45 feet long were once again able to
use the highway. However, the structures supporting the temporary bridges have a
predicted lifespan of about 10 years and will ultimately require removal whether a
Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  5

Chapter 1  Proposed Project

permanent solution is provided or not. Should the structures reach the end of their
useful life before a permanent solution is in place, their necessary removal would lead
to the closure of State Route 140 at the section damaged by the rockslide. The
temporary bridges sit within the 20-year flood zone and are not expected to withstand
flood levels similar to those that occurred in the area in years past.
As the temporary closure of the highway in 2006 proved, a permanent closure of
State Route 140 would negatively affect Mariposa County and Yosemite National
Park. Such a closure would make the delivery of goods and services, as well as the
arrival and departure of tourists, more difficult and time-consuming. Local residents
who live on one side of the slide area and work on the other side would experience
much longer and more dangerous commutes. State Route 140 is essential in
supporting the Mariposa County and Yosemite communities.
The Ferguson rockslide created a debris field that is 650 feet wide by 800 feet long.
Underneath that debris field lies a section of State Route 140, damaged and covered
by rock. The rockslide also encroached nearly 30 feet into the Merced River. State
Route 140 outside the current project area has suffered rockslide damage in the past.
Since 1999, approximately $13 million have been spent on rockslide removal, slope
stabilization, rockfall barriers, and now, the construction of the temporary detours, all
within the project area.
The permanent restoration of State Route 140 would maintain full access for all types
of travelers, ranging from recreational to business, and eliminate future repair costs
caused by a repeat of the Ferguson rockslide.

Project Alternatives

Alternatives

Caltrans proposes to restore full highway access between the communities of
Mariposa and Yosemite National Park via State Route 140 in Mariposa County by
repairing or permanently bypassing the portion of the highway that was damaged by
the Ferguson rockslide. Restoration of State Route 140 would eliminate the temporary
detour now in place and provide full access to all traffic on State Route 140 between
the town of Mariposa and Yosemite National Park. This section describes the
proposed action and the design alternatives that were developed by an interdisciplinary team to achieve the project purpose and need while avoiding or
minimizing environmental impacts.
2.1.1 Build Alternatives
Caltrans created a project development team to identify alternative solutions. The
team consists of representatives from several disciplines including transportation
engineers, environmental planners, biologists, archaeologists, engineering geologists,
and hydraulics engineers. Alternative solutions created by the project development
team were evaluated based on cost, schedules, environmental effects, engineering
considerations, constructability, and project mitigation. The project development
team ensures that state and federal requirements are followed to meet state design
standards and to minimize environmental impacts and cost.
The following alternatives propose to fully reopen State Route 140 on the existing
alignment, or south of the rockslide through a tunnel.
Alternative R (Rockshed/Tunnel)
 Aligns the highway through a 760-foot-long cut-and-cover rockshed/tunnel (a
reinforced concrete box supported on concrete piles and tieback anchors) built
through the talus (debris deposited below slide) of the rock slide.


Uses the existing State Route 140 alignment and grade and keeps the highway on
the south side of the Merced River.



Provides two 12-foot-wide lanes, two 8-foot-wide outside shoulders and a 4-footwide emergency walkway on the river’s side.



Cost: $47.1 million in 2013 dollars.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  11

Chapter 2  Project Alternatives



Calls for a mandatory design exception to accommodate constructing the
rockshed/tunnel on the existing alignment, which features a roadway curvature
that does not meet current standards.



Requires construction excavation equipment be modified to operate remotely to
minimize exposure of workers to rockfall/slide hazards during construction.



Requires construction of retaining walls to block rock material from falling onto
the highway on the approach ends of the structure where it cuts into the canyon
wall.



Requires transport and disposal of an estimated 80,000 cubic yards of rock
material to a disposal site outside of the project area. This equates to
approximately 200 trips a day for 30 working days, using the typical 15-toncapacity mining trucks.

Alternative T-3 (Tunnel under Slide Realignment)
 Realigns the highway through a 2,200-foot-long tunnel built beneath the rockslide
debris field.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  12

Chapter 2  Project Alternatives



Keeps State Route 140 on the south side of the Merced River.



Provides two 12-foot-wide lanes, two 8-foot-wide outside shoulders and two 4foot-wide emergency walkways.



Cost: $225.7 million in 2013 dollars.



Requires transport and disposal of an estimated 120,000 cubic yards of rock
material to a disposal site outside of the project area. This equates to
approximately 200 trips a day for 45 working days, using the typical 15-toncapacity mining trucks.



Requires construction of retaining walls to block rock material from falling onto
the highway on the approach ends of the structure where it cuts into the canyon
wall.

Common Design Features of the Build Alternatives
 Calls for an emergency monitoring and reporting system, such as cameras within
and at entrances to the rockshed or tunnel. Also requires a tunnel operations and
maintenance facility, potentially located at the Midpines Maintenance Station,
Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  13

Chapter 2  Project Alternatives

where routine 24-hour supervision of the emergency monitoring and reporting
systems can be conducted.


Incurs future operating and maintenance costs of $1.5 million per year, to include
full-time monitoring of the rockshed or tunnel, routine cleaning, and repair and
replacement of rockshed or tunnel equipment, such as electrical systems,
structural components, and water drainage systems.



Requires transport and disposal of rock material. The exact disposal site is not
known at this phase of the project. Caltrans construction contracts allow the
selected contractor to choose the location for disposal of excess material. The
contractor can sell, use, or dispose of the material as he or she chooses, provided
all state and federal laws are followed. There are no known commercial disposal
sites in Mariposa County that have the capacity to accept all the excess material.
There are sites in Merced County, some 60 to 70 miles from the project site, that
would be suitable for disposal. Trucks would most likely travel on State Route
140 through the town of Mariposa to reach disposal destinations in Merced
County.



Once construction is complete for either of the build alternatives, the temporary
detour would be removed. All temporary bridges, including the pilings, piers,
abutments, and pedestals, would be removed to at least 1 foot below the ground.
The embankments behind the abutments would be removed, and the slopes would
be restored to their original contours. Abutments from the first temporary bridges
would also be removed in the same manner. Pavement on Incline Road would be
removed, and the road would be restored to its previous unpaved condition for use
by recreational users and the U.S. Forest Service.



Create an aesthetic design advisory committee that would be guided by Caltrans’
Context Sensitive Solutions and that would make recommendations regarding
appropriate implementation of the avoidance, minimization, and/or mitigation
measures listed in Section 3.1.5. The aesthetic design advisory committee is not a
mitigation measure, nor will the committee develop new mitigation measures. The
aesthetic design advisory committee would meet after the preferred alternative has
been selected and the recommendations of the committee would be reported in the
Final Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement.



Mitigation for impacts as a result of the emergency project (installation of
temporary bridges and pavement on Incline Road) would be added to any
mitigation proposed for either build alternative.
Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  14

Chapter 2  Project Alternatives



Culvert systems would be incorporated into the plans and specifications to
channelize, collect and discharge storm water runoff using project-specific
approved best management practices (BMPs) to minimize non-storm water
discharges into the Merced River.



No utility relocation is required.

2.1.2 No-Build Alternative
Consideration of a No-Build Alternative is required by CEQA and NEPA and
requires the same environmental analysis as the proposed permanent build
alternatives.


The No-Build Alternative would leave State Route 140 damaged and blocked by
the Ferguson rockslide, and it would leave the temporary bridges in place to
function as State Route 140. In addition, the traffic signals controlling the singlelane access through the detour would remain in operation.



The detour was constructed during a declared emergency as a temporary solution
to the closure of State Route 140. It was designed under an agreement with the
U.S. Forest Service that the pavement and structures used for the detour would be
removed once a permanent solution could be constructed. The agreement allows
the detour to remain for 10 years. In the absence of a permanent solution, the
detour would be removed when the temporary bridges or abutments fail.



The temporary bridges and the structures that support them vary in their length of
service life, depending on environmental conditions. The steel bridges themselves
may have a useful life of between 20 and 25 years. This estimate is based on
normal wear, fatigue, and corrosion of the steel components. However, the actual
service life of the bridges could depend on the flow of the river. The temporary
bridges are designed to allow a 10-year flood to pass safely underneath them, but
when greater floods (such as a 20-year flood) occur, the bridges could become
damaged to the point of failure.



The structures supporting the temporary bridges have a service life of 5 to 10
years from the date of installation in 2008. These support structures are what
determine the useful age of the detour route. They consist of bridge abutments
made partly of galvanized wire retaining walls. Between the fifth and tenth year
of use, the maintenance of these walls will increase and, by the tenth year, the
walls may require actual replacement, which would not likely be allowed by the
U.S. Forest Service. River flows resulting from a four-year flood could damage
Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  15

Chapter 2  Project Alternatives

the retaining walls and shorten their service life, leading to the closure of the State
Route 140 detour.


The temporary nature of the bridge structures and the fact that they could be
overrun with flood waters in the event of a heavy precipitation year leave the area
vulnerable to loss of highway access from a sudden failure of the structures. The
agreement with the U.S. Forest Service does not allow reconstruction of the
temporary detour bridges or abutments.



When the temporary bridges or abutments are no longer considered safe, the
temporary detour would be removed. All temporary bridges, including the pilings,
piers, abutments, and pedestals, would be removed to at least 1 foot below the
ground. The embankments behind the abutments would be removed, and the
slopes would be restored to their original contours. Abutments from the first
temporary bridges would also be removed in the same manner. Pavement on
Incline Road would be removed, and the road would be restored to its previous
unpaved condition.



Mitigation for impacts as a result of the emergency project would be required
when the temporary bridges and pavement are removed.



The No-Build Alternative does not meet standard design features, and it would
not meet the purpose and need of the project to restore the highway to its original
operation as a full-access route with some restrictions.

2.1.3 Comparison of Alternatives
Potential environmental effects, cost, and the degree to which they meet the project
purpose and need are used to evaluate the proposed project alternatives. The two
proposed build alternatives would restore full access between the communities on
State Route 140, as well as to Yosemite National Park and other recreational
opportunities. Both build alternatives are consistent with the Mariposa County
General Plan, the Sierra National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, and
the South Fork and Merced Wild and Scenic River Implementation Plan. The build
alternatives would maintain access through the project area for all types of emergency
vehicles whereas the No-Build Alternative currently provides short-term access for
emergency vehicles. The No-Build Alternative’s eventual failure and removal from
the environment would cut off emergency access through the area in the long term.
The No-Build Alternative is inconsistent with the Mariposa County General Plan and
the purpose and need of the project.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  16

Chapter 2  Project Alternatives

The build alternatives as well as the No-Build Alternative would not affect cultural
resources. The archaeological and architectural resources within the project area were
determined not to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.
Alternative R is predicted to reduce scenic quality in the area to moderately low, a
more substantial visual impact than Alternative T-3. Alternative T-3 would improve
the project area’s visual and aesthetic quality. The No-Build Alternative imposes a
short-term visual quality of moderately high with the temporary bridges in place.
With the removal of the temporary structures, the surrounding landscape would be
restored to its naturally high visual quality.
Construction activities associated with the build alternatives would cause short-term
impacts to surface water quality and could potentially create long-term surface water
impacts through storm water runoff. The temporary structures of the No-Build
Alternative would create only short-term storm water runoff impacts since the bridges
would eventually be removed. Also, either build alternative, if built, could result in a
similar chance of dispersing non-native weed species in the area. Potential hazardous
waste and materials exposures are similar in all of the alternatives in that they present
the possibility of exposure to elevated levels of arsenic along Incline Road due to soil
disturbance.
The build alternatives would have some impact on the Merced River, which is
designated as a Wild and Scenic River. Alternatives R and T-3 would not place
structures within the free-flowing boundaries of the river, but they both would affect
the outstandingly remarkable value of wildlife in the area by removing a portion of
limestone salamander habitat, resulting in the likely take of limestone salamanders.
Alternative R would remove a little more than 2 acres of salamander habitat, while
Alternative T-3 would remove a bit less than half an acre. Incline Road would be
restored to its previous condition, removing the temporary use of the Section 4(f)
property.
The No-Build Alternative would have short-term impacts on the free flow of the river
if the water level exceeds the ordinary high water mark. The temporary structures
would eventually be removed from the banks of the river, eliminating the impact to
the river. The No-Build Alternative would not affect the limestone salamander during
this alternative’s temporary lifespan or upon its removal. Incline Road would be
restored to its previous condition, removing the temporary use of the Section 4(f)
property.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  17

Chapter 2  Project Alternatives

There would be a significant amount of rock removed for both build alternatives
through cutting, blasting and drilling. Sediment from construction operations could
cause short-term impacts to water quality. Alternative R would remove 80,000 cubic
yards of the rockslide talus, requiring 200 truck loads per day for 30 working days.
Alternative T-3 would remove 292,000 cubic yards of rock, requiring 200 truck loads
per day for 105 working days. The build alternatives have the potential to cause
minor rockfall in cut areas and also offer possible exposure to future slides. For the
No-Build Alternative, the removal of the temporary bridges would restore the
geology of the project area back to its natural contours.
Impacts from construction of the build alternatives would be temporary and would
require minimal closures of the highway as traffic would be maintained throughout
construction on the current temporary detour. Closure of the detour is not expected,
though if needed would be no more than 10 to 15 minutes to move equipment in and
out of the construction area.
Blasting and drilling activities would be used to build the rockshed or tunnel, and
excess rock material would need to be hauled off to a disposal site outside the project
area. Trucks removing excess material would use the detour traffic light cycle to enter
the roadway. Trucks would most likely travel on State Route 140 through the town of
Mariposa to reach disposal destinations in Merced County. Haul loads would be
required to be within the legal amount for the route. Any damage to the state route
would be addressed by Caltrans.
Both build alternatives would include restoring Incline Road for use by bicyclists and
pedestrians. The No-Build Alternative would eventually cut off through traffic at the
project site; at that time, Incline Road would be restored, but would be accessible
only from the east side of the Ferguson rockslide. Currently, the temporary detour
places short-term impacts on bicyclists and pedestrians because Incline Road is used
as a vehicular route with no shoulders.
The build alternatives would have impacts on natural communities, although the
magnitude of those impacts varies. Alternative R would remove around 2 acres of oak
woodlands. Alternative T-3 would remove under a half acre. The No-Build
Alternative would not have any impacts on natural communities.
Both build alternatives would have some effect on special-status plant species habitat,
including copper moss, Tompkins sedge, Mariposa clarkia, and smallflower
monkeyflower. Alternative R would remove more than an acre of smallflower
Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  18

Chapter 2  Project Alternatives

monkeyflower habitat and slightly more than 2 acres of habitat for Mariposa clarkia
and Tompkins sedge. Alternative T-3 would remove 0.25 acre of smallflower
monkeyflower habitat and 0.45 acre of habitat for Mariposa clarkia and Tompkins
sedge. Alternative T-3 would also affect one to two patches of cooper moss.
The build alternatives would potentially affect some bat habitat and the habitat of the
state fully protected ringtail, at least temporarily, due to ground disturbance related to
construction. In addition, Alternatives R and T-3 would both remove potential habitat
for the state fully protected limestone salamander.
Both build alternatives and the No-Build Alternative would include mitigation for
impacts generated from the installation of the temporary bridges and detour road.
Theses impacts include:


Removal of 13 trees (8 oak trees, 1 upland tree, 4 riparian trees)



Impact to two Tompkin’s sedge plants

The estimated costs of the build alternatives range between $47.1 million for
Alternative R and $225.7 million for Alternative T-3. Table 2.1 compares the
alternatives by comparing their environmental effects, cost and construction time. For
comparison purposes, the existing condition of the project area includes the
temporary bridges and detour and is the same as the No-Build Alternative in the
short-term.

Chapter 2  Project Alternatives

After the public circulation period, all comments will be considered, and Caltrans will select
a preferred alternative and make the final determination of the project’s effect on the
environment. In accordance with CEQA, Caltrans will certify that the project complies with
CEQA, prepare findings for all significant impacts identified, prepare a Statement of
Overriding Considerations for impacts, if any, that will not be mitigated below a level of
significance, and certify that the findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations have
been considered prior to project approval. Caltrans will then file a Notice of Determination
with the State Clearinghouse that will identify whether the project will have significant
impacts, whether mitigation measures were included as conditions of project approval,
whether findings were made, and whether a Statement of Overriding Considerations was
adopted. With respect to NEPA, Caltrans, as assigned by FHWA, will document and explain
its decision regarding the selected alternative, project impacts, and mitigation measures in a
Record of Decision in accordance with NEPA.
2.1.4 Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Further Discussion
This section includes all alternatives that were considered during the project development
process but were eliminated before this draft environmental document was circulated to the
public. Information on when and why alternatives were eliminated from consideration is
included. Some alternatives were considered in early planning documents and eliminated by
the project development team, while other alternatives were studied in depth and removed by
Caltrans and the participating agencies just prior to the circulation of this draft environmental
document. Participating agencies for this project are listed on the cover page.
Alternative E (Slide Removal)
Alternative E proposed to remove the debris from the rockslide and restore State Route 140
on the existing alignment. This alternative was considered during the initial alternatives
development process and withdrawn by the project development team for the following
reasons:


The rockslide would have to be removed from the top down, which would require
building a 30-foot-wide, two-lane road on either side of the rockslide to the top of the
rockslide. Approximately 9 acres of Limestone salamander habitat would be impacted.



The rockslide contains about 800,000 cubic yards of rock material. Removing,
transporting and disposing of this material would take 200 trips each day for up to 300
working days, using the typical 15-ton-capacity mining trucks.



There is a potential that once the rockslide material was removed, additional material
upslope could begin to slide down, endangering drivers and recreational users and
potentially closing the highway again.
Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  25

Chapter 2  Project Alternatives



Based on the geology and stability of the canyon and the massiveness of the slide,
removal is not considered a viable long term solution.

These reasons remain true under the current conditions.
Alternative S-2 (Modified Viaduct Realignment)
Alternative S-2 proposed multiple bridge types to span the Merced River and fit within the
alignment of the canyon. A total of five bridge types were studied by Caltrans, which
included tied-arch, slant-leg, steel-through truss, suspension, and cable stay. This alternative
and its variations were considered during the alternatives development process for the
November 2010 Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement.
The steel-through truss, suspension, and cable stay were determined non-viable by the project
development team for the following reasons:


The topography of the Merced River canyon requires bridge spans to be placed on curved
alignments. These bridge types don’t allow for curves in the length of their span.



The confines of the Merced River canyon would not accommodate these bridges and the
approaches that would be required to meet current Caltrans design standards.



This alternative would have a direct and adverse effect to the Merced Wild and Scenic
River’s outstandingly remarkable value of Recreation and Cultural/Historic.



This alternative would have a permanent use of 0.05 to 0.07 acre of the Merced
River/Incline Road Section 4(f) property, which is prohibited if there is a feasible
alternative that avoids the use.

The tied-arch (S2-V1) and slant-leg (S2-V2) bridges were considered during the
environmental study process and were presented as viable alternatives in the November 2010
Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement. They were removed
from further consideration by Caltrans and the participating agencies for the following
reasons:


This alternative would have a direct and adverse effect to the Merced Wild and Scenic
River’s outstandingly remarkable value of Recreation and Cultural/Historic.



This alternative would have a permanent use of 0.05 to 0.07 acre of the Merced
River/Incline Road Section 4(f) property, which is prohibited if there is a feasible
alternative that avoids the use.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  26

Chapter 2  Project Alternatives

Alternative T-2 (Western Tunnel Realignment)
Alternative T-2 proposed to realign the highway south of the Ferguson rockslide by tunneling
one mile through the mountain from the existing State Route 140 alignment. This alternative
was considered during the alternatives development process for the November 2010 Draft
Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement, but was rejected by the
project development team for the following reasons:


This alternative is estimated to cost $528 million (2013 dollars). This alternative is
economically infeasible.



This alternative would take up to 7 years to build.



This alternative would require the transport and disposal of about 500,000 cubic yards of
excavated material to a disposal site outside of the project area. This equates to about 200
trips a day for 180 working days, using the typical 15-ton-capacity mining trucks.



A tunnel of this size would require 3-foot-in-diameter emergency exits placed throughout
the entire length of the tunnel to provide vertical access to the top of the mountain from
the tunnel. These vertical emergency exits would have to climb up to 2,000 feet in
elevation. Engineering, construction, and maintenance of the exits would be
economically infeasible.

Alternative A (At-grade Realignment)
Alternative A proposed to realign the highway to the northeast, spanning the Merced River
with two at-grade concrete bridges. State Route 140 would bypass the rockslide on a halfmile of Incline Road and then span the river to meet with the existing alignment. This
alternative was considered during the alternatives development process for the November
2010 Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement, but was rejected
by the project development team for the following reasons:


The design speed of this roadway alignment would be 25 miles per hour at the bridge
entrances and exits, which is non-standard and poses a safety concern for motorists.



A substantial side-hill excavation into a one-half mile section of the northern canyon wall
would be required.



Prolonged closures of the temporary detour would be necessary, denying access to
Yosemite National Park via State Route 140.



The conversion of a half-mile of Incline Road into the state highway would restrict trail
use activities to the shoulders of the road, which is prohibited if there is a feasible
alternative that avoids the use.
Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  27

Chapter 2  Project Alternatives



This alternative would have a permanent use of 3 acres of the Merced River/Incline Road
Section 4(f) property.



An ongoing slide-monitoring program would have to be established due to the potential
of future rockslides affecting the at-grade bridges.



At-grade bridges would be more vulnerable to a future rockslide.



The at-grade bridges would be built at a level below a 20-year flood event, posing a
longitudinal encroachment.

Alternative C (Open-cut Realignment)
Alternative C proposed to realign the highway to the northeast. It would span the Merced
River with a concrete bridge bypassing the rockslide, cut through the mountain across the
river from the rockslide, and then span back across the river where it would meet the existing
alignment. This alternative was considered during the environmental study process and was
presented as a viable alternative in both the November 2007 Initial Study/Environmental
Assessment and the November 2010 Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental
Impact Statement. The alternative was removed from further consideration by Caltrans and
the participating agencies for the following reasons:


This alternative would have a direct, un-mitigatable effect to the free flow of the Merced
Wild and Scenic River. Under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, any
development affecting the free-flowing condition of a Wild and Scenic River would
require a congressional waiver.



This alternative would have a direct and adverse effect to the Merced Wild and Scenic
River’s outstandingly remarkable values of Recreation and Cultural/Historic, and a direct
but not adverse effect to the outstandingly remarkable value of Wildlife.



This alternative would have a permanent use of 0.02 acre of the Merced River/Incline
Road Section 4(f) property, which is prohibited if there is a feasible alternative that
avoids the use.

Alternative T (Tunnel Realignment)
Alternative T proposed a similar realignment to Alternative C, spanning the Merced River
twice with concrete bridges. Instead of a cut through the mountain on the north side of the
river, this alternative featured a 700-foot tunnel through the mountain. This alternative was
considered during the environmental study process and was presented as a viable alternative
in both the November 2007 Initial Study/Environmental Assessment and the November 2010
Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement. The alternative was
Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  28

Chapter 2  Project Alternatives

removed from further consideration by Caltrans and the participating agencies for the
following reasons:


This alternative would have a direct, un-mitigateable effect to the free flow of the Merced
Wild and Scenic River. Under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, any
development affecting the free-flowing condition of a Wild and Scenic River would
require a congressional waiver.



This alternative would have a direct and adverse effect to the Merced Wild and Scenic
River’s outstandingly remarkable values of Recreation and Cultural/Historic, a direct but
not adverse effect to the outstandingly remarkable value of Wildlife, and short-term
impacts to Recreation and Geology.



This alternative would have a permanent use of 0.02 acre of the Merced River/Incline
Road Section 4(f) property, which is prohibited if there is a feasible alternative that
avoids the use.

Alternative S (Viaduct Realignment).
Alternative S proposed to realign the highway to the northeast, spanning the Merced River
with a bridge, following the edge of the hillside on the north side of the river with a viaduct
and retaining wall then spanning back across the river to meet the existing alignment. This
alternative was considered during the environmental study process and was presented as a
viable alternative in both the November 2007 Initial Study/Environmental Assessment and
the November 2010 Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement.
The alternative was removed from further consideration by Caltrans and the participating
agencies for the following reasons:


This alternative would have a direct, un-mitigateable effect to the free flow of the Merced
Wild and Scenic River. Under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, any
development affecting the free-flowing condition of a Wild and Scenic River would
require a congressional waiver.



This alternative would have a direct and adverse effect to the Merced Wild and Scenic
River’s outstandingly remarkable values of Recreation and Cultural/Historic, and a direct
but not adverse effect to the outstandingly remarkable value of Wildlife.



This alternative would have a permanent use of 0.03 acre of the Merced River/Incline
Road Section 4(f) property, which is prohibited if there is a feasible alternative that
avoids the use.

Affected Environment,
Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization,
and/or Mitigation Measures

This chapter explains the impacts that the project would have on the human, physical, and
biological environments in the project area. It describes the existing environment that could
be affected by the project, potential impacts from each of the alternatives, and proposed
avoidance, minimization, and/or mitigation measures. Any indirect impacts are included in
the general impacts analysis and discussions that follow.
As part of the scoping and environmental analysis conducted for the project, the following
environmental issues were considered, but no adverse impacts were identified. Consequently,
there is no further discussion regarding these issues in this document.


Growth—The proposed project is not expected to encourage unplanned growth because
the build alternatives would only reestablish full access to State Route 140 (Community
Impact Assessment, July 2007).



Farmlands/Timberlands—There is no farmland or timberland in the project area
(Community Impact Assessment, July 2007, and Visual Impact Assessment, April 2009).



Environmental Justice—There are no communities or residents in the project area
(Community Impact Assessment, July 2007).



Paleontology— The proposed project would not affect paleontological resources because
no resources have been identified in the proposed project area. (Paleontological
Identification Report, June 2007, and Updated Paleontological Identification Report,
August 2008).



Energy—The proposed project would not affect the way energy is produced or used
because the build alternatives would only reestablish full access to the section of State
Route 140 damaged by the Ferguson rockslide.

and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

3.1

Human Environment

3.1.1

Land Use

3.1.1.1 Existing and Future Land Use
Affected Environment
Current land use was identified using Mariposa County’s 2006 General Plan and the Sierra
National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan. More than half of the land in
Mariposa County is federally owned. Most notable is Yosemite National Park, which
occupies more than 250,000 acres of Mariposa County. Two National Forests—Stanislaus
and Sierra—occupy most of the land within the county. The Stanislaus National Forest is
mostly west of Yosemite and north of the Merced River. The Sierra National Forest is mostly
west of Yosemite and south of the Merced River (see Figure 1-1). The project area lies in the
Sierra National Forest. The Bureau of Land Management also owns segments of land, mostly
along the Merced River’s wild and scenic corridor.
The land within the project area is considered rural and is managed by the U.S. Forest
Service. There are no residences or businesses within the limits of the proposed project. The
Merced River, which flows through the project area, is designated as a Wild and Scenic
River under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (see Section 3.1.1.3). The existing State Route
140 operates on Forest Service land pursuant to a Special Use Permit with the U.S. Forest
Service. The temporary detour was constructed on Forest Service land through an agreement
with the U.S. Forest Service.
Environmental Consequences
The proposed project would not require or encourage a change in land use. The build
alternatives would only reestablish full access for motorists using State Route 140. Under the
No-Build Alternative, the temporary detour would remain in use until its eventual failure,
which would also require an amendment to the current Special Use Permit with the U.S.
Forest Service.
Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
No mitigation measures would be required.
3.1.1.2 Consistency with State, Regional, and Local Plans
Affected Environment
The Mariposa County General Plan (2006), the Yosemite Valley Plan (November 2000), and
the Economic Vitality Strategy and Implementation Plan for Mariposa County (November

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  32

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

2007) focus on maintaining accessibility to Yosemite National Park, rivers, lakes, National
Forests, rural scenery, scenic routes, and historic sites within Mariposa County. The plans
further promote the enhancement and preservation of the following:


Yosemite and National Forest lands



Large and intact areas of agricultural and forest lands



Separate and unique communities that support larger rural developments



Close proximity to outdoor recreation



Historic structures, ruins, and monuments

The Mariposa County General Plan addresses a broader range of goals that include land use,
economic development, transit and transportation, and historic resources. In November 2007,
Mariposa County developed an Economic Vitality Strategy and Implementation Plan with
the primary goal of improving the economy in Mariposa County through encouraging
tourism. Efforts to accomplish the goals set forth in the county’s general plan and the
economic implementation plan include the following:


Facilitating improvements to state highways that serve Mariposa County



Maintaining an effective transit system



Maintaining an effective emergency system



Preserving, protecting, and enhancing regional tourism opportunities and resources



Creating visitor access to communities and points of interest



Providing job growth and sustaining county revenues by enhancing and expanding
sectors of the economy that serve visitors



Using the county’s historic sites to increase tourism opportunities



Creating historic districts to preserve the county’s historic character

These efforts depend on State Route 140 as well as other routes to provide full access to all
communities and recreational activities within Mariposa County. Maintaining the highways
and roads in the county is an important part of accomplishing Mariposa County’s goals.
The Sierra National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan was developed to direct the
management of the Sierra National Forest. This plan provides goals for the transportation and
facility resource and requires a broad range of developed and dispersed recreation
opportunities that balance with existing and future demand. Three levels of direction make up
the Sierra National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan. The first level is the Forest
Goals and Objectives, which provide broad and overall direction for the type and amount of
goods and services the forest will provide in the future. The second level is a discussion of

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  33

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

future conditions of the forest. The third level is general Management Prescriptions and
Management Standards and Guidelines.
The Sierra National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan states that river segments
totaling 82.5 miles will be managed as part of the National Wild and Scenic River System.
Facility construction will be implemented within Scenic/Recreational river segment
designations commensurate with existing uses and conditions.
The Sierra National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan emphasizes preservation of
the free-flowing condition of selected rivers having various outstanding remarkable features
and notable values for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic River System. The plan
calls for the management of recommended segments in accordance with the Wild and Scenic
Rivers Act of 1968. Recreational segments allow recreational development along the river to
provide opportunity to engage in activities enhanced by the river. Recreational designations
do not preclude consideration of dams and/or diversions in certain situations.
The management and resource guidance in the Sierra National Forest Land and Resource
Management Plan relates to the Merced Wild and Scenic River by prescribing management
of designated river corridors according to classification and direction established in the Wild
and Scenic River management plans. The administering of permits to whitewater raft on the
Merced River would be coordinated with other agencies.
The South Fork and Merced Wild and Scenic River Implementation Plan provides for
management guidance per the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. This plan incorporates the overall
standards, recreation river zone objectives, and management guidelines.
Some of the overall standards are the following:


Cultural Resources—Maintain in a condition that will permit an evaluation of
significance.



Fisheries—Meet all Riparian Standards and Guidelines.



Transportation System—Maintain trails and roads at designated levels.



Wildlife—Maintain or improve habitat.

Management guidelines include the following:


Restrain from developing on slopes more than 25 percent.



Set back structures so as not to infringe upon the skyline as viewed from the river’s edge.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  34

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures



Maintain the existing vegetation species diversity at current levels within the river
corridor.



Limit overhead crossing of any type across the river corridor.



Require all structures that will be in view of the river to meet the motif or color
guidelines of the agency involved.



Encourage a minimum of a 100-foot setback for all newly constructed improvement and
structures from the river’s edge.



Require visual screening. Use native vegetation materials to make the facilities
subordinate with the existing landscape.

Environmental Consequences
The build alternatives would be consistent with the Mariposa County General Plan, the
Yosemite Valley Plan, and the Economic Vitality Strategy and Implementation Plan for
Mariposa County by restoring full access to all vehicle types traveling on State Route 140.
Alternative R would introduce a structural element next to the Merced River that could be
considered too evident in the landscape and would not be consistent with the Sierra National
Forest Land and Resource Management Plan. Alternative T-3 would be consistent with the
plan.
The build alternatives have been developed to meet as many of the South Fork and Merced
Wild and Scenic River Implementation Plans standards, objective and guidelines as possible.
However, the project area is in a narrow river canyon with steep sides, constraining
construction options. Alternative R does not propose an overhead crossing, but would be
within 100 feet from the river’s edge. The exposed wall of the rockshed/tunnel would be
textured, patterned, and/or colored to blend into the surroundings. Alternative T-3 would be
consistent with the plan.
The No-Build Alternative would not be consistent with any of the federal, state, regional, and
local plans because a vital transportation link between communities and access to Yosemite
National Park and other tourist activities would be eventually eliminated due to eventual
failure of the temporary bridges or their support. Failure of the No-Build Alternative would
restrict access to the outstandingly remarkable values associated with the Merced River in the
project area by eliminating motor vehicle traffic.
Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
Refer to Section 3.1.5 for mitigation measures for the visual impacts of the build alternatives.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  35

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

3.1.1.3 Wild and Scenic Rivers
Regulatory Setting
Projects affecting Wild and Scenic Rivers are subject to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers
Act (16 U.S. Code 1271) and the California Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (CA Public
Resources Code Section 5093.50 et seq.).
There are three types of Wild and Scenic Designations:
1. Wild—undeveloped, with river access by trail only;
2. Scenic—undeveloped, with occasional river access by road; and
3. Recreational—some development is allowed, with road access.
A river along with its immediate environment is included in the National Wild and Scenic
Rivers System if it possesses “outstandingly remarkable values,” defined by the Wild and
Scenic Rivers Act as “scenic, recreational, geologic, fish and wildlife, vegetation, cultural, or
other similar values.” A river designated wild and scenic shall be preserved in a free-flowing
condition, and shall be protected from water quality degradation. In addition, the river’s
immediate environments are protected for the benefit and enjoyment of future generations.
Any development affecting the free-flowing condition of a federally designated Wild and
Scenic River would require a congressional waiver of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
Affected Environment
The following reports were used to determine potential impacts to the Merced River as a
result of the proposed project: River Geomorphology Report, January 2009; supplemental
Natural Environment Study, February 2013; Historic Properties Survey Report, September
2007 and supplemental versions, June 2010 and January 2013; revised Geotechnical Design
Report, March 2008; Paleontological Report, August 2008; Water Quality Assessment
Report, January 2013; Noise Study Report, May 2010; Recreational Survey Report, June
2011; Merced River, South Fork Merced River Environmental Impact Statement, November
1991; and Merced Wild and Scenic River Section 7(a) Advanced Summary of Effect to
Rivers Values, January 2013.
The Merced River originates in the High Sierra of Yosemite National Park. The river collects
its water from Mount Hoffman, Mount Raymond, Tenaya Lake, and the Cathedral Range and
flows freely into Yosemite Valley. The Merced River creates deep canyons as it continues

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  36

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

through the Sierra and Stanislaus National Forests. The river eventually makes its way down
into the San Joaquin Valley.
The Merced River has two major branches. The main river branch goes through Yosemite
Valley. The South Fork branch starts at the southern end of Yosemite and flows through
some of the wildest and least developed land in the Sierra National Forest before it joins the
main branch just upstream of the Ferguson rockslide.
Development near the Merced River, including the former Yosemite Valley Railroad line
(now Incline Road and the temporary State Route 140 detour), occurred because of the
river’s proximity to Yosemite National Park. In 1987, designation as a federal Wild and
Scenic River was sought to protect the largely undeveloped Merced River from further
development to preserve the wild, scenic, and recreational characteristics.
The segment of the Merced River that flows through the project area is classified as
recreational (the least restrictive of the three classifications attributed to segments of Wild
and Scenic Rivers) because of the presence of the highway and Incline Road, which provides
access to the recreational activities on the river. This 5.5-mile segment extends from the
confluence of the South Fork Merced River to the northwest boundary of the Sierra and the
southeast boundary of the Stanislaus National Forest. The river here is free flowing; the
slopes alongside it are sparsely vegetated, making the river highly visible to the traveling
public. Whitewater rafting, fishing, and picnicking are popular activities along this part of the
Merced River. The outstandingly remarkable values of the Merced Wild and Scenic River
within the project area include geology, recreation, wildlife, vegetation, and
cultural/historical benefits. The details of each outstandingly remarkable value are explained
below.
The U.S. Forest Service as the river administrator has established the Wild and Scenic River
boundary for the segment of the Merced River affected by the proposed project as extending
a quarter mile above the two-year flood event (the Q2) on both sides of the river. The Q2
represents the boundaries of the river during a flood event that has a 50 percent chance of
occurring in any given year. The U.S. Forest Service has prepared an advance summary of
effects to the Merced Wild and Scenic River. See Appendix I for this summary.
Free-Flowing Condition and Water Quality
The Merced River is free flowing and runs a relatively straight path from Yosemite Valley to
the San Joaquin Valley, except for a bend to the north of the project area. The water quality
at the project area is good to excellent.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  37

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

The downstream temporary bridge was built above the Q2 flow of the river channel. At the
left (south) abutment, the river flow decreases 2 to 3 feet per second; closer to the center of
the channel, the flow increases up to 1 foot per second, causing a separation in flow and a
minor change in the flow velocity of the river.
The upstream temporary bridge was built slightly below the Q2 flow, causing a narrow strip
of decreased water level along the far right (west) bank at the abutment during larger flows.
With larger flows, the right bank pier of the bridge may impede the navigability of
whitewater rafters.
Geology
The geology outstandingly remarkable value consists of areas where metamorphic and
granite rocks contact each other, and where limestone beds form prominent escarpments.
The Merced River Canyon is a steep inner gorge with highly fractured rocks that formed as a
result of tectonic uplifting and the cutting of the Merced River. Exposure of the rocks within
the canyon has provided an opportunity for understanding the geologic history of the area.
Glaciation left its imprint on this part of the Merced River Canyon as glacial outwash
deposits.
Between El Portal and Briceburg, the river valley cuts through rocks that are geologically
significant. An interpretive sign about a quarter mile west of the Ferguson rockslide describes
the rocks within the canyon as very old metamorphic rocks (rocks changed over time by heat,
water or pressure). The bedrock in the Merced River Canyon near the Ferguson rockslide
consists of these types of rocks, primarily the phyllite and chert of Hite’s Cove. The bedrock
also contains limestone lenses or beds (small, localized areas of limestone) with an extensive
limestone bed on the west side of the horseshoe bend. This limestone bed is important
because it yielded early Triassic fossils.
Recreation
The recreational outstandingly remarkable value consists of four main recreational activities:
whitewater rafting, camping, wading/water play, and hiking. Whitewater rafting is the most
popular activity on the river within the project area and has been occurring on the river since
the 1970s, averaging 8,000 to 10,000 rafters annually. The whitewater rafting season
typically begins in March and ends in June or July depending on the snow pack.
Camping and wading/water play are not common in the area because of the steep canyon
walls found in the project area. More suitable camping and wading opportunities can be
found in the flat open terrain upstream of the project area near the Foresta Road Bridge.

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Incline Road provides opportunities for hiking and biking and is occasionally used by
equestrians.
The U.S. Forest Service is responsible for the administration of this recreationally classified
segment. The Bureau of Land Management, through a Memorandum of Understanding and
Letter of Agreement with the U.S. Forest Service, is the lead agency for managing
whitewater rafting. The Bureau of Land Management issues permits to whitewater rafting
outfitters as well as private boaters that launch boats at locations both above and below the
project area. These locations include Redbud, Indian Flat, and Briceburg. In addition to
issuing permits, the Bureau of Land Management maintains and monitors the permit system
on the Merced River. All issues affecting the recreational value of the river would be
reported to the U.S. Forest Service.
Caltrans, the Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Forest Service conducted a
recreational survey from the fall of 2008 through the summer of 2009. The survey was
designed to capture the opinions of recreational stakeholders such as whitewater rafters,
campers, hikers, bikers, and anglers, as well as the general public with regards to the
proposed project alternatives’ impacts on the recreational value of the Merced River.
The Recreational Survey was conducted on-site and on-line. The survey was announced at
local libraries and advertised through community groups and commercial rafting operators. A
total of 195 individuals responded to the survey. Respondents were asked to indicate their
reasons for visiting the river, their evaluation of the build alternatives (which included the
two build alternatives and four bridge alternatives that have since been removed from
consideration), and the perceived impact on their recreational experience of the Merced Wild
and Scenic River.
More than half (55%) of the respondents’ primary recreation activity during their visit to the
river was whitewater rafting. Hiking accounted for 14% of respondents, and camping
accounted for 7%. Other activities included swimming, fishing, sightseeing and bicycling.
Most chose this area to view the scenic beauty and be close to nature. When asked to respond
to statements about their attachment to the Merced River, respondents indicated that the river
means a lot to them, the wild and scenic status of the river is important, they identify strongly
with the river, and they are very attached to the river.
Wildlife
The wildlife outstandingly remarkable value includes important riparian-dependent wildlife
and state and federal special-status species found in the project area. The limestone

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  39

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

salamander (Hydromantes brunus) was designated as a threatened species by the State of
California in 1971. The threatened designation by the State of California indicates that the
species is at a high risk of extinction due to restricted range and few populations. Threats to
this species include gold mining operations, highway construction, water development, and
quarrying for limestone. The limestone salamander is also designated as a fully protected
species pursuant to the California Fish and Game Code Section 5050. Assembly Bill 1973
was passed in July 2012 to amend Section 5050 and add to Section 2081.9 of the California
Fish and Game Code to allow a one-time only authorization by the California Department of
Fish and Wildlife to issue a 2081 Incidental Take Permit to Caltrans for the purposes of this
project.
Limestone salamanders live in crevices of cliffs and ledges and under the canopy of foothilloak woodland, especially where the rocks are overgrown with moss. They are active during
the fall, winter, and spring rains, and become inactive during the dry hot months sheltering in
cracks, crevices, or dense leaf litter.
The limestone salamander occurs only along the following segments of the Merced River
drainage, all of which are within a 5-mile radius of the project area: the Merced River
Canyon above Briceburg; a short distance up the North Fork of the Merced River; at Hite’s
Cove on the South Fork of the Merced River; and in the area of the rockslide.
Limestone salamanders were observed during surveys at various locations on the south side
of the Merced River within the project area.
Vegetation
The wildlife outstandingly remarkable value includes state and federal special-status species
found in the project area. The Merced River Canyon is renowned nationally and
internationally for the spectacular display of wildflowers that may be seen in a good rain
year. Visitors are especially attracted to the South Fork Trail that leads to Hite’s Cove, but
the entire river corridor is an attraction because of the flowers’ visual appeal.
During plant surveys conducted at the project area, there were two unconfirmed sightings of
the state endangered Merced clarkia (Clarkia lingulata).
Cultural and Historical Landscape
The cultural and historical outstandingly remarkable value is composed of a combination of
prehistoric and historic resources as well as those of ethnographic importance to the Southern
Sierra Miwuk.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  40

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Within the project area are three historic resources: the Yosemite Valley Railroad Grade
(Incline Road), State Route 140, and historic concrete bridge piers and debris (CA-MRP1552H). There are also five ethnographic features: two prehistoric bedrock mortar sites (CAMRP-1566 and CA-MRP-2076), two naturally occurring bedrock basins similar to what
tribal elders used as medicine basins, and plant collection areas.
Historic Properties are also protected under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act, which specifically looks at the effects of a project on historic properties eligible for and
included on the National Register of Historic Places. See Section 3.1.6 for more information
on Historic Properties and the Section 106 process.
Environmental Consequences
Free-Flowing Condition
Impacts to free flow are determined by:


Alteration of the adjacent riparian habitat or floodplain.



Alteration of the upland conditions—drainage patterns into the river.



Alteration of hydrological processes—the ability for the river channel to change course or
inundate its floodplain.



Magnitude and extent of off-site change—changes that influence other parts of the river
system (up- or downstream).

Alternatives R and T-3 would not place any structures within the bed or bank of the Merced
River. These alternatives would not have long-term effects to the free-flowing condition of
the river. Construction of the build alternatives may affect or truncate seasonal drainages
during construction. However, downstream effects are not expected.
The No-Build Alternative would leave the temporary bridges in place, resulting in short-term
impacts to the free-flow condition.
Water Quality
The build alternatives would have no long-term effects on water quality because they are
outside of the river channel and culvert systems would be installed as part of the project to
collect and discharge stormwater runoff to ensure compliance with the Basin Plan. See
Section 3.2.2 for additional information on water quality. Short-term impacts on water
quality could occur during the construction of this project under the build alternatives. The
potential water quality impacts are as follows:


Increases in sediments, turbidity (cloudiness), and total dissolved solids from
construction adjacent to the river channel and removal of the temporary bridges.
Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  41

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures



Toxicity caused by chemical substances originating from construction activities.

The No-Build Alternative could cause short-term water quality impacts from bridge
maintenance activities until the eventual removal of the temporary bridges. Best management
practices and ongoing coordination with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers would continue
for the life of the temporary bridges to reduce potential impacts as much as practicable.
Geology
The contact between metamorphic rock and granite rock is 3 miles east of the Ferguson
rockslide. Because the contact of the two rock types does not occur in the project area, there
are no short- or long-term effects for the build alternatives or No-Build Alternative.
Limestone beds with prominent escarpments have been identified in this segment of the
Merced River. However, the build alternatives would not excavate near the prominent
escarpment of limestone that yielded important early Triassic fossil parts.
Recreation
The following findings resulted from the Recreational Survey:


Alternatives R and T-3 would be significantly more likely to be considered acceptable,
pleasant, desirable, and scenic than any bridge alternative (bridge alternatives were
removed from consideration).



Individuals were more positive about Alternatives R and T-3 than any bridge alternative.



Boaters perceived Alternatives R and T-3 to be safer for their recreational activity than a
bridge alternative.



63% of respondents indicated that Alternative T-3 would have the least negative impact
on their recreation experience; 25% indicated Alternative R. The other 12% selected the
various bridge alternatives that have since been removed from consideration.



Alternatives R and T-3 were perceived to be more restorative than any bridge
alternatives. Perceived restorativeness includes: the feeling of being away from it all,
fascination with the area, and the coherence and compatibility with surroundings.



Respondents indicated that Alternatives R and T-3 would provide benefits of
experiencing the river.

Rafting
Alternatives R and T-3 would not affect whitewater rafting because they would be
constructed outside the bed and banks of the river. The temporary bridges would be removed
in the late summer to avoid short-term impacts to whitewater rafting.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  42

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

The No-Build Alternative would leave the temporary bridges in place until removed either
from general wear or damage to the point of failure. Until that time, the temporary upstream
bridge center pier would remain within the river flow, requiring care in navigation. After
removal of the temporary bridges, there would be no access from El Portal to Briceburg (the
current put-in and take-out areas for rafting the Merced River), which would greatly reduce
or eliminate rafting. This alternative would financially affect the existing rafting companies,
with the loss of revenue from the annual 8,000 to 10,000 rafters.
Hiking
Impacts from construction of the build alternatives would be temporary and require minimal
closures of the highway, as traffic would be maintained throughout construction on the
temporary detour. Hikers and bikers passing through the area would also be affected by the
construction activities. See Section 3.6 for details on construction methods.
The build alternatives would restore Incline Road to its previous state so it could return to its
use as a recreational trail for hiking, biking, and access to private property and U.S. Forest
Service maintenance activities.
The No-Build Alternative would continue to restrict recreational use of Incline Road as long
as the temporary bridges remain in use as the temporary detour. Once the temporary bridges
are removed, through traffic on State Route 140 would not be possible. Trail use would be
affected most for users who access the trail from the west side of the Ferguson rockslide, as
opposed to those who live in El Portal or locations east of the project area. It is possible for
visitors to travel other routes into Yosemite National Park and then take State Route 140
west, but the extra time and fuel expenses would likely not be desirable.
Wildlife
Suitable limestone salamander habitat and the presence of this species occur on the southern
slope next to the existing State Route 140. Alternatives R and T-3 would directly remove
2.10 acres and 0.45 acre of limestone salamander habitat and likely cause a take of the
species, resulting in short-term effects from construction. Long-term indirect effect of habitat
fragmentation may also result from habitat isolation.
The No-Build Alternative does not disturb the southern slope beyond the limits of the
remaining highway.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  43

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Vegetation
Alternatives R and T-3 would cut into the slopes on the south side of the river where the
unconfirmed observations of Merced clarkia were made. Alternative R would affect 2.10
acres of habitat, and Alternative T-3 would affect 0.45 acre of potential habitat.
The No-Build Alternative would not affect the Merced clarkia potential habitat during its
lifespan or upon the eventual removal of the temporary bridges.
Cultural and Historical Landscape
The historic and prehistoric sites within the project area along with the ethnographic features
are part of the unique historic context of the Merced River Canyon. Little change has
occurred to the setting of the canyon since the construction of the historic railroad and
highway.
The build alternatives would not physically affect the historic or prehistoric resources in the
canyon, but would introduce a structural element or tunnel opening next to the Merced River,
altering the setting of the canyon. Both build alternatives would remove the temporary
bridges and pavement along Incline Road (the former Yosemite Valley Railroad) after
construction. The resulting effect to the outstandingly remarkable value of cultural and
historical landscape would be a minimal long-term effect.
Because State Route 140 is part of the historical landscape, any impacts would be reduced by
the continuation of the historical function of the transportation system.
The No-Build Alternative leaves intact the temporary bridges and pavement along Incline
Road. The eventual removal of the temporary detour would result in the closure of State
Route 140. This would greatly affect the historic function of the highway and sever a
millennia-old living transportation corridor between the San Joaquin and Yosemite valleys.
Table 3.1 summarizes the impacts to the Merced Wild and Scenic River.

Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
Free-Flowing Condition and Water Quality
Alternatives R and T-3 would not impede the free-flowing condition of the river at
the Q2 flow. Mitigation measures would not be required for these alternatives with
regard to river flow.
Management measures and best management practices would be needed to address
any water quality impacts during construction. Best management practices for roads,
highways, and bridges include the following:


Protect areas that provide important water quality benefits or are particularly
susceptible to erosion.



Limit land disturbance such as clearing, grading, cutting, and filling to prevent
erosion.



Limit disturbance of natural drainage features and vegetation.



Prepare and implement an approved Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan.



Ensure proper storage and disposal of toxic material.



Incorporate pollution prevention into operation and maintenance procedures.



Develop and implement runoff pollution controls for existing road systems.

The following pollution prevention measures are being proposed in the design of this
project:


Culverts would discharge surface runoff from the project to unlined channels. To
minimize scour (erosion), check dams, drainage inlets, and energy dissipation
systems would be incorporated into the drainage design.



Flared end sections and energy dissipation devices would be constructed at all
culvert outlets.



All ditches would be stabilized with erosion control.



Embankment slopes would be built with a slope of 1:4 or flatter.



The newly constructed slopes would be stabilized with erosion control.

Geology
There are no feasible mitigation measures for the effects of the rock material removed
by each of the build alternatives.
The entrances for both Alternatives R and T-3 would be constructed at least 150 feet
away from the flanks of the slide. Placing the entrances at this location would provide
adequate distance for more rockfall debris to accumulate without spilling onto the
highway and blocking the rockshed or tunnel. For construction of the entrances, the

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

slopes would be cut at a 1:4 ratio. A catchment area at grade, rockfall barriers, or a
combination of the two would also be required for these alternatives to protect the
roadway from potential falling rock.
Recreation
The following measures would be used to minimize the temporary construction
impacts to the recreation outstandingly remarkable value:


During the rafting season, construction would be coordinated with the U.S. Forest
Service, Bureau of Land Management, and commercial outfitters to safely allow
rafting to continue through the project area. Spotters would be placed at the
rafting put-in locations and upstream from the construction area to identify time
periods during which construction would be suspended. This method was
successfully used during installation of the temporary bridges.



Construction work in, alongside, or above the river during rafting season could
potentially impede rafting opportunities. Work may need to be suspended Friday
through Sunday during daylight hours.



During the rafting season, construction activities would be suspended for a fourday duration surrounding both the Memorial Day and July 4th holidays.



A minimum of a two-week notice would be provided to the U.S. Forest Service,
Bureau of Land Management, and the commercial outfitters prior to Caltrans
closing the river for any construction activities. Any closure of the river would
occur in mid-week, when the river has the least number of boaters. An additional
48-hour notification would occur to specify times that the river would be closed
and when the river would be opening to rafting.



Any road closures would be planned in coordination with the U.S. Forest Service,
Bureau of Land Management, and commercial outfitters. Agencies and outfitters
would be notified of the closures a minimum of two weeks in advance. An
additional 48-hour notice would be provided for specific times of planned
closures.



Trail use opportunities would be restored at the earliest possible date.

Wildlife
Alternatives R and T-3 would require a 2081 Incidental Take Permit from the
California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Under normal circumstances, this permit
would not be issued because the limestone salamander is a fully protected species.
Assembly Bill 1973 was passed in July 2012 to amend Section 5050 and add to
Section 2081.9 of the California Fish and Game Code to allow a one-time-only
Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  48

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

authorization by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to issue a 2081
permit to Caltrans for the purpose of this project. The project must begin construction
on or before January 1, 2016, which is when the authorization ends.
A construction work window may be established to prevent construction-related
activities from occurring on the southern slope during the salamander’s active season,
December through March. Environmentally sensitive area fencing in the form of 5foot orange plastic mesh as well as salamander protection fencing in the form of 24inch sheet metal would be erected if construction-related activities must be pursued
next to limestone salamander habitat and during this species’ active season.
Alternatives R and T-3 would require off-site compensatory mitigation for impacts to
the limestone salamander at an approximately 3 to 1 ratio as part of the 2081 permit.
See Section 3.3.5 for additional information on the limestone salamander mitigation.
Vegetation
Some individual plants to be affected would be transplanted with the assistance and
concurrence of the U.S. Forest Service botanist.
Caltrans biologists and landscape specialists would continue to coordinate with the
U.S. Forest Service on the planting of appropriate vegetation during and after
construction. This may include seed collection from affected Mariposa clarkia plants.
Cultural and Historical Landscape
While the bedrock mortar sites are situated away from the location of construction
activities, they would be protected during construction by designating the sites as
environmentally sensitive areas. Before construction, a professionally qualified staff
archaeologist would oversee the placement of environmentally sensitive area fencing
around each site. A Native American monitor may also be present during
establishment of the fencing. During construction, the archaeologist and a Caltrans
construction liaison would regularly inspect the fencing to ensure that it is intact and
the protected sites are undisturbed.
The build alternatives and eventually the No-Build Alternative would remove the
existing detour pavement from the Yosemite Valley Railroad Grade (Incline Road)
and restore it to its previous condition.

3.1.1.4 Parks and Recreation
Affected Environment
The project sits within the Sierra National Forest, which offers many recreational
activities, including hunting, fishing, hiking, swimming, and camping. Incline Road is
used as a bicycle, pedestrian, and equestrian trail. Refer to Section 3.1.4 Traffic and
Transportation/ Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities.
In the project area, the Merced River is designated as a Wild and Scenic River and
protected by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (refer to Section 3.1.1.3). The Merced
River is also considered a recreational resource and protected by Section 4(f) of the
Department of Transportation Act of 1966. A Section 4(f) evaluation, which is
prepared in conjunction with participating agencies, can be found in Appendix B.
The Merced River is used for whitewater rafting within the project area. Whitewater
rafting season runs from April to July, depending on the winter snow pack. Peak
flows of the river occur during April and May. Operating under permit from the
Bureau of Land Management, around eight commercial whitewater rafting outfitters
provide rafting services on the river. Rafters can rent boats out of El Portal at the Red
Bud Picnic Area and Whitewater Rafting Put-in or at the Briceburg Put-in and Takeout areas.
In addition to rafting, camping is popular in the Sierra National Forest. The Bureau of
Land Management manages several campgrounds along the Merced River. Three
campgrounds below Briceburg—McCabe Flat, Willow Placer, and Railroad Flat—
offer both tent and recreational vehicle campsites, but none is within the project area.
Yosemite National Park is east of the project area and is the main tourist attraction of
Mariposa County (see Figure 1-1). People from around the world visit the park to
sightsee, hike and camp. An average of 3.8 million people visited Yosemite National
Park for recreation each year between 2007 and 2011.
Three state highways provide access to Yosemite National Park. State Route 140,
which has gentle grades and curves, is one. State Routes 120 and 41 are the other two,
but they both have steeper grades and tighter curves than State Route 140 and are
difficult to maneuver with larger vehicles, especially during the winter. The Ferguson
rockslide temporarily eliminated State Route 140 as the most accessible route for tour
buses; State Route 140 brought buses into Yosemite National Park through the Arch
Rock entrance. With construction of the emergency project, tour buses were able to

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  50

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

access recreational activities along the highway and Yosemite National Park via State
Route 140, but that access is considered temporary.
Environmental Consequences
The build alternatives would allow visitors and recreational users full access to Sierra
National Forest and whitewater rafting opportunities as well as Yosemite National
Park. The No-Build Alternative requires the eventual closure of the highway and
prevents recreational vehicles and tour buses from accessing all recreational
activities, including visiting Yosemite National Park, by way of State Route 140.
Alternatives R and T-3 avoid permanent use of the Merced River Section 4(f)
resources. Both alternatives would have temporary impacts to Incline Road during
construction. Minimization measures used during construction and the restoration of
Incline Road to its previous condition would result in a de minimis impact. The NoBuild Alternative leaves the temporary detour on Incline Road, which is part of the
Section 4(f) resource. Since the temporary bridges and pavement will eventually be
removed and Incline Road restored to its previous condition, the No-Build Alternative
would result in a de minimis impact to the Section 4(f) resource. See Appendix B for
additional information on the Section 4(f) determination.
Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
For the build alternatives, see Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
in Section 3.1.1.3.
3.1.2

Community Impacts

3.1.2.1 Community Character and Cohesion
Regulatory Setting
NEPA established that the federal government use all practicable means to ensure for
all Americans safe, healthful, productive, and aesthetically and culturally pleasing
surroundings [42 U.S. Code 4331(b)(2)]. The FHWA in its implementation of NEPA
[23 U.S. Code 109(h)] directs that final decisions regarding projects are to be made in
the best overall public interest. This requires taking into account adverse
environmental impacts, such as destruction or disruption of human-made resources,
community cohesion, and the availability of public facilities and services.
Under CEQA, an economic or social change by itself is not to be considered a
significant effect on the environment. However, if a social or economic change is

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  51

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

related to a physical change, then the social or economic change may be considered in
determining whether the physical change is significant. Since this project would result
in physical change to the environment, it is appropriate to consider changes to
community character and cohesion in assessing the significance of the project’s
effects.
Affected Environment
A Community Impact Assessment was completed in July 2007, and an Economic
Impact Report was completed in May 2007.
Communities
Communities in the affected area include Mariposa, Midpines, and Briceburg on the
west side of the rockslide and El Portal and Yosemite Village on the east side of the
rockslide. Mariposa is the largest town in the county and supports the county’s
greatest amount of tourist accommodations. Midpines is a residential area that
surrounds a small commercial center minutes east of Mariposa. Briceburg is a small
community anchored by a Bureau of Land Management Visitor Center. El Portal is
near the entrance to Yosemite National Park in the Merced River Valley. It has a
compact residential area and a business and resort center. Yosemite Village has the
second largest population in the county. Yosemite Village houses employees of the
park as well as individuals who provide services for the park.
Schools and Childcare Facilities
A number of schools and childcare facilities serve the Mariposa County area.
Childcare facilities include the Almost Like Home Before and After Schooling
Center, the Mariposa Children’s Center, Mariposa County Head Start, Mariposa
Lutheran Childhood Discovery Program, the El Portal Child Development Center,
and the Yosemite Valley Daycare Center. Schools in the Yosemite area include
Yosemite Valley School, El Portal Elementary School, and Yosemite Park High
School. The Mariposa area schools include Mariposa High School and Mariposa
Elementary School. Many children live in one community, but attend schools or
childcare facilities in other communities, adding urgency to the need for permanent
access between the communities.
Economy and Jobs
Because State Route 140 provides a direct all-weather route to Yosemite Valley, the
communities along State Route 140 serve as hosts to thousands of tourists a year. The
Mariposa County economy is described mainly as a service-providing economy, with

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  52

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

most of its employment in accommodations, government services, retail trade, and
food service establishments.
More than half of the private economic activity and private sector jobs in Mariposa
County support tourism, serving mainly visitors on their way to and from Yosemite; a
large share of governmental expenditures relates to tourism as well. The economy has
typically been affected by the seasonal fluctuation of tourism. During the summer
months, more tourists visit the area, increasing seasonal job opportunities. During the
winter months, tourism and jobs tend to decrease. While there is a core economy in
Mariposa that serves the local residents, businesses, and government employees, the
main economic driver in Mariposa County is tourism and the businesses that support
tourism.
State Route 140 is essential for supplying goods and services to the different
communities throughout the Mariposa and Yosemite National Park area. State Route
140 is the basis of the cohesiveness between area communities.
Environmental Consequences
Immediately after the Ferguson rockslide, businesses in the communities along State
Route 140 began suffering economic losses from the diversion of tourist traffic. Even
with the original temporary detour in place, the 28-foot vehicle length restriction
prevented tour bus companies from bringing many visitors to the area.
Tour bus companies, which carry loads of tourists to the area, were forced to take
different routes to the entrance to Yosemite, bypassing the communities along State
Route 140. The companies stopped renewing contracts that use State Route 140 as a
way of getting to tourist attractions. For additional information on tour buses, see
Section 3.1.4.
These ongoing effects caused a sharp drop in the local economy, presenting the
possibility of a further economic emergency that might not be survivable for some
communities. In response, Caltrans, regulatory agencies, and Mariposa County
officials worked on a second temporary solution that allowed vehicles up to 45 feet
long to use the rockslide detour on State Route 140. The purpose of the new detour,
which opened in June 2008, was to allow tour buses to safely travel on State Route
140.
The build alternatives would provide full access throughout the communities and to
tourist attractions, which is important in maintaining community stability and family

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  53

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

and school district cohesion. Tour buses and the tourists themselves could continue to
enter Yosemite via State Route 140, supporting the Mariposa County economy and its
tourism-related businesses. Community cohesion would be maintained as goods and
services could efficiently be supplied between the communities. In addition, school
buses would no longer be affected by time delays caused by the temporary detour.
The No-Build Alternative would ultimately eliminate the bridges and close the road
due to eventual failure of the temporary bridges or their support. The failure of the
No-Build Alternative would eliminate through-access for motor vehicle traffic at the
Ferguson rockslide and between communities along State Route 140, keeping
children from being transported to schools, making service-providers unable to accept
work from the next town over, and eliminating tourism through the communities by
way of State Route 140.
Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
The build alternatives would maintain community cohesion and therefore not require
any avoidance, minimization, and/or mitigation measures.

Caltrans prepared a Community Impact Assessment (July 2007) for the proposed
project.
Law Enforcement
The Mariposa County Sheriff’s office is the main law enforcement agency for
Mariposa County, including federally owned lands. The Sheriff’s office provides such
services for the county as coroner/public administrator, animal control, search and
rescue, boating and safety on county waterways, civil service, court security,
corrections, and emergency 911 dispatches. The Sheriff’s office also provides limited
services for Yosemite National Park, although the park has its own law enforcement
unit. The California Highway Patrol is responsible for traffic enforcement and
accident investigation along the highways in the county.
The U.S. Forest Service operates the Bass Lake Ranger Station in North Fork. This
ranger station has jurisdiction over the project area and is responsible for enforcement
of federal laws and regulations governing National Forest lands and resources.

and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Fire Protection
The California Department of Forestry operates five fire stations in Mariposa County,
one of which is in the town of Mariposa. The Yosemite Fire Department provides
wild land and structural fire protection and responds to hazardous material spills,
emergency medical calls, searches and rescues, public service, and motor vehicle
accidents. The Yosemite Fire Department provides these services to Yosemite Valley,
Wawona, El Portal, and other areas of Mariposa County.
The Mariposa Public Utility District Fire Department has been providing fire
protection to the historic district of Mariposa. This fire department would also
provide and receive aid to and from the Mariposa County Fire Department and the
California Department of Forestry.
Hospitals
West of the rockslide, the John C. Fremont Hospital District operates as a countywide
independent district. The hospital is in Mariposa and provides a clinic, an extendedcare facility, in-patient beds, 24-hour trauma services, and a helicopter for emergency
air transport. East of the rockslide, the National Park Service contracts with Doctors
Medical Center for medical services within Yosemite National Park at the Yosemite
Medical Clinic. This clinic is able to treat minor injuries and medical conditions and
provide first aid for incidents occurring within the park and the El Portal area. Larger
medical emergencies must be handled by the John C. Fremont Hospital on the other
side of the rockslide.
Utilities
There are underground AT&T telephone facilities and Pacific Gas and Electric
overhead power facilities within the project area.
Environmental Consequences
The two build alternatives offer full access for emergency services, specifically
access to the John C. Fremont Hospital, which offers the only large-scale medical
care in the county. Law enforcement and fire services have been established on both
sides of the rockslide, but these services would experience unrestricted access
(without the delay of up to 15 minutes) with the build alternatives should the need for
additional services from other areas occur. There would be short-term closures and
delays for construction operations such as blasting for the rockshed or tunnel
openings. No long-term closures are expected for the build alternatives. Refer to
Section 3.6 for details on construction methods.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  55

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

The No-Build Alternative provides short-term access for emergency services with
minimal delay (up to 15 minutes) resulting from passing through the single-lane
detour. The failure of the temporary structures would eventually close the highway,
diminishing access for emergency service vehicles and equipment to the east side of
the rockslide where additional or specialized services would be needed in the local
communities. This alternative may also diminish access to specialized medical care
for those residents forced to drive 2.5 hours out of their way to get to the hospital in
Mariposa.
During construction and for the No-Build Alternative, the existing signal lights at the
entrances and exits of the detour are designed to flash during an emergency situation.
The flashing signals would allow emergency vehicles to pass through the temporary
detour with minimal delay.
Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
The build alternatives would not require any mitigation.
3.1.4

Traffic and Transportation/Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities

Regulatory Setting
Caltrans, as assigned by the FHWA, directs that full consideration should be given to
the safe accommodation of pedestrians and bicyclists during the development of
federal-aid highway projects (see 23 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 652). It
further directs that the special needs of the elderly and the disabled must be
considered in all federal-aid projects that include pedestrian facilities. When current
or anticipated pedestrian and/or bicycle traffic presents a potential conflict with motor
vehicle traffic, every effort must be made to minimize the detrimental effects on all
highway users who share the facility.
Affected Environment
The Ferguson rockslide is blocking the section of State Route 140 that links the town
of Mariposa to El Portal and Yosemite National Park. Currently, the temporary detour
serves the purpose of maintaining essential traffic through the area blocked by the
rockslide. Yosemite National Park and the communities of Mariposa County rely
heavily on full access along this highway for many types of transportation that serve
tourists and residents of the area.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  56

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Transit
Public transit systems use State Route 140 to transport people through Mariposa
County and Yosemite National Park. The VIA-Adventures Tour Service operates 45foot-long buses between the City of Merced and Yosemite Valley via State Route
140. The Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System, known as YARTS, is
another service that provides inter-county transit to Yosemite National Park. It is
designed to provide an alternative mode of transportation for both visitors and
employees of Yosemite National Park.
Buses
The main vehicle for tourism in this area is the tour bus. These buses are usually
about 45 feet long, and they are easier to maneuver along roads like State Route 140
with relatively minor curves and flatter surfaces to avoid accidents and delays. Tour
buses also deliver tourists to businesses providing lodging, food and drink, and retail
goods while on the way to Yosemite National Park.
Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities
There are no designated pedestrian and bicycle facilities in the project area. However,
bicyclists and pedestrians use the highway’s shoulders or edge of the road, and
Incline Road serves as a hiking and bicycle trail.
Environmental Consequences
The build alternatives would restore full access on State Route 140. There would be a
short-term impact on access due to the construction of either build alternative.
Impacts from the construction would be temporary and would require minimal
closures of the highway as traffic would be maintained throughout construction on the
current temporary detour. Closure of the detour is not expected, however, if needed,
would be no more than 10 to 15 minutes to move equipment in and out of the
construction area. Blasting and drilling activities would be used to build the rockshed
or tunnel, and excess rock material would be hauled off to a disposal site outside the
project area. An estimated 200 trucks a day removing excess material would use the
detour traffic light cycle to enter the roadway. To remove the excess material for
Alternative R, it would take approximately 30 working days; for Alternative T-3, it
would take approximately 105 working days.
The No-Build Alternative, which controls traffic through signal lights and has a 45foot vehicle length restriction, relies on bridge support structures with a service life
span of 5 to 10 years. When these temporary bridges fail, the highway will close,

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  57

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

cutting off through-access between Mariposa and El Portal permanently. This impact
would place a severe hardship on businesses and residents of Mariposa County.
The project would restore the recreational use of Incline Road by returning the trail to
its previous unpaved condition. At the request of the National Park Service and the
U.S. Forest Service, the build alternatives would maintain access to Incline Road for
pedestrians and bicyclists or other recreational users. All pavement used by the
temporary detour would be removed. The No-Build Alternative would eliminate the
recreational use of Incline Road throughout the life of the temporary detour.
Although they do not include designated bicycle lanes, the build alternatives would
provide 8-foot-wide shoulders in both directions, allowing access for bicyclists along
this section of State Route 140. The No-Build Alternative is a one-lane roadway with
no shoulders.
Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
During construction of either of the build alternatives, a Traffic Management Plan
would accommodate traffic on the existing temporary detour. The Traffic
Management Plan would include:


Short-term (10- to 15-minute) closures to move equipment in and out of the
construction area.



Construction staging areas on the existing highway on each side of the Ferguson
rockslide, not being used as part of the detour.

Public notification advertising the dates and location of construction activities would
be provided through media press releases, local cable and news broadcasts, a project
web page, and the Caltrans Public Information Office. Message and special
construction signs, plus highway advisory radio, would inform motorists traveling
through the construction zone. The Construction Zone Enhanced Enforcement
Program may also be used. This program improves project safety through the use of
supplemental California Highway Patrol units that assist in the management of traffic
going through the construction zone.
There would be no feasible avoidance, minimization, and/or mitigation measure for
the effects of the No-Build Alternative.

3.1.5

Visual/Aesthetics

Regulatory Setting
NEPA establishes that the federal government use all practicable means to ensure all
Americans safe, healthful, productive, and aesthetically (emphasis added) and
culturally pleasing surroundings [42 U.S. Code 4331(b)(2)]. To further emphasize
this point, the FHWA in its implementation of NEPA [23 U.S. Code 109(h)] directs
that final decisions regarding projects are to be made in the best overall public interest
taking into account adverse environmental impacts, including among others, the
destruction or disruption of aesthetic values.
Likewise, CEQA establishes that it is the policy of the state to take all action
necessary to provide the people of the state “with…enjoyment of aesthetic, natural,
scenic and historic environmental qualities” [CA Public Resources Code Section
21001(b)].
Affected Environment
A Visual Impact Assessment for the project was completed in April 2009. This
assessment was prepared in accordance with the methodologies established by the
FHWA’s Visual Impact Assessment for Highway Projects Guidance (1981).
Land in the project area is mostly steeply rolling hills that support a mixed oak
woodland forest. The forest is made up of oak trees and pine trees ranging from
seedlings to adult trees. Pines generally grow on the drier south- and west-facing
slopes; the oak trees grow on the north- and east-facing slopes. The ground is a mix
of low broadleaf evergreen shrubs and grasses. Rock outcroppings are common.
The existing highway, Incline Road grade, and the electric transmission lines are the
main human-made elements in the project area. The roadway and associated cut
slopes parallel the Merced River. The steep slopes and winding nature of the river
confine the views of roadway travelers, river users, and recreational trail users.
Roadway travelers are composed of tourists, sightseers, recreational users, local
residents, work commuters, commercial and service-related travelers, and often
bicyclists. River users are rafters and kayakers and people fishing from the river bank.
Trail users include hikers, bicyclists, and horseback riders using Incline Road.
State Route 140 is designated as a Scenic Highway from its junction with State Route
49 in Mariposa to Yosemite National Park. The intent of the California Scenic

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  59

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Highway Program is to protect and enhance the natural scenic beauty of the highways
by means of special conservation treatments.
Criteria from the FHWA Visual Impact Assessment for Highway Projects Guidance
were used to describe the visual character of the project area. The criteria include the
following:


Vividness or the memorable strength of the landscape components as they
combine in a distinctive visual pattern.



Intactness or the visual integrity of the landscape and its freedom from nontypical encroaching elements.



Unity or the visual harmony of the landscape considered as a whole.

The overall visual quality of the landscape within the Merced River Canyon (free of
structures) is high with high vividness and unity and moderately high intactness
because of the aesthetic appeal of the vegetated slopes and the patterns created
between the vegetation and the rock outcroppings. However, existing conditions with
the temporary bridges and detour in place define the project area as having a
moderately high overall visual quality. The overall visual quality is measured by
averaging the vividness, intactness, and unity.
Environmental Consequences
Table 3.2 summarizes the overall visual quality assigned to each of the alternatives as
they affect the driver, the river user, and the trail users. A description of each
alternative’s visual quality as it affects those users is explained below. For
comparison purposes, the existing condition of the project area includes the
temporary bridges and detour and is the same as the No-Build Alternative in the
short-term. Simulations of proposed views are shown in Figures 3-1 and 3-2.

Figure 3-2 Alternative R Rockshed/Tunnel Side View

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  62

Alternative R
For the approaching driver, the 760-foot-long rockshed/tunnel along with its entrance
walls would be a new element in the landscape. As the driver passes through the
rockshed/tunnel, views of the outside scenery would be partially blocked. The
blocking of the outside scenery and the view of an exposed rockshed/tunnel wall by
approaching drivers would decrease the visual quality from moderately high to
moderate.
For river users and especially rafters, the 15- to 20-foot-high rockshed/tunnel walls
would be very noticeable as the river flows toward and then passes by the roadway
alignment. The benefit is that there would be no bridges to block views over the river.
The visual quality would be reduced to moderately low.
For trail users, views of the rockshed/tunnel wall would be very similar to that of the
river user, except that certain trees or other vegetation may obscure some portions of
the wall. Given the presence of the exposed rockshed/tunnel wall, the visual quality
would drop from moderately high to moderately low.
Alternative T-3
Much like with Alternative R, the driver would see new elements such as the entrance
walls and tunnel walls. But, at 2,200 feet, the T-3 tunnel is much longer. All views of
the outside landscape would be blocked as the tunnel curves under the rockslide.
Since the tunnel entrance walls would be the only outside visible feature, the visual
quality would be maintained at moderately high.
River and trail users alike would notice the entrance walls to the tunnel, especially as
the river flows and trail winds northwest and directly toward one of the entrances.
These entrance walls would not have a substantial presence within the much larger
canyon wall. This alternative also has the benefit of no bridges that would block
views over the river. The visual quality is expected to improve to high.
No-Build Alternative
For drivers, river users, and trail users, the temporary bridges, guardrail, detour
pavement, and signal lights define the project area as having a short-term visual
quality of moderately high. The minimal disturbance to the surrounding vegetation
has softened the appearance of the engineered elements such as the bridges, but they
do not visually fit within the surrounding landscape. With the eventual failure of the

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

temporary bridge structures, their removal will be required. The engineered elements
would be removed from the landscape, and the scenery would be restored to its
naturally high rating.
Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
With implementation of avoidance, minimization, and/or mitigation measures, the
visual impacts of the build alternatives would be reduced and would not result in
substantial changes in scenic quality. The measures would further avoid affecting the
designation of State Route 140 as a Scenic Highway. The following measures apply
to both of the build alternatives and would maintain the visual quality of the area if
the project were built:


Provide a landscape architect during construction as needed to oversee tree and
native vegetation preservation, structural aesthetic applications, and replanting the
project area.



Round toes and tops of slopes to create a more natural appearance.



Create a natural appearance to any rock outcropping exposed by construction and
stain it to give a weathered look.



Roughen new slopes to create the look of age.



Apply erosion control to all disturbed slopes except rock outcroppings and
prevent runoff into the river.



Remove existing roadway paving, barriers, and other elements associated with
unused portions of State Route 140.



Where possible, salvage, stockpile, and replace topsoil and duff containing seeds
and organic matter from affected areas. Where possible exposed slopes would
receive a minimum of 4 inches of topsoil.



Replace or add plant materials in specific areas, such as the tunnel entrances and
removed temporary bridge footings, to visually mitigate for structure heights and
cut slopes. Planting ratios shall be a minimum of 1:1, and species mix shall be
developed in consultation with the U.S. Forest Service.



Replant using native species and create natural-appearing patterns.



Implement a minimum three-year plant establishment period during which
supplemental irrigation would be provided to new plants where horticulturally
appropriate.



Restore Incline Road to its previous condition by removing all pavement and
temporary bridge abutments.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  64

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures



Design all visible exterior and interior portions of the rockshed or tunnel to be
visually compatible with the natural setting of the State Route 140 corridor.



Provide texture or pattern to tunnel entrances, and/or exposed walls or visible to
drivers and recreational users of the river canyon.



Use colors on structures that blend into the surroundings.



Use darkened metal elements or non-reflective surfaces for guardrails and posts.



Bury culverts when possible, and add color or texture to any exposed sections to
fit the landscape.

3.1.6

Cultural Resources

Regulatory Setting
The term “cultural resources” as used in this document refers to all historical and
archaeological resources, regardless of significance. Laws and regulations dealing
with cultural resources include the following.
The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, sets forth national
policy and procedures regarding historic properties, defined as districts, sites,
buildings, structures, and objects included in or eligible for the National Register of
Historic Places. Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act requires federal
agencies to take into account the effects of their undertakings on such properties and
to allow the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation the opportunity to comment
on those undertakings, following regulations issued by the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation (36 Code of Federal Regulations 800). On January 1, 2004, a
Section 106 Programmatic Agreement among the Advisory Council, FHWA, State
Historic Preservation Officer, and Caltrans went into effect for Caltrans projects, both
state and local, with FHWA involvement. The Programmatic Agreement implements
the Advisory Council’s regulations, 36 Code of Federal Regulations 800, streamlining
the Section 106 process and delegating certain responsibilities to Caltrans. The
FHWA’s responsibilities under the agreement have been assigned to Caltrans as part
of the Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program (23 Code of Federal
Regulations 773).
The Archaeological Resources Protection Act applies when a project may involve
archaeological resources located on federal or tribal land. This act requires that a
permit be obtained before excavation of an archaeological resource on such land can
take place.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  65

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Historical resources are considered under CEQA, as well as California Public
Resources Code Section 5024.1, which established the California Register of
Historical Resources. Section 5024 of the Public Resources Code requires state
agencies to identify and protect state-owned resources that meet listing criteria for the
National Register of Historic Places. It further specifically requires Caltrans to
inventory state-owned structures in its rights-of-way.
The U.S. Forest Service, as the federal land management agency, has regulatory
responsibility under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of
1990 (NAGPRA) codified in Title 43 CFR Part 10.4 (43 CFR 10.4). NAGPRA
outlines the protocol followed when Native American human remains, funerary
objects, sacred objects and/or objects of cultural patrimony (collectively defined in
the act as “cultural items”) are discovered unintentionally. Specifically, the statute
requires the federal land management agencies to consult with Native American
tribes on the disposition and control of Native American human remains and/or
cultural items found on federal lands after November 16, 1990 [25 U.S.C. 3002
(d)(2)].
Affected Environment
An Archeological Survey Report was completed for the project in June 2007 and a
Historic Resource Evaluation Report (HRER) was completed in August 2007. A
Historic Property Survey Report (HPSR) summarizing the results of cultural technical
studies was completed in September 2007. Supplemental reports (HRER and HPSR)
were completed in June 2010 for the additional alternatives being considered. A
second supplemental HPSR was completed in January 2013 to address cultural sites
not previously studied. The supplemental report also documented the reduced area of
potential effects that resulted from the removal of some of the build alternatives.
The area of potential effects encompasses all of the ground disturbance and
development activities proposed by the build alternatives between post miles 42.0 and
42.7 on State Route 140 and any other areas that may be indirectly affected by the
undertaking. The area of potential effects is defined on the south by the slope
immediately above State Route 140; on the north side, it includes Incline Road.
Caltrans conducted record searches and field surveys within the area of potential
effects to identify cultural resources that may be historic properties or historical
resources.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  66

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Archaeology
Caltrans previously surveyed the south side of the canyon within the project area for
archaeological resources following severe storm damage to State Route 140 in 1997.
During that survey, one archaeological site was recorded within the current project
area. Caltrans was informed of an additional archaeological site by Native American
representatives and U.S. Forest Service archaeologists. Surveys were conducted in
2011 to locate the second site. The archaeological sites within the area of potential
effects are:


Prehistoric bedrock mortar (CA-MRP-1566)



Prehistoric bedrock mortar (CA-MRP-2076)

Initially, both bedrock mortar locations were determined not to be eligible for
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places because they are more than 300
feet from any other archaeological features, and periodic river flooding has removed
their association with other archaeological artifacts and deposits. The information
values of these resources have been recovered through documentation in the project’s
cultural resources reports. However, the U.S. Forest Service is in the process of
defining a historic landscape within the Merced River Canyon that they consider a
historic property (eligible to the National Register of Historic Places). The two
bedrock mortar sites are potential contributors to that historic property.
Architectural History
Following the Ferguson rockslide in 2006, Caltrans conducted emergency surveys
and identified resources that would be affected by the emergency detour and the
proposed permanent restoration of State Route 140. These resources include:


Yosemite Valley Railroad Grade (now Incline Road in the project area)



State Route 140



Historic concrete bridge piers and debris (CA-MRP-1552H)

The Yosemite Valley Railroad operated from 1907 to 1945, providing access for
tourists to Yosemite National Park and use of natural resources by commercial
mining and lumber operations. The railroad grade (Incline Road) in the project area
ran parallel to the Merced River on the north side. The rails and ties of the Yosemite
Valley Railroad were pulled up and sold with the rest of the equipment in 1946, and
flooding in 1955 and 1997 washed away portions of the grade. Both the U.S. Forest

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  67

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Service and Caltrans staff have agreed that the segment of the railroad bed in the area
of potential effects would not be a contributor to an eligible linear resource.
The “All-Weather Highway” (State Route 140), constructed from 1923 to 1927,
provides year-round access to Yosemite National Park and is associated with the first
use of convict labor to construct public roadways in California. The highway, despite
being on its original alignment, was damaged by flooding in 1937 and 1997 and is
presently covered by the recent rockslide that deposited thousands of tons of rubble
onto its surface. The U.S. Forest Service and Caltrans staff has agreed that the
segment of State Route 140 in the area of potential effects would not be a contributor
to an eligible linear resource.
In Summary, the portions of the two linear features (the railroad and highway) within
the project area were evaluated and determined to have no potential to contribute to
the National Register of Historic Places eligibility of the two respective resources as a
whole, even if the two linear resources were found to be eligible for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places.
Within the area of potential effects there are historic concrete bridge piers and debris
upstream from the downstream temporary bridge. The bridge remnants consist of six
abandoned board-formed concrete piers. They are possibly from a suspension foot
bridge, however, the physical integrity of the original bridge structure is missing. The
concrete bridge piers and debris lack the integrity of materials, setting, feeling, or
design for their respective periods of significance that would make it eligible to the
National Register of Historic Places. The U.S. Forest Service staff concurs with this
finding.
Native American Concerns
In coordination with a representative of the American Indian Council of Mariposa
County, the following two properties of concern were identified:


Two Bedrock Basins



Plant Collection Area

The two bedrock basins are naturally formed depressions in an outcrop of
metamorphic bedrock next to the Merced River. According to a local Miwuk
individual, the basins are similar to what tribal elders reportedly used as medicine
basins. Herbs and water were put in similar basins at other locations. Individuals were
then placed in the basins to soak and facilitate healing. There is no evidence at this
Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  68

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

time that the basins within the project area of potential effects were used. In
consultation with the Sierra National Forest, it was decided that Caltrans, on behalf of
FHWA, would determine that the basins are not eligible to the National register of
Historic Places.
The American Indian Council of Mariposa County has identified native plant species
that were and are important to the Miwuk people. The Merced River Canyon, with its
array of riparian habitat, contains many of these plants. Members of the Miwuk
community have collected plants occasionally within the project area for more than a
century. The recent temporary bridges have provided access to the river bottom over
the last six or seven years and facilitated plant collection in the project area. But,
historically, there were no known defined plant patches or areas of plant manipulation
within the project area. There were no traditional plant collecting areas within the
area of potential effect that meet the threshold of eligibility to the National Register.
The presence of indigenous plants of economic importance to the Miwuk is not
enough to designate an area within in the area of potential effects as a traditional
Miwuk plant collecting area of significance.
Both Native American properties are determined not eligible to the National Register
of Historic Places. There is no evidence that the rock basins were ever associated with
human activity. The representative indicated that he never used these resources and
he knows of no one who has. The plant collecting area is not a defined property that is
over 50 years old. There are defined traditional plant collecting areas in Merced River
Canyon, but none is within the area of potential effects of the project.
Environmental Consequences
Caltrans consulted with the State Historic Preservation Officer on the cultural
resources determinations without objection per stipulation VIII.c.5 of the January
2004 Programmatic Agreement. This indicates concurrence with Caltrans’ findings.
The State Historic Preservation Officer was notified that under the authority of
FHWA, Caltrans has determined that no historic properties are affected by this
undertaking. However, under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act the properties
discussed in this section are part of a unique historic context of the Merced River
canyon. Avoidance and minimization measures required under the Wild and Scenic
Rivers Act are discussed in section 3.1.1.3. The California State Historic Preservation
Officer concurred with Caltrans’ findings on October 10, 2007 and July 15, 2013 (see
Appendix D for concurrence letters).

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  69

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
During construction, Caltrans and its contractors have the regulatory responsibility
under NAGPRA and 43 CFR 10.4(b) to notify immediately the U.S. Forest Service
by telephone, with written notification to follow, in the event that Native American
human remains and/or cultural items are inadvertently discovered. Caltrans and its
contractors are to stop activity in the area of the discovery and make a reasonable
effort to protect the remains and cultural items.
As a state agency, Caltrans also has a legal responsibility under the California Health
and Safety Code Section 7050.5 when human remains are discovered. Pursuant to
California Health and Safety Code Section 7050.5, Caltrans is to stop activities in any
area or nearby area suspected to overlie remains, and contact the county coroner.
After the U.S. Forest Service completes the steps in 43 CFR 10.4(d)(1), or 30 days
after the U.S. Forest Service has certified written confirmation of the inadvertent
discovery, the activity may resume (43 CFR 10.4[d][2]). The activity may also
resume if the U.S. Forest Service and the Native American tribes have executed a
written legally binding agreement on the recovery of the remains and/or cultural
items.
The bedrock mortar sites are within the project area, but are situated away from the
location of construction activities and would be protected during construction by
designating the sites as environmentally sensitive areas. Before construction, a
professionally qualifies staff archaeologist would oversee the placement of
environmentally sensitive area fencing around the site. A Native American monitor
may also be present during the establishment of the fencing. During construction, the
archaeologist and a Caltrans environmental construction liaison would regularly
inspect the fencing to determine that it is intact and that the protected sites are
undisturbed.

3.2

Physical Environment

3.2.1

Hydrology and Floodplain

Regulatory Setting
Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management) directs all federal agencies to
refrain from conducting, supporting, or allowing actions in floodplains unless it is the
only practicable alternative. Requirements for compliance are outlined in 23 Code of
Federal Regulations 650 Subpart A. To comply, the following must be analyzed:

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  70

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures



Practicability of alternatives to any longitudinal encroachments



Risks of the action



Impacts on natural and beneficial floodplain values



Support of incompatible floodplain development



Measures to minimize floodplain impacts and to preserve/restore any beneficial
floodplain values affected by the project

The base floodplain is defined as “the area subject to flooding by the flood or tide
having a one percent chance of being exceeded in any given year.” An encroachment
is defined as “an action within the limits of the base floodplain.”
Affected Environment
A Location Hydraulic Study and a Floodplain Evaluation Report Summary were
completed in September 2007 using Flood Insurance Rate Maps for the
unincorporated areas of Mariposa County. An Addendum to the Location Hydraulic
Study was completed in July 2008 to address the additional alternatives.
The Location Hydraulic Study analyzed the potential impacts of the proposed project
on the floodplain. According to the Flood Insurance Rate Maps, the damaged section
of State Route 140 is within the 100-year base floodplain designated as “Zone A.”
Zone A is defined as special flood areas inundated by the 100-year flood with no base
flood elevations determined. It has been determined that the existing highway within
the project area would be inundated by the base flood and the highway with or
without the proposed structures would be unusable during such a flood.
The floodplain in the project area possesses natural and beneficial uses, which include
recreational opportunities, a very high water quality, groundwater discharge, and fish,
wildlife and plant habitats.
Environmental Consequences
Alternative R is considered a longitudinal encroachment into the floodplain because it
would place a rockshed/tunnel structure parallel to the Merced River below the
predicted high water mark for a 100-year flood event. A 100-year flood event would
inundate the existing highway in the project area to a maximum depth of 8.65 feet,
rendering the highway impassable. During such an event, the rockshed/tunnel would
also be subject to flooding, with resulting damage to the operational appurtenances of
the rockshed/tunnel.

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Alternative T-3 would not adversely affect the base floodplain, but rather provide an
alternate passage for some of the base floodwaters. During a 100-year flood event, the
tunnel could pass water up to 8 feet deep. This alternative places a structure within
the base floodplain, but is not considered a longitudinal encroachment because it does
not parallel the river.
The No-Build Alternative would be temporarily affected by a 20-year event because
of its at-grade alignment with the existing highway. Should these temporary bridges
be damaged by floodwaters, they could be found unsafe to carry traffic and the
highway would be cut off to traffic. Upon these bridges’ removal from general wear,
all the structures associated with the temporary detour would be removed from the
base floodplain. There would no longer be an impact to the floodplain or its beneficial
values.
Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
There would be no feasible mitigation measures for Alternative R. Building the
rockshed/tunnel would result in a longitudinal encroachment, and Executive Order
11988 directs that longitudinal encroachments on the floodplain should be avoided
unless it is the only practicable alternative. No mitigation measures would be required
for Alternative T-3.
3.2.2

Water Quality and Storm Water Runoff

Regulatory Setting
Federal Requirements: Clean Water Act
In 1972, Congress amended the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, making the
addition of pollutants to the waters of the United States, from any point source
unlawful unless the discharge is in compliance with a National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit. Known today as the Clean Water Act, this act
has been amended by Congress several times. In the 1987 amendments, Congress
directed dischargers of storm water from municipal and industrial/construction point
sources to comply with the NPDES permit scheme. Important Clean Water Act
sections are as follows:


Sections 303 and 304 require states to promulgate water quality standards,
criteria, and guidelines.



Section 401 requires an applicant for a federal project or permit to conduct any
activity, which may result in a discharge to waters of the United States, to obtain

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  72

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

certification from the State that the discharge will comply with other provisions of
the act. This is most frequently required in tandem with a Section 404 permit
request (see below).


Section 402 establishes the NPDES, a permitting system for the discharges
(except for dredge or fill material) of any pollutant into waters of the United
States. Regional Water Quality Control Boards (RWQCBs) administer this
permitting program in California. Section 402(p) requires permits for discharges
of water from industrial/construction and municipal separate storm sewer systems
(MS4s).



Section 404 establishes a permit program allows for the discharge of dredge or fill
material into waters of the United States. This permit program is administered by
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

The objective of the Clean Water Act is “to restore and maintain the chemical,
physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.”
State Requirements: Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (California
Water Code)
California’s Porter-Cologne Act, enacted in 1969, provides the legal basis for water
quality regulation within California. This act requires a “Report of Waste Discharge”
for any discharge of waste (liquid, solid, or otherwise) to land or surface waters that
may impair beneficial uses for surface and/or groundwater of the state. It predates the
Clean Water Act and regulates discharges to waters of the state. Waters of the state
include more than just waters of the U.S., such as groundwater and surface waters not
considered waters of the United States. Additionally, it prohibits discharges of
“waste” as defined, and this definition is broader than the Clean Water Act definition
of “pollutant.” Discharges under the Porter-Cologne Act are permitted by Waste
Discharge Requirements and may be required even when the discharge is already
permitted or exempt under the Clean Water Act.
The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) and Regional Water Quality
Control Boards are responsible for establishing the water quality standards (objectives
and beneficial uses) required by the Clean Water Act, and regulating discharges to
ensure compliance with the water quality standards. Details on water quality
standards in a project area are contained in the applicable Regional Water Quality
Control Board Basin Plan.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  73

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

In California, regional boards designate beneficial uses for all water body segments in
their jurisdictions and then set criteria necessary to protect these uses. Consequently,
the water quality standards developed for particular water segments are based on the
designated use and vary depending on such use. In addition, the State Water
Resources Control Board identifies waters failing to meet standards for specific
pollutants, which are then state-listed in accordance with Clean Water Act Section
303(d). If a state determines that waters are impaired for one or more constituents and
the standards cannot be met through point source or non-point source controls
(NPDES permits or Waste Discharge Requirements), the Clean Water Act requires
the establishment of Total Maximum Daily Loads to specify allowable pollutant loads
from all sources (point, non-point, and natural) for a given watershed.
State Water Resources Control Board and Regional Water Quality Control
Boards
The State Water Resources Control Board administers water rights, water pollution
control, and water quality functions throughout the state. RWCQBs are responsible
for protecting beneficial uses of water resources within their regional jurisdiction
using planning, permitting, and enforcement authorities to meet this responsibility.
NPDES Program
The State Water Resources Control Board adopted the Caltrans Statewide NPDES
Permit (Order No. 99-06-DWQ) on July 15, 1999. This permit covers all Caltrans
rights-of-way, properties, facilities, and activities in the state. NPDES permits
establish a 5-year permitting time frame. NPDES permit requirements remain active
until a new permit has been adopted.
Construction General Permit Order No. 2009-009-DWQ, as amended by 2020-0014DWG), was adopted on November 16, 2010, and became effective on February 14,
2011. The permit regulates storm water discharges from construction sites that result
in a disturbed soil area of one acre or greater, and/or are smaller sites that are part of a
larger common plan of development. By law, all storm water discharges associated
with construction activity where clearing, grading, and excavation results in soil
disturbance of at least one acre must comply with the provisions of the General
Construction Permit. Construction activity that results in soil disturbances of less than
one acre is subject to this Construction General Permit if there is potential for
significant water quality impairment resulting from the activity as determined by the
Regional Water Quality Control Board. Operators of regulated construction sites are
required to develop storm water pollution prevention plans; implement sediment,

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  74

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

erosion, and pollution prevention control measures; and obtain coverage under the
Construction General Permit.
The 2009 Construction General Permit separates projects into Risk Levels 1, 2 and 3.
Risk levels are determined during the planning and design phases, and are based on
potential erosion and transport to receiving waters. Requirements apply according to
the Risk Level determined. For example, a Risk Level 3 (highest risk) project would
require compulsory storm water runoff pH and turbidity monitoring and beforeconstruction and after-construction aquatic biological assessments during specified
seasonal windows. For all projects subject to the permit, applicants are required to
develop and implement an effective Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWPPP). In accordance with Caltrans’ Standard Specifications, a Water Pollution
Control Plan (WPCP) is necessary for projects with a disturbed soil area less than one
acre.
Affected Environment
A Water Quality Report was completed for the project in August 2007. An updated
Water Quality Assessment Report, which included analysis of additional alternatives,
was completed in November 2008. An Amended Water Quality Assessment Report
was completed in October 2010 to include additional build alternatives. An addendum
to the October 2010 report was completed in January 2013 to reflect the current
proposed project conditions.
The project site lies within the North Fork Merced Hydraulic Area 537.30 of the
Merced River Hydrologic Unit. The watershed is 160,784 acres, with an annual
rainfall of 41.9 inches. Major streams in this area are the Merced and South Fork
rivers. The water quality of the Merced River within the project vicinity is good to
excellent.
The project sits within the jurisdiction of the Central Valley Regional Water Quality
Control Board (Region 5), which has adopted a Water Quality Control Plan (Basin
Plan) for the area encompassing the project site. Listed within the Basin Plan are the
following designated beneficial uses of the Merced River from its source down to
Lake McClure: irrigation, industrial power, recreation, fresh water habitat, and
wildlife habitat. Water quality objectives consist of narrative and numerical goals and
are established to preserve the beneficial uses of regional water bodies and must
comply with the Federal Anti-Degradation Policy. This policy requires that the

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  75

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Regional Water Quality Control Board maintain the beneficial uses that existed in
1975 or the best possible water quality since that time.
The Upper Merced River is not presently designated as high quality water (Tier 2)
and is not subject to the State Anti-Degradation Policy (State Water Resources
Control Board Resolution 68-16). Should municipal or domestic use become a future
beneficial use, the Upper Merced River could be designated a Tier 2 water and be
entitled to a more protective status under Resolution 68-16.
The project area also sits within the Yosemite Valley Groundwater Basin #5-69 in
Mariposa County. The basin lies beneath the floor of Yosemite Valley at an
approximate elevation of 4,000 feet. Recharge to groundwater occurs through direct
precipitation and from the Merced River. Groundwater is of very good quality and is
suitable for all uses. The groundwater resources in the project area possess four
beneficial uses: municipal or domestic supply, agricultural supply, industrial service
supply, and industrial process supply.
Environmental Consequences
Short-term impacts to surface water quality could occur during construction of either
build alternative and/or during the removal of the temporary bridges. Similar
construction methods would be used for either alternative, so impacts from
construction would be the same. The potential surface water quality impacts are as
follows:


Increases in sediments, turbidity (cloudiness), and total dissolved solids from
removal of the temporary bridges.



Toxicity due to chemical substances originating from construction activities.

Impacts may occur from exposing loose soil during excavation as well as grading and
filling activities. Suspended solids, dissolved solids, and organic pollutants in surface
water runoff could increase when nearby soils are disturbed and dust is generated.
Changes in storm water drainage could potentially affect the water quality as well.
Sediments suspended in runoff could be carried downstream and may accumulate,
potentially harming any downstream aquatic resources and water quality. Accidents
or improper use of construction materials such as oil and petroleum products may
result in the release of chemical contaminants into surface water resources.
Groundwater could be temporarily and minimally affected as it becomes recharged.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  76

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

The No-Build Alternative would have short-term impacts on water quality from storm
water runoff from the bridge structure and bridge maintenance activities. Best
Management Practices and coordination with the United States Army Corps would
continue for the life of the temporary bridges to reduce potential impacts.
Alternatives R and T-3 would not have any direct construction in the river bed and
would have no long-term impacts from storm water.
Storm water runoff rates can be increased from the addition of impervious roadway
surface areas. The impervious roadway surfaces were calculated for the proposed
project. These surface areas were then used to estimate storm water runoff flows for
each alternative.
Table 3.3 compares the impervious roadway surfaces and storm water runoff of each
alternative to the storm water runoff for the entire watershed. For the purpose of this
comparison, the baseline includes existing State Route 140 not covered by the
rockslide, the temporary bridges and the detour on Incline Road.

The areas listed in Table 3.3 would be the total proposed impervious acreage for these
alternatives. Alternative R would build on the existing alignment, and the detour
would be removed, leaving 1.10 acres of impervious area. For Alternative T-3, the
abandoned section of State Route 140 next to the rockslide would be removed and
restored to a natural condition, and the Incline Road pavement would be removed
leaving just the area of the new alignment (0.90 acre) impervious.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  77

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

The No-Build Alternative would temporarily have an impervious area of 2.20 acres.
The impervious area would eventually be reduced to zero within the project area once
the temporary bridge structures and temporary detour pavement are removed due to
structural failure or damage by floodwaters.
As shown in Table 3.3, Alternative R would produce a 0.68 cubic feet/second runoff
flow, an amount less than the baseline flow. Alternative T-3 proposes a runoff flow of
0.56 cubic feet/second. The runoff flow from the proposed project would be minimal
when compared to the runoff flow of the entire watershed, which is 337,640 cubic
feet/second.
The No-Build Alternative produces a 1.36 cubic feet/second runoff flow. The runoff
flow would be reduced to zero cubic feet/second once the temporary bridge structures
are removed.
The proposed impervious area and storm water runoff impacts would not violate any
water quality standards or waste discharge requirements. Culvert systems would be
incorporated into the plans and specifications to channelize, collect and discharge
storm water runoff using project-specific approved best management practices
(BMPs) to minimize non-storm water discharges into the Merced River. Therefore,
the project would not substantially alter the river hydraulics or cause substantial
additional sources of polluted runoff.
The proposed build alternatives would sustain the existing water quality and comply
with the Federal Anti-Degradation Policy provisions of the Clean Water Act.
Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
Implementation of the project would require construction activities near the natural
flow of the Merced River. Management measures in the form of a Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan, design pollution prevention best management practices,
construction site temporary best management practices, and maintenance best
management practices are required to address water quality impacts during planning,
design, construction, and operational and maintenance stages. Best management
practices for roads, highways, and bridges include the following:


The proposed project would be programmed to follow the guidelines and
procedures outlined in the 2003 Storm Water Management Plan to address storm
water runoff or any subsequent Storm Water Management Plan version drafted
and approved.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  78

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures



Prior to work in or near the river, coffer dams, culverts, and/or other temporary
water diversion features would be installed to reduce sedimentation during
construction. Diverted or impounded water would not be discharged into the river
prior to removing sediment.



Land-disturbing activities and the installation of erosion and sedimentation
control practices would be coordinated to reduce on-site erosion and off-site
sedimentation. These measures may include mulches, soil binders and erosion
control blankets, silt fencing, fiber rolls, sediment desilting basins, sediment traps,
and check dams.



Loose bulk materials may be applied to the soil surface as a temporary cover to
protect bare soils from rainfall, increase infiltration, and reduce runoff and
erosion.



Water would be applied to the soil surface to prevent the movement of dust at the
project area due to traffic, wind, and grading activities.



All areas would be restored to pre-construction contours and revegetated with
native species.



Berms would be provided along the tops of slopes to prevent water from running
uncontrolled down the slopes. Water would be transported at the berms through
an erosion-proof drainage system. Sediment that is collected at the berms would
be allowed to settle out and then be removed from the site.



Energy dissipaters and erosion control pads would be provided at the bottom of
slope drains. Other flow conveyance control mechanisms may include earth dikes,
swales, and ditches.



All construction-related materials would be hauled off-site after completion of
construction.



All erosion control measures and storm water control measures would be properly
maintained until the site has returned to a pre-construction state.



All construction roadway areas would be properly protected to prevent excess
erosion, sedimentation, and water pollution.



All vehicle and equipment maintenance procedures, including fueling, would be
conducted off-site if practical.



All concrete curing activities would be conducted to minimize spray drift and
prevent curing compounds from entering the river.



All construction materials, vehicles, stockpiles, and staging areas would be
situated outside of the river channel. All stockpiles would be covered as feasible.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  79

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures



Work within the bed and banks of the river, if required, would be limited to the
period between April 15 and October 15 to avoid the rainy season.

Storm water runoff systems should promote sheet flow through vegetation, use open
vegetated channels and conveyances, and minimize the use of curb, dike, and pipe.
The following pollution prevention measures are being proposed in the drainage plan
of this project:


Culverts would discharge surface runoff from the project to unlined channels. To
minimize scour (erosion), check dams, drainage inlets, and energy dissipation
systems would be incorporated into the drainage design.



Flared end sections and energy dissipation devices would be constructed at all
culvert outlets.



All ditches would be stabilized with erosion control. The newly constructed
slopes would be stabilized with erosion control.

The selection of best management practices depends on site- and project-specific
circumstances and conditions. The best management practices are applied to control,
reduce, or treat runoff water quality impacts to the maximum extent practicable using
best conventional technology and best available technology to comply with the water
quality objectives of the Basin Plan.
3.2.3

Geology/Soils/Seismic/Topography

Regulatory Setting
For geologic and topographic features, the key federal law is the Historic Sites Act of
1935, which establishes a national registry of natural landmarks and protects
“outstanding examples of major geological features.” Topographic and geologic
features are also protected under CEQA.
This section also discusses geology, soils, and seismic concerns as they relate to
public safety and project design. Earthquakes are prime considerations in the design
and retrofit of structures. Caltrans’ Office of Earthquake Engineering is responsible
for assessing the seismic hazard for Caltrans projects. The current policy is to use the
anticipated Maximum Credible Earthquake, from young faults in and near California.
The Maximum Credible Earthquake is defined as the largest earthquake that can be
expected to occur on a fault over a particular period of time.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  80

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Affected Environment
The Preliminary Geotechnical Design Report (August 2007) and Geotechnical Design
Report (October 2007) documented the literature review and surface/subsurface
explorations used to evaluate the nature and extent of the geologic and geotechnical
conditions of the project area. A Geotechnical Design Report Addendum was
completed in March 2008 and includes analysis of the additional alternatives.
The project lies in the Merced River Canyon, which is in the west-central portion of
the Sierra Nevada Geomorphic Province. The canyon is bounded by the Sierra
Nevada fault system to the east and the Great Valley to the west. The bedrock that
underlies the project area and the Ferguson rockslide are part of the Calaveras
Complex, which is made of very hard metamorphic rock called phyllite and chert. In
some places, the bedrock is exposed at the surface. At other locations, such as the
slopes, the bedrock is covered with a thin layer of soil and angular pieces of rock
called colluvium. The river channel is made of alluvium, which is composed of
rounded cobbles and boulders. The temporary bridges were constructed on abutments
built into the bed and banks of the river channel.
The Ferguson rockslide as a geologic formation occurred in phyllite that has been
fractured and folded to a near vertical position. When the rocks become unstable,
slide material comes loose from the Ferguson rockslide and falls down the mountain.
In the spring of 2006, approximately 10 percent of the slide material cascaded down
the slope and covered State Route 140. The volume of slide material still on the slope
is roughly 700,000 cubic yards. The rockslide material is composed entirely of
elongated, angular, metamorphic boulders up to 20 feet wide. A possible explanation
for the most recent rockslide could be that it was caused by a rise in groundwater due
to rainfall; however, it is difficult to determine exactly how rainfall totals contributed
to the movement of the rockslide. Other dormant slides may exist next to the
Ferguson rockslide. In addition, minor rockfalls could occur from natural slopes and
existing cuts.
Caltrans has concluded that there is an extremely low probability that the Ferguson
rockslide would fail catastrophically and in one rapid motion dam the Merced River
and bury Incline Road. This conclusion is based on evidence derived from mapping
the rockslide and surrounding terrain. The mapping shows evidence from changes in
slope shape and vegetative cover that, at a minimum, two previous episodes of
rockslide movement occurred. The mapping further indicates that the time between
these episodes could be in the thousands of years.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  81

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

There are cobble and boulder deposits along the north side of the river. These cobbles
and boulders are less than 2 feet in diameter and mostly composed of granite rock
with a minor amount of metamorphic rock. The northern slope across the Merced
River and opposite the Ferguson rockslide contains no topographic features such as
scarps and closed depressions that are associated with rockslides. During soil boring
testing, nothing was found that could be interpreted as rockslide debris, which
eliminates any history of rockslides large enough to span the river. There is no
evidence that debris and rock from these past rockslides were deposited on the north
side of the Merced River.
Caltrans also concluded that the rockslide moves at a slow to moderate rate as
relatively intact blocks of rock. It is expected that future movements by the Ferguson
rockslide would be smaller than the 2006 episode. This is due to the loss of potential
energy each time a rockslide occurs. A future rockslide would add to the existing rock
debris pile gradually narrowing the river channel, forcing flows toward Incline Road
and gradually raising river levels.
A study prepared for the U.S. Geological Survey called Simulations of Potential
Runout and Deposition of the Ferguson Rockslide, Merced River Canyon, California
(2007) stated that the Ferguson rockslide could move extremely rapidly like a sandand-gravel flow. That statement is contrary to the Geotechnical Design Report
performed by Caltrans, which found that the rockslide moves at a slow rate and as
intact blocks. A report prepared by the U.S. Forest Service supports the conclusion
that the rockslide would move at a slow rate.
The nearest active fault zones are northeast of the project area. They are the Silver
Lake fault, the Hartly Springs fault, and the Mono Lake fault. These faults are located
between 40 and 45 miles away from the project area. There are no known active
faults within the project area.
Groundwater in the form of seeps was found along the highway and the detour
alignment.
Environmental Consequences
The natural slopes above the proposed Alternative R and Alternative T-3 entrances
could produce rockfall.
The No-Build Alternative would be temporarily exposed to potential rockslides
because the detour bridges and alignment are built at the existing highway grade and

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  82

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

do not elevate as they cross the river. The temporary bridges would eventually be
removed, and therefore a potential rockslide could no longer affect them.
For the build alternatives, the bedrock may be cut and excavated by using blasting
equipment such as hydraulic splitters and hoe rams. The cut and fill slopes for the
proposed build alternatives would not be erosive because the bedrock exposed during
excavation is made of hard phyllite and chert. The No-Build Alternative would have
no effect on the bedrock.
Caltrans’ standard practice is to design all structures for seismicity by establishing a
Maximum Credible Earthquake. The maximum credible earthquake is established by
using correlations between fault lengths, displacement, and area and earthquake
magnitudes. Earthquake acceleration for a particular site is also analyzed by
comparing three parameters: the maximum credible earthquake, the peak historical
acceleration, and the distance from the site to the fault. The Silver Lake fault would
produce the highest earthquake acceleration at the project area, and that acceleration
is not considered very strong.
Alternatives R and T-3 may be built within or next to topographic features adjacent to
the Ferguson rockslide that may be dormant rockslides. The No-Build alternative
would avoid disturbing these features.
Groundwater could be encountered during the blasting and drilling of the rockshed or
tunnel in Alternatives R and T-3.
Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
With use of the blasting equipment mentioned above, the rock material being
excavated would be controlled to prevent the spread of rock material, limit ground
vibrations, and limit noise.
The entrances for both Alternatives R and T-3 would be built at least 150 feet away
from the flanks of the rockslide. Placing the entrances at this location would provide
adequate distance for more rockfall debris to accumulate without spilling onto the
highway and blocking the rockshed or tunnel. When the entrances are built, the slopes
would be cut at a 1:4 ratio. A catchment area at-grade, rockfall barriers, or a
combination of the two would be required for these alternatives to protect the
roadway from the possibility of falling rock.

3.2.4

Hazardous Waste/Materials

Regulatory Setting
Hazardous materials and hazardous wastes are regulated by many state and federal
laws. These include not only specific statutes governing hazardous waste, but also a
variety of laws regulating air and water quality, human health, and land use.
The main federal laws regulating hazardous wastes/materials are the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976. The purpose of the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, often referred to as
Superfund, is to clean up contaminated sites so that public health and welfare are not
compromised. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act provides for “cradle to
grave” regulation of hazardous wastes.
Other federal laws include the following:


Community Environmental Response Facilitation Act of 1992



Clean Water Act



Clean Air Act



Safe Drinking Water Act



Occupational Safety & Health Act



Atomic Energy Act



Toxic Substances Control Act



Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act

In addition to the acts listed above, Executive Order 12088, Federal Compliance with
Pollution Control, mandates that necessary actions be taken to prevent and control
environmental pollution when federal activities or federal facilities are involved.
Hazardous waste in California is regulated primarily under the authority of the federal
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 and the California Health and
Safety Code. Other California laws that affect hazardous waste are specific to
handling, storage, transportation, disposal, treatment, reduction, cleanup, and
emergency planning.
Worker health and safety and public safety are key issues when dealing with
hazardous materials that may affect human health and the environment. Proper
disposal of hazardous material disturbed during project construction is vital.

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Affected Environment
Caltrans completed an Initial Site Assessment for the project on June 13, 2007. An
addendum to the Initial Site Assessment studying the additional alternatives was
completed on August 28, 2008. A subsequent addendum was completed in July 2009
to include additional alternatives.
Field surveys and record searches were used to identify potential hazardous waste
concerns within the project area. The project area consists of State Route 140 running
close to the base of the Merced River Canyon slopes and alongside the Merced River.
The surrounding land is owned by the U.S. Forest Service and consists of steep
mountain slopes with vegetation. A former railroad alignment exists on the north side
of the Merced River; a segment of that alignment was converted into the one-lane
paved detour around the rockslide.
Soil samples collected next to the former railroad alignment and current one-lane
paved detour were analyzed for Title 22 metals. Title 22 metals include elemental,
organic, and inorganic compound forms of antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium,
cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, lead, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, selenium,
silver, thallium, vanadium, and zinc. Hazardous levels of many of these metals and
their numerous compounds can be found in many common contaminant sources,
including motor oil, manufacturing/processing wastes, and mine tailings. In some
areas, they can be found occurring naturally in rock outcrops.
Elevated arsenic levels were the only potential concern identified within the project
area. The total threshold limit concentration for arsenic is 500 micrograms per
kilogram. The soluble threshold limit concentration is 5.0 micrograms per liter. The
levels of arsenic noted to be in the project area are well below the total threshold and
soluble limit levels. However, the arsenic levels exceed the Commercial/Industrial
California Human Health Screening Level of 0.24 microgram per kilogram. The
Commercial/Industrial California Human Health Screening Level serves as a
guideline to aid in determining clean-up levels at contaminated sites.
Environmental Consequences
The results of the analysis identified elevated arsenic levels (24 to 56 micrograms per
kilogram) in three of four surface soil samples. The sources of the elevated arsenic
levels could be associated with the former railroad alignment, historical mining
operations, or localized bedrock mineralized zones.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  85

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

For the build alternatives and the eventual removal of the temporary detour, elevated
arsenic levels may present a health hazard to people working in the area of Incline
Road or occupying the area for recreational purposes. The build alternatives propose
to restore Incline Road to its previous condition by removing the existing pavement.
The No-Build Alternative would continue to use Incline Road temporarily as State
Route 140, leaving the pavement in place, which poses no immediate impact.
Restoration of Incline Road would occur when the detour is removed from either
general wear or construction of the build alternatives.
Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
The presence of elevated arsenic levels along the one-lane detour is a project
constraint with respect to soil management and disposal where planned roadway
improvements generate excess soil from the area. Before off-site disposal of any
excess soil generated from excavations within the vicinity of the one-lane detour, soil
sampling, testing, and notification of arsenic levels would be provided to the off-site
disposal facility for proper disclosure and material acceptance.
Caltrans construction and maintenance personnel and contractors would be properly
notified of potential risks associated with elevated arsenic levels in the soil. Dust
control and proper hygiene would be practiced during construction. Any planned
pedestrian and/or recreational uses of the one-way detour would incorporate risk
management controls, such as using dirt free of hazardous materials or paving areas
that have a high arsenic content to minimize exposure.
3.2.5

Air Quality

Regulatory Setting
The Federal Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, is the federal law that governs air
quality, while the California Clean Air Act of 1988 is its companion state law. These
laws, and related regulation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the
California Air Resources Board, set standards for the quantity of pollutants that can
be in the air. At the federal level, these standards are called National Ambient Air
Quality Standards (NAAQS). NAAQS and state ambient air quality standards have
been established for six transportation-related criteria pollutants that have been linked
to potential health concerns. The criteria pollutants are: carbon monoxide (CO),
nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), broken down for
regulatory purposes into particles of 10 micrometers or smaller—(PM10) and particles
of 2.5 micrometers and smaller—(PM2.5), lead (Pb), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). In

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  86

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

addition, state standards exist for visibility reducing particles, sulfates, hydrogen
sulfide (H2S), and vinyl chloride. The NAAQS and state standards are set at a level
that protects public health with a margin of safety, and are subject to periodic review
and revision. Both state and federal regulatory schemes also cover toxic air
contaminants (air toxics). Some criteria pollutants are also air toxics or may include
certain air toxics within their general definition.
Federal and state air quality standards and regulations provide the basic scheme for
project-level air quality analysis under NEPA and CEQA. In addition to this type of
environmental analysis, a parallel “Conformity” requirement under the Federal Clean
Air Act also applies.
The Federal Clean Air Act Section 176(c) prohibits the U.S. Department of
Transportation and other federal agencies from funding, authorizing, or approving
plans, programs, or projects that are not first found to conform to the State
Implementation Plan (SIP) for achieving the goals of Federal Clean Air Act
requirements related to the NAAQS. “Transportation Conformity” Act takes place on
two levels: the regional—or planning and programming—level and the project level.
The proposed project must conform at both levels to be approved. Conformity
requirements apply only in nonattainment and “maintenance” (former nonattainment)
areas for the NAAQS, and only for the specific NAAQS that are or were violated.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations at 40 Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) 93 govern the conformity process.
Regional conformity is concerned with how well the regional transportation system
supports plans for attaining the standards set for CO, NO2, O3, particulate matter, and
in some areas SO2. California has nonattainment or maintenance areas for all of these
transportation-related “criteria pollutants” except SO2, and also has a nonattainment
area for Pb. However, lead is not currently required by the Federal Clean Air Act to
be covered in transportation conformity analysis. Regional conformity is based on
Regional Transportation Plans (RTPs) and Federal Transportation Improvement
Programs (TIPs) that include all of the transportation projects planned for a region
over a period of at least 20 years for the RTP, and 4 years for the TIP. RTP and TIP
conformity is based on use of travel demand and air quality models to determine
whether or not the implementation of those projects would conform to emission
budgets or other tests showing that requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act and the
SIP are met. If the conformity analysis is successful, the Metropolitan Planning
Organization, FHWA, and Federal Transit Administration, make determinations that

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  87

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

the RTP and TIP are in conformity with the SIP for achieving the goals of the Federal
Clean Air Act. Otherwise, the projects in the RTP and/or TIP must be modified until
conformity is attained. If the design concept, scope, and open to traffic schedule of a
proposed transportation project are the same as described in the RTP and TIP, then
the proposed project is deemed to meet regional conformity requirements for
purposes of project-level analysis.
Conformity at the project-level also requires “hot spot” analysis if an area is
“nonattainment” or “maintenance” for CO and/or particulate matter A region is
“nonattainment” if one or more of the monitoring stations in the region measures
violation of the relevant standard, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
officially designates the area nonattainment. Areas that were previously designated
as nonattainment areas but subsequently meet the standard may be officially
redesignated to attainment by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and are
then called “maintenance” areas. “Hot spot” analysis is essentially the same, for
technical purposes, as CO or particulate matter analysis performed for NEPA
purposes. Conformity does include some specific procedural and documentation
standards for projects that require a hot spot analysis. In general, projects must not
cause the “hot spot”-related standard to be violated, and must not cause any increase
in the number and severity of violations in nonattainment areas. If a known CO or
particulate matter violation is located in the project vicinity, the project must include
measures to reduce or eliminate the existing violation(s) as well.
Affected Environment
An Air Quality Report was completed in April 2013.
The project area sits in the Mountain Counties Air Basin in Mariposa County. The
climate is semi-arid, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild winters. At higher
altitudes, distinct wet and dry seasons prevail.

Environmental Consequences
Regional Conformity
Under 40 CFR Section 93.126 Table 3, this project falls under the category of
“Changes in Vertical and Horizontal Alignment” and is exempt from regional
emission analysis. The table 3 exemption is a full exemption since the area is
unclassified/attainment for all hot-spot-related pollutants. Separate listing of the
project in the RTP and TIP, and their regional conformity analyses, is not necessary.
The project will not interfere with timely implementation of Transportation Control
Measures (TCM) identified in the applicable SIP and regional conformity analysis.
Project-Level Conformity
The project has undergone Interagency Consultation with concurrence on the project
as fully exempt from conformity analysis.
Carbon Monoxide (CO) Analysis
The project is located in Mariposa County, which is in attainment for the federal and
state carbon monoxide standards. There are no carbon monoxide monitors near the
project or in Mariposa County.
According to the California Almanac of Emissions and Air Quality (2008 edition),
California has reduced carbon monoxide concentrations over the past 10 years. It is
expected that improved motor vehicle emissions controls and less-polluting fuels will
continue this downward trend.
The U.C. Davis Transportation Project-Level Carbon Monoxide Protocol, dated
December 1997, was used to evaluate the potential carbon monoxide impact of this
project. The Protocol was created for use by agencies that sponsor transportation
projects. The qualitative evaluation Local CO Analysis flow chart located in the
Protocol (Chapter 4, Figure 3) was followed. The flow chart asked a series of
questions for the basis of deciding if any emission changes are acceptable:


Is the project in a CO nonattainment area? No.



Was the area redesignated as “attainment” after the 1990 Clean Air Act? No.



Does project worsen air quality? No.



Are there any other reasons to believe the project may have adverse air quality
impact? No.

The outcome of the flowchart was that the project is satisfactory and no further
analysis needed.

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Particulate Matter Analysis
A small reduction in PM2.5 and PM10 is expected when comparing the build
alternatives to existing conditions and the near-term no-build conditions because
traffic would no longer back up at the signals controlling one-way traffic on the
temporary detour. A greater reduction in emissions is expected when comparing the
build alternatives to the long-term no-build conditions because of the longer detour
created by the removal of the temporary bridges
Mobile Source Air Toxics (MSAT)
In addition to the criteria air pollutants for which there are NAAQS, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency also regulates air toxics. Most air toxics originate
from human-made sources, including on-road mobile sources, non-road mobile
sources (e.g. airplanes), area sources (e.g. dry cleaners) and stationary sources (e.g.
factories or refineries).
For each of the alternatives, the amount of MSAT emitted would be proportional to
the vehicle miles traveled, which is obtained by multiplying the annual average daily
traffic by the project length. The overall MSAT emissions of the two build and the
No-Build alternatives, immediately following construction and in the future, would
have no appreciable difference compared to the existing condition. Technical
shortcomings of emissions and dispersion models and uncertain science with respect
to health effects prevent meaningful or reliable estimates of MSAT emissions and the
effect of this project.
Regardless, emissions will likely be lower in the future than current levels as a result
of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board
programs that are projected to reduce MSAT emissions by 65 to 80 percent between
2005 and 2040.
Short-term Construction Impacts
During construction, the proposed project would generate air pollutants. The exhaust
from construction equipment contains hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, carbon
monoxide, suspended particulate matter, and odors. Most of the pollutants would be
windblown dust generated during excavation, grading, hauling, and various other
activities. The impacts of these activities would vary each day as construction
progresses.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  93

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

The build alternatives would require a large amount of rock material to be removed,
then transported to and disposed of at a disposal site outside the project area.
Alternative R would require approximately 200 truck trips per day for 30 working
days. Alternative T-3 would require approximately 200 truck trips per day for 108
working days. These trips would generate excess dust and add traffic to the state
highways and local roads.
Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
Caltrans Standard Specifications pertaining to dust control and dust palliative
requirements are a required part of all construction contracts and should effectively
reduce and control emission impacts during construction. The provisions of Caltrans
Standard Specifications, Section 14-9.02 “Air Pollution Control” and Section 14-9.03
“Dust Control,” require the contractor to comply with the Mariposa County’s Air
Pollution Control District’s rules, ordinances, and regulations.
3.2.6 Noise
Regulatory Setting
CEQA and NEPA provide the broad basis for analyzing and abating the effects of
highway traffic noise. The intent of these laws is to promote the general welfare and
foster a healthy environment. The requirements for noise analysis and consideration
of noise abatement and/or mitigation, however, differ between the two acts.
California Environmental Quality Act
CEQA requires a strictly baseline versus build analysis to assess whether a proposed
project will have a noise impact. If a proposed project is determined to have a
significant noise impact under CEQA, then the act dictates that mitigation measures
must be incorporated into the project unless such measures are not feasible. The rest
of this section will focus on NEPA-23 Code of Federal Regulations 772 noise
analysis; refer to Chapter 4 for further information on noise analysis under CEQA.
National Environmental Policy Act and 23 Code of Federal Regulations 772
For highway transportation projects with FHWA (and Caltrans, as assigned)
involvement, the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970 and the associated implementing
regulations (23 Code of Federal Regulations 772) govern the analysis and abatement
of traffic noise impacts. The regulations require that potential noise impacts in areas
of frequent human use be identified during the planning and design of a highway
project. The regulations contain noise abatement criteria that are used to determine

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  94

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

when a noise impact would occur. The noise abatement criteria differ depending on
the type of land use under analysis. For example, the criterion for residences (67
dBA) is lower than the criterion for commercial areas (72 dBA). Table 3.4 lists the
noise abatement criteria for use in NEPA and 23 Code of Federal Regulations 772
analysis.

Table 3.6 Noise Levels of Common Activites

In accordance with Caltrans’ Traffic Noise Analysis Protocol for New Highway
Construction and Reconstruction Projects, August 2006, a noise impact occurs when
the future noise level with the project is a substantial increase from existing levels
(substantial is defined as a 12-dBA or more increase) or when the future noise level
with the project approaches or exceeds the noise abatement criteria. Approaching the
noise abatement criteria is defined as coming within 1 dBA of the noise abatement
criteria.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  96

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

If it is determined that the project would have noise impacts, then potential abatement
measures must be considered. Noise abatement measures that are determined to be
reasonable and feasible at the time of final design are incorporated into the project
plans and specifications. This document discusses noise abatement measures that
would likely be incorporated into the project.
Caltrans’ Traffic Noise Analysis Protocol sets forth the criteria for determining when
an abatement measure is reasonable and feasible. Feasibility of noise abatement is
basically an engineering concern. A noise abatement measure (for example, a
soundwall) must be shown to produce at least a 5-dBA reduction in the future noise
level to be considered feasible. Other considerations include topography, access
requirements, other noise sources, and safety. The reasonableness determination is
basically a cost-benefit analysis. Factors used in determining whether a proposed
noise abatement measure is reasonable include: residents’ acceptance, the absolute
noise level, build versus existing noise, environmental impacts of abatement, public
and local agencies’ input, newly constructed development versus development predating 1978, and the cost per benefited residence.
Affected Environment
A Noise Report was completed in August 2007. An Amended Noise Report was
completed in May 2010 to include additional build alternatives.
Within the project area, the Merced River is used mainly for whitewater rafting, but is
also used for fishing and swimming. Incline Road was a U.S. Forest Service Road
being used as a bicycle, pedestrian, and equestrian trail until the construction of the
one-lane detour, which currently realigns State Route 140 across the river, along
Incline Road, and back across the river to the existing alignment. There are no
residences or businesses in the project area.
Two field noise measurements were used to document the existing background noise
levels generated by the river and to calibrate the noise model for future noise level
calculations. Noise measurements were taken on April 25, 2008. Two locations were
then modeled to represent recreational users near the temporary downstream and
upstream bridges. The existing background noise levels in the area are mostly
generated by the river flowing swiftly over rocks in its course. Table 3.7 summarizes
the results of the noise impact analysis for the project.

Environmental Consequences under NEPA
The build alternatives would not bring traffic closer to the recreational user than what
exists with the existing or pre-slide condition. Therefore, recreational users would not
experience a permanent or long-term increase in noise levels with the build
alternatives. Noise levels would increase during construction. The increased noise
would vary in intensity and be temporary and intermittent depending on the type of
construction activity. For Alternative R, noise levels would temporarily increase from
the cutting and excavating of slopes. Alternative T-3 would build a tunnel and
temporarily generate increased noise levels by a combination of blasting and drilling
through bedrock.
The No-Build Alternative, which leaves the temporary bridges in place, does not have
an immediate or short-term impact on recreational users. However, with the eventual
removal of the bridges, construction methods such as excavating the bridge abutments
and piers, dismantling the bridge structure, and removing pavement would
temporarily affect noise levels within the project area. Once the temporary detour has
been taken down, State Route 140 would be severed and the noise receptors within
the project area would no longer be affected.
Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Noise Abatement under NEPA
The following measures would be implemented to minimize construction noise for
recreational users:


Whenever possible, use construction methods or equipment that would provide
the lowest level of noise (for example, alternative low noise pile installation
methods).



Use newer or well-maintained equipment with improved muffling, and ensure that
all equipment items have the manufacturer’s recommended noise abatement

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  98

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

measures, such as mufflers, engine enclosures, and engine vibration isolators
intact and operational.


Maintain good public relations with the community to minimize objections to
unavoidable construction noise.

Biological Environment

3.3.1

Natural Communities

Regulatory Setting
This section of the document discusses natural communities of concern with a focus
on biological communities, not individual plant or animal species. This section also
includes information on wildlife corridors and habitat fragmentation. Wildlife
corridors are areas of habitat used by wildlife for seasonal or daily migration. Habitat
fragmentation involves the potential for dividing sensitive habitat and thereby
lessening its biological value.
Habitat areas that have been designated as critical habitat under the Federal
Endangered Species Act are discussed in Threatened and Endangered Species,
Section 3.3.5. Wetlands and other waters are discussed in Section 3.3.2.
Affected Environment
A Natural Environment Study was completed for the project in November 2007. A
revised Natural Environment Study, which includes an analysis of the additional
alternatives, was completed in January 2009. An additional revised Natural
Environment Study was completed in January 2013 to include new information since
the release of the previous Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact
Statement in November 2010.
Oak woodland communities make up a major portion of California’s ecosystems,
occupying about 10 million acres of land. The oak woodlands in the project area are
dominated by foothill pine (Pinus sabiniana) and interior live oaks (Quercus
wislizeni) with a shrubby understory of chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum),
buckbrush (Ceanothus cuneatus), and grasses. Many animal species depend on oak
woodlands, which are also the favored habitat of many plant species. Within the
project area, 76 of the 218 plant species observed are native species found under oaks.
Included in this number are three rare plant species: Tompkins’ sedge (Carex
tompkinsii), Mariposa clarkia (Clarkia biloba ssp. australis), and smallflower

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  99

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

monkeyflower (Mimulus inconspicuous). Refer to Sections 3.3.3 and 3.3.5 for
impacts to these rare plant species.
These species provide a good example of the specific benefits oaks provide.
Tompkins’ sedge and smallflower monkeyflower were found growing in the shade of
oaks, often directly beneath them, benefiting from the moderating influence over
temperature and light provided by the shade. These species may also be benefiting
from the nutrients particular to oak woodland soils. The clarkia species, in contrast,
were usually found in open areas between oaks, but always where they were shaded
by an oak or by a rock face. They may be benefiting either directly from the shade
produced by the oaks or indirectly by the lower grass density found in the partly
shaded open areas between the oaks. Oak woodland communities make up the entire
project area outside of the Merced River channel and its adjacent riparian corridor.
The riparian corridor that lines the Merced River channel is characterized by sparse
vegetation due to the frequent flooding. The riparian area is dominated by California
ash (Fraxinus latifola), red willow (Salix laevigata), and less frequently, Fremont’s
cottonwood (Populus fremontii ssp. fremontii) and dusky willow (Salix melanopsis).
The shrub cover is dominated by arroyo willow (Salix lasiolepis) and buttonbush
(Cephalanthera occidentalis). The torrent sedge (Carex nudata) is the dominant herb
along the water margin. California wild grape (Vitis californica) forms large colonies
on the river bank below the roadway, and redbud (Cercis occidentalis) is prominent
on the roadsides between the riparian area and the foothill woodland.
Installation of the temporary bridges and detour under the emergency project affected
13 trees: 3 upland trees (2 of which were oak trees) and 10 riparian trees (6 of which
were oak trees).
Environmental Consequences
The build alternatives would each affect an area of oak woodland. The build
alternatives would not affect the riparian area along the Merced River. Table 3.8
shows the impacts that the proposed alternatives would have on oak woodlands along
with the impacts from the past emergency project. Total impacts for the project would
include the impact of the build alternative plus the past impacts.

The No-Build Alternative would not affect oak woodland or the riparian area from
either temporarily leaving the detour in place or eventually removing the detour from
the environment. However, the past impacts from the emergency project would
require mitigation.
Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
Caltrans would specifically compensate for oak woodland at a minimum 3:1 ratio
based on the acreage of impact. Caltrans would purchase a parcel off-site with
sufficient acreage of oak woodland and other natural resources affected by the project
(discussed throughout Section 3.3). Any parcel purchased for the purpose of
mitigation would be from a willing seller. All compensation plans would be approved
by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the U.S. Forest Service.
The 13 trees removed (indicated as impacts from the emergency project) for the
placement of the temporary bridges would be mitigated for through the planting of
replacement trees on-site. A 3:1 ratio would likely be used as a replacement value.
The 39 trees would be the same species as those removed or possibly include other
native upland and riparian species as well. This mitigation would include a
monitoring plan. The final design and the monitoring plan would be approved by the
U.S. Forest Service and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.
Caltrans biologists and landscape architects would continue to coordinate with the
U.S. Forest Service on the planting of appropriate vegetation during and after
construction. These plantings would include native shrubs, plants, herbs and grasses
for the purpose of revegetation as well as erosion control. Current coordination efforts
have included discussions with the U.S. Forest Service about collecting and planting
seeds from the project area to compensate for the removal of oaks as well as other
native plant species.

3.3.2

Wetlands and Other Waters

Regulatory Setting
Wetlands and other waters are protected under a number of laws and regulations. At
the federal level, the Clean Water Act (33 U.S. Code 1344) is the main law regulating
wetlands and waters. The Clean Water Act regulates the discharge of dredged or fill
material into waters of the United States, including wetlands. Waters of the United
States include navigable waters, interstate waters, territorial seas, and other waters
that may be used in interstate or foreign commerce. To classify wetlands for the
purposes of the Clean Water Act, a three-parameter approach is used that includes the
presence of: water-loving vegetation, wetland hydrology, and soils subject to
saturation/inundation. All three must be present, under normal circumstances, for an
area to be designated as a jurisdictional wetland under the Clean Water Act.
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act establishes a regulatory program that provides
that no discharge of dredged or fill material can be permitted if a practicable
alternative exists that is less damaging to the aquatic environment or if the nation’s
waters would be significantly degraded. The Section 404 permit program is run by the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with oversight by the Environmental Protection
Agency.
The Executive Order for the Protection of Wetlands (11990) also regulates the
activities of federal agencies with regard to wetlands. Essentially, this executive order
states that a federal agency, such as FHWA, and Caltrans as assigned, cannot
undertake or provide assistance for new construction located in wetlands unless the
head of the agency finds: 1) that there is no practicable alternative to the construction
and 2) the proposed project includes all practicable measures to minimize harm.
At the state level, wetlands and waters are regulated primarily by the California
Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Regional Water Quality Control Boards.
Sections 1600-1607 of the California Fish and Game Code require any agency that
proposes a project that would substantially divert or obstruct the natural flow of or
substantially change the bed or bank of a river, stream, or lake to notify the California
Department of Fish and Wildlife before beginning construction. If the California
Department of Fish and Wildlife determines that the project may substantially and
adversely affect fish or wildlife resources, a Lake or Streambed Alteration Agreement
will be required.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  102

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

California Department of Fish and Wildlife jurisdictional limits are usually defined
by the tops of the stream or lake banks, or the outer edge of riparian vegetation,
whichever is wider. Wetlands under jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
may or may not be included in the area covered by a Streambed Alteration Agreement
obtained from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.
The Regional Water Quality Control Boards were established under the PorterCologne Water Quality Control Act to oversee water quality. The Regional Water
Quality Control Boards also issue water quality certifications in compliance with
Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. A Section 401 Water Quality Certification is
required before the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will issue a Section 404 permit for
dredge and fill. Please see the Water Quality section for additional details.
Affected Environment
A Natural Environment Study was completed for the project in November 2007. A
revised Natural Environment Study, which includes an analysis of the additional
alternatives, was completed in January 2009. An additional revised Natural
Environment Study was completed in January 2013 to include new information since
the release of the previous Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact
Statement in November 2010.
The Merced River fits under the definition of jurisdictional waters of the United
States and has been designated as a Wild and Scenic River (for recreational
classification) protected by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Installation of the
temporary bridges and detour under the emergency project affected a total of 0.005
acre of fill material in the form of bridge columns placed below the ordinary high
water mark of the Merced River channel. For more information on the impacts to the
Merced River, see Section 3.1.1.3.
There are no wetlands in the project area.
Environmental Consequences
The build alternatives would have no impacts to waters of the United States. Removal
of the temporary bridges would remove the previous fill material and would require
coordination with a number of regulatory agencies.
The No-Build Alternative would not affect waters of the United States. The eventual
removal of the temporary bridges would remove the previous fill material and would
require coordination with a number of regulatory agencies.

Removal of the temporary bridges would occur in late summer or early fall when the
Merced River flows are lowest. The construction contractor would be required to
address all potential water quality impacts that could occur through Caltrans Standard
Specification Section 13-1 “Water Pollution Control.” This specification requires the
contractor to prepare and submit to Caltrans for approval a Water Pollution Control
Program. This program would detail how standard best management practices would
be used to avoid and minimize impacts to water quality.

Plant Species

Regulatory Setting
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and California Department of Fish and Wildlife
have regulatory responsibility for the protection of special-status plant species.
Special-status species are selected for protection because they are rare and/or subject
to population and habitat declines. “Special-status” is a general term for species that
are afforded varying levels of regulatory protection. The highest level of protection is
given to threatened and endangered species; these are species that are formally listed
or proposed for listing as endangered or threatened under the Federal Endangered
Species Act and/or the California Endangered Species Act. Please see Threatened and
Endangered Species, Section 3.3.5, in this document for detailed information on these
species.
This section of the document discusses all the other special-status plant species,
including California Department of Fish and Wildlife species of special concern, U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service candidate species, and non-listed California Native Plant
Society rare and endangered plants.

and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

The regulatory requirements for the Federal Endangered Species Act can be found at
U.S. Code 16, Section 1531, and et seq. See also 50 Code of Federal Regulations Part
402. The regulatory requirements for the California Endangered Species Act can be
found at California Fish and Game Code, Section 2050, et seq. Caltrans projects are
also subject to the Native Plant Protection Act, found at California Fish and Game
Code, Section 1900-1913, and CEQA, Public Resources Code, Sections 2100-21177.
Affected Environment
A Natural Environment Study was completed for the project in November 2007. A
revised Natural Environment Study, which includes an analysis of the additional
alternatives, was completed in January 2009. An additional revised Natural
Environment Study was completed in January 2013 to include new information since
the release of the previous Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact
Statement in November 2010.
Tompkins’ Sedge
Tompkins’ sedge (Carex tompkinsii) is a Sierra Nevada species known mainly from
the Kings River drainage in Fresno County and the Merced and Tuolumne River
drainages in Mariposa and Tuolumne counties. Its preferred habitat is dry rocky soil
found in canyon sides and canyon bottoms between 1,900 and 2,950 feet in elevation.
Within the project area, Tompkins’ sedge occurs on the south side of the river on
north- and east-facing slopes. This plant species is rated as U.S. Forest Service
Sensitive and California Native Plant Society Rare 4. It is listed as State Rare.
Mariposa Clarkia
Mariposa clarkia (Clarkia biloba ssp. australis) is a Sierra Nevada species that ranges
from Mariposa to Tuolumne counties and resides within the Merced River Canyon
along the south fork of the Merced River and in the main stem of the river down to
Briceburg. It is also present along Bear Creek from Briceburg to Midpines. It appears
to favor sites where there is shade from interior live oak and few shrubs. Large
populations of Mariposa clarkia begin above the cut banks of the highway and
continue uphill to the edge of the Ferguson rockslide and on intact portions of the
rockslide. This plant species is rated as U.S. Forest Service Sensitive and California
Native Plant Society Rare 1B.
Copper Moss
Copper moss (Mielichhoferia elongate) is geographically widespread with a range
that includes North America, Europe, and Asia. It is found within the Merced River

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  105

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Canyon between Briceburg and El Portal, usually tucked into a corner of a narrow
ledge. Its critical habitat factors are low soil-water pH and high concentrations of
sulphite ions. Within the project area, four small patches of the moss were observed.
Three were found on human-made rock overhangs along the highway and temporary
detour; the fourth was on a natural rock overhang on the west-facing slope of the
canyon. This plant species is rated as U.S. Forest Service Sensitive and California
Native Plant Society Rare 2.
Smallflower Monkeyflower
The smallflower monkeyflower (Mimulus inconspicuous) is found in scattered
populations of a few individuals in shaded banks of small streams, meadow edges or
the north-facing slopes of the canyon. It has threadlike stems, few leaves and a few
pale pink flowers. Its current known distribution is entirely within California. This
plant is known to occur in the Sierra Nevada foothills from El Dorado County to the
Transverse Ranges in Los Angeles County, and in Glenn and Butte counties.
Within the project area, the smallflower monkeyflower population was found
beginning about 80 feet above the highway in the deep shade of oaks on the
northeast-facing slope and on the eastern side of the rockslide. There are several small
patches of about 10 to 200 individuals scattered on the hillside. This plant species is
rated as California Native Plant Society Rare 4.
Environmental Consequences
Tompkins’ Sedge
The build alternatives would cut into the slopes on the south side of the river where
Tompkins’ sedge habitat has been identified. Alternative R would affect 2.10 acres of
habitat, and Alternative T-3 would affect 0.45 acre of habitat.
Mariposa Clarkia
Alternatives R and T-3 would cut into the slopes on the south side of the river where
populations of Mariposa clarkia have been identified. Alternative R would affect 2.10
acres of habitat, and Alternative T-3 would affect 0.45 acre of habitat.
Copper Moss
Alternative R would completely avoid the copper moss. Alternative T-3 would
remove one to two patches of copper moss that are along the highway and the
temporary detour. The No-Build Alternative would not affect the plant during the
removal of the temporary bridges.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  106

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

The patches of copper moss found within the project area are small and few and
represent an insignificant portion of the population of this species in the canyon. The
patches of moss that would be removed are on ledges of human-made rock faces that
were created when the highway and railroad beds were originally built. Any further
cuts into these rock faces that create vertical walls and/or under hangs would
reestablish new habitat for the moss rather than diminish any habitat.
Smallflower Monkeyflower
Alternatives R and T-3 could potentially affect 1.05 acres and 0.25 acre of
smallflower monkeyflower habitat, respectively. The No-Build Alternative would not
affect any known populations of smallflower monkeyflower during removal of the
temporary bridges.
Table 3.9 shows the impacts that the proposed alternatives would have on the plant
species listed above.

Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
Tomkins’ Sedge
For Alternatives R and T-3, environmentally sensitive area fencing would be placed
around the Tompkin’s sedge populations to minimize their removal and protect them
and their associated habitat to the maximum extent possible. Some individual plants
to be affected could be transplanted with the assistance and concurrence of the U.S.
Forest Service botanist. Caltrans Standard Specification (SS) 14-1.03 for
environmentally sensitive area temporary fencing would be included in the
construction contract.
Mariposa Clarkia
For Alternatives R and T-3, environmentally sensitive area fencing (SS 14-1.03)
would be placed around the Mariposa clarkia populations to minimize their removal

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  107

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,

and protect them and their associated habitat to the maximum extent possible.
Caltrans biologists and landscape specialists would continue to coordinate with the
U.S. Forest Service and the National Park Service on the planting of appropriate
vegetation during and after construction. This may include seed collection from
affected Mariposa clarkia plants.
Copper Moss
No mitigation measures would be required.
Smallflower Monkeyflower
For Alternatives R and T-3, environmentally sensitive area fencing (SS 14-1.03)
would be placed around the smallflower monkeyflower populations to minimize
ground disturbance and protect them and their associated habitat to the maximum
extent possible. Caltrans biologists and landscape specialists would continue to
coordinate with the U.S. Forest Service and the National Park Service on the planting
of appropriate vegetation during and after construction. This may include seed
collection from affected smallflower monkeyflower plants.

Animal Species

Regulatory Setting
Many state and federal laws regulate impacts to wildlife. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service, and
the California Department of Fish and Wildlife are responsible for implementing
these laws. This section discusses potential impacts and permit requirements
associated with wildlife not listed or proposed for listing under the state or federal
Endangered Species Act. Species listed or proposed for listing as threatened or
endangered as well as California Department of Fish and Wildlife fully protected
species are discussed in Section 3.3.5 below. All other special-status animal species
are discussed here, including species of special concern and U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service
candidate species.
Federal laws and regulations pertaining to wildlife include the following:


National Environmental Policy Act



Migratory Bird Treaty Act



Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  108

State laws and regulations pertaining to wildlife include the following:


California Environmental Quality Act



Sections 1600–1603 of the California Fish and Game Code



Sections 4150 and 4152 of the California Fish and Game Code

Agency regulations that pertain to this project include the U.S. Forest Service South
Fork and Merced Wild and Scenic River Implementation Plan. Refer to Sections
3.1.1.2 and 3.1.1.3 for more information.
Affected Environment
A Natural Environment Study was completed for the project in November 2007. A
revised Natural Environment Study, which includes an analysis of the additional
alternatives, was completed in January 2009. An additional revised Natural
Environment Study was completed in January 2013 to include new information since
the release of the previous Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact
Statement in November 2010.
Hardhead Fish
Hardhead (Mylopharodon conocephalus) fish are mainly found in low-to midelevation streams in the main Sacramento and San Joaquin drainage. The exact timing
of spawning activity has not been definitively recognized; some sources state
spawning occurs in the spring, perhaps May through June in valley streams,
extending into August in foothill streams (NatureServe, 2012) and other sources state
that, although spawning can occur as late as August, it usually occurs around April
and May (California Fish Website, 2012). Hardhead fish are much less abundant in
Central California than they once were, but are still widely distributed in foothill
streams. Although surveys for this fish were not conducted, hardhead fish could be
present in the Merced River within the project area. This species is rated by the U.S.
Forest Service as Sensitive and listed as a State Species of Special Concern.
Foothill Yellow-legged Frog
Foothill yellow-legged frogs (Rana boylii) prefer partially shaded, small foothill
streams with year-round flow, at elevations of 100 to 3,300 feet. The Merced River
within the project area does not provide preferred habitat for this species, although
these frogs are present in the smaller tributaries to the river. Because the project area
does not have preferred habitat, surveys for the foothill yellow-legged frog were not
conducted. This species is rated by the U.S. Forest Service as Sensitive and listed as a
State Species of Special Concern.
Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  109

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Ringtail
The ringtail (Bassariscus astutus) is a nocturnal species and in the same family as the
raccoon. Ringtails live in brushy and wooded areas at the lower and middle
elevations. They are commonly found in foothill canyons and along waterways with a
preference for chaparral, rocky hillsides, and riparian habitat.
In 1968, the ringtail was designated as Fully Protected through California Fish and
Game Code Section 4700. In 1980, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife
recommended removing the ringtail from the list because the data showed that
ringtails were either stable or increasing in numbers. However, the ringtail is still
designated as fully protected and a take of this species cannot be authorized through
the Section 2081 permitting process.
During bat surveys, one adult ringtail was observed a quarter mile west of the project
area. The Merced River Canyon is considered prime habitat for the ringtail, and it is
likely that there are greater numbers of the species present in the area of the project
than just the one observed.
Pallid Bat
Pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus) frequent rocky outcrops in lower elevations up into
the forested oak and pine regions. Daytime roosts consist of rock crevices and
buildings where they can retreat out of sight and wedge themselves into tight places.
They are intolerant of disturbance and may abandon a roost when disturbed and not
return for years. Pallid bats were observed and their calls were identified during
surveys within the project area. Additionally, a night roost was seen on the South
Fork Merced River bridge only a few miles east of the project area. This species is
rated by the U.S. Forest Service as Sensitive and listed as a State Species of Special
Concern.
Western Red Bat
Western red bats (Lasiurus blossevillii) roost alone in the foliage of large shrubs and
trees, frequently in streamside habitats dominated by cottonwoods, oaks, sycamores,
and walnuts, but will also roost in fruit orchards within suburban areas. Western red
bats or their calls were not positively identified. However, some calls were heard that
were similar and could not be ruled out as being this species. This species is rated by
the U.S. Forest Service as Sensitive and listed as a State Species of Special Concern.

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Migratory Birds
The project area contains trees, shrubs, and rock faces that provide nesting habitat for
birds protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
Environmental Consequences
Hardhead Fish
The build alternatives and eventually the No-Build Alternative would remove the
temporary bridges that are within the active river channel. Construction activities
such as the creation of small de-watered areas used for the removal of the temporary
bridges and abutments may temporarily and indirectly affect hardhead fish as the soil
is stirred up and creates cloudiness within the river. This indirect impact may affect
downstream habitat as the cloudy water is carried by the current.
Foothill Yellow-legged Frog
The build alternatives and the No-Build Alternative would have no impact to this
species.
Ringtail
The proposed alternatives would involve ground disturbance on the southern slope of
the canyon, which is potential ringtail habitat. However, construction-related
activities would encourage any ringtails to move away to another area; this would
then avoid a take of these animals under Section 5050 of the California Fish and
Game Code.
Pallid Bat and Western Red Bat
The build alternatives would remove rocks, structures, and forested areas that provide
roosting and foraging habitat for pallid and western red bats. Table 3.10 shows the
potential impacts to roosting and foraging habitat along with the past impacts.

Migratory Birds
The build alternatives would remove trees, shrubs and rock faces that provide nesting
habitat for birds. The No-Build Alternative, which currently leaves the temporary
bridges in place and would eventually require the removal of these bridges, would not
affect migratory birds.
Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
Hardhead Fish
For activities associated with the removal of the temporary bridges in the water, a “no
in-stream work” window may be established to avoid impacts during the spawning
season. The exact work window would be decided during consultation with the U.S.
Forest Service and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife later in the project
development process.
Foothill Yellow-legged Frog
Even though no impact to this species would occur as a result of any of the build
alternatives, pre-construction surveys for special-status species would be conducted
within 30 days of initial ground disturbance. If foothill yellow-legged frogs are
observed, Caltrans would consult with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife
regarding a possible work window, no-work buffer zone, or other minimization
measures. Caltrans Standard Special Provision 14-6.02, which includes details of
pre-construction surveys and species protection, would be included in the
construction contract.
Ringtail
If ground disturbance occurs during the ringtail reproductive season, defined as
March through August, then qualified biologists would conduct field identification
surveys for potentially active dens. If an active den is located, construction activities
within 150 feet would temporarily be stopped and the California Department of Fish
and Wildlife would be consulted about the protection of the den. Caltrans Standard
Special Provision 14-6.02, which includes details of pre-construction surveys and
species protection, would be included in the construction contract.
Pallid Bat and Western Red Bat
The compensatory mitigation for oak woodland (see Section 3.3.1) would also benefit
pallid and western red bats.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  112

Migratory Birds
Caltrans Standard Specification 14-6.03, which includes details of pre-construction
surveys and bird protection, would be included in the construction contract to allow
the removal of trees only during the non-nesting season. The nesting season is defined
as February 15 through September 1.
3.3.5

Threatened and Endangered Species

Regulatory Setting
The main federal law protecting threatened and endangered species is the Federal
Endangered Species Act: 16 U.S. Code, Section 1531, et seq. See also 50 Code of
Federal Regulations Part 402. This act and subsequent amendments provide for the
conservation of endangered and threatened species and the ecosystems upon which
they depend. Under Section 7 of this act, federal agencies, such as FHWA, and
Caltrans as assigned, are required to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service to
ensure that they are not undertaking, funding, permitting or authorizing actions likely
to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or destroy or adversely modify
designated critical habitat. Critical habitat is defined as geographic locations critical
to the existence of a threatened or endangered species. The outcome of consultation
under Section 7 is a Biological Opinion or an incidental take statement. Section 3 of
the Federal Endangered Species Act defines take as “harass, harm, pursue, hunt,
shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture or collect or any attempt at such conduct.”
California has enacted a similar law at the state level, the California Endangered
Species Act (California Fish and Game Code, Section 2050, et seq.). The California
Endangered Species Act emphasizes early consultation to avoid potential impacts to
rare, endangered, and threatened species and to develop appropriate planning to offset
project-caused losses of listed species populations and their essential habitats.
The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is the agency responsible for
implementing the California Endangered Species Act. Section 2081 of the California
Fish and Game Code prohibits “take” of any species determined to be an endangered
species or a threatened species. Take is defined in Section 86 of the California Fish
and Game Code as “hunt, pursue, catch, capture, or kill, or attempt to hunt, pursue,
catch, capture, or kill.”

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  113

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

The California Endangered Species Act allows for take incidental to otherwise lawful
development projects; for these actions, an incidental take permit is issued by the
California Department of Fish and Wildlife. For projects requiring a Biological
Opinion under Section 7 of the Federal Endangered Species Act, the California
Department of Fish and Wildlife may also authorize impacts to the California
Endangered Species Act species by issuing a Consistency Determination under
Section 2080.1 of the California Fish and Game Code.
In addition to the California Endangered Species Act, the State of California places
certain species on a “Fully Protected” list. A fully protected status prevents the
California Department of Fish and Wildlife from authorizing a take of any species
designated as fully protected through the usual California Fish and Game Code
Section 2081 permit process.
Affected Environment
A Natural Environment Study was completed for the project in November 2007. A
revised Natural Environment Study, which includes an analysis of the additional
alternatives, was completed in January 2009. An additional revised Natural
Environment Study was completed in January 2013 to include new information since
the release of the previous Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact
Statement in November 2010.
Merced Clarkia
Merced clarkia (Clarkia lingulata) is extremely endemic or associated with a
particular area. This plant species is known to be found in only two confirmed
locations. One is an upstream location, less than a mile from the project area where
the south fork and the main stem of the Merced River meet. The downstream location
is also less than a mile away on the slope at the north tip of the Ferguson Ridge. This
species is listed as endangered by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.
The Merced clarkia was not observed during surveys conducted in 2007. During
surveys done in the past, two unconfirmed sightings of Merced clarkia were reported
within the project area.
Limestone Salamander
Limestone salamanders (Hydromantes brunus) are excellent climbers that live in the
crevices of cliffs and ledges and in limestone under the canopy of foothill oak
woodland, especially where the rocks are overgrown with moss. They are active and

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  114

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

above ground during the fall, winter, and spring rains. They become inactive during
the dry hot months, sheltering in cracks, crevices, or dense leaf litter. This species has
been found only along the Merced River drainage in Mariposa County.
The limestone salamander was designated as a threatened species by the State of
California in 1971. It is also designated as fully protected through Section 5050 of the
California Fish and Game Code.
The U.S. Forest Service considers the limestone salamander to be a part of the
“outstandingly remarkable value” for wildlife, one of the values by which the Merced
River was designated as wild and scenic. Refer to Section 3.1.1.3 for more
information.
Limestone salamanders were seen during surveys at various locations on the south
side of the Merced River within the project area. All sightings were higher on the
slope above the road, closer to the mountain ridge. All areas on the north side of the
river within the project area were characterized as unsuitable or potentially poor
habitat. See Appendix G for map of limestone salamander habitat.
Environmental Consequences
Merced Clarkia
Alternatives R and T-3 would cut into the slope on the south side of the river where
the unconfirmed observations of Merced clarkia were made. Although no confirmed
sightings were made, the project area is considered potential habitat. Alternatives R
and T-3 would affect 2.10 acres and 0.45 acre of habitat, respectively.
The No-Build Alternative would not affect potential habitat for Merced clarkia while
the bridges are in place or upon their eventual removal.
Limestone Salamander
Alternatives R and T-3 would remove 2.10 acres and 0.45 acre of limestone
salamander habitat and likely result in a take of the salamanders as defined in the
California Endangered Species Act. Take could result from changes in above- and
below-ground hydrology and blasting and excavating activities.
The No-Build Alternative would not affect the limestone salamander while the
temporary bridges are in place or upon their eventual removal.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  115

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
Merced Clarkia
Although this plant was not observed during surveys, pre-construction surveys would
be done in the appropriate bloom period within the year before construction to
provide updated data. If the Merced clarkia is observed, environmentally sensitive
area fencing would be placed around the population to protect it to the maximum
extent possible. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife would be notified if
the plant is observed. If the plants cannot be completely avoided, Caltrans would
request a Section 2081 Individual Take Permit.
Limestone Salamander
A construction work window may be established during initial ground disturbance
activities to prevent construction-related activities from occurring on the southern
slope during the salamander’s active season, which is defined as December through
March. Environmentally sensitive area fencing in the form of 5-foot orange plastic
mesh as well as salamander exclusion (protection) fencing in the form of 24-inch
sheet metal would be erected if construction-related activities were to occur next to
limestone salamander habitat and during their active season.
Alternatives R and T-3 would require a 2081 Incidental Take Permit from the
California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Under normal circumstances, the
California Department of Fish and Wildlife would not have the ability to issue a 2081
Incidental Take Permit for impacts to a fully protected species. However, Assembly
Bill (AB) 1973 amended Section 5050 and Section 2081.9 of California Fish and
Game Code to allow a one-time only authorization by the California Department of
Fish and Wildlife to issue a 2081 Incidental Take Permit to Caltrans for the purposes
of this project. AB 1973, which is included in Appendix H, was passed by the
Assembly and Senate, and signed by the Governor on July 12, 2012.
Alternatives R and T-3 would require off-site compensatory mitigation at
approximately a 3 to 1 ratio as part of the 2081 Incidental Take Permit. Caltrans
would purchase property that would have specific habitat elements indicative of
limestone salamander presence, but could be required to have confirmed presence
prior to purchase. The parcel would likely be near the existing Limestone Salamander
Ecological Reserve that is currently owned and managed by the California
Department of Fish and Wildlife. Ownership and management could go to the
California Department of Fish and Wildlife or to a non-profit land management
organization such as the Sierra Foothill Conservancy. An endowment would also be

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  116

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

required to cover the initial costs of management as well as long-term and recurring
costs, and would accompany the property to be managed according to requirements in
the 2081 Incidental Take Permit. The details of the plan would be proposed to
California Department of Fish and Wildlife for review and approval in the 2081
Incidental Take Permit application.
3.3.6

Invasive Species

Regulatory Setting
On February 3, 1999, President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 13112 requiring
federal agencies to combat the introduction or spread of invasive species in the
United States. The order defines invasive species as “any species, including its seeds,
eggs, spores, or other biological material capable of propagating that species, that is
not native to that ecosystem whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or
environmental harm or harm to human health.” FHWA guidance issued August 10,
1999 directs the use of the state’s noxious weed list, currently maintained by the
California Invasive Species Council to define the invasive plants that must be
considered as part of the NEPA analysis for a proposed project.
The U.S. Forest Service has guidelines for noxious weed prevention practices and revegetation policy to help prevent the spread of invasive plant species. The goal of the
U.S. Forest Service invasive species program is to reduce, minimize, or eliminate the
potential for introduction, establishment, spread, and impact of invasive species
across all landscapes and ownerships.
Affected Environment
A Natural Environmental Study was completed for the project on November 12,
2007. A revised Natural Environment Study, which includes an analysis of the
additional alternatives, was completed in January 2009. The Natural Environment
Study was revised again (completion date February 2013) to include new information
since the release of the previous Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental
Impact Statement in November 2010.
Within the project area, 40 non-native plant species were found. Most of these nonnative species occur exclusively or primarily as roadside weeds. Several are pervasive
weeds of open grassy areas. A number of the non-native species are listed by the U.S.
Forest Service, Sierra National Forest as special-status noxious weeds. The weeds
include cheat grass (Bromus tectorum), Himalayan blackberry (Rubus discolor),

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  117

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

milkthistle (Silybum marianum), perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium), spotted
knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), tocalote (Centaurea melitensis), yellow star-thistle
(Centaurea solstitalis), and woolly mullein (Verbascum thapsus).
There are no known aquatic invasive species in the project area, but there are a
number within transport range (Source: Aquatic, Non-Vertebrate Invasive Species,
Pacific Southwest Region, U.S. Forest Service). These include Asian Clam
(Corbicula fluminea), chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis), didymo
(Didymosphenia gerinata), Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), Hydrilla
(Hydrilla verticillata), and New Zealand mudsnails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum).
The U.S. Forest Service has been conducting extensive integrated weed management
for the past decade in the Merced River Canyon, including the area of this project.
Environmental Consequences
Construction-related activities from the build alternatives and the eventual removal of
the temporary bridges would potentially promote the distribution of invasive plant
species through ground disturbance and invasive aquatic species during work in or
next to the river. If aquatic invasive pests were introduced, they could damage the
aquatic ecology and diminish the fishing and recreational opportunities in the area.
Construction of the emergency project could have also potentially promoted the
distribution of invasive plant species through ground disturbance.
Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures
In compliance with the Executive Order on Invasive Species, Executive Order 13112,
and subsequent guidance from FHWA, the following measures would be used to
prevent the introduction or spread of invasive species:


The landscaping and erosion control included in the project would not use species
listed as noxious weeds.



Equipment should arrive at the construction site clean and would be subject to
inspection.



Cleaning measures would be used if equipment is moved between areas that have
known invasive species.



Caltrans would continue to coordinate with the U.S. Forest Service regarding the
most feasible program for planting during and after construction.



A Special Provision would be included in the construction bid package to prevent
the introduction and/or spread of invasive and noxious weeds.

The build alternatives would be consistent with the Mariposa County General Plan,
the Yosemite Valley Plan, the Economic Vitality Strategy and Implementation Plan
for Mariposa County by restoring full access to all vehicle types traveling on State
Route 140. The No-Build Alternative would not be consistent with state, regional,
and local plans because the roadway would eventually be closed at the project area
and access to communities and recreational activities along State Route 140 would be
reduced by the failure of the temporary bridges.
The build alternatives would have both beneficial and negative long-term effects.
Restoring full access to all vehicle types would provide for long-term tourism to the
area, cohesion between the communities within Mariposa County, and a variety of
recreational uses including entering Yosemite National Park. Incline Road would be
restored to its previous condition and could be used for recreational activities.
The scenic quality of the area would be decreased with Alternative R as a
rockshed/tunnel would be added to the area. The build alternatives would
permanently remove between 0.45 and 2.10 acres of oak woodland, roosting and
foraging habitat for bats, and habitat for both special-status and threatened and
endangered plant species. Alternatives R and T-3 would also permanently remove up
to 2.10 acres of habitat for the ringtail and the limestone salamander. Short-term,
construction activities in the surrounding environment during completion of any of
the build alternatives would involve noise from heavy equipment, changes to the
visual environment, and potential delays in traffic. The Merced River could be
affected in the short term by water quality problems, specifically regarding pH levels
and turbidity.
While the proposed project may have some negative effects on the natural habitats
within the project area and the build alternatives may have short-term impacts to
whitewater rafting, the long-term productivity of Mariposa County would be restored
and enhanced by an adequate transportation system that supports recreational
mobility, tourism, and the movement of goods and services.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments of
Resources that Would be Involved in the Proposed
Project

Implementation of the proposed project involves a commitment of a range of natural,
physical, human, and fiscal resources. Land used in the construction of the proposed
roadway is considered an irreversible commitment during the time period that the
land is used for a highway. However, if a greater need arises for use of the land or if
the highway is no longer needed, the land can be converted to another use, as will be
the case for unused portions of existing State Route 140 for Alternative T-3.
Fossil fuels, labor, and highway construction materials such as cement and aggregate
would be expended in the construction of the structures and roadway. Additionally,
labor and natural resources would be used to fabricate and prepare construction
materials. These materials are generally not retrievable. However, they are not in
short supply, and their use would not have an adverse effect on continued availability
of these resources. Any construction would also require an expenditure of federal
funds, which are not retrievable. The proposed project cost of $47.1 million to $225.7
million (2013 dollars) would be committed.
Water would be required to produce construction materials and maintain structures
such as cleaning bridges and rockshed or tunnel walls.
Commitment of these resources is based on the concept that Mariposa County
residents and tourists would benefit from the fully restored State Route 140. These
benefits would consist of full and unrestricted access to all recreational possibilities
within Mariposa County and for residents traveling between communities, which
would be expected to outweigh the commitment of these resources.

3.6

Construction Impacts

Impacts from the construction of the build alternatives would be temporary and would
require minimal closures of the highway as traffic would be maintained throughout
construction on the temporary detour. Construction activities such as excavation may
occur within the river channel. Following construction, the channel would be restored
to its pre-construction condition. Methods for constructing the proposed build
alternatives are described below.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  120

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

Construction Access
Staging areas for construction equipment and materials would be placed on the
existing State Route 140 next to the rockslide. This portion of State Route 140 is
currently not being used as part of the temporary detour.
Rockshed and Tunnel Construction
Alternative R would be a reinforced concrete box structure supported on concrete
piles and tieback anchors into the west canyon wall. To move the box structure into
place, the rockslide talus, the debris deposited below the slide, would be removed and
the structure pushed into place using a rail system. To increase worker safety, rock
slope fence protection and remote-controlled equipment could be used. Retaining
walls would be built to keep rock debris from falling onto the highway.
Alternative T-3 would require a combination of blasting and drilling techniques to
build the tunnel. Retaining walls would be built flanking the entrances and exits of
the tunnel to keep rock debris from falling onto the highway.
Both alternatives would require the removal of rock material to build the rockshed or
tunnel and cut areas for the highway. All the excess rock material would be hauled to
a disposal site outside the project area, requiring multiple trips for a number of trucks.
These trips would generate excess dust and add traffic to state highways and possibly
local roads.
Use of Construction Equipment
Construction equipment would be used only in the areas created for construction
access. The access areas would be lined with barriers to prevent fluid leaks from
equipment entering any bodies of water. Concrete trucks that have delivered their
loads would be required to wash out on the closed portions of the existing State Route
140 next to the rockslide. Best management practices would be applied to prevent any
discharge to the river.
Construction Schedule
Closures of State Route 140 to traffic would be infrequent, with each just long
enough to accommodate equipment being moved around, generally about 10 to15
minutes.
Temporary Detour Removal
The detour and the temporary bridges can be removed and the site restored to its
previous condition within weeks of the opening of the permanent restoration project.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  121

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

The asphalt concrete temporary roadway would be ground into a gravel size and
hauled off-site. The metal beam guardrail and wood posts along the detour route
would be dismantled and hauled to a Caltrans storage facility. The wire mesh gravelfilled retaining walls along the detour would be excavated and cut into pieces to be
removed and recycled off-site. All signs and other detour equipment would be
removed. Once the pavement is removed, Incline Road would be graded and restored
to its previous condition.
The upstream temporary bridge would be elevated up onto rollers and moved toward
the detour roadway, incrementally taken apart and hauled off-site for storage. The
upstream bridge supports at the ends of this bridge along with the concrete column
supports would be jack-hammered into large rock-size pieces and hauled off-site. All
concrete used for the temporary bridges would be removed to at least 1 foot below the
ground. The downstream temporary bridge structure would be removed from its
supports by crane and dismantled into pieces no larger than 7 feet by 10 feet. These
bridge segments would then be hauled off-site. The downstream bridge supports
would be jack-hammered into rock-sized pieces and hauled off-site for disposal or
recycling.

3.7

Cumulative Impacts

Cumulative impacts are those that result from past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable future actions, combined with the potential impacts of the proposed
project. A cumulative effect assessment looks at the collective impacts posed by
individual land use plans and projects. Cumulative impacts can result from
individually minor, but collectively substantial, impacts taking place over a period of
time.
Cumulative impacts to resources in the project area may result from residential,
commercial, industrial, and highway development, as well as from agricultural
development and the conversion to more intensive types of agricultural cultivation.
These land use activities can degrade habitat and species diversity through
consequences such as displacement and fragmentation of habitats and populations,
alteration of hydrology, contamination, erosion, sedimentation, disruption of
migration corridors, changes in water quality, and introduction or promotion of
predators. They can also contribute to potential community impacts identified for the
project, such as changes in community character, traffic patterns, housing availability,
and employment.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  122

Chapter 3  Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences,
and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures

CEQA Guidelines Section 15130 describes when a cumulative impact analysis is
warranted and what elements are necessary for an adequate discussion of cumulative
impacts. The definition of cumulative impacts, under CEQA, can be found in Section
15355 of the CEQA Guidelines. A definition of cumulative impacts, under NEPA,
can be found in 40 Code of Federal Regulations Section 1508.7 of the Council on
Environmental Quality Regulations.
Transportation projects and other actions by federal, state or local agencies within the
Merced River Canyon are infrequent. Other than routine maintenance of State Route
140, Caltrans has only one current project and no past or reasonably foreseeable
projects in the canyon area. The current project is 8 miles west at Bull Creek Road.
The project would repair a retaining wall next to State Route 140 and Bear Creek, a
tributary to the Merced River. No cumulative impacts are expected as a result of this
project in combination with the Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration.
Impacts from the emergency project, which installed the temporary bridges and
detour on Incline Road, are included with the impacts from the build alternatives in
the Environmental Consequences and Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation
sections in this chapter. Therefore, they will not be addressed as cumulative impacts.
No other projects in the Merced River Canyon that would, in combination with this
project, result in any cumulative impacts were identified during the preparation of this
document. Therefore, no cumulative impacts would result from implementation of the
Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration project.

California Environmental
Quality Act Evaluation

Determining Significance under CEQA

The proposed project is a joint project by Caltrans and the FHWA and is subject to
state and federal environmental review requirements. Project documentation,
therefore, has been prepared in compliance with both CEQA and NEPA. The
FHWA’s responsibility for environmental review, consultation, and any other action
required in accordance with NEPA and other applicable federal laws for this project
is being, or has been, carried out by Caltrans under its assumption of responsibility
pursuant to 23 U.S. Code 327. Caltrans is the lead agency under CEQA and NEPA.
One of the main differences between CEQA and NEPA is the way significance is
determined.
Under NEPA, significance is used to determine whether an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS), or some lower level of documentation, would be required. NEPA
requires that an EIS be prepared when the proposed federal action (project) as a
whole has the potential to “significantly affect the quality of the human environment.”
The determination of significance is based on context and intensity. Some impacts
determined to be significant under CEQA may not be of sufficient magnitude to be
determined significant under NEPA. Under NEPA, once a decision is made regarding
the need for an EIS, it is the magnitude of the impact that is evaluated and no
judgment of its individual significance is deemed important for the text. NEPA does
not require that a determination of significant impacts be stated in the environmental
documents.
CEQA, on the other hand, does require Caltrans to identify each “significant effect on
the environment” resulting from the project and ways to mitigate each significant
effect. If the project may have a significant effect on any environmental resource,
then an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) must be prepared. Each significant effect
on the environment must be disclosed in the EIR and mitigated if feasible. In
addition, CEQA Guidelines list a number of mandatory findings of significance,
which also require the preparation of an EIR. There are no types of actions under
NEPA that parallel the findings of mandatory significance under CEQA. This chapter
discusses the effects of this project and CEQA significance.

Chapter 4  California Environmental Quality Act Evaluation

4.2

Discussion of Significance of Impacts

4.2.1 Less than Significant Effects of the Proposed Project
There would be no impacts on the environment in the following areas:


Growth – Would not encourage unplanned growth because the build alternative
would only reestablish full access to State Route 140.



Farmlands/Timberlands – There is no farmland or timberland in the project area.



Paleontology – No paleontological resources were identified within the project
area.



Energy – Would not affect the way energy is produced or used because the build
alternatives would only reestablish full access to State Route 140.



Hydrology and Floodplain – AlternativeT-3 would not encroach longitudinally on
the base floodplain.



Air Quality – A small reduction in emissions is expected when comparing the
build alternatives to existing conditions and the near-term no-build conditions
because traffic would no longer back up at the signals controlling one-way traffic
on the temporary detour. A greater reduction in emissions is expected when
comparing the build alternatives to the long-term no-build conditions because of
the longer detour created by the removal of the temporary bridges.



Waters of the United States – The build alternative have no impact to Waters of
the United States because their footprints are outside of the Merced River and
there are no wetlands in the project area.

For more information on these areas, refer to Chapter 3.
The project would have a less than significant effect on the environment in the
following areas:


Consistency with State, Regional, and Local Plans –The build alternatives would
be consistent with these plans, while the No-Build Alternative would not be
consistent.



Parks and Recreation – The build alternatives would restore full access to parks
and recreation activities in the area.



Community Character and Cohesion – The build alternatives would restore full
access throughout the communities.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  126

Chapter 4  California Environmental Quality Act Evaluation



Utilities/Emergency Services – The build alternatives would restore full access to
utility and emergency services.



Traffic and Transportation/Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities – The build
alternatives would restore full access to these facilities.



Visual/Aesthetics – Alternative T-3 would not degrade the existing visual
character or quality of the project area.



Cultural Resources – The build alternatives would have no adverse affects to
historic properties within the project area.



Hazardous Waste or Materials – All alternatives would include removing the
pavement on Incline Road, which would expose workers to elevated levels of
arsenic. The proposed project would incorporate dust control measures and proper
hygiene. Any planned pedestrian and/or recreational uses of the one-way detour
would incorporate risk management controls, such as using dirt free of hazardous
materials or paving areas that have high arsenic content to minimize exposure.
These measures would reduce this impact to less than significant.



Water Quality and Storm Water Runoff –The build alternatives would have shortterm impacts during construction activities. Management measures in the form of
a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, design pollution prevention best
management practices, and construction site temporary best management
practices to control, reduce, and treat runoff water, thereby avoiding and
minimizing potential short term impacts to a level less than significant. The build
alternatives would have no long-term impacts because the footprint is outside of
the river channel and culvert systems would be installed as part of the project to
collect and discharge stormwater runoff.



Noise – There would be a temporarily increase in noise levels during construction
of the build alternatives.



Natural Communities – Both build alternatives propose to remove a portion of
oak woodland habitat. Compensation for oak woodland at a minimum 3:1 ratio
would reduce this impact to less than significant.



Plant Species – Alternatives R and T-3 would impact sensitive plant species, such
as Tompkins’ sedge, Mariposa clarkia, and smallflower monkeyflower, and one to
two patches of copper moss. Environmental sensitive area fencing and
transplanting individual plants would reduce this impact to less than significant.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  127

Chapter 4  California Environmental Quality Act Evaluation



Animal Species – The build alternatives would remove up to 2.10 acres of bat
roosting and foraging habitat. The compensation for oak woodland would reduce
this impact to less than significant.



Invasive Species – Although the build alternatives would potentially promote the
distribution of invasive plant species through ground disturbance, erosion control
included in the project would not use species listed as noxious weeds and in areas
of particular sensitivity, extra precautions would be taken if invasive species were
found in or next to the construction areas, including the inspection and cleaning of
construction equipment and eradication strategies to be implemented should an
invasion occur.

For a full discussion of less than significant effects and mitigation measures for the
above issues, refer to Chapter 3.
4.2.2 Significant Environmental Effects of the Proposed Project
The project would have impacts with a significant effect on the environment in the
following areas:


Visual/Aesthetics – Alternative R would have an average reduction in visual
quality to moderate low.



Geology/Soils/Seismic/Topography – Because the tunnel would be built within
the slopes of the Merced River Canyon, Alternative T-3 would remove
approximately 292,000 cubic yards of rock material. Disturbances to rock
formations would be within the slopes and not exposed to the surrounding
landscape. Alternative R would remove approximately 80,000 cubic yards of the
rockslide talus.

4.2.3 Unavoidable Significant Environmental Effects
The project would have an unavoidable significant effect on the environment in the
following areas:


Parks and Recreation – The No-Build Alternative would eventually affect access
to recreational activities along State Route 140 as well as to Yosemite National
Park via State Route 140 when the temporary structures fail due to general wear.



Community Character and Cohesion – The No-Build Alternative would
eventually affect access between communities along State Route 140 when the
temporary structures fail due to general wear.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  128

Chapter 4  California Environmental Quality Act Evaluation



Utilities/Emergency Services – The No-Build Alternative would eventually
diminish access for emergency service vehicles and equipment needing to access
the east side of the rockslide because the temporary bridges support structures will
eventually fail. It may also diminish access to specialized medical care for those
residents forced to drive 2.5 hours out of their way to get to the hospital in
Mariposa.



Traffic and Transportation/Pedestrians and Bicycle Facilities – The No-Build
Alternative would eventually cut off access to recreational activities, residents,
businesses, and Yosemite National Park via State Route 140 for all through traffic
and residential, transit, tour, and school buses, as well as recreational and
commercial traffic. The access would be cut off when the temporary bridges fail
due to general wear.



Hydrology and Floodplain – Alternative R would encroach longitudinally on the
base floodplain.

For a full discussion of unavoidable significant effects for the above issues, refer to
Chapter 3.
4.2.4 Significant Irreversible Environmental Changes
The project would have significant irreversible changes on the environment in the
following areas:


Wild and Scenic Rivers –Alternatives R and T-3 would affect the wildlife value
by removing limestone salamander habitat.



Threatened and Endangered Species – Alternatives R and T-3 propose to remove
limestone salamander habitat, which would likely result in a take of the California
fully protected limestone salamander.

For a full discussion of irreversible significant changes for the above issues, refer to
Chapter 3.
4.2.5 Climate Change under CEQA
Climate change refers to long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, wind
patterns, and other elements of the earth's climate system. An ever-increasing body of
scientific research attributes these climatological changes to greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions, particularly those generated from the production and use of fossil fuels.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  129

Chapter 4  California Environmental Quality Act Evaluation

While climate change has been a concern for several decades, the establishment of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) by the United Nations and
World Meteorological Organization in 1988, has led to increased efforts devoted to
GHG emissions reduction and climate change research and policy. These efforts are
primarily concerned with the emissions of GHGs generated by human activity
including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),
tetrafluoromethane, hexafluoroethane, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), HFC-23
(fluoroform), HFC-134a (s, s, s, 2-tetrafluoroethane), and HFC-152a (difluoroethane).
In the U.S., the main source of GHG emissions is electricity generation, followed by
transportation. In California, however, transportation sources (including passenger
cars, light duty trucks, other trucks, buses, and motorcycles make up the largest
source (second to electricity generation) of GHG emitting sources. The dominant
GHG emitted is CO2, mostly from fossil fuel combustion.
There are typically two terms used when discussing the impacts of climate change.
"Greenhouse Gas Mitigation" is a term for reducing GHG emissions in order to
reduce or "mitigate" the impacts of climate change. “Adaptation," refers to the effort
of planning for and adapting to impacts resulting from climate change (such as
adjusting transportation design standards to withstand more intense storms and higher
sea levels)1.
There are four primary strategies for reducing GHG emissions from transportation
sources: 1) improving the transportation system and operational efficiencies, 2)
reducing the growth of vehicle miles traveled (VMT), 3) transitioning to lower GHG
emitting fuels, and 4) improving vehicle technologies. To be most effective all four
strategies should be pursued cooperatively. The following Regulatory Setting section
outlines state and federal efforts to comprehensively reduce GHG emissions from
transportation sources
Regulatory Setting
State
With the passage of several pieces of legislation including State Senate and Assembly
Bills and Executive Orders, California launched an innovative and pro-active
approach to dealing with GHG emissions and climate.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  130

Chapter 4  California Environmental Quality Act Evaluation

Assembly Bill (AB) 1493, Pavley. Vehicular Emissions: Greenhouse Gases, 2002:
requires the California Air Resources Board to develop and implement regulations to
reduce automobile and light truck GHG emissions. These stricter emissions standards
were designed to apply to automobiles and light trucks beginning with the 2009model year. In June 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA)
Administrator granted a Clean Air Act waiver of preemption to California. This
waiver allowed California to implement its own GHG emission standards for motor
vehicles beginning with model year 2009. California agencies will be working with
federal agencies to conduct joint rulemaking to reduce GHG emissions for passenger
cars model years 2017-2025.
Executive Order (EO) S-3-05: (signed on June 1, 2005, by former Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger) the goal of this EO is to reduce California’s GHG emissions to: 1)
year 2000 levels by 2010, 2) year 1990 levels by the 2020, and 3) 80 percent below
the year 1990 levels by the year 2050. In 2006, this goal was further reinforced with
the passage of AB 32.
Assembly Bill 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, Núñez and Pavley:
AB 32 sets the same overall GHG emissions reduction goals as outlined in EO S-305, while further mandating that the California Air Resources Board create a scoping
plan (which includes market mechanisms) and implement rules to achieve “real,
quantifiable, cost-effective reductions of greenhouse gases.”
Executive Order S-20-06 (signed on October 18, 2006 by former Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger) further directs state agencies to begin implementing AB 32,
including the recommendations made by California’s Climate Action Team.
Executive Order S-01-07: (signed on January 18, 2007 by former Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger) set forth the low carbon fuel standard for California. Under this
EO, the carbon intensity of California’s transportation fuels is to be reduced by at
least ten percent by the year 2020.
Senate Bill (SB) 97, Chapter 185, 2007: required the Governor's Office of Planning
and Research (OPR) to develop recommended amendments to CEQA Guidelines for
addressing GHG emissions. The amendments became effective on March 18, 2010.
Caltrans Director’s Policy 30 (DP-30) Climate Change (approved June 22, 2012): is
intended to establish a Caltrans policy that will ensure coordinated efforts to
incorporate climate change into Caltrans decisions and activities. This policy

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  131

Chapter 4  California Environmental Quality Act Evaluation

contributes to Caltrans’ stewardship goal to preserve and enhance California’s
resources and assets.
Federal
Although climate change and GHG reduction is a concern at the federal level;
currently there are no regulations or legislation that have been enacted specifically
addressing GHG emissions reductions and climate change at the project level. Neither
the U.S. EPA nor FHWA has promulgated explicit guidance or methodology to
conduct project-level GHG analysis. As stated on FHWA’s climate change website
(http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/hep/climate/index.htm), climate change considerations
should be integrated throughout the transportation decision-making process–from
planning through project development and delivery. Addressing climate change
mitigation and adaptation up front in the planning process will facilitate decisionmaking and improve efficiency at the program level, and will inform the analysis and
stewardship needs of project level decision-making. Climate change considerations
can easily be integrated into many planning factors, such as supporting economic
vitality and global efficiency, increasing safety and mobility, enhancing the
environment, promoting energy conservation, and improving the quality of life.
The four strategies set forth by FHWA to lessen climate change impacts do correlate
with efforts that the state has undertaken and is undertaking to deal with
transportation and climate change; the strategies include improved transportation
system efficiency, cleaner fuels, cleaner vehicles, and a reduction in the growth of
vehicle hours travelled.
Climate change and its associated effects are being addressed through various efforts
at the federal level to improve fuel economy and energy efficiency, such as the
“National Clean Car Program” and EO 13514 - Federal Leadership in
Environmental, Energy and Economic Performance.
Executive Order 13514 is focused on reducing greenhouse gases internally in federal
agency missions, programs and operations, but also direct federal agencies to
participate in the Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force, which is
engaged in developing a national strategy for adaptation to climate change.
On April 2, 2007, in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007), the Supreme Court
found that greenhouse gases are air pollutants covered by the Clean Air Act and that
the U.S. EPA has the authority to regulate GHG. The Court held that the U.S. EPA
Administrator must determine whether or not emissions of greenhouse gases from

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  132

Chapter 4  California Environmental Quality Act Evaluation

new motor vehicles cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be
anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, or whether the science is too
uncertain to make a reasoned decision.
On December 7, 2009, the U.S. EPA Administrator signed two distinct findings
regarding greenhouse gases under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act:


Endangerment Finding: The Administrator finds that the current and projected
concentrations of the six key well-mixed greenhouse gases—carbon dioxide
(CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydro fluorocarbons (HFCs), per
fluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)—in the atmosphere threaten
the public health and welfare of current and future generations.



Cause or Contribute Finding: The Administrator finds that the combined
emissions of these well-mixed greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and
new motor vehicle engines contribute to the greenhouse gas pollution which
threatens public health and welfare.

Although these findings did not themselves impose any requirements on industry or
other entities, this action was a prerequisite to finalizing the U.S. EPA’s Proposed
Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards for Light-Duty Vehicles, which was published
on September 15, 20092. On May 7, 2010 the final Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse
Gas Emissions Standards and Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards was
published in the Federal Register.
U.S. EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) are
taking coordinated steps to enable the production of a new generation of clean
vehicles with reduced GHG emissions and improved fuel efficiency from on-road
vehicles and engines. These next steps include developing the first-ever GHG
regulations for heavy-duty engines and vehicles, as well as additional light-duty
vehicle GHG regulations. These steps were outlined by President Obama in a
Presidential Memorandum on May 21, 20103.
The final combined U.S. EPA and NHTSA standards that make up the first phase of
this national program apply to passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty
passenger vehicles, covering model years 2012 through 2016. The standards require
these vehicles to meet an estimated combined average emissions level of 250 grams
of carbon dioxide (CO2) per mile, (the equivalent to 35.5 miles per gallon [MPG] if

the automobile industry were to meet this CO2 level solely through fuel economy
improvements). Together, these standards will cut GHG emissions by an estimated
960 million metric tons and 1.8 billion barrels of oil over the lifetime of the vehicles
sold under the program (model years 2012-2016).
On November 16, 2011, U.S. EPA and NHTSA issued their joint proposal to extend
this national program of coordinated greenhouse gas and fuel economy standards to
model years 2017 through 2025 passenger vehicles.
Project Analysis
An individual project does not generate enough GHG emissions to significantly
influence global climate change. Rather, global climate change is a cumulative
impact. This means that a project may contribute to a potential impact through its
incremental change in emissions when combined with the contributions of all other
sources of GHG.4 In assessing cumulative impacts, it must be determined if a
project’s incremental effect is “cumulatively considerable” (CEQA Guidelines
sections 15064(h)(1) and 15130). To make this determination the incremental
impacts of the project must be compared with the effects of past, current, and
probable future projects. To gather sufficient information on a global scale of all
past, current, and future projects in order to make this determination is a difficult, if
not impossible, task.
The AB 32 Scoping Plan mandated by AB 32 contains the main strategies California
will use to reduce GHG emissions. As part of its supporting documentation for the
Draft Scoping Plan, the California Air Resources Board released the GHG inventory
for California (forecast last updated: October 28, 2010). The forecast is an estimate
of the emissions expected to occur in the year 2020 if none of the foreseeable
measures included in the Scoping Plan were implemented. The base year used for
forecasting emissions is the average of statewide emissions in the GHG inventory for
2006, 2007, and 2008.

This approach is supported by the AEP: Recommendations by the Association of Environmental
Professionals on How to Analyze GHG Emissions and Global Climate Change in CEQA Documents
(March 5, 2007), as well as the South Coast Air Quality Management District (Chapter 6: The CEQA
Guide, April 2011) and the US Forest Service (Climate Change Considerations in Project Level NEPA
Analysis, July 13, 2009).

Figure 4-1 California Greenhouse Gas Inventory

Caltrans and its parent agency, the Business, Transportation, and Housing Agency,
have taken an active role in addressing GHG emission reduction and climate change.
Recognizing that 98 percent of California’s GHG emissions are from the burning of
fossil fuels and 40 percent of all human-made GHG emissions are from
transportation, Caltrans has created and is implementing the Climate Action Program
at Caltrans that was published in December 2006.5
One of the main strategies in Caltrans’ Climate Action Program to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions is to make California’s transportation system more efficient. The
highest levels of carbon dioxide from mobile sources, such as automobiles, occur at
stop-and-go speeds (0-25 miles per hour) and speeds over 55 miles per hour.
Environmental Consequences
The purpose of the proposed project is to restore and reopen a section of State Route
140 that was closed due to a rockslide that began in 2006. The highway would be
replaced in kind with 2 lanes of traffic (one lane in each direction). Vehicles
currently stopped at either end of the Ferguson rockslide detour can be delayed for up
to 15 minutes, causing increased emissions in the area. Construction of the build
alternatives would reduce traffic congestion and/or vehicle time delays caused by the
current single-lane detour and traffic signals. Additionally, out of direction travel on
State Routes 120 and 41 that was caused as a result of the detour and delay on State

Chapter 4  California Environmental Quality Act Evaluation

Route 140 would be reduced by re-opening the route to all types of vehicles. No
additional operational greenhouse gas emissions are expected as a result of the
proposed project. If the No-Build Alternative is selected as the preferred alternative,
the temporary bridges and detour would eventually be removed. Vehicles would have
to use other state highways to access Yosemite National Park or El Portal. This out of
direction travel may lead to increase vehicle hours of delay and increased vehicle
miles traveled.
Construction Emissions
Greenhouse gas emissions for transportation projects can be divided into those
produced during construction and those produced during operations. Construction
GHG emissions include emissions produced as a result of material processing,
emissions produced by onsite construction equipment, and emissions arising from
traffic delays due to construction. These emissions will be produced at different levels
throughout the construction phase; their frequency and occurrence can be reduced
through innovations in plans and specifications and by implementing better traffic
management during construction phases.
In addition, with innovations such as longer pavement lives, improved traffic
management plans, and changes in materials, the GHG emissions produced during
construction can be mitigated to some degree by longer intervals between
maintenance and rehabilitation events. The provisions of Caltrans Standard
Specifications, Section 14-1.01 “Air Pollution Control” require the contractor to
comply with the Mariposa County’s Air Pollution Control District’s rules and
ordinances.
CEQA Conclusion
While construction related activities will result in an increase in greenhouse gas
emissions during construction, Caltrans expects that there would be no operational
increase in GHG emissions associated with this proposed project. However, it is
Caltrans’ determination that in the absence of further regulatory or scientific
information related to greenhouse gas emissions and California Environmental
Quality Act significance, it is too speculative to make a determination on the project’s
direct impact and its contribution on the cumulative scale to climate change.
Nonetheless, Caltrans is taking further measures to help reduce energy consumption
and greenhouse gas emissions. These measures are outlined in the following section.

AB 32 Compliance
Caltrans continues to be actively involved on the Governor’s Climate Action Team as
the California Air Resources Board works to implement EO S-3-05 and S-01-07 and
help achieve the targets set forth in AB 32. Many of the strategies Caltrans is using to
help meet the targets in AB 32 come from the California Strategic Growth Plan,
which is updated each year. Former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Strategic
Growth Plan calls for a $222 billion infrastructure improvement program to fortify
the state’s transportation system, education, housing, and waterways, including
$100.7 billion in transportation funding during the next decade. The Strategic Growth
Plan targets a significant decrease in traffic congestion below today’s level and a
corresponding reduction in GHG emissions. The Strategic Growth Plan proposes to
do this while accommodating growth in population and the economy. A suite of
investment options has been created that combined together are expected to reduce
congestion. The Strategic Growth Plan relies on a complete systems approach to
attain CO2 reduction goals: system monitoring and evaluation, maintenance and
preservation, smart land use and demand management, and operational improvements
as depicted in Figure 4.2.

Figure 4-2 Mobility Pyramid

Caltrans is supporting efforts to reduce vehicle miles traveled by planning and
implementing smart land use strategies: job/housing proximity, developing transitoriented communities, and high density housing along transit corridors. Caltrans
works closely with local jurisdictions on planning activities but does not have local
land use planning authority. Caltrans also assists efforts to improve the energy
efficiency of the transportation sector by increasing vehicle fuel economy in new
cars, light and heavy-duty trucks; Caltrans is doing this by supporting on-going
research efforts at universities, by supporting legislative efforts to increase fuel

economy, and by its participation on the Climate Action Team. It is important to
note, however, that the control of the fuel economy standards is held by U.S. EPA
and the California Air Resources Board.
Table 4.1 summarizes Caltrans and statewide efforts that it is implementing in order
to reduce GHG emissions. More detailed information about each strategy is included
in the Climate Action Program at Caltrans (December 2006).

Adaptation Strategies
“Adaptation strategies” refer to how Caltrans and others can plan for the effects of
climate change on the state’s transportation infrastructure and strengthen or protect
the facilities from damage. Climate change is expected to produce increased
variability in precipitation, rising temperatures, rising sea levels, variability in storm
surges and intensity, and the frequency and intensity of wildfires. These changes may
affect the transportation infrastructure in various ways, such as damage to roadbeds
from longer periods of intense heat; increasing storm damage from flooding and
erosion; and inundation from rising sea levels. These effects will vary by location
and may, in the most extreme cases, require that a facility be relocated or redesigned.
There may also be economic and strategic ramifications as a result of these types of
impacts to the transportation infrastructure.
At the federal level, the Climate Change Adaptation Task Force, co-chaired by the
Council on Environmental Quality, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, released its interagency report
on October 14, 2010 outlining recommendations to President Obama for how federal
agency policies and programs can better prepare the United States to respond to the
effects of climate change. The Progress Report of the Interagency Climate Change
Adaptation Task Force recommends that the federal government implement actions to
expand and strengthen the nation’s capacity to better understand, prepare for, and
respond to climate change.
Climate change adaption must also involve the natural environment as well. Efforts
are underway on a statewide-level to develop strategies to cope with impacts to
habitat and biodiversity through planning and conservation. The results of these
efforts will help California agencies plan and implement mitigation strategies for
programs and projects.
On November 14, 2008, former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed EO S-1308 which directed a number of state agencies to address California’s vulnerability to
sea level rise caused by climate change. This EO set in motion several agencies and
actions to address the concern of sea level rise.
The California Natural Resources Agency was directed to coordinate with local,
regional, state and federal public and private entities to develop. The California

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  140

Chapter 4  California Environmental Quality Act Evaluation

Climate Adaptation Strategy (Dec 2009)6, which summarizes the best known science
on climate change impacts to California, assesses California's vulnerability to the
identified impacts, and then outlines solutions that can be implemented within and
across state agencies to promote resiliency.
The strategy outline is in direct response to EO S-13-08 that specifically asked the
California Natural Resources Agency to identify how state agencies can respond to
rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, sea level rise, and extreme
natural events. Numerous other state agencies were involved in the creation of the
Adaptation Strategy document, including the California Environmental Protection
Agency; Business, Transportation and Housing; Health and Human Services; and the
Department of Agriculture. The document is broken down into strategies for different
sectors that include: Public Health; Biodiversity and Habitat; Ocean and Coastal
Resources; Water Management; Agriculture; Forestry; and Transportation and Energy
Infrastructure. As data continues to be developed and collected, the state's adaptation
strategy will be updated to reflect current findings.
The California Natural Resources Agency was also directed to request the National
Academy of Science to prepare a Sea Level Rise Assessment Report by December
20107 to advise how California should plan for future sea level rise. The report is to
include:


Relative sea level rise projections for California, Oregon, and Washington taking
into account coastal erosion rates, tidal impacts, El Niño and La Niña events,
storm surge and land subsidence rates.



The range of uncertainty in selected sea level rise projections.



A synthesis of existing information on projected sea level rise impacts to state
infrastructure (such as roads, public facilities and beaches), natural areas, and
coastal and marine ecosystems.



A discussion of future research needs regarding sea level rise.

Prior to the release of the final Sea Level Rise Assessment Report, all state agencies
that are planning to construct projects in areas vulnerable to future sea level rise were
directed to consider a range of sea level rise scenarios for the years 2050 and 2100 to
6

http://www.energy.ca.gov/2009publications/CNRA-1000-2009-027/CNRA-1000-2009-027-F.PDF
Pre-publication copies of the report, Sea Level Rise for the Coasts of California, Oregon, and
Washington: Past, Present, and Future, were made available from the National Academies Press on
June 22, 2012. For more information, please see http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13389.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  141

Chapter 4  California Environmental Quality Act Evaluation

assess project vulnerability and, to the extent feasible, reduce expected risks and
increase resiliency to sea level rise. Sea level rise estimates should also be used in
conjunction with information regarding local uplift and subsidence, coastal erosion
rates, predicted higher high water levels, storm surge and storm wave data.
Interim guidance has been released by the Coastal Ocean Climate Action Team (COCAT) as well as Caltrans as a method to initiate action and discussion of potential
risks to the state’s infrastructure due to projected sea level rise.
The proposed project is outside the coastal zone, and direct impacts to transportation
facilities due to projected sea level rise are not expected.
EO S-13-08 also directed the Business, Transportation, and Housing Agency to
prepare a report to assess vulnerability of transportation systems to sea level rise
affecting safety, maintenance and operational improvements of the system, and
economy of the state. Caltrans continues to work on assessing the transportation
system vulnerability to climate change, including the effect of sea level rise.
Currently, Caltrans is working to assess which transportation facilities are at greatest
risk from climate change effects. However, without statewide planning scenarios for
relative sea level rise and other climate change effects, Caltrans has not been able to
determine what change, if any, may be made to its design standards for its
transportation facilities. Once statewide planning scenarios become available,
Caltrans will be able review its current design standards to determine what changes, if
any, may be warranted to protect the transportation system from sea level rise.
Climate change adaptation for transportation infrastructure involves long-term
planning and risk management to address vulnerabilities in the transportation system
from increased precipitation and flooding; the increased frequency and intensity of
storms and wildfires; rising temperatures; and rising sea levels. Caltrans is an active
participant in the efforts being conducted in response to EO S-13-08 and is
mobilizing to be able to respond to the National Academy of Science Sea Level Rise
Assessment Report.

4.3

Mitigation Measures for Significant Impacts under CEQA

Natural Communities – Caltrans would specifically mitigate for oaks at a 3 to 1 ratio
based on the acreage of impact. This would be made possible by restoring a currently
disturbed site or purchasing and preserving intact oak woodland. All mitigation plans

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  142

Chapter 4  California Environmental Quality Act Evaluation

would be approved by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the U.S.
Forest Service.
Limestone salamander – The build alternatives would require a 2081 Incidental Take
Permit from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. As part of the permit
requirements, Caltrans would purchase off-site compensatory mitigation at
approximately a 3 to 1 ratio. A construction work window may be established during
initial ground disturbance activities to prevent construction-related activities from
occurring on the southern slope during the salamander’s active season.
Environmentally sensitive area fencing in the form of 5-foot orange plastic mesh as
well as salamander exclusion (protection) fencing in the form of 24-inch sheet metal
would be erected if construction-related activities were to occur next to limestone
salamander habitat and during their active season. All mitigation plans would be
approved by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.
For a full discussion on Avoidance, Minimization, and/or Mitigation Measures, refer
to Chapter 3.

Comments and Coordination

Early and continuing coordination with the general public and appropriate public
agencies is an essential part of the environmental process helping to determine the
necessary scope of environmental documentation, the appropriate level of analysis,
the type and magnitude of potential impacts and mitigation measures, and other
related environmental requirements. Agency consultation and public participation for
this project have been accomplished through a variety of formal and informal means,
including project development team meetings, interagency coordination meetings,
public information meetings, press releases, information update brochures, and
consultation with Native American representatives. This chapter summarizes the
results of Caltrans’ efforts to identify, address, and resolve project-related issues
through early and continuing coordination.
Early and Ongoing Coordination
Caltrans project management and various members of the project development team
have regularly presented project information to the Mariposa County Board of
Supervisors, the U.S. Forest Service, and public officials. Mariposa County officials
and the U.S. Forest Service employees have shown interest in this project and support
its construction.
Coordination with Public Agencies (23 USC 139)
Caltrans began coordinating with public agencies on the preparation of the Draft
Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report in February 2008
following the release of the Notice of Intent, which was published in the Federal
Register on January 24, 2008. A Notice of Preparation was also circulated to public
agencies on January 28, 2008.
During February 2008, letters of invitation were issued to public agencies that were
either interested in the proposed project or would have a permitting responsibility on
the project. The following agencies received invitations to be cooperating and
participating agencies:


U.S. National Park Service Yosemite – formally accepted cooperating and
participating agency status, is actively involved in project interagency meetings,
and will provide comments on the environmental document.



Bureau of Land Management – formally accepted cooperating and participating
agency status based on its responsibilities of managing and permitting river

Interagency Meetings
Five meetings were held on the following dates:
February 13, 2008: Caltrans announced its role as lead agency for the preparation of
the Draft Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report and verified
the roles of the agencies present. Concurrence on the purpose and need was obtained,
and discussions were held on methods for addressing the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
The agencies requested that Caltrans identify and analyze additional alternatives that
avoid adversely affecting the Merced River. The agencies also requested that Caltrans
initiate a recreational survey to determine the public’s perception of how the proposed
alternatives could affect the Merced River corridor.
April 30, 2008: Each agency discussed its individual comments on the Notice of
Intent and explained that their comments on the Initial Study with Proposed Negative
Declaration/Environmental Assessment should be used during the development of the
Draft Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report. Caltrans
presented Alternatives A and T-3 as alternatives that would be analyzed for their
viability and for their ability to avoid the Merced River. Caltrans discussed efforts it
had made toward initiating a recreational survey and a river geomorphology report,
and updating all other studies previously finalized.
November 19, 2008: Caltrans presented Alternatives E, A, and T-2 as alternatives
considered and withdrawn. The agencies concurred as long as adequate
documentation is provided. Alternative S-2 was presented as an alternative that would
place piers above the ordinary high water mark of the river and avoid affecting
limestone salamander habitat. The U.S. Forest Service confirmed that the ordinary

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  147

Chapter 4  California Environmental Quality Act Evaluation

high water is equal to the Q2 flow or 8871 cubic feet per second. Agencies further
concurred that the No-Build Alternative is the temporary detour and should be
evaluated for its long-term effects on the project area. A status of the environmental
studies and recreational survey was also provided.
July 1, 2010: Caltrans provided an update to the cooperating/participating agencies
by discussing the status of the draft environmental document, the anticipated
scheduled release of the document, the public circulation process, and the finalization
of the draft recreational survey report. All agencies concurred that the environmental
document should be sent to the agencies at least two weeks in advance of the start of
the circulation process to further promote coordination efforts. During the circulation
process, the agencies would be reviewing the draft environmental document and the
draft survey report. Following their reviews, comments would be provided on both
documents. Caltrans would conduct regular meetings with the agencies during the
circulation process to facilitate quality reviews and address concerns with the draft
environmental document.
November 14, 2012: Caltrans provided agencies with new information that requires
Caltrans to circulate a new draft environmental document. This included the passing
of Assembly Bill 1973, a Final Recreation Survey of the Merced River, a change to
the Merced River Section 4(f) boundary, and an update to the Wild and Scenic Rivers
Section 7(a) process. The new information led the interagency group to discuss the
removal of the bridge alternatives that were presented in the November 2010 Draft
Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report. All agencies
concurred that Alternatives C, T, and S should be removed from further consideration
because of the adverse impact each would have on the Merced Wild and Scenic
River’s free flow. Additionally, Alternatives S2-V1 and S2-V2 should be removed
from further consideration because they would have adverse impacts to several
outstandingly remarkable values of the river and would have a direct use of a Section
4(f) property.
Mariposa County Board of Supervisors
Caltrans staff attended various board meetings to give regular updates on the
Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration project. The Mariposa County Board of
Supervisors has been given regular opportunities to participate in the development of
the project.

completely avoided with implemented avoidance measures. Also discussed were
mitigation measures for impacts to bats, oak woodland, and hardhead fish.
October 3, 2007: Caltrans received an email from Laura Peterson-Diaz accepting
Caltrans’ proposal of avoidance and mitigation measures for bats, oak woodland,
limestone salamander, and hardhead fish.
September 22, 2008: Caltrans discussed the effects of Alternatives R and T-3 on
limestone salamander habitat. Caltrans requested that the California Department of
Fish and Wildlife provide a letter stating that if any alternative presents a take on the
limestone salamander habitat, then a permit could not be issued and that a waiver of
the Fully Protected Species Act would need to be pursued for this project.
November 8, 2012: Caltrans met with Laura Peterson-Diaz to discuss mitigation
strategies for the limestone salamander.
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
February 1, 2007: Caltrans spoke with Tom Cavanaugh regarding the need for an
individual permit if the U.S. Forest Service determines the project would have an
adverse impact on the Merced River, which has a Wild and Scenic designation.
January 28, 2009: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers participated in the
Environmental Focus Group meeting as a cooperating agency on the project.
National Park Service

Chapter 4  California Environmental Quality Act Evaluation

July 22, 2010: The National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service, and Caltrans
discussed the process by which impacts to the outstandingly remarkable values would
be evaluated. Any impacts to the outstandingly remarkable values are to be evaluated
pursuant to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. A Section 7(a) evaluation would be
prepared for each alternative describing the impacts. The evaluations are prepared by
the U.S. Forest Service, which functions as the river administering agency. The
Section 7(a) process of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act is considered a separate
analysis from the NEPA process.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service
October 9, 2007: Caltrans had a phone conference with Madelyn Martinez and Doug
Hampton to discuss the potential for essential fish habitat at the project site. Both said
they would have no jurisdiction over this project area.
The National Marine Fisheries Service issued a Draft Recovery Plan for Sacramento
River winter-run chinook salmon and Central Valley spring-run chinook salmon. A
potential recovery scenario would include the reintroduction of steelhead trout above
the New Exchequer Reservoir on the main stem of the Merced River and on the South
Fork Merced River. Prior to construction of any alternative, Caltrans would
coordinate with the National Marine Fisheries Service with respect to the recovery
plan.
U.S. Forest Service, Sierra National Forest
February 16, 2007: Caltrans submitted an operating plan for cultural work to the
U.S. Forest Service for permitting purposes.
March 2007: Caltrans visited the U.S. Forest Service’s district archaeologist’s office
to review cultural files of the project area.
April 10, 2007: Caltrans discussed the preparation of the Section 7(a) Wild and
Scenic Rivers Act Evaluation with Dave Martin, District Ranger, and Jackie Diedrich
of the U.S. Forest Service. The preparation should follow the guidance provided in
the October 2004 Wild and Scenic Rivers Act technical document.
May 8, 2007: Caltrans talked with the U.S. Forest Service about the “outstandingly
remarkable values” used to determine a project’s effect on a Wild and Scenic River.
These values should be applied to the discussion on the Merced Wild and Scenic
River Evaluation as appropriate.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  150

Chapter 4  California Environmental Quality Act Evaluation

Service.
June 14, 2007: Caltrans received a sensitive animal species list from the U.S. Forest
Service.
July 25, 2007: The U.S. Forest Service suggested that the Bureau of Land
Management should also be a reviewing agency of the Section 7(a) Wild and Scenic
Rivers Act Evaluation. The Bureau of Land Management is responsible for issuing
permits for whitewater rafting on the Merced River. Also, various U.S. Forest Service
specialists will be reviewing the evaluation.
July 26, 2007: Caltrans biology and landscape architecture staff met with Joanna
Clines to discuss erosion control measures and post-construction plantings.
August 10, 2007: Caltrans sent the U.S. Forest Service a copy of the Public
Information Meetings Summary Report.
August 21, 2007: The U.S. Forest Service informed Caltrans that it would be
working with its Wild and Scenic River Coordinator on clearly defining the
“outstandingly remarkable values.” These values should help Caltrans with the
Section 7(a) analysis of the Merced River.
August 29, 2007: Caltrans and the U.S. Forest Service discussed the Merced River
and whether it has been designated as recreational in terms of being a Section 4(f)

agencies requested that Caltrans initiate a recreational survey to determine impacts to
the Merced River.
April–June 2008: Weekly coordination meetings were held with the U.S. Forest
Service about the construction of the second temporary detour project. The U.S.
Forest Service confirmed that, for the purposes of the detour project, the Q2 flow
would represent the ordinary high water mark of the river. Impacts to the river would
be analyzed based on the Q2 boundary.
August 8, 2008: Caltrans met with the U.S. Forest Service to discuss final comments
on the recreational survey plan and gain concurrence on the plan so that the survey
could be implemented online and in the field.
September 19, 2008: Caltrans met with the U.S. Forest Service to discuss analyzing
the 4(f) properties within the project area. Caltrans confirmed that the Merced River
and Incline Road would be considered 4(f) properties.
November 21, 2008: Caltrans met with the U.S. Forest Service to confirm that the
proposed alternatives are still subject to a Wild and Scenic River analysis even if they
avoid encroaching into the Q2 flow. The analysis would determine if the alternatives
affect the river in a manner that the U.S. Forest Service would find adverse.

April 17, 2009: Caltrans met with the U.S. Forest Service to discuss preparation of
the Individual Section 4(f) and the Wild and Scenic River section of the
environmental document.
June 9, 2009: Caltrans design and structures engineers along with environmental
staff met with the U.S. Forest Service at the project site to discuss proposed bridge
construction methods and their effect on the Q2 flow of the river. Further discussions
would be held to address mitigation for the construction methods.
March 16, 2010: Caltrans and the U.S. Forest Service discussed strategies for the
review of the draft environmental document. The U.S. Forest Service has requested to
receive the draft environmental document one to two weeks in advance of its release
to the public. The U.S. Forest Service will provide comments on the document
following the start of circulation and will also be conducting a concurrent review for
the draft recreational survey report. This review is being conducted at the same time
as the document because the survey report will aid in the preparation of the draft
Section 7(a) evaluations. The public circulation process may require up to a 90-day
review. The U.S. Forest Service is also requesting that a series of meetings take place
at the start of the circulation period, which would involve discussing conceptual
design plans. This would facilitate a better review process.
The U.S. Forest Service would be preparing draft Section 7(a) evaluations absent of
determinations for each alternative. These evaluations would also be done during the
circulation of the draft environmental document. Both the environmental document
and the recreational survey report will be used for the preparation of these
evaluations. Caltrans confirmed that Section 7(a) determinations (not evaluations)
would be required for each alternative if the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requests
them from the U.S. Forest Service. An alternative would typically require a Section
7(a) determination if that alternative affects the river below the ordinary high water
mark. This criterion applies to the Wild and Scenic River analysis and not the NEPA
analysis. The U.S. Forest Service will be evaluating impacts to the outstandingly
remarkable values within the Wild and Scenic Corridor even if determinations are not
required for certain alternatives or regardless of whether the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers requests a determination. This type of analysis is also part of the Wild and
Scenic Rivers Act and is not a NEPA analysis.

May 1, 2013: Caltrans and the U.S. Forest Service met to discuss the eligibility
determinations of the cultural resources identified in the project area. The below
determinations were agreed upon by both agencies:


Prehistoric bedrock mortars sites CA-MRP-1566 and CA-MRP-2076– The U.S.
Forest Service is in the process of defining a historic landscape within the Merced
River Canyon that they consider a historic property. The bedrock mortar sites are
potential contributors to that historic property.



Yosemite Valley Railroad Grade (now Incline Road in the project area)– The
segment of the railroad bed in the area of potential effects would not be a
contributor to an eligible linear resource.



State Route 140– The segment of State Route 140 in the area of potential effects
would not be a contributor to an eligible linear resource.



Historic concrete bridge piers and debris (CA-MRP-1552H)– The concrete bridge
piers and debris lack the integrity of materials, setting, feeling, or design for their
respective periods of significance that would make it eligible to the National
Register of Historic Places.



Two Bedrock Basins– Caltrans, on behalf of FHWA, would determine that the
basins are not eligible to the National register of Historic Places.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  154

Chapter 4  California Environmental Quality Act Evaluation



Plant Collection Area– The presence of indigenous plants of economic
importance to the Miwuk is not enough to designate an area within the area of
potential effects as a traditional Miwuk plant collecting area of significance.

Appendix A California Environmental
Quality Act Checklist
The following checklist identifies physical, biological, social, and economic factors
that might be affected by the proposed project. The California Environmental Quality
Act impact levels include “potentially significant impact,” “less than significant
impact with mitigation,” “less than significant impact,” and “no impact.”
Supporting documentation of all California Environmental Quality Act checklist
determinations is provided in Chapters 3 and 4 of this Environmental Impact
Report/Environmental Impact Statement. Documentation of “No Impact”
determinations is provided at the beginning of Chapters 3 and 4. Discussion of all
impacts, avoidance, minimization, and/or compensation measures is under the
appropriate topic headings in Chapters 3 and 4.

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  175

Potentially
significant
impact

I. AESTHETICS: Would the project:
a) Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista
b) Substantially damage scenic resources, including, but not
limited to, trees, rock outcroppings, and historic buildings within a
state scenic highway
c) Substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of
the site and its surroundings?
d) Create a new source of substantial light or glare which would
adversely affect day or nighttime views in the area?
II. AGRICULTURE AND FOREST RESOURCES: In
determining whether impacts to agricultural resources are
significant environmental effects, lead agencies may refer to the
California Agricultural Land Evaluation and Site Assessment
Model (1997) prepared by the California Dept. of Conservation
as an optional model to use in assessing impacts on agriculture
and farmland. In determining whether impacts to forest
resources, including timberland, are significant environmental
effects, lead agencies may refer to information compiled by the
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection regarding
the state’s inventory of forest land, including the Forest and
Range Assessment Project and the Forest Legacy Assessment
Project; and the forest carbon measurement methodology
provided in Forest Protocols adopted by the California Air
Resources Board. Would the project:
a) Convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or Farmland of
Statewide Importance (Farmland), as shown on the maps
prepared pursuant to the Farmland Mapping and Monitoring
Program of the California Resources Agency, to non-agricultural
use?
b) Conflict with existing zoning for agricultural use, or a
Williamson Act contract?
c) Conflict with existing zoning for, or cause rezoning of, forest
land (as defined in Public Resources Code section 12220(g)),
timberland (as defined by Public Resources Code section 4526),
or timberland zoned Timberland Production (as defined by
Government Code section 51104(g))?
d) Result in the loss of forest land or conversion of forest land to
non-forest use?
e) Involve other changes in the existing environment which, due
to their location or nature, could result in conversion of Farmland,
to non-agricultural use or conversion of forest land to non-forest
use?

under an applicable federal or state ambient air quality standard
(including releasing emissions which exceed quantitative
thresholds for ozone precursors)?
d) Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant
concentrations?
e) Create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of
people?

IV. BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES: Would the project:
a) Have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or through
habitat modifications, on any species identified as a candidate,
sensitive, or special status species in local or regional plans,
policies, or regulations, or by the California Department of Fish
and Wildlife or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service?
b) Have a substantial adverse effect on any riparian habitat or
other sensitive natural community identified in local or regional
plans, policies, regulations or by the California Department of
Fish and Wildlife or US Fish and Wildlife Service?
c) Have a substantial adverse effect on federally protected
wetlands as defined by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act
(including, but not limited to, marsh, vernal pool, coastal, etc.)
through direct removal, filling, hydrological interruption, or other
means?
d) Interfere substantially with the movement of any native
resident or migratory fish or wildlife species or with established
native resident or migratory wildlife corridors, or impede the use
of native wildlife nursery sites?
e) Conflict with any local policies or ordinances protecting
biological resources, such as a tree preservation policy or
ordinance?
f) Conflict with the provisions of an adopted Habitat Conservation
Plan, Natural Community Conservation Plan, or other approved
local, regional, or state habitat conservation plan?

effects, including the risk of loss, injury, or death involving:
i) Rupture of a known earthquake fault, as delineated on the
most recent Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Map issued
by the State Geologist for the area or based on other substantial
evidence of a known fault? Refer to Division of Mines and
Geology Special Publication 42?
ii) Strong seismic ground shaking?
iii) Seismic-related ground failure, including liquefaction?
iv) Landslides?
b) Result in substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil?
c) Be located on a geologic unit or soil that is unstable, or that
would become unstable as a result of the project, and potentially
result in on- or off-site landslide, lateral spreading, subsidence,
liquefaction or collapse?

this good faith effort in order to provide the public and
decision-makers as much information as possible
about the project, it is Caltrans’ determination that in
the absence of further regulatory or scientific
information related to GHG emissions and CEQA
significance, it is too speculative to make a significance
determination regarding the project’s direct and indirect
impact with respect to climate change. Caltrans does
remain firmly committed to implementing measures to
help reduce the potential effects of the project. These
measures are outlined in the body of the environmental
document.

Appendix B De Minimis Determination and
Resources Evaluated Relative
to the Requirements of
Section 4(f)
Section 6009(a) of SAFETEA-LU amended Section 4(f) legislation at 23 USC 138
and 49 USC 303 to simplify the processing and approval of projects that have only de
minimis impacts on lands protected by Section 4(f). This revision provides that once
the U.S. Department of Transportation determines that a transportation use of Section
4(f) property, after consideration of any impact avoidance, minimization, and
mitigation or enhancement measures, results in a de minimis impact on that property,
an analysis of avoidance alternatives is not required and the Section 4(f) evaluation
process is complete. FHWA’s final rule on Section 4(f) de minimis findings is
codified in 23 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 774.3 and CFR 774.17.
Responsibility for compliance with Section 4(f) has been assigned to Caltrans
pursuant to 23 USC 326 and 327, including determinations and approval of Section
4(f) evaluations, as well as coordination with those agencies that have jurisdiction
over a Section 4(f) resource that may be affected by a project action.
De minimis impacts on publicly owned parks, recreation areas, and wildlife and
waterfowl refuges are defined as those that do not adversely affect the activities,
features, or attributes of the Section 4(f) resource.
Description of Section 4(f) Properties
One Section 4(f) resource has been identified within the project area. The resource is
the recreational portion of the Merced Wild and Scenic River, which includes the bed
and bank of the river, Incline Road, which is used as a recreational trail, and the area
between the north side of the river and Incline Road.
The Merced River is designated as a federal Wild and Scenic River to protect the
largely undeveloped river from further development to preserve the wild, scenic, and
recreational characteristics. The segment of the Merced River that flows through the
project area is classified as recreational because of the presence of the highway and
Incline Road and the recreational activities that the river supports. This 5.5-mile
segment extends from the confluence of the South Fork Merced River to the
northwest boundary of the Sierra and the southeast boundary of the Stanislaus

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  185

Appendix B  Section 4(f) Evaluation

National Forests. The river here is free flowing; the slopes alongside it are sparsely
vegetated, making the river highly visible to the traveling public. Whitewater rafting,
fishing, hiking and picnicking are popular activities along this part of the Merced
River.
The portion of Incline Road that parallels the Merced River within the project area is
considered to be a recreational trail that the public can use and access via State Route
140. Hiking and biking are popular activities on the trail, with occasional equestrian
riders using it as well. The U.S. Forest Service owns and maintains Incline Road for
its use as a recreational trail. The recreational aspect of Incline Road contributes to
the Wild and Scenic River’s outstandingly remarkable value of recreation.
De minimis Impact Finding
Alternatives R and T-3 avoid permanent use of the Section 4(f) resource. With the
implementation of minimization measures during construction and the restoration of
Incline Road to its previous condition, the build alternatives would not adversely
affect the recreational activities of the Section 4(f) resource.
See Figure B-1 at the end of this appendix for a map of the Section 4(f) resource.
Measures to Minimize Harm to the Section 4(f) Resource
Measures to minimize harm to the Merced Wild and Scenic River Section 4(f)
resource include the following:


During the rafting season, construction would need to be coordinated with the
U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and the commercial outfitters
to safely allow rafting to continue through the project area. Spotters would be
placed at the rafting put-in locations and upstream from the construction area to
identify time periods during which construction would need to be suspended. This
method was successfully used during the installation of the temporary bridges.



Construction work in, alongside, or above the river during rafting season could
potentially impede rafting opportunities. Work may need to be suspended Friday
through Sunday during daylight hours.



During the rafting season, construction activities would need to be suspended for
a four-day duration surrounding both the Memorial Day and July 4th holidays.



A minimum of a two-week notice would need to be provided to the U.S. Forest
Service, Bureau of Land Management, and the commercial outfitters prior to
Caltrans closing the river for any construction activities. Any closure of the river
Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  186

Appendix B  Section 4(f) Evaluation

would occur mid-week when the river has the least number of boaters. An
additional 48-hour notification would need to occur to provide specific times that
the river would be closed and when it would be opening to rafting.


Any road closures would need to be planned in coordination with the U.S. Forest
Service, Bureau of Land Management, and the commercial outfitters. Notification
of the closures would occur a minimum of two weeks prior to the closure. An
additional 48-hour notice would need to be provided for specific times of
anticipated delays.



Caltrans context-sensitive solutions would be included during project
development to incorporate naturally existing features into the design.



Areas would be excavated using measures that preserve roots of adjacent trees.



Existing rock outcroppings would be retained.



Any rock outcropping exposed by construction would be given a natural
appearance and stained to give a weathered look.



Erosion control would be applied to all disturbed slopes except rock outcroppings,
and prevent runoff into the river.



Plant materials would be replaced in specific areas to visually mitigate for
structure heights and cut slopes. Consult with the U.S. Forest Service on a
planting ratio.



The project would replant using native species and create natural-appearing
patterns.



Colors that blend into the surroundings would be used on structures.



Incline Road would be restored to its previous condition by removing all
pavement and temporary bridge abutments.



Trail use opportunities would need to be restored at the earliest possible date.

Refer to Chapter 3 for more information on measures to minimize harm to the Merced
River and Incline Road.
Coordination
On August 29, 2007, Caltrans and the U.S. Forest Service, the agency with
jurisdiction over the Merced River, first discussed the Merced River and whether the
river had been classified as recreational in terms of being a Section 4(f) resource or
solely for the purposes of a Wild and Scenic River. Talks continued between Caltrans

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  187

Appendix B  Section 4(f) Evaluation

and the U.S. Forest Service, discussing the Merced River as being protected by the
Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and as a 4(f) resource due to its recreational
classification. These discussions took place during a field visit in February 2008,
throughout interagency meetings of the same year, and at a focused 4(f) meeting held
on September 19, 2008.
On April 17, 2009, Caltrans met with the U.S. Forest Service to discuss preparation of
the Individual Section 4(f) and the Wild and Scenic River section of the
environmental document. It was concluded that the Section 4(f) evaluation should
analyze both the Merced River and Incline Road as 4(f) resources, have a 4(f)
resource boundary equivalent to the Wild and Scenic River recreationally classified
segment boundary (1/2 mile out from edge of the river), and discuss impacts to the
4(f) resources similarly to the impacts affecting the Wild and Scenic River corridor.
In November of 2010, a Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact
Statement was circulated to the public using the above Section 4(f) boundary. At that
time there were 6 build alternatives, all of which impacted the Section 4(f) resource
because of the large area it covered. No avoidance alterative to using the Section 4(f)
resource was feasible. In June 2010, a recreation survey of the Merced Wild and
Scenic River was complete, however the finding of the survey were not included in
the November 2010 document. Caltrans has now analyzed the survey findings and
determined that the ½ mile in each direction boundary did not follow the intent of the
Section 4(f) law.
During October to December 2012, Caltrans had several discussions with the U.S.
Forest Service about the Section 4(f) boundaries of the Merced Wild and Scenic
River and use of each alternative. In a letter dated January 25, 2013, the U.S. Forest
Service agreed that the Section 4(f) resource should be reduced to the recreational
portion of the Merced Wild and Scenic River, which includes the bed and bank of the
river, Incline Road, and the area between the north side of the river and Incline Road.
This letter is attached at the end of this appendix. The January 2013 letter supersedes
the April 2009 boundary decision.
Resources Evaluated Relative to the Requirements of Section 4(f)
This section of the document discusses parks, recreational facilities, wildlife refuges,
and historic properties found within or adjacent to the project area that do not trigger
Section 4(f) protection because either: 1) they are not publicly owned, 2) they are not
open to the public, 3) they are not eligible historic properties, 4) the project does not

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  188

Appendix B  Section 4(f) Evaluation

permanently use the property and does not hinder the preservation of the property, or
5) the proximity impacts do not result in constructive use.
Yosemite National Park is the main tourist attraction of Mariposa County and
considered to be a well-known Section 4(f) resource. The Arch Rock entrance station
on State Route 140 is a less than ten miles east of the project and Yosemite Valley is
less than 20 miles east. People from around the world visit the park to sightsee, hike
and camp. Three state highways access the park. State Route 140 is one, and State
Routes 120 and 41 are the other two. While the build alternatives would not use any
portion of the park, deny access to, or affect any resource within the park, the
unavoidable closure of the highway as a result of the No-Build Alternative would
eliminate access to the park for individuals traveling from the west side of the
Ferguson rockslide via State Route 140.
Other recreational areas managed by the U.S. Forest Service are nearby and rely on
State Route 140 for access. The ten miles between the project site and the Yosemite
National Park entrance station is home to several camp grounds, a picnic/day use
area, rafting put-ins, and trail-heads.

An act to amend Section 5050 of, and to add Section 2081.9 to, the Fish
and Game Code, relating to wildlife resources.

LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST

AB 1973, Olsen. Protected species: take: Ferguson Slide Permanent
Restoration Project.
The California Endangered Species Act (CESA) prohibits the taking of an
endangered or threatened species, except as specified. The Department of
Fish and Game may authorize the take of listed species if the take is
incidental to an otherwise lawful activity and the impacts are minimized and
fully mitigated.
This bill would authorize the department to authorize under CESA the
incidental take of limestone salamander (Hydromantes brunus) resulting from
impacts attributable to the Department of Transportation's implementation of
the Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration Project, contingent upon the
fulfillment of prescribed conditions.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION 1.

Section 2081.9 is added to the Fish and Game Code, to read:

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  213

Appendix H  Assembly Bill 1973

2081.9.

(a) Notwithstanding Section 5050, the department may authorize,

under this chapter, the incidental take of limestone salamander (Hydromantes
brunus) resulting from impacts attributable to the Department of
Transportation's implementation of the Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration
Project on State Route 140 from 8 miles east of Briceburg to 7.6 miles west
of El Portal in Mariposa County, contingent upon the fulfillment of the
following conditions:
(1) The Department of Transportation begins construction of the Ferguson
Slide Permanent Restoration Project on or before January 1, 2016.
(2) The department has determined that the Department of Transportation
will adopt appropriate avoidance and mitigation measures to protect the
limestone salamander through enforceable commitments that, at a minimum,
include the following:
(A) A construction work window that prevents initial ground-disturbing
construction activities from occurring on the southern slope during the
salamander's active season of December to March, inclusive.
(B) Environmentally sensitive area fencing in the form of five-foot
orange plastic mesh, as well as salamander protection exclusionary fencing
in the form of 24-inch sheet metal, will be erected if construction-related
activities will occur adjacent to limestone salamander habitat during their
active season.
(C) A biological monitor will be onsite during active building to inspect
the worksite and all exclusionary fencing.
(D) All ground-disturbing activities within 100 feet will cease if a
limestone salamander is detected in an active construction site until the
animal can be safely removed from the area according to an agreed-upon
salvage plan.
(3) The requirements of subdivisions (b) and (c) of Section 2081 are
satisfied for the take of the limestone salamander.
(4) The department ensures that all further measures necessary to satisfy
the conservation standard of subdivision (d) of Section 2805 are
incorporated into the project.
(5) The take authorization provides for the development and
implementation, in cooperation with the department, of an adaptive
management process for monitoring the effectiveness of, and adjusting as
necessary, the measures to minimize and fully mitigate the impacts of the
authorized take. The adjusted measures are subject to Section 2052.1.
(6) The failure to appropriate funds does not relieve the applicant of
the obligations of paragraphs (1) and (2).
(7) Any observations of the species in the worksite and any accidental
injury or mortality from vehicle strikes or other means will be reported to

Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration  214

Appendix H  Assembly Bill 1973

the department immediately and the onsite biological monitor will notify the
resident engineer who will halt the work immediately.
(b) This section shall not be construed to exempt the Ferguson Slide
Permanent Restoration Project on State Route 140 from 8 miles east of
Briceburg to 7.6 miles west of El Portal in Mariposa County from any other
law.
SEC. 2.

5050.

Section 5050 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to read:

(a) (1) Except as provided in Section 2081.7, 2081.9, or 2835,

fully protected reptiles and amphibians or parts thereof may not be taken or
possessed at any time. No provision of this code or any other law shall be
construed to authorize the issuance of permits or licenses to take any fully
protected reptile or amphibian, and no permits or licenses heretofore issued
shall have any force or effect for that purpose. However, the department may
authorize the taking of those species for necessary scientific research,
including efforts to recover fully protected, threatened, or endangered
species. Prior to authorizing the take of any of those species, the
department shall make an effort to notify all affected and interested
parties to solicit information and comments on the proposed authorization.
The notification shall be published in the California Regulatory Notice
Register and be made available to each person who has notified the
department, in writing, of his or her interest in fully protected species
and who has provided an email address, if available, or postal address to
the department. Affected and interested parties shall have 30 days after
notification is published in the California Regulatory Notice Register to
provide any relevant information and comments on the proposed authorization.
(2) As used in this subdivision, "scientific research" does not include
any actions taken as part of specified mitigation for a project, as defined
in Section 21065 of the Public Resources Code.
(3) Legally imported fully protected reptiles or amphibians or parts
thereof may be possessed under a permit issued by the department.
(b) The following are fully protected reptiles and amphibians:
(1) Blunt-nosed leopard lizard (Crotaphytus wislizenii silus).
(2) San Francisco garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis tetrataenia).
(3) Santa Cruz long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum croceum).
(4) Limestone salamander (Hydromantes brunus).
(5) Black toad (Bufo boreas exsul).
