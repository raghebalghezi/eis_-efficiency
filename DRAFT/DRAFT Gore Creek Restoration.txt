Three alternatives are being considered. Under the No Action alternative, current conditions would continue, no restoration projects would be done to improve resource concerns. Roads and dispersed campsites would continue to negatively affect watershed condition. Under the Proposed Action, restoration activities would occur to improve resource concerns associated with temporary roads, landings, burn piles, skid trails and areas that were harvested on steep slopes. Approximately 7 miles of road would be decommissioned, which would remove a culvert from one perennial water crossing, and two dispersed campsites would be rehabilitated. Both the No Action and Proposed Action alternatives would allow approximately 240 acres of timber harvest in previously analyzed sales using the existing road infrastructure. Alternative 3 is the same as the Proposed Action except that it allows for up to 5 miles of temporary road, of which 0.5 miles could be designed temporary road or specified road, to be built to access timber sales that were previously analyzed, increasing timber harvest to approximately 600 acres, in order to facilitate timber production and improve forest revegetation. Reviewers should provide the Forest Service with their comments during the comment period of the draft environmental impact statement. This will enable the Forest Service to analyze and respond to the comments at one time and to use information acquired in the preparation of the final environmental impact statement, thus avoiding undue delay in the decision-making process. Reviewers have an obligation to structure their participation in the National Environmental Policy Act process so that it is meaningful and alerts the agency to the reviewers’ position and contentions [Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978)]. Environmental objections that could have been raised at the draft stage may be waived if not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement [City of Angoon v. Hodel (9th Circuit, l986) and Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980)]. Comments on the draft environmental impact statement should be specific and should address the adequacy of the statement and the merits of the alternatives discussed (40 CFR 1503.3). SUMMARY The Mountain Pine Beetle began killing a large number of lodgepole pine trees in the early 2000’s which led to multiple vegetation management assessments, including the Rock Creek Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), Red Dirt Environmental Assessment (EA) and Roadside Hazard Tree Removal EA being completed in the Gore and Red Dirt Geographic Areas. During implementation of the commercial timber sales, areas outside the analysis area under the Rock Creek EIS, hereinafter referred to as ‘areas outside NEPA boundaries’ were harvested. Upon discovery, timber sale activity was suspended until all timber sale unit boundaries could be brought into compliance with the Rock Creek EIS, however approximately 550 acres of harvest had been completed outside of the areas analyzed in previous NEPA decisions. Due to resource concerns identified by an interdisciplinary team in areas harvested outside the NEPA boundaries it was determined that restoration was needed on landings, slash piles, temporary roads, skid trails, and steep slopes throughout the analysis area. During implementation of the Rock Creek timber sales, the miles of temporary road built within the analysis area exceeded the amount that was analyzed in the NEPA document. Despite this overage, additional temporary roads are necessary to complete the sales analyzed in the 2006 Rock Creek EIS (USDA 2006). It has been determined that approximately 5 miles of temporary road would be necessary to complete salvage harvest in Forest Products Management Areas (5.13) throughout the Rock Creek analysis area. The timber harvest prescriptions analyzed in this document for other management areas are not applicable now that the Mountain Pine Beetle epidemic has killed the majority of the lodgepole pine throughout this region. Watershed impacts were noted in previous NEPA documents, which stated that road closure, decommissioning, relocation, reconstruction, and/or repair could be done to improve the watershed condition. More specific road decommissioning and reconstruction projects have been identified under this proposal on National Forest System Roads (NFSR) 185, 241, 242, and 246. In addition to the road projects, two dispersed campsites that are directly depositing sediment into Gore Creek have been identified for decommissioning. This would also improve watershed health. Three courses of action are under consideration. 1. Under the No Action alternative, current management plans would continue to guide management of the project area. There would be no restoration done and any resource damage that occurred outside of previously analyzed NEPA boundaries would be left in its current state. Timber sales analyzed under the Rock Creek EIS, that have not already been harvested, would be sold in small sales using the current road system allowing for the harvest of approximately 240 acres of timber, and no temporary road building would occur. NFSRs 185, 241, 242, and 246 would not be decommissioned, and the two dispersed campsites would remain in their current condition and would continue to affect watershed health. Road maintenance issues would continue to be addressed on the existing road system as funding allows. 2. The Proposed Action would improve resource concerns through obliterating temporary roads, rehabilitating landings, burning and rehabilitating piles, rehabilitating skid trails, and providing erosion control in areas that were harvested on steep slopes. The type of rehabilitation done would be dependent on many different factors, such as topography, soils, impacts to groundwater and surface water, and archeological impacts. These treatments would include full re-contouring of temporary roads, ripping, seeding, mulching, slash, and other erosion control as needed. Watershed improvement projects would be completed on approximately 8 miles of road. This would also include the removal of culverts and stream restoration at perennial stream crossings, and rehabilitation of two dispersed campsites that are depositing sediment directly into Gore Creek. Timber sales analyzed under the Rock Creek EIS, approximately 240 acres, that have not already been harvested, would be sold in small sales using the current road system as described above, and no temporary road building would occur. 3. Under Alternative 3, watershed improvement projects and rehabilitation treatments on areas that have resource concerns would move forward as described in the Proposed Action alternative. Timber sales analyzed under the Rock Creek EIS, that have not already been harvested, would be sold and up to 5 miles of new temporary road construction could occur. Of this, 0.5 miles could be built as specified or designed temporary road. Approximately 3.5 miles of temporary road have been preliminarily located to access an additional 360 acres above that in the No Action and Proposed Action alternatives (240 acres), for a total harvest of approximately 600 acres. The additional 1.5 miles of temporary road would be used to access the stands identified, if necessary. The area affected by the proposal includes predominately mature lodgepole pine stands, areas that have been harvested where resource concerns have been found, and the current road system. The purpose of the Proposed Action is to minimize the environmental impacts which occurred outside of previously analyzed project boundaries created during implementation of previous NEPA decisions, reduce current impacts associated with roads in the analysis area, and to complete salvage operations in some of the stands analyzed under the Rock Creek EIS. There is a need to: . Address temporary roads and skid trails that were created outside of NEPA boundaries, concerns on steep slopes created during timber sale activities, and all landings and burn piles within the analysis area. . Analyze effects of additional temporary roads needed to complete a portion of the Rock Creek sales in order to remove dead lodgepole pine and expedite the regeneration process. . Improve watershed health through relocation or decommissioning of roads and dispersed campsites that are causing adverse impacts to stream networks. After the analysis process is completed, a decision will be made that includes the following: . The selected alternative. Based upon the effects of the alternatives, the responsible official will decide whether or not to implement in full or in part any alternative or if the No Action alternative should be taken. . Rationale for the decision; and . Design Criteria, mitigation and monitoring requirements necessary for project implementation. The Notice of Intent was posted in the Federal Register on April 11, 2012 asking the public for input on the proposal within 30 days. Two major issues were raised. First, people are concerned with building more temporary road in an area that has already had a large amount of timber harvest, which built more temporary road than was previously analyzed. The second issue is that the decommissioning of roads will decrease access to the area for the public, specifically aging hunters. Conclusions by resource specialists through their analysis include but are not limited to: Design Criteria developed by resource specialists have been incorporated into the action alternatives to reduce detrimental effects to resources while still maintaining the effectiveness of the actions. By including the Design Criteria, the Proposed Action can be implemented with no potential adverse effects to resources. Region 2 sensitive plant species and species of local concern would not be directly affected under the No Action alternative; however, noxious weed species may increase posing an indirect threat to these species. Under the Proposed Action colonization by native species is expected to increase, having a beneficial effect on these species. Alternative 3 increases the probability of impacting individual plants but would not result in a loss of viability. More destructive, less manageable wildfires are more likely under the No Action and Proposed Action alternatives than under Alternative 3. Fish and amphibian habitat and populations would remain stable under all alternatives; however, the action alternatives would improve stream habitat in the long-term, although there may be short-term impacts during implementation. Archeological resources would be affected to some extent by all of the alternatives. The No Action alternative would result in deterioration of at least one significant archeological site due to increased erosion. Under both action alternatives ground scarification and pile burning may affect cultural sites, while revegetation would improve in these areas resulting in an overall benefit to these sites. There has been a determination of “no adverse effect” if eligible sites and sites that are unevaluated are avoided. Water quality, infiltration, hillslope hydrology, soil health, and overall stream health would improve under the Proposed Action. Under the No Action alternative the implementation of the proposed restoration actions including road treatments would not occur and the potential for detrimental watershed effects would remain high. The combination of high ECA (Equivalent Clearcut Acres) values and road densities in four subwatersheds suggest that significant watershed effects are likely in these areas, and would continue under the No Action alternative. The effects of Alternative 3 are greater than the Proposed Action alternative, but less than the No Action alternative and are dependent upon where the temporary roads are built. This could result in an improvement in condition of 11 watersheds or a decline in watershed health in up to six watersheds. The Circle Park, Farnham and Gore Creek bike loops (approximately 5 miles) would be removed from the current Gore Pass mountain bike trail system, since they are located on current Forest Service roads that are proposed for decommissioning, resulting in the current loop systems to be out and back routes in both action alternatives. Terrestrial wildlife assessments determined that both the No Action alternative and Alternative 3 “May adversely impact individuals, but not likely to result in a loss of viability on the planning area, nor cause a trend toward federal listing” for the American marten, pygmy shrew and Northern goshawk. The Proposed Action was determined to have a “beneficial impact” on these three species. In addition, for the Canada lynx a “no effect” determination was made for both the No Action and Proposed Action alternatives, while Alternative 3 had a “may affect, but not likely to adversely affect” determination. The management indicator species (Northern goshawk and golden-crowned kinglet) populations would remain stable in all alternatives. Overall, restoration projects associated with the Proposed Action would be beneficial to wildlife, but the impacts from more temporary roads and associated timber harvest would result in greater habitat loss in Alternative 3. The predicted effects of the Proposed Action by specialists on the interdisciplinary team support the premise that this action is needed to improve resource concerns in areas harvested outside previously analyzed NEPA boundaries. Leaving these areas in their current condition would not meet water and soils Forest Plan Standards and Guidelines, specifically water and aquatic Standards 2 and 3, and soils Standard 4.  Table of Contents Summary ........................................................................................................................ iv Chapter 1.

PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION Document Structure ______________________________ The Forest Service has prepared this environmental impact statement (EIS) in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other relevant Federal and State laws and regulations. This EIS discloses the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts that would result from the Proposed Action and other alternatives. The document is organized into four chapters: Chapter 1. Purpose of and Need for Action: The chapter includes information on the history of the project proposal, the purpose of and need for the project, and the agency’s proposal for achieving that purpose and need. This section also details how the Forest Service informed the public of the proposal and how the public responded. Chapter 2. Alternatives, including the Proposed Action: This chapter provides a more detailed description of the agency’s Proposed Action as well as alternative methods for achieving the stated purpose. These alternatives were developed based on significant issues raised by the public and other agencies. This discussion also includes design criteria and mitigation measures. Finally, this section provides a summary table of the environmental consequences associated with each alternative. Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences: This chapter describes the environmental effects of implementing the Proposed Action and other alternatives. This analysis is organized by resource area. Chapter 4. Consultation and Coordination: This chapter provides a list of preparers and agencies consulted during the development of the environmental impact statement. Additional documentation, including more detailed analyses of project-area resources, may be found in the project planning record located at Yampa Ranger District, 300 Roselawn, Yampa, CO 80483.  Background _____________________________________ The Mountain Pine Beetle began killing a large number of lodgepole pine in the early 2000s. As the Mountain Pine Beetle began to move through the Gore and Red Dirt Geographic Areas, a number of management actions took place. The Forest Roadside Hazard Tree Removal EA was completed to assist with removal of hazardous trees along the road system, and the Rock Creek Integrated Management Project EIS (Rock Creek) was completed for large scale preventative harvesting and salvage efforts. This was followed by the Red Dirt Integrated Management Project EA (Red Dirt), which covered a small section of the eastern portion of the project area. Approximately 129 acres of timber harvest analyzed in Red Dirt are within the Gore Creek Restoration Analysis Area. From 2005 through today, roads have been cleared of hazard trees, trees under and adjacent to the powerlines have been cut by Western Power Authority, and a large amount of timber has been removed through commercial timber sales. The Rock Creek Record of Decision was signed in April 2006. This decision authorized silvicultural actions, primarily commercial timber harvest, and associated road construction on approximately 13,500 acres of NFS lands. Silvicultural actions were to occur within . mile of existing roads and would not occur on slopes greater than 40 percent or within inventoried roadless areas. In order to complete these sales it was estimated that 25 miles of road would need to be constructed, which included 15 miles of specified road and 10 miles of temporary road. As of March 2013 six timber sales, amounting to approximately 4,175 acres, have been cut under the Rock Creek decision. During implementation of these sales approximately 25 miles of temporary road and 7 miles of specified road were built. Up to 5 miles of additional temporary road may be built to facilitate timber production and improve forest revegetation, especially in Management Area 5.13 (Forest Products). If a specified road is needed up to 0.5 miles of the 5 miles of temporary road analyzed could be used for specified or designed temporary road. The effects of adding these temporary roads will be analyzed in Alternative 3. Effects associated with the timber harvest have already been analyzed in the Rock Creek EIS (USDA 2006a). During implementation of the commercial timber sales areas outside of NEPA boundaries were harvested. Upon discovery, implementation of timber sales was suspended and timber sale unit boundaries were brought into compliance with the NEPA decision, however approximately 550 acres of harvest had been completed outside of the areas analyzed in previous NEPA decisions. Further analysis is needed to rehabilitate temporary roads, and skid trails that were placed outside of NEPA boundaries and all landings and burn piles. There are over 350 landings associated with these sales, with one to two slash piles at each of the landings, as well as within timber units. Road closure, decommissioning, relocation, reconstruction, and repair were identified as general projects under the 2006 Rock Creek EIS decision. More specific projects have been identified under this proposal on National Forest System Roads (NFSR) 185, 241, 242, and 246.   Figure 1.

Address temporary roads and skid trails that were created outside of NEPA boundaries, concerns on steep slopes created during timber sale activities, and all landings and burn piles within the analysis area. . Analyze effects of additional temporary and specified roads needed to complete a portion of the Rock Creek sales in order to remove dead lodgepole pine and expedite the regeneration process. . Improve watershed health through relocation and decommissioning of roads and dispersed campsites that are causing adverse impacts to stream networks. Forest Plan Direction _____________________________ This action responds to the goals and objectives outlined in the Routt National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, 1997 Revision (Routt Forest Plan), and helps move the project area towards the desired conditions described in the plan (USDA 1997). Examples of Standard and Guidelines that apply to the Proposed Action include but are not limited to: Forest-wide Standards and Guidelines Soils Standards 4. Reclaim roads and other disturbed sites when use ends, as needed, to prevent resource damage (Routt Forest Plan page 1-6). 5. Manage land treatments to limit the sum of severely burned or detrimentally compacted, eroded, and displaced land to no more than 15 percent of any land unit (Routt Forest Plan page 1-6). Water and Aquatic Standards 2. Manage land treatments to conserve site moisture and to protect long-term stream health from damage by increased runoff (Routt Forest Plan page 1-6) 3. Manage land treatments to maintain enough organic ground cover in each land unit to prevent harmful increased runoff (Routt Forest Plan page 1-6). 4. In the water influence zone next to perennial and intermittent streams, lakes, and wetlands, allow only those land treatments that maintain or improve long-term stream health and riparian ecosystem condition (Routt Forest Plan page 1-6) Recreation-Dispersed Recreation Standards 3. Only allow camping outside a 100-foot zone surrounding lakes and streams, unless otherwise designated (Routt Forest Plan page 1-18). Infrastructure-Travelways Guidelines 2. Obliterate, revegetate and slope to drain those system travelways which are no longer needed to achieve management objectives or where resource damage cannot be mitigated (Routt Forest Plan page 1-23). Biological Diversity Standards 3. Use genetically local (at the sub-section level), native plant species for revegetation efforts where technically and economically feasible. Use weed-free seed mixtures. While native perennials are becoming established, non-native annuals or sterile perennial species may be used to prevent soil erosion. (Routt Forest Plan page 1-8). Threatened, Endangered, Sensitive Species, and Wildlife Standards 7. Where newly discovered threatened, endangered, proposed, or sensitive species habitat is identified, conduct an analysis to determine if any adjustments in the Forest Plan are needed. (Routt Forest Plan page 1-14). 8. Manage activities to avoid disturbance to sensitive species which would result in a trend toward Federal listing or a loss of population viability. The protection will vary depending on the species, potential for disturbance, topography, location of important habitat components, and other pertinent factors. Give special attention during breeding, young rearing, and other times which are critical to survival of both flora and fauna (Routt Forest Plan page 1-14). 9. Avoid disturbing threatened, endangered, and proposed species (both flora and fauna) during breeding, young rearing, or at other times critical to survival by closing areas to activities. Exceptions may occur when individuals are adapted to human activity, or the activities are not considered a threat (Routt Forest Plan page 1-14). Undesirable Species Standards 2. Use only certified noxious weed free hay, seed, straw or other materials for feed or revegetation projects on the Forest (Routt Forest Plan page 1-16). Geographic Area Desired Condition Gore Geographic Area Desired Condition . Lodgepole pine will continue to be the dominant cover type. In areas allocated to management area prescriptions 5.11, 5.12, or 5.13, a variety of tree sizes and seral stages will be present. High-quality developed and dispersed motorized recreation opportunities will be emphasized. A low motorized travelway density will provide access for timber management, grazing, and developed and dispersed recreation (Routt Forest Plan page 3-75 and 3-76). Red Dirt Geographic Area Desired Condition . Lodgepole pine and spruce/fir will continue to be the dominant cover types. In areas allocated to management area prescriptions 5.11, 5.12, or 5.13, a variety of tree sizes and seral stages will be present. Dispersed motorized and non-motorized recreation opportunities will be available. A low to medium motorized travelway density will provide access primarily for all-season dispersed recreation and for timber and grazing uses (Routt Forest Plan page 3-89 and 3-90). Management Area Direction Management Area 5.11= General Forest and Rangelands - Forest Vegetation Emphasis Desired Condition . Vegetation composition and structure will exist in a range of successional stages to meet wildlife, range, and timber objectives. Forest insects and disease will be present but locally restricted (Routt Forest Plan pages 2-39 and 2-40). Management Area 5.13= Forest Products Desired Condition . Vegetation composition and structure will be managed for a mosaic of tree groups with different ages and heights while providing for a sustained yield of forest products. Forest insects and disease will be present but locally restricted (Routt Forest Plan page 2-44). Vegetation Standards 1. Use a full range of biologically appropriate silvicultural practices to emphasize the production of sawtimber (Routt Forest Plan page 2-45). Proposed Action _________________________________ The Forest Service’s Proposed Action includes: rehabilitating areas with resource concerns, watershed improvement projects, and harvesting a portion of the timber analyzed under the Rock Creek EIS. Rehabilitation could include obliterating temporary roads, rehabilitating landings, burning or removing and rehabilitating slash piles, rehabilitating skid trails, and providing erosion control in areas that were harvested on steep slopes. The type of rehabilitation will be dependent on many different factors, such as topography, soils, impacts to groundwater and surface water, and archeological impacts. These treatments may include full re-contouring of temporary roads, ripping, seeding, mulching, scattering slash, and other erosion control as needed. Watershed improvement projects would occur on approximately 8 miles of road and two dispersed campsites. This would include approximately 7 miles of road decommissioning, removal of culverts and channel restoration on perennial stream crossings, and closure and rehabilitation of two dispersed campsites that are currently affecting watershed health. Timber sales that were analyzed under the Rock Creek EIS for salvage treatment could move forward with approximately 240 acres of harvest projected to occur using the existing road network. Decision Framework ______________________________ Given the purpose and need, the deciding official reviews the Proposed Action, the other alternatives, and the environmental consequences in order to make the following decisions: . Based upon the effects of the alternatives, the responsible official will decide whether or not to implement in full or in part any alternative or if the no action alternative should be taken. . Rationale for the decision; and . Design Criteria, mitigation and monitoring requirements necessary for project implementation. Public Involvement _______________________________ The Notice of Intent (NOI) was published in the Federal Register on April 11, 2012. A scoping period was provided for 30 days. In addition, as part of the public involvement process, the agency will provide an opportunity to comment on the draft environmental impact statement. Using comments from the public, other agencies, and Forest Service specialists (see Issues section), the interdisciplinary team developed a list of issues to address. Issues __________________________________________ The Forest Service generally separates environmental issues into two groups: Key issues are defined as those directly or indirectly caused by implementing the Proposed Action. Non-key issues are identified using the following criteria: . Outside the scope of the Proposed Action. . Already decided by law, regulation, Forest Plan, or other higher level decision. . Irrelevant to the decision to be made. . Conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence. The Council on Environmental Quality NEPA regulations explain this delineation in Sec. 1501.7, “…identify and eliminate from detailed study the issues which are not significant or which have been covered by prior environmental review (Sec. 1506.3)… .” A list of non-key issues and reasons regarding their categorization as non-key may be found at Yampa Ranger District, 300 Roselawn, Yampa, Colorado in the project record. The Forest Service received eight letters responding to the informal scoping mailed to government agencies, tribes, and other interested parties. From these comments and internal discussion 18 issues/concerns were documented of which two were categorized as key issues, and used to formulate the alternatives. Indicators were developed for each issue category. Indicators are measurable ways of displaying how the issues could be affected by project implementation. Issue 1: Temporary Road There is a concern over the amount of temporary road already built and the cumulative effects of past and present harvesting and ground disturbance on other resources, including soils and watershed health. There is also a concern that building more temporary road will increase these impacts. Indicators: . Miles of temporary road proposed . Miles of temporary road that will be reclaimed. Issue 2: Motorized Access There is a concern that the road density in the area is larger than necessary, and that many roads provide access to the same general areas. There is also a concern that many of the roads are in poor condition, due to lack of maintenance, increasing sedimentation to the stream network and impacting watershed health. However, there is also a desire by the public for motorized access into the area. Indicators: . Miles of road being decommissioned . Road density . Cost of road maintenance Opportunities ____________________________________ As part of the internal and public scoping process another watershed restoration project within the Analysis Area was identified. This project involves road relocation of approximately 0.5 miles of NFSR 225.1, which was previously analyzed in the Travel Management in the NFSR 225 Analysis Area EA to improve watershed health. This relocation could occur under any of the alternatives, but would be facilitated under Alternative 3, due to the proposed temporary road building. Under Alternative 3, entrance into the timber unit would utilize the location previously analyzed. The new construction would be kept open which would allow for decommissioning of the existing segment of concern on NFSR 225.1. The decommissioned segment would be rehabilitated to reduce the connected disturbed area, and to restore riparian areas, soil productivity, and hillslope hydrology. CHAPTER 2. ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING THE PROPOSED ACTION Introduction _____________________________________ This chapter describes and compares the alternatives considered for the Gore Creek Restoration Project. It includes a description of each alternative considered. This section also presents the alternatives in comparative form, defining the differences between each alternative and providing a clear basis for choice among options by the decision maker and the public. Some of the information used to compare the alternatives is based upon the design of the alternative (i.e., building of new temporary roads) and some of the information is based upon the environmental, social and economic effects of implementing each alternative (i.e., the amount of timber that could be harvested). Alternatives Considered in Detail ___________________ The Forest Service developed three alternatives; Alternative 1 - No Action, Alternative 2 - Proposed Action, and Alternative 3 in response to issues raised by the public and through internal discussion. Alternative 1 No Action Under the No Action alternative, current management plans would continue to guide management of the project area. No restoration would occur and any resource damage that occurred outside of previously analyzed NEPA boundaries would be left in its current state. Timber sales within the Rock Creek EIS, that have not already been harvested, could be sold in small sales using the current road system with approximately 240 acres of timber harvested. Prescriptions for these timber sales were determined in the Rock Creek EIS, and would most likely include salvage logging. Using only the current road system would decrease the volume of the sales, but directly address resource concerns of building more temporary road. No temporary road building within the Rock Creek analysis area would occur; therefore, relocation of a segment of NFSR 225 affecting watershed health would not be facilitated. NFSRs 185, 241, 242, and 246 would not be decommissioned; culverts on perennial stream crossings would not be removed and would continue to affect stream and wetland function; and the two dispersed campsites along Gore Creek would remain in their current condition and would continue to affect watershed health. Road maintenance issues would continue to be addressed on the existing road system as funding allows. This alternative represents the current condition and is the baseline for comparison with the other alternatives. Alternative 2 The Proposed Action Under the Proposed Action, the Yampa Ranger District of the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests would rehabilitate areas that have resource concerns in the Gore Creek analysis area. This includes obliterating temporary roads, rehabilitating landings, burning or removing and rehabilitating piles, rehabilitating skid trails, and providing erosion control in areas that were harvested on steep slopes. The type of rehabilitation done will be dependent on many different factors, such as topography, soils, impacts to groundwater and surface water, and archeological impacts. These treatments could include full re-contouring of temporary roads, ripping, seeding, mulching, slash, and other erosion control as needed. Watershed improvement projects would be completed on approximately 8 miles of road. This would include decommissioning 7 miles of system road and road restoration on 1 mile of system road. Culverts would be removed on perennial streams and two dispersed campsites that are inputting sediment directly into Gore Creek would be decommissioned. Figure 2 and Table 2 identify where these activities are proposed. Approximately 5 miles of the roads proposed for decommissioning are also a part of the Gore Pass bike trail system. This would result in these trails being closed and changed from loops to out and back trails. Timber sales would be completed as described in the No Action alternative, using the existing road system. Table 2. Description of proposed watershed improvement projects. Road Number Proposed Action Miles Reason NFSR 241.1 Decommission from intersection with NFSR 250.1 to the campsite overlooking Blacktail Creek 1.8 Road parallels Blacktail Creek and is also experiencing severe erosion in many locations adding sediment to the creek. NFSR 241.1 Improve road from campsite overlooking Blacktail Creek 1.1 Road is rutted and drainage is no longer functional. NFSR 242.1 Decommission from the intersection with NFSR 241.1 to the stream crossing in T1N, R82W, NENW sec. 5 1.0 This road runs adjacent to a perennial stream that has several wet springy areas in the middle of the road. NFSR 246.1 Decommission entire road segment 1.1 This road intersects with the portion of NFSR 241.1 proposed for decommissioning and is a dead-end road Road Number Proposed Action Miles Reason NFSR 185.1 Decommission the portion of the road that is incised, leaving dispersed campsites at both the north and south ends 2.9 This road has poor drainage and is incised delivering sediment directly into both Birch Creek and a tributary to Bobcat Creek. Non-system road off of NFSR 241.1 Effectively decommission to reduce motorized use, reduce erosion, and promote revegetation. 0.2 This is an old temporary road that was not effectively closed following use. There is extensive surface erosion due in part to ATV trespass, and in part due to lack of drainage features. General Guidelines for Rehabilitation and Decommissioning . Scarification would be done to a depth of 4 to 6 inches. The ripper teeth should be lifted every 150 feet on slopes less than 15 percent, every 100 feet on slopes 15 to 30 percent, and every 50 feet on slopes greater than 30 percent to prevent concentration of water and development of rills and gullies. . Seeding would be done using an approved seed mixture. . Water bars would be implemented using an appropriate spacing for slope and soil type. . Slash would include both fine and coarse woody debris. . Chips and mulch would not exceed more than 3 inches in depth and would not cover more than 40 percent of the treatment area. When mastication or chipping is used distribution would be a discontinuous, patch mosaic and avoid contact with residual trees. If desired coverage or depth are exceeded that site would be evaluated to determine if redistribution or disposal is required. . Ground cover would be 65 percent over the affected area. Temporary Road and Excavated Skid Trail Decommissioning Temporary roads and excavated skid trails that were built outside of previously analyzed NEPA decisions would be decommissioned using the methods described below. Roads and skid trails that were built within the Rock Creek project area will be decommissioned under that decision. Approximately 3 miles of temporary road and excavated skid trails would be decommissioned with this decision. . Road obliteration on existing and proposed temporary roads and excavated skid trails could be done by restoring and re-contouring to a hydrologically self-maintaining and natural state roads and skid trails that have a 3-foot or greater cut slope, and other areas as deemed necessary by Forest Service personnel. When re-contouring is done the equipment would be required to remain on the existing roadway or skid trail to minimize disturbance outside of this area. Scattering slash is also recommended in re-contoured areas to prevent erosion, add organic material, and improve water retention. . When re-contouring is not necessary, such as on flat areas of ground, then obliteration could be done by adding water bars, scarification, scattering of slash, and seeding where necessary. . If culverts have been installed on temporary roads they would be removed and the streambanks would be reshaped to reflect the original cross-sectional area and streambank angle of the upstream and downstream sections of the stream. Stabilization of newly constructed streambanks using slash, logs, or rocks may also be required as specified by Forest Service personnel. Skid Trail Rehabilitation Skid trails built outside of previously analyzed NEPA decisions would be rehabilitated using a variety of methods depending on site specific conditions. Skid trails that were built within previously analyzed areas would be decommissioned under those decisions. . This may include scarification, seeding, adding water bars and scattering slash to prevent erosion and reduce compaction. Scattering slash may be done in lieu of ripping and constructing water bars on spur or lightly used skid trails. However, both water bars and slash may be necessary in some locations depending on the slope and soil type. . Heavily used skid trails identified by the Forest Service would require scarification to reduce compaction. . Additions of masticated wood, fine slash, wood chips, or straw mulch may be necessary to promote vegetation establishment and prevent the disturbed soil materials from re-compacting or sealing. Chipping or mastication of slash left near the skid trail may be used for this purpose. . Scattering of organic materials, such as slash, prior to ripping would be done in some areas so that mixing of organics and soil could promote revegetation. Landing Rehabilitation Landings within the analysis area would be rehabilitated using a variety of methods depending on site specific conditions. There are over 300 landings within this analysis area. . In many instances this would include scarification, seeding, and scattering slash or burn pile debris. Water bars may also be necessary in some locations. . Recontouring of landings may be necessary in areas that have been cut to create a level surface. Disturbance would not be allowed outside of the existing disturbed area. This would be followed by seeding and scattering of slash. . Additions of masticated wood, fine slash, wood chips, straw mulch, and/or soil improvement amendments such as bio-char may be used on some landings to promote vegetation establishment and prevent the disturbed soil materials from re-compacting or sealing. Scattering of organic materials would occur prior to ripping to mix the organics and soil and help promote revegetation. Burn Pile Rehabilitation Burn piles would be rehabilitated, after burning or removal, using a variety of methods depending on site specific conditions. If methods such as chipping or hauling are used to eliminate the slash piles less intensive rehabilitation may be necessary as soil would not be affected by intense heating. There are over 1,500 burn piles within the analysis area. Some piles may be left unburned to provide for wildlife habitat or due to access or economic issues. . Burn piles that are greater than 30 feet in diameter would be rehabilitated by scarification, preferably by an excavator or track-hoe, as these types of equipment do not cause as much compaction as a dozer and also provide greater scarification than hand treatment. However, hand scarification may be necessary on some piles depending on access. These areas would then be seeded, and any unburned slash that is available would be scattered to increase ground cover to 50 to 60 percent. It is preferable to remove the piles that are larger than 60 feet in diameter. . Piles less than 30 feet in diameter may be mechanically treated or hand scarified and possibly seeded. In areas of hand scarification the scattering of slash would likely be less than on mechanically treated piles. Some slash would be thrown back on these areas when possible. Rehabilitation on Steep Slopes A variety of methods for rehabilitating steep slopes will be used depending on site specific conditions. . Areas of bare or displaced soil greater than 100 square feet shall be covered with slash. Coverage shall be 30 to 50 percent. . Other rehabilitation may include seeding, adding water bars, scattering slash, and mulching with chips or straw mulch. Work by hand in these areas would be preferable to avoid equipment operating on these steep slopes. Watershed Improvement Projects Road decommissioning would occur on NFSRs 185, 241, 242, 246, and an unauthorized road off of NFSR 241. . Road decommissioning would include re-contouring areas with cut slopes greater than 3 feet. Scattering slash could be included in re-contoured areas to prevent erosion, add organic material, and improve water retention. . When re-contouring is not necessary, such as on flat areas of ground, then road decommissioning would be done by adding water bars, scarification, scattering of slash, and seeding where necessary. Masticated wood, fine slash, wood chips, or straw mulch may also be spread on areas of high compaction to try and improve water retention and increase revegetation. All culverts would be removed. Those on perennial stream crossings would be rehabilitated to improve wetland function and stream health. . Streambanks would be reshaped to mimic the cross-sectional area and streambank angle of the upstream and downstream sections of the stream. . Stabilization of the newly constructed streambanks may be done using slash, logs, or rock, and willows may be planted to improve revegetation and stabilize streambanks. . A grade control structure may be built upstream of the culvert removal to prevent headcutting through sediment accumulated upstream of the road-stream crossing. Road improvement would occur on approximately 1 mile of NFSR 241 at the northern end of the decommissioning project toward NFSR 243 (see Figure 2). This would be done by adding drainage and reducing gullying along this section of road. Two dispersed campsites along NFSR 243 that are directly inputting sediment into Gore Creek would be permanently closed and rehabilitated. These will be closed by ripping, removing fire rings, falling trees into the site, and possibly placing boulders along the road to reduce access to these locations. If approved, the Yampa Ranger District would likely begin implementation in 2014. Alternative 3 Under Alternative 3 watershed improvement projects and rehabilitation treatments on areas that have resource concerns would move forward as described in the Proposed Action alternative. This includes obliterating temporary roads, rehabilitating landings, burning and rehabilitating slash piles, rehabilitating skid trails, and providing erosion control in areas that were harvested on steep slopes. In addition, timber sales analyzed under the Rock Creek EIS, that have not already been harvested, would be treated and up to 5 miles of new temporary road construction could occur within the Gore Creek analysis area. Up to 0.5 miles of the proposed temporary road could be designed temporary road or specified road, if necessary. The amount of temporary road construction analyzed under the Rock Creek EIS has already been exceeded with past and current timber sales. This new temporary road construction is above that which was authorized under the Rock Creek decision and would allow for greater completion of sales within timber harvest emphasis areas. Prescriptions for timber sales were determined in the Rock Creek EIS, and would include salvage logging. Allowing for 5 miles of temporary road to access timber sale units would increase the amount of dead material removed and allow for the use of silvicultural practices to emphasize the production of sawtimber, especially in Management Area 5.13 (Forest Products). Approximately 360 acres of additional harvest above that described in the No Action and Proposed Action alternatives (240 acres) have been identified using the proposed temporary road. This would allow for the harvest of approximately 600 acres under Alternative 3. A portion of the proposed temporary or specified road construction will be left open to facilitate the relocation of NFSR 225, as previously analyzed.    Figure 2. Proposed Watershed Improvement Map  Design Criteria Common to All Alternatives __________ The ID team identified Design Criteria to reduce or prevent undesirable effects resulting from management activities. Design Criteria expand upon best management practices, watershed conservation practices, Forest Plan Standards and Guidelines, and other environmental protection measures to ensure the project meets all required laws and regulations. The following site specific Design Criteria were developed for restoration activities and road building under this project and are common to all action alternatives. Actions that are yet to occur under the Rock Creek EIS, such as timber harvest, will follow the Rock Creek Design Criteria. Botany/Fisheries/Wildlife 1. If specific impacts from the alternatives to threatened, endangered, and Region 2 sensitive species (TES) or their habitats are identified, management may be adjusted as necessary to reduce those impacts through working with the biologists or botanists. Timing restrictions may also need to be applied. The TES species of interest include goshawks, raptors, pygmy shrews, amphibians, and rare plants. Botany 2. To avoid introduction of non-native species, clean all equipment, both Forest Service and private, before entering the project area. Equipment should be inspected prior to coming onto the Forest when it has been in areas of known noxious weed infestations or any unknown areas. 3. Units not previously surveyed for R2 Sensitive and SOLC plant occurrences will be surveyed prior to sale. 4. Any seed used in the project area will be tested for noxious and non-native seed according to the Guidelines for Revegetation for the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests and Thunder Basin National Grasslands. Heritage 5. Archaeological sites that were damaged during the implementation of the timber sale and pile burning will be manually rehabilitated to prevent additional resource damage and erosion under supervision of the District Archaeologist and in consultation with the Colorado State Historic Preservation Office. Hydrology 6. All USGS blue-line streams, wetlands, riparian areas, and specific crenulations identified during project layout will be designated as protected stream courses and considered streamside management zones unless determined otherwise by a hydrologist or soil scientist. Heavy equipment will not be allowed to operate in protected stream courses or streamside management zones except to do restoration work. 7. Avoid operating mechanical equipment on sustained slopes steeper than 35 percent except to do rehabilitation work. A hydrologist or designated Forest Service representative will be present when equipment is operating. 8. Avoid soil disturbing actions during periods of heavy rain or wet soils. Do not operate equipment when it results in rutting of soils. 9. Winter operations can occur with a minimum of 1 foot of packed snow or 2 inches of frozen soil. 10. Keep mechanical equipment 100 feet from developed spring sources. 11. Locate vehicle service and fuel areas, chemical storage and use areas, and waste dumps on gentle upland sites. Mix, load, and clean on gentle upland sites. Dispose of chemicals and containers in State-certified disposal areas. 12. Do not use berms/tank traps for permanent road closure adjacent to high-use arterial and collector roads. Use different sizes of rocks and boulders buried at least 1/3 in the ground for barriers instead of berms/tank traps in the immediate foreground of arterial and collector roads. Lands 13. Piles that are within the powerline right-of-way will not be burned and will be removed when feasible. 14. Designate areas listed below as protected improvements on the Analysis Area Map to prevent damage through proposed activities. Require avoidance and/or restoration to full function of these protected improvements. a. Irrigation Ditches b. Fences c. Special Use Roads d. Powerline right-of-ways and access routes e. Water improvements and all associated structures f. Snotel and Weather Station Sites 15. Allow access to permittees on roads and other access routes shown on the Analysis Area Map. Soils 16. Landings and adjoining burned pile surface soil materials will be examined (by a soil scientist or other trained forest personnel) for depth and degree of compaction and burning. Scarification should be done to the approximate depth of compaction and burning. Design Criteria for Alternative 3 ____________________ Heritage 1. All proposed temporary road corridors that have not been adequately surveyed for cultural resources will be identified during sale preparation and approximate locations will be provided to the archeologist for review, which will be completed prior to sale implementation. Hydrology 2. New temporary or specified road construction: a. Outslope roads with rolling dips and/or waterbars to maintain hillslope hydrology to the extent possible and ensure adequate road drainage for all conditions. b. Armor rolling dips as needed to prevent rutting damage. c. Space cross drains based on slope and soil type as outlined in the Watershed Conservation Practices Handbook (FSH 2509.25) or by the Forest Soil Scientist. d. Temporary road widths should not exceed 12 feet unless needed to meet curve radius or intersection needs. e. Temporary road grades should not exceed 8 percent. f. Any cut and/or fill required for temporary road construction or skid trails should not exceed two feet in height g. Temporary roads will not cross perennial or intermittent stream courses, wetlands, or riparian areas. h. Temporary roads will be located at least 200 feet from intermittent and perennial streams, riparian areas, and wetlands, unless approved by qualified Forest Service personnel. i. Recontour all temporary roads unless a Forest Service representative determines it is not necessary. j. The 1.5 miles of temporary road that has not been located will not be built within the Small C, Little Henry/Horse Creek, or Little Rock/Decker Creek subwatersheds to avoid adverse impacts to watershed health. 3. Within units, streamside management zones (SMZs) will be designated wherever wet depressional areas, springs, or other riparian and wetland habitats exist. SMZs will also be designated and marked where timber harvest units are located closer than 100 feet to streams, or within 50 feet of riparian areas. No heavy equipment will be allowed to operate within these SMZs, but timber may be removed by equipment reaching into the SMZ and cutting trees for removal. a. SMZs will be marked either with red tracer paint or “Streamside Management Zone” (orange with black lettering) flagging. GPS will be used to spatially locate all streamside management zones for inclusion on the sale area map. The appropriate specialist (hydrologist, soil scientist, botanist, etc) will work with the timber layout crew to identify streamside management zones during sale preparation. b. SMZs or Resource Protection zones may also be identified outside of, but adjacent to, designated harvest units where heavy equipment should not be operated. Example areas include wetlands, riparian areas, erodible soils etc. Wildlife 4. To minimize the reduction of lynx habitat in the analysis area, avoid building temporary roads in areas of advanced regeneration. Advanced regeneration can be defined as lateral cover greater than 35 percent and available to snowshoe hares in winter (≥5 ft. in height) as described in the Southern Rockies Lynx Amendment. Monitoring ______________________________________ Heritage 1. Monitoring of rehabilitation efforts and site stability will continue on an annual basis for three years until such time that the site is determined stable. If monitoring indicates site is not trending toward stabilization, then additional or alternative rehabilitation will be implemented under the direction of a professional archaeologist and consultation with the Colorado State Historic Preservation Officer. Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study __________________________________________ The team considered a different watershed improvement and travel management proposal. This involved converting a portion of NFSR 243 to a level 1 road, improving NFSR 185 to a level 3 road, and building a short section of road to link NFSR 185 and NFSR 243 to remove the parallel roads in this area. While this alternative would maintain access into the same areas as NFSR 243 it was not considered in detail for the following reasons. . NFSR 185 is in worse condition than NFSR 243 and causes more watershed impacts. . NFSR 243 has been completely cleared of hazard trees through removal of dead lodgepole pine along this road, and closing it after putting in this investment is not economically preferable. . NFSR 243 has more dispersed camping opportunities for hunters and other public and NFSR 185 can be left open to a few of the most popular dispersed campsites without impacting watershed health. The team also considered analyzing the treatment of all remaining Rock Creek sales and implementing harvesting in management areas 5.11, 4.2, and 4.3. It was found that the only remaining harvest method available after the insect and disease infestation is the salvage method, and these management areas did not allow salvage in their range of allowed treatments analyzed in the Rock Creek EIS. Comparison of Alternatives ________________________ This section provides a summary of the effects of implementing each alternative. Information in the table is focused on activities and effects where different levels of effects or outputs can be distinguished quantitatively or qualitatively between alternatives. Table 3.

AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES This chapter summarizes the physical, biological, social, and economic environments of the project area and the effects of implementing each alternative on that environment. It also presents the scientific and analytical basis for the comparison of alternatives presented. Additional documentation, including more detailed analyses of project area resources, may be found in the project administration record located at the Yampa District Office in Yampa, Colorado, or on-line at http://fs.usda.gov/goto/mbr/projects. Botany Affected Environment The area is predominately a lodgepole pine forest type interspersed with openings of forb meadows and aspen stands. Willow stands and grass and sedge meadows are found along stream corridors. The majority of the lodgepole pine trees that are greater than 9 inches in diameter at breast height have has been killed by the Mountain Pine Beetle epidemic that occurred in this area. Within the analysis area, there are approximately 2,270 harvest-related disturbance areas, which account for approximately 155 acres of significant resource damage. These areas include slash piles, landings, and temporary and specified roads. All vegetation at these sites has been removed and the soil has been severely compacted and may be hydrophobic as a result of pile burning. In addition, dispersed campsites immediately adjacent to streams have compacted soils, degraded riparian condition, increased sedimentation, and can affect water quality. It is estimated that more than 100 acres are infested with noxious weeds within the analysis area. There are 13 known invasive species at 56 sites within the analysis area. See the Noxious Weed section for more information. In recent years, rare plant surveys have been conducted by the Forest Service in and near proposed treatment units in accordance with the National Resource Information Systems (NRIS) plants protocol (2005c). Two federally threatened, endangered, or proposed (TEP) plant species are known in Grand County: Osterhout milkvetch (Astragalus osterhouttii) and Penland beardtongue (Penstemon penlandii). No TEP plant species are known in Routt County (US 2012). Both plants are found outside the Routt National Forest boundary, no habitat for either plant is available on the Forest, and none were observed during field reconnaissance for this project. Therefore, both Osterhout milkvetch and Penland beardtongue are excluded from this analysis. Twenty-six Region 2 sensitive plant species have potential habitat within the project area, none of which were found during field surveys. However, the presence of Botrychium lineare cannot reasonably be determined during surveys and is likely to occur within or near the analysis area, have potential habitat in or near the analysis area, or be affected (i.e., directly, indirectly, or cumulatively) by the implementation of an action alternative. Based on the pre-field review and field surveys, 72 species of local concern (SoLC) had potential habitat in the project area. Of these, only 3 species, including one proposed SoLC species, were found in the project area. These included Mill Creek agoseris (Agoseris lackshewitzii), clustered lady’s slipper (Cypripedium fasiculatum), and white-veined wintergreen (Pyrola picta). Presence of Botrychium sp. cannot reasonably be determined during surveys. Although one Botrychium plant was found during surveys, all Botrychium SoLCs will be carried forward in the analysis (R2 FSM 2672.43). All other species not found during field surveys were dropped from further analysis. Environmental Consequences ALTERNATIVE 1 - No Action: Under the No Action alternative, no creation or improvement of potential habitat would be implemented and no rehabilitation of disturbed areas would occur; therefore, non-native and invasive plant species would be the most likely to successfully colonize these areas. Once established, they are likely to spread, causing a negative impact to the sensitive species and species of local concern found in the project area. For the No Action alternative a determination of “No impact” was made for all species because under this alternative no management actions would occur and natural processes would continue. ALTERNATIVE 2 - Proposed Action: Proposed rehabilitation activities include a variety of soil disturbing actions, such as scarification and ripping, that could potentially dislodge or destroy individual plants, and mulching could bury individual plants. Rehabilitation of areas with resource concerns is expected to increase colonization by native species and reduce potential infestation by non-native invasive species. Habitat modifications may cause shifts in hydrologic, solar, and soil characteristics of rare plant habitats, and may also impact pollinators or soil mycorrhizae associated with rare plant species. Some species, such as moonworts, rely on light disturbance. Disturbance and land management activities may create and maintain suitable habitat for these species or may negatively impact existing populations depending on the disturbance timing, intensity, and frequency (Beatty et al. 2003, Williston 2001, Muller 2000, Zika et al. 1995). It is anticipated that rehabilitation of temporary roads, skid trails and landings could, over one to two decades produce potential habitat for Botrychium species. These species typically occur in previously disturbed habitat. It is not currently known which other species may benefit from long-term habitat creation. Seeding of disturbed sites poses concerns as to whether the seeding will succeed or fail and whether the restored populations will be “the same” as the original populations. Native seed could include commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) and or local genetic materials. COTS materials are typically cultivars and/or have genetic materials from other geographic areas. Use of COTS can have a substantial effect on population genetics, reducing the fitness of the existing population. Local genetic materials are typically collected from multiple parents at multiple locations within a defined seed-transfer zone. Use of local genetic material has a lower risk of inbreeding and outbreeding depression (Johnson et al. 2010), and is preferred if available. For the Proposed Action a determination of “Beneficial impact” was made for all species because under this alternative areas of previous disturbance would be rehabilitated and potentially create new habitat for the species. ALTERNATIVE 3: This alternative allows for the construction of up to 5 miles of temporary road, which increases the disturbed area. This increases the probability of physical damage to rare plant individuals, populations, or habitat. Although these areas would be rehabilitated, it is unlikely that these areas would be fully restored to their pre-disturbance condition within 10 to 15 years. For Alternative 3 a determination of “May adversely impact individuals, but not likely to result in a loss of viability on the planning unit, nor cause a trend to federal listing or a loss of species viability rangewide” was made for all species because individuals or populations may experience detrimental direct or indirect effects including, but not limited to, trampling, crushing, incineration, loss of habitat, loss of mycorrhizae, and displacement by invasive species. Table 6 summarizes the effects for each of the species analyzed. These determinations assume the project adheres to all Design Criteria. Cumulative Effects: Past and present grazing, fire, invasive species control, road and trail development, timber harvest, water diversions, and wildlife movement have all affected the existing condition in the project area. Future timber sales, restoration actions, wildfire, road and trail development, and grazing may also contribute to cumulative effects for botanical resources. Table 6.

Ground disturbance also creates habitat for invasive species. Invasive species presence can be additive to other disturbances and can change mycorrhizal communities (With 2002) that are essential to many native species. It is also possible that ground disturbance may create or improve habitat for some species (such as Botrychium) increasing the populations. Grazing by domestic livestock and wildlife leads to biomass removal and trampling, which causes changes in species composition, compaction of soils, changes in fuel loading and fire regime, downcutting of riparian areas and drying of adjacent meadows, and noxious weed invasion. As both wild and domestic animals graze the palatable forage unpalatable species are likely to increase. This effectively reduces diversity of desirable native plant species. Water development or diversion may affect individuals or populations of analyzed species by altering the hydrologic regime of occupied or potential habitat. Loss of individuals or populations could occur through site inundation or desiccation that results from water diversions and developments, whether at the watershed scale, or at the scale of a culvert placement. The effects of fire may benefit Botrychium habitat by reducing litter accumulation and competition from other plants. However, high-severity fires that create high ground temperatures could sterilize the soil and eliminate mycorrhizal fungal species that are necessary for Botrychium survival. Conversely, restoration actions such as road decommissioning, road relocation, road improvements, burn pile rehabilitation, closure of dispersed recreation sites, and spraying of noxious weeds can help to improve conditions and be beneficial to native species. The actions and effects described above can be both additive and interactive to each other and to the direct and indirect effects described above. The cumulative effects are not expected to contribute to an increase in any current or predicted downward trend in population numbers or density or to current or predicted downward trends in habitat capability that would reduce the existing distribution of the analyzed species. Fire/Fuels Affected Environment The affected environment has mid-elevation lodgepole pine stands, with areas of Englemann spruce and sub-alpine fir primarily in drainages and hillslopes with a more northerly aspect. The Mountain Pine Beetle epidemic has caused a landscape scale disturbance, which has led to the death or decay of the majority of the lodgepole pine stands. As the dead stands decay and fall, fuel loading will continue to increase and may create an environment that is more susceptible to high intensity fires with longer duration events on a landscape scale. Areas that have been harvested throughout the analysis area exhibit fuels conditions that are conducive to safe and effective fire management in the event of a wildfire. Fire behavior within the treated areas will generally be low intensity and of short duration over the next decade. This will generally prevent fires that ignite within the treated areas from spreading in size and duration. Treatment will also provide a fuel continuity break when wildfires enter treated areas, causing a decrease in fire behavior, and allowing for safer and more effective management of an incident. Regeneration of the harvested sites, once dominated by primarily dead material provides natural fuel breaks through ground shading from new canopy cover and increased relative humidity that will dampen fire behavior. Species composition may also be altered post-treatment from a more fire receptive species, such as spruce and fir, to a fire resistant species, such as aspen. The combination of these effects will aid future fire management efforts within the treated areas. Fire managers will have more flexibility in tactics when a fire occurs and will provide a safer environment for first responders as well as the public. The condition of the affected area can be evaluated using a recognized fire regime and its current condition found in the Interagency Fire Regime Condition Class Guidebook (Barrett et al. 2010). A fire regime is a general classification of the role fire would play across a landscape. Fire Regime Condition Class is a rating of the fire regime based on a relative measure describing the degree of departure from natural or historic conditions. This departure results in changes to one or more of the following components: vegetation characteristics; fuel composition; fire frequency, severity and pattern; and other associated disturbances, such as insect and disease mortality, drought, and grazing. There are three levels of Fire Regime Condition Class with 1 being within the natural range of variability and 3 being the highest departure from the natural regime. The analysis area is in fire regime IV which has a 35 to 200 year frequency and generally mixed severity fires. Fire regime IV also includes low severity fires, which would include lodgepole pine stands with a mixed spruce and fir component. The Fire Regime Condition Class for the analysis area is 1, within the natural range of variability (Barrett et al. 2010). Environmental Consequences ALTERNATIVE 1 - No Action: Under the No Action alternative, there would be no direct effects to the fuels conditions within the project area. Harvest that has already occurred has provided a positive effect to the fuels profile by removing large material and piling residual debris. Piles located within the Rock Creek treatment units will be burned or possibly removed for biomass utilization. Piles outside of the Rock Creek units would be left unburned, however the number of piles in these areas is limited and does not contribute to any negative impact to the fuels profiles and will not increase the hazard if left unburned. If remaining harvest areas from the Rock Creek EIS are sold in smaller sales using only existing infrastructure, there may be a longer period before all identified areas are harvested, and some areas may not be harvested at all. This will mean that some areas will retain or increase their current fuel loading, which may increase the potential for more destructive and less manageable fires until harvest in these areas occurs. It is not fully known to what extent the beetle epidemic will affect the probability of intense fire events. “The probabilities of such fires are uncertain, and more research is needed to learn in what ways and how long the fuels and fire environment are altered by the beetles. Nevertheless, protection of communities and other values at risk continues to be imperative” (Kaufmann, 2008). ALTERNATIVE 2 - Proposed Action: The piles that are located outside the original Rock Creek sales would be burned and proposed timber sales within the Rock Creek analysis area would be harvested using existing infrastructure. Sales will be sold in smaller sales similar to the No Action alternative; therefore the associated effects to increased fuel loading would be the same as described in the No Action Alternative. ALTERNATIVE 3: Under this alternative, allowing for 5 miles of temporary road would increase the amount of harvest that could be done from approximately 240 acres to approximately 600 acres. This would have a positive effect on fire severity and behavior by providing larger treated areas, leading to low intensity and short duration fires as well as providing for fuel breaks. Regeneration in larger areas would also aid future fire management efforts by creating more diversity in species and fuel composition within the treated areas. Cumulative Effects: There have been no large wildfires or prescribed fires within the analysis area over the last 50 years. The greatest impact to the fire regime has been through the Mountain Pine Beetle epidemic and large scale timber harvests. The Mountain Pine Beetle epidemic left the majority of the lodgepole pine stands dead and in varying degrees of decay, increasing available fuel, which could lead to higher intensity fires of a longer duration. Past timber harvest has also affected fire behavior. The resulting effect of these large timber harvests over the long-term is two parts. First, the immediate removal of existing fuel accumulations decreases the potential for large scale fires over the next decade. Then after ten years, the emerging stands of healthy young trees with some areas of new species composition would provide for a geographic area that has a mix of fuel composition and arrangement. Future timber harvests in the geographic area would bolster this mosaic of age class and species composition. Managing wildfire in an area of varying fuels availability is usually an easier fire to manage for agency and public needs. Fisheries Affected Environment The streams in the analysis area have the capability to provide habitat for Colorado River cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii pleuriticus (CRCT), Hirsch et al. 2006). Currently cutthroat trout only exist in Deadman Gulch within the project area. The Deadman Gulch population is consistent with the greenback lineage (Oncorhynchus clarkii stomias) which is federally threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The primary fish species within the project area are non-native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), brown trout (Salmo trutta), and long-nosed sucker (Catastomus catastomus). Brook trout occur in all streams while brown trout occupy lower and middle Rock Creek and the lower portions of its tributaries. Density estimates ranged from low to high but were within the range of what would be expected. Multiple age classes were present suggesting that there are no chronic impacts affecting recruitment. The tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) is the most common amphibian species recorded in the project area while western chorus frogs (Pseudacris triseriata) have been heard at multiple locations. Neither of the species are threatened, endangered or Region 2 sensitive species. The project area contains minimal suitable habitat for the northern leopard frog (Lithobates pipeans) although one known population exists at Bulkley Reservoir, which is approximately 2 miles from the western border of the Analysis Area. Boreal toads (Anaxyrus boreas boreas) are not known to occur within the project area. There are two breeding sites approximately two miles north of the project area suggesting that adult toads may be present. Northern leopard frog and boreal toad are Region 2 sensitive species. Management Indicator Species (MIS) The National Forest Management Act directs National Forests to identify Management Indicator Species (MIS). MIS are chosen as species representative of certain habitat conditions important to a variety of other species. MIS are generally presumed to be sensitive to habitat changes. By monitoring and assessing populations of MIS managers can determine if management actions are affecting species populations. Table 7 outlines Routt National Forest aquatic MIS, their presence in the analysis area, and anticipated effects due to implementation of an action alternative. Sensitive Species Species for Region 2 are listed on the Regional Forester’s sensitive species list and are composed of plants, birds, mammals, amphibians, fish and invertebrates (Holifield 2011). The species have been reviewed and all have been considered. Of the sensitive aquatic species, three are likely to occur within or near the analysis area, have potential habitat in or near the analysis area, or be affected by the implementation of an action alternative. The three species carried forward are Boreal toad, Northern leopard frog, and Colorado River cutthroat trout. Boreal Toad (Anaxyrus boreas boreas) and Northern Leopard Frog (Lithobates pipiens) National Wetland Inventory maps indicate that amphibian habitat within the analysis area is mostly associated with beaver ponds, streams in low gradient valleys, and two reservoirs. Surveys for boreal toads and leopard frogs have been ongoing throughout the entire project area. No boreal toads have been identified in the project area. The only occurrence of Northern leopard frogs was a 2012 sighting at Bulkley Reservoir. Boreal toads, as well as Northern leopard frogs, are cryptic species and it is recognized that a one-time survey does not necessarily mean that they are not present in the project area. While boreal toads have not been observed within the analysis area, there are two breeding sites located two miles from the analysis area boundary suggesting that toads may be present. Colorado River cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii pleuriticus) Colorado River cutthroat trout (CRCT) are thought to have historically inhabited most streams within the Gore Creek Restoration project area. No conservation populations of CRCT currently occupy streams within the analysis area. While suitable habitat exists, there are currently no plans to expand the range of Colorado River cutthroat trout into streams within the project area. Threatened and Endangered Species The bonytail chub (Gila elegans), Colorado pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus lucius), humpback chub (Gila cypha), and razorback sucker (Xyrauchen texanus) are endangered aquatic species that persist downstream in larger rivers and could potentially be affected by the Gore Creek Restoration project. The Fish and Wildlife Service believes that one of the major causes for the decline of these species is the effect of impoundments and water depletions. There are no water depletions associated with this project and the project would not have any net effect on habitats in the mainstem Yampa River. Therefore, there would be no direct, indirect, or cumulative effects associated with the Proposed Action to the endangered downstream fish populations or habitat. Environmental Consequences MIS species The Gore Creek Restoration project activities specified in the action alternatives are appropriate as a means to rehabilitate disturbed ground, improve watershed conditions, and construct temporary roads. There will be no influence on forest-wide CRCT populations as they are not present within the project area. The No Action alternative would not change the existing condition and aquatic habitats would remain stable. Implementation of the action alternatives would benefit fish habitat and brook trout and are not anticipated to affect population trends within the planning unit or Forest-wide (Table 7). Forest Plan Standards, Guidelines, Watershed Conservation Practices, and project Design Criteria have been established to reduce impacts to aquatic species. The conditions of aquatic habitat are expected to improve under the action alternatives although to a lesser extent with Alternative 3. Table 7. Summary of effects for aquatic MIS species Common Name of MIS Management Issue Species Present in Analysis Area? Habitat Present in Analysis Area? Summary of Anticipated Effects From Implementation of an ‘Action Alternative’ to MIS Colorado River cutthroat trout  Aquatic habitat fragmentation & sedimentation of riparian areas & aquatic habitats No Yes The implementation of the Proposed Action alternative is anticipated to have no impact to suitable habitat or influence forest-wide population trends. Alternative 3 may impact suitable habitat for this population but would not influence forest-wide population trends. Brook trout Aquatic habitat fragmentation & sedimentation of riparian areas & aquatic habitats Yes Yes The action alternatives have Design Criteria incorporated that are likely to eliminate any impacts to trout habitat and particularly the potential for increased sedimentation in riparian areas, aquatic habitat fragmentation, and loss of stream shading. Therefore, the implementation of an action alternative is anticipated to have no impact on suitable habitat or influence forest-wide population trends.   Sensitive Species ALTERNATIVE 1 - No Action: The natural effects from the Mountain Pine Beetle epidemic would continue, which may result in water yield increases, destabilizing some streams and affecting aquatic habitat. Existing sediment sources from past road and harvest activities would remain chronic and continue to contribute sediment to the stream system which would affect stream health. Coupled with the effects of increased water yields from the dying trees, some stream channels, and thus aquatic habitat may experience degradation. Overall, aquatic habitat conditions for fish and amphibians would remain stable or increase under this alternative. ALTERNATIVE 2 - Proposed Action: Rehabilitation treatments and watershed improvement activities would improve amphibian and fish habitat conditions affected by past harvest and road construction activities. With proper implementation of Design Criteria, aquatic organisms and their habitat may experience minor short term impacts, but in the long term would improve conditions relative to the No Action alternative. ALTERNATIVE 3: The effects and benefits of rehabilitation treatments and watershed improvements would be the same as described in the Proposed Action. The proposed temporary road construction may result in an increase in sediment reaching the stream channels, likely occurring at stream crossings. It is not expected that additional sedimentation would result in measurable, negative effects to fish or amphibian habitat. No substantial effects to aquatic resources due to road construction are expected if best management practices, Standards, Guidelines, and Design Criteria are followed. Although road construction activities are not considered a factor in the decline of amphibian species, crushing of juveniles and adults may occur. Negative impacts from the proposed activities would most likely occur in the spring when amphibians are migrating from over wintering habitat to breeding habitat and after the breeding season when they are dispersing. This period is usually from the middle of May through the first part of September. The Deadman Gulch watershed contains a population of lineage GB cutthroat trout, which is considered a federally threatened species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. New temporary road construction could occur within this watershed. Alternative 3 is more consistent with Forest Plan direction for aquatic resources than the No Action alternative but less consistent than the Proposed Action alternative. The overall result would still be improved conditions for aquatic organisms. Threatened and Endangered Species There would be no effect to the Colorado pikeminnow, bonytail chub, humpback chub or razorback sucker from the Proposed Action. The rationale for this determination is because the endangered fish or their habitat are not present on the Medicine Bow - Routt National Forests or Thunder Basin National Grassland and no water depletions are associated with this project.  Table 8.

Therefore, the No Action and Proposed Action alternatives would result in a “no effect” determination, whereas temporary road construction proposed in Alternative 3 would result in a “may affect, but not likely to adversely affect” (NLAA) determination for greenback cutthroat trout. Cumulative Effects: Past and present vegetation management, road construction, livestock grazing, and recreation have all affected the existing condition in the project area. Vegetation management and road construction activities likely increased water yields and increased sedimentation to the stream system. Livestock grazing has affected riparian health and stream stability and increased sedimentation in certain stream reaches. Dispersed campsites immediately adjacent to streams have compacted soils, degraded riparian condition, increased sedimentation and can affect water quality. Conversely, watershed restoration actions have helped to improve conditions. These have included road decommissioning, road relocation, road improvements, burn pile rehabilitation, closure of dispersed recreations sites near streams, and the replacement of undersized culverts with bottomless arch structures. Reasonably foreseeable actions or events that may affect aquatic habitat include water yield increases and increased risk of large-scale high intensity wildfire resulting from the bark beetle epidemic. Wildfires could significantly affect watershed health, function and aquatic habitat. On one hand, wildfires can cause direct mortality to aquatic organisms, loss of downed wood at micro-climate refugia, and reduced water quality through increased sediment and excess nutrient loading (Packauskas 2005). Conversely, wildfires can improve the shrub component in the understory (Loeffler 2001) and accelerate revegetation. The cumulative effects of the Proposed Action on aquatic organisms would be positive. Ground disturbance related to further vegetation management activities and road construction may have direct and indirect negative effects on individuals. Conversely, this alternative reduces the potential for a stand replacing fire. With proper implementation of Design Criteria, aquatic organisms and their habitat may experience minor short term impacts, but in the long term the Proposed Action would maintain or improve conditions relative to the No Action alternative. Heritage Affected Environment To evaluate past and potential impacts on cultural resources data was collected during the 2011 and 2012 field seasons to determine the effects of past timber harvest, the potential effects to unidentified cultural resources during proposed restoration activities, as well as where timber harvest activities occurred outside of NEPA. Of the total area that is eligible for restoration activities, 597 acres (68 percent) were examined to determine if ground visibility was adequate for surveying for cultural resources, and if cultural resources were present in those areas that allowed for surveying. Only 3 percent of the survey is considered adequate due to the lack of ground surface visibility throughout the majority of the survey area. If cultural resources were identified, then efforts were made to determine if these sites were affected by timber harvest activities. Survey was also conducted along all roads and at the dispersed campsites where decommissioning is proposed, as well as at the culvert removal. Finally, previously identified eligible sites within the project area were revisited to determine the current condition based on implemented timber activities. Data collected indicated that ground disturbance from timber sale activities has affected some cultural resources in the analysis area. Piling and burning of slash affected cultural resources through destruction of stone artifacts. Stone artifacts can be affected by fire causing breakage and other alterations (Ryan et al. 2012). The effect of heat from fire is not limited to artifacts laying on the surface; heat can affect subsurface artifacts as well. Landing locations surveyed had total disturbance with no evidence of cultural material. Any archeological site that may have been present in these locations would have been destroyed when the landings were built. Proposed restoration areas were assessed for the potential to survey for cultural resources. The ability to see the ground surface is integral to the identification of many archaeological sites, unless there are large objects resting above vegetation. In order to determine the potential effects the proposed restoration activities might have, ground surface visibility was assessed. This was found to be highly variable between and within proposed restoration areas. The cultural resource survey conducted for this project is only considered adequate for the implementation of the campground and road decommissioning, as well as proposed culvert removal. Restoration of burn piles, rehabilitation of landings and roads, and for the preponderance of harvested areas cannot be assessed for the presence of cultural resources because ground surface visibility prevents the identification of cultural resources. During the surveys 14 newly identified cultural resources were located and the boundary of one cultural resource was expanded. All cultural resources are evaluated for eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) according to the criteria described in 36 CFR 800. All significant cultural resources must: (a) Be associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our past, or (b) Be associated with the lives of persons significant in our past, or (c) Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period or method of construction, represent the work of a master, present high artistic values, represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction, or (d) Yield or be likely to yield information important in prehistory or history. For the purposes of this analysis, cultural resources are considered significant if they are determined to be eligible for the NRHP or if their eligibility has not been determined. Environmental Consequences ALTERNATIVE 1 - No Action: The No Action alternative would result in further deterioration of at least one significant archeological site due to increased erosion, which could increase the potential for collection and vandalism at the site. By not mitigating the effects of harvest activities through restoration of disturbances, the No Action alternative would be in violation of the National Historic Preservation Act, as amended. ALTERNATIVE 2 - Proposed Action: Several activities within the Proposed Action have the potential to impact cultural resources within the project area. Restoration activities have the potential to affect two sites considered eligible for inclusion into the NRHP as a contributing element to a National Historic District. Primary impacts to cultural resources from ground scarification may include the displacement, alteration and destruction of surface artifacts and cultural features, as well as disturbance to site stability. It is possible that additional, otherwise unidentified, cultural resources have the potential to be effected by proposed project implementation. Areas and activities proposed for road decommissioning, culvert removal, closing dispersed campsites, and decommissioning of skid trails and temporary roads would have no effect to archaeological sites. These areas were surveyed for cultural resources and none were identified. The reduction of roads on the Forest is beneficial to archaeological sites. Eliminating routes into the Forest that can be used for unauthorized recreation activities reduces the potential for damage or vandalism to archaeological sites. Any archeological sites that were present in landing locations have already been destroyed and rehabilitation of these sites would decrease erosion which could reduce sedimentation at other sites. It is unknown whether burn piles outside of NEPA polygons are located on archeological sites. These sites were not previously surveyed because they are outside of previously analyzed NEPA polygons and burn piles are now impacting the ability to survey the area. If burn piles are located on archeological sites then burning and scarification would have a detrimental effect. Mechanical scarification of the pile would not only damage the cultural material present in the pile, but also the site surrounding the pile. Because it is impossible to determine if cultural resources would be affected by burning piles that were placed outside of surveyed units, it is also impossible to determine if the rehabilitation of the burn piles would affect cultural resources without surveying each pile post burn and before rehabilitation. However, the seeding associated with the rehabilitation would protect sites, if present, from further erosion caused by lack of vegetation. Restoration on steep slopes should have little effect on cultural resources. Archaeological sites indicative of prehistoric or historic occupation have a low probability of being located on the types of slopes proposed for restoration. Re-vegetating areas of disturbance would have an overall beneficial effect on archeological sites. If there are unidentified sites adjacent to disturbance areas then eliminating disturbances will also reduce the secondary effects from erosion. Although proposed activities would have the potential to cause adverse effects to cultural resources, the determination for the Proposed Action is “no adverse effect” if eligible and unevaluated sites are avoided and stipulations outlined in the consultation letter and NHPA compliance report (Roth and Paschal 2012) are followed. Mitigating the effects of harvest activities through restoration of disturbances is in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act, as amended. ALTERNATIVE 3: Impacts from restoration activities would be the same as described in the Proposed Action. The addition of up to 5 miles of new temporary road could also affect cultural resources through increased ground disturbance; however, these sites would be surveyed prior to building the temporary roads, which would reduce impacts to cultural resources. Alternative 3 is in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act, as amended. Cumulative Effects: Cultural resources are non-renewable. In surveyed areas, recording and archiving basic information about each site for future reference serves to partially mitigate potential cumulative effects to cultural resources. During this project the total loss of archaeological information cannot be determined, since a majority of the area was not adequately surveyed for cultural resources. For those sites that have been identified and determined to be “not eligible” for inclusion to the NRHP, the detrimental effect of this loss is low. Although attempts were made to fully document these sites in a way that collects all information relevant to broader understanding of that site’s relationship to the cultural landscape, it is possible that the limited ground surface visibility obscured additional cultural material. Caution should be used in these areas during implementation of restoration activities for the presence of cultural material. For those sites that are determined to be “eligible” or are “unevaluated” to the NRHP, as long as they are protected from the effects of the proposed project, as determined through consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer, the overall cumulative effects to cultural resources is low. Over time, the accumulated loss of individual cultural resources has the potential to limit our ability to understand broad patterns of human history as well as local historical events. Hydrology Affected Environment The Gore Creek Restoration project is located primarily in the Toponas Creek (140100011004), Headwaters Rock Creek (140100011001), Outlet of Rock Creek (140100011006), Pass Creek (140100010707), and Blacktail Creek (140100010902) sixth level watersheds. All of these watersheds are in the upper Colorado River basin. National Hydrography Dataset seventh level watersheds and Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) numbers are used in this analysis to better identify specific areas of concern and evaluate the environmental effects. In order to better address cumulative effects, complete watersheds including areas outside of the project analysis area, but within the proclaimed Forest boundary were used. Watersheds were not analyzed beyond the Forest boundary due to a lack of data regarding past and present management actions, and watershed condition. Seventh level subwatersheds are a subset of sixth level watersheds; Table 9 shows the relationship between sixth and seventh level watersheds. Figure 3 shows the location of the seventh level subwatersheds within the Analysis Area. Table 9.

None of the streams in the analysis area are listed as impaired on the Colorado 303(d) list or Monitoring and Evaluation list (CDPHE 2012). All of the streams and watersheds in the analysis area are considered source water areas for community water supplies; see CDPHE 2008 for a description of different sourcewater areas. In a 2009 Memorandum between the Forest Service and State of Colorado (CDPHE 2009), the Forest Service agreed to recognize state designated sourcewater areas as analogous to municipal watersheds as defined in FSM 2542. This recognition directs the Forest Service to protect water quality while allowing for multiple uses. There are approximately 3,500 acres of riparian or wetland areas in the analysis area, and approximately another 100 miles of riparian communities that are too small to be mapped as riparian polygons based on the Routt National Forest riparian inventory (Routt 1993). The Headwaters Rock Creek, Outlet Rock Creek, Pass Creek, and Blacktail Creek watersheds would be considered to be in Condition Class II (FSM 2521.1) based on the 2011 National Watershed Condition Framework assessment process (Potyondy and Geier 2010). Class II watersheds exhibit moderate geomorphic, hydrologic, and biotic integrity relative to their natural potential condition. Portions of the watershed may exhibit an unstable drainage network. Physical, chemical, and biologic conditions suggest that soil, aquatic, and riparian systems are at risk in being able to support beneficial uses (FSM 2521.1). This rating is due largely to the effects of past timber harvest and associated road construction, and water developments and diversions. The Toponas Creek watershed would be considered Condition Class I. Class I watersheds exhibit high geomorphic, hydrologic, and biotic integrity relative to their natural potential condition (FSM 2521.1). Table 10 shows the stream health rating as defined in the Rock Creek EIS versus what was seen in the field in 2011. Past and present timber harvest, road construction, livestock grazing, and recreation have affected the existing condition in the analysis area. Past timber harvest and road construction has increased water yields, extended the channel network, and increased sedimentation to the stream system through connected disturbed areas. Past timber operations have also affected soil productivity including infiltration and surface erosion potential. Livestock grazing has affected riparian health and stream stability in certain stream reaches as outlined in the original Rock Creek EIS. Dispersed campsites immediately adjacent to streams have compacted soils, degraded riparian condition, increased sedimentation, and can affect water quality. Motorized recreation off designated roads has increased the connected disturbed area and increased stream sedimentation. The hydrologic regime, particularly water yield, has been affected by past and current timber harvest. Timber harvest reduces evapotranspiration and interception losses that increase water yield which can potentially affect stream health and stream stability. Multiple research studies (FST 2509.25, Troendle et al. 2001) have found that water yield increases are often not detectable until approximately 25 percent of the basal area has been removed. This suggests that water yield increases where less than 25 percent of the basal area is removed are within the range that streams naturally evolved.   Figure 3.

Recent data from the Fraser Experimental Forest suggests that beetle epidemics result in less water yield increase than timber harvest due to interception from the standing tree boles, and release of the understory which continues to use some of the available water. The concept of equivalent clearcut area (ECA) is used to represent the acres or percent of basal area reduction within a watershed. Basal area reduction includes mechanical removal through timber harvest, or mortality through natural processes such as beetle epidemics or fire. ECA represents the area of a watershed considered to be hydrologically equivalent to a clearcut with no regeneration; for example, one acre of clearcut with no regeneration equals one ECA acre. Depending on the channel type and inherent channel stability, 20 to 30 percent of the basal area of a watershed can be affected without affecting channel stability (USDA 1974). Table 11 summarizes the existing condition of each subwatershed with respect to past timber harvest, roads, and other basal area loss. It includes the existing ECA which incorporates acres harvested as part of implementation of the Rock Creek EIS as well as roadside hazard and other post-2008 vegetation management projects. None of the ECA values include water yield increases from beetle mortality since data suggests that water yield increases from beetle mortality alone tend to be less than timber harvest due to the understory still utilizing some of the available water, and interception by the standing tree boles. Values that are approaching or exceed thresholds indicating likely adverse watershed effects are highlighted. Existing road densities and indices of road impacts to the stream network are also included. Table 11.

The Teepee Creek subwatershed has an ECA value over 25 percent, while the Iron Springs/Rock Creek and Little Rock/Decker Creek subwatersheds are approaching 25 percent, and within the 20-30 percent range where channel stability may be affected (USDA 1974). Past timber harvest has resulted in the construction of roads and skid trails, which increase the connected disturbed area, decrease infiltration and increase surface erosion, and affect the hillslope hydrology and movement of water through the watershed. Roads are a source and a conduit for sediment, delivering sediment directly to the stream system through connected disturbed areas6. Roads convert subsurface flow to surface flow and reduce infiltration. This increases surface erosion and expands the channel network. 6 Connected disturbed areas are defined as “high runoff areas like roads and other disturbed sites that have a continuous surface flow path into a stream or lake…connected disturbed areas are the main source of damage in all regions” (FSH 2509.25). Road density calculations are frequently used as a method to evaluate the potential effect of the road system on watershed function and hillslope hydrology. The 2010 Forest Service Watershed Condition Classification Guide identifies a threshold of 2.4 miles/mile2 where “the density and distribution of roads and linear features in the watershed indicates that there is a higher probability that the hydrologic regime (timing, magnitude, duration, and spatial distribution of runoff flows) is substantially altered” (Potyondy and Geier 2010). In addition to road densities, proximity of roads to streams was assessed to determine the probability that the existing road system is hydrologically connected to the stream network. The 2010 Watershed Condition Framework (Potyondy and Geier 2010) indicates that watersheds with more than 25 percent of the road and trail length located within 300 feet of streams and water bodies are likely to be in Poor condition or have Impaired watershed function. Watersheds with 10 to 25 percent of the road/trail length within 300 feet of streams and waterbodies are considered to be in Fair condition or Functioning at Risk. Table 11 shows existing road densities as well as percent of roads within 300 feet of streams as an indicator of potential hydrologic connection of roads to streams. As can be seen in Table 11, six subwatersheds exceed the 2.4 mile/mile2 threshold under all alternatives. Four of these are the same subwatersheds that exceeded the 25 percent ECA threshold with implementation of the proposed future timber harvest. The combination of high ECA values and road densities in these subwatersheds suggest that cumulative watershed effects are impacting watershed function. Best Management Practices (BMPs) were described as a part of the Rock Creek EIS. It was found that during implementation of the timber sales BMPs were effective approximately 85 to 90 percent of the time. In areas where BMPs were not effective, there were visible signs of surface erosion indicating overland surface flow which also suggests a reduction in infiltration properties, impacts to riparian areas and wetlands, and increased connected disturbed areas. The greatest concern areas occur where landings, skid trails, temporary roads, and burned slash piles have not been adequately rehabilitated. Landings and burnpiles associated with past timber harvest have the potential to permanently affect watershed function through compaction and loss of infiltration on landings, and loss of soil productivity and revegetative potential on burn piles. Environmental Consequences ALTERNATIVE 1 - No Action: Under this alternative the existing condition would remain the same. Identified concern areas in need of rehabilitation would not be addressed and would continue to degrade watershed health. The existing roads would be managed in their current state, and would continue to affect the hillslope hydrology, act as connected disturbed areas, and degrade water quality. Road densities would remain the same as summarized in Table 11 and there would be no reduction in road segments adjacent to streams and water bodies. There would be no potential for additional direct effects to community water supplies from ground disturbing activities. There would be no direct or indirect effects to riparian areas, wetlands, or floodplains. Destabilization of channels due to increased water yields may have indirect effects on riparian areas. Table 12 summarizes projected ECA values by subwatershed for each alternative, including reasonably foreseeable timber harvest authorized in the original Rock Creek EIS. The projected future harvest under the Rock Creek EIS is highly dependent on new road construction (temporary or specified) which is not currently authorized (see letter to the file). As a result, projected future timber harvest is similar for the No Action and Proposed Action alternatives since no additional road construction would occur under either alternative. Projected future harvest increases in Alternative 3 as a result of additional road construction facilitating additional timber harvest. Table 127.

ECA values in the Little Henry/Horse Creek subwatershed would increase slightly, which further increases the likelihood of significant cumulative watershed effects. Without implementation of the proposed restoration actions including road treatments, the potential for these cumulative watershed effects to be significant remains very high. The Iron Springs/Rock Cr, Little Rock/Decker Cr, and Teepee Cr are all at risk of exceeding the Tolerance limit for water yield. As can be seen from Table 13, six subwatersheds exceed the road density threshold of 2.4 mile/mile2, and there would be no reduction in road density under this alternative. Four of these (Iron Spring/Rock Cr, Little Henry/Horse Cr, Little Rock/Decker Cr, and Teepee Cr) are the same subwatersheds that approach or exceed the 25 percent ECA threshold with implementation of the proposed future timber harvest. The combination of high ECA values and road densities in these subwatersheds suggest that significant cumulative watershed effects are likely, and would continue under this alternative. Table 138.

Rehabilitation measures to address skid trails, landings, burn piles, and steep slopes, as well as the watershed improvement projects would help to improve infiltation, hillslope hydrology, stream health, and water quality. Road densities would decrease in ten of the seventh level subwatersheds (Table 13) which would improve watershed function; five of these (Farnham Creek, Iron Springs/Rock Creeks, Little Henry/Horse Cr, Little Rock/Decker Cr, and Teepee Cr) are subwatersheds identified as being at increased risk of adverse impacts due to high road densities. There would be no additional road construction, so no potential for increased road densities or new roads to act as connected disturbed areas. The percent of roads within 300 feet of streams would substantially improve in two subwatersheds, moving their rating from poor/impaired to fair/functioning at risk (Table 13). Stream health and function would improve with removal of the culvert on NFSR 241 in the Iron Spring/Rock Creek watershed. The comprehensive road treatments are consistent with the desired condition of progressing toward zero connected disturbed area, and the Standard “Limit roads and other disturbed sites to the minimum feasible number, width, and total length consistent with the purpose of the specific operations, local topography, and climate.” The future road management plans would help to restore the hillslope hydrology and reduce the extended channel network which would help to maintain dispersed subsurface flows that are critical to maintaining late summer low flow conditions, and not increasing peak spring flows. This would also help to reduce the connected disturbed area and sedimentation to the stream system. From this standpoint this alternative is consistent with the Forest Plan Standard “Manage land treatments to conserve site moisture and to protect long-term stream health from damage by increased runoff.” Greater consistency with this standard would move the analysis area toward the Desired Condition, and help to improve stream health. This alternative would improve water quality through a reduction in sediment which would be a benefit to community water supplies. There would be a benefit to floodplains and the riparian and wetland resources from the road decommissioning treatments, and closure of the two dispersed campsites that are within riparian areas immediately adjacent to Gore Creek in the Farnham Creek subwatershed. This alternative would do the most to reduce the adverse watershed effects. The long-term road management plans would help to reduce the effects of past road construction and ground disturbance on watershed function. This would also reduce the effects of dispersed recreation by decommissioning some unauthorized travel routes that did not incorporate design criteria to minimize the effects to water resources and hydrologic function. Impacts from the timber harvest authorized under the Rock Creek EIS would be moderated by reduced impacts from roads; this is particularly true in the Iron Spring/Rock Cr, Little Henry/Horse Cr, Little Rock/Decker Cr, and Teepee Cr subwatersheds. This alternative would result in an improved condition in 11 subwatersheds. The two subwatersheds with a projected degraded condition are Small C and Whiskey Cr due to future timber harvest authorized under the Rock Creek EIS. Design criteria in the original Rock Creek EIS provide stream buffers and other measures to protect water quality, wetlands, riparian areas, and floodplains. Through careful unit layout, road location, and implementation of Design Criteria, these resources are not expected to be impacted by this alternative. All of the proposed actions are consistent with Forest Plan Standards, including water and aquatic Standards 2, 3, 4 and 7, and soils Standards 3 and 4 (Routt Forest Plan pages 1-6 and 1-7). With proper implementation of Design Criteria, there would be no additional irreversible or irretrievable effects ALTERNATIVE 3 - Effects under this alternative would be similar to the Proposed Action alternative with implementation of the rehabilitation measures and watershed improvement projects. However, the construction of an additional 5 miles of temporary road and associated increase in timber harvest would offset some of the benefits of the road treatments. Depending on how this alternative is implemented, it would either result in an expected improvement in watershed condition in eleven subwatersheds, with only one subwatershed being degraded, or only six subwatersheds being improved and potentially six subwatersheds degraded (Table 14). The difference depends on where the 1.5 miles of temporary road that has not been generally located are built. While it is highly unlikely that all six subwatersheds would be degraded, it is unknown at this time which subwatersheds would be affected. Rehabilitation of existing disturbed areas will help to restore soil productivity and infiltration, and reduce surface erosion, but existing disturbed areas are not expected to completely recover to pre-disturbance conditions within the next planning period, approximately 10 to 15 years. With the construction of 3.5 miles of temporary road that has been generally located, road densities would still decrease in ten subwatersheds, although not to as great a degree as the Proposed Action (Table 13). However there is potential for road density to increase in the Whiskey Cr subwatershed if the additional 1.5 miles were to be built there (Table 11). There would be a benefit to riparian areas and wetlands as some of the roads proposed for decommissioning are immediately adjacent to or within riparian areas and wetlands. There would be a substantial reduction in the percent of roads within 300 feet of streams in three subwatersheds. The timber clearing and the new temporary road construction in the Whiskey Creek subwatershed would help to facilitate relocation of NFSR 225.1 away from streams and riparian areas to decrease the connected disturbed area. There would be a slight benefit to community water supplies since road segments that are acting as connected disturbed areas would be rehabilitated to reduce sediment input which would improve water quality. Project specific design criteria ensure that new temporary roads would be located to minimize the potential for new connected disturbed areas. Depending on the sideslope and the need for roadcuts, new temporary roads would still have the potential to intercept subsurface flows and affect overall hillslope hydrology which would have a greater affect than the Proposed Action alternative. Effects of Alternative 3 would be greater than the Proposed Action, but less than the No Action alternative. The effects of road building and increased timber harvest could be reduced from the existing condition in up to eleven subwatersheds, or could increase in up to five subwatersheds, depending on how this alternative is implemented. While restoration of landings, skid trails, temporary roads and burnpiles outside of appoved NEPA polygons would improve watershed health, the net increase in total disturbance from timber harvest coupled with temporary road construction would offset this benefit from a cumulative watershed effects perspective. Design criteria have been included to prohibit building the additional 1.5 miles of temporary road within the Small C, Little Henry/Horse Creek, or Little Rock/Decker Creek subwatersheds, to decrease the potential for adverse cumulative effects This alternative is generally consistent with Routt Forest Plan Standards, including Water and Aquatic Standards 2, 3, 4, 7, although to a lesser degree than the Proposed Action. With proper implementation of project specific Design Criteria, irreversible or irretrievable effects from this additional road construction should be limited, but effects may still occur due to the overall extent of ground disturbing activities. Cumulative Effects: Hydrologically, past actions which contribute to cumulative effects include past timber harvesting and road construction. Other management activities contributing to cumulative effects include livestock grazing and recreation. Future management activities that could contribute to cumulative effects include additional road construction, timber harvest, and fuels management. With any ground disturbing activity, there is the potential for increased erosion and delivery of sediment to the stream system. Contract specifications have been developed to minimize future cumulative effects from additional timber management to the extent feasible. These contract specifications as well as Design Criteria from the Watershed Conservation Practices Handbook (FSH 2509.25) outlined in Appendix B would be incorporated into any future management activities to prevent additional adverse watershed cumulative effects. When applicable measures are implemented and effective, adverse effects to watershed health from management activities would be minimized. However, as the levels of activity increase, the risk that conservation practices would not be implemented or would not be cumulatively effective increases. Beetle mortality may result in a loss of some of the trees providing shade in the steep headwater streams, but this is not expected to significantly affect stream temperatures as the steep gradients route water through the system quickly. Design Criteria in the original Rock Creek EIS provide stream buffers and other measures to protect water quality. The Routt National Forest riparian inventory (Routt 1993) and field reconnaissance were used to identify wetland and riparian areas. Through careful unit layout, road location, and implementation of Design Criteria, wetlands are not expected to be impacted by any of the action alternatives. There is always the potential for future wildfires which, depending on the intensity and extent, could affect water resources. Effects occur through increased overland flow and associated surface erosion which could increase sedimentation to the stream network, destabilize stream beds and banks, and degrade water quality through both ash deposition and increased sedimentation. These effects would be similar in all alternatives. Noxious Weeds Affected Environment It is estimated that more than 100 acres are infested with noxious weeds within the analysis area. There are 13 invasive species and 56 sites within the analysis area, which are summarized in Table 15. Approximately 32 percent of these sites occur in the Little Rock/Decker Creek and the Teepee Creek 7th level watersheds. Although hoary cress has not yet been documented in the analysis area, it is encroaching and expected to establish detectable populations within the foreseeable future. The majority of the noxious weed acres within the analysis area are composed of Canada thistle. Due to the sheer number of acres that the plant covers it has not been chemically treated except in certain areas such as campgrounds and timber sales. The Yampa Ranger District has been experimenting with biological control of the plant for the past 3 years. Initial results have been inconclusive; however, this would be the preferred treatment method for Canada thistle once a viable biological control is verified. Noxious weeds can be expected to occur in higher densities along roadways, in areas disturbed by timber harvests, campgrounds, recreation trails, trailheads, livestock corridors, and ditches; however, they are also known to invade otherwise healthy, undisturbed plant communities. Table 15.

List B includes plants whose continued spread should be stopped. List C plants are selected for recommended control methods.  Environmental Consequences ALTERNATIVE 1 - No Action: Continued disturbance on system roads would likely increase existing infestations of noxious weeds. Skid trails, temporary roads, landings, and burn piles would not by rehabilitated leaving disturbed land open for infestation. Motor vehicle use of roads and trails would lead to an increase in the number of weed populations and weed acreage. Most of this increase would be roadside weed populations, which would not be offset by road decommissioning. ALTERNATIVE 2 - Proposed Action: The decommissioning of roads reduces the potential for the dispersal of seed by motorized vehicles; however, earth disturbance associated with certain decommissioning methods can create habitat for noxious weeds to get established. The decommissioning of roads without revegetation reduces the movement of seed but does little to reduce the available habitat or prevent establishment once seed enters the area. The early treatment and revegetation of these roads, skid trails, landings and burn piles can reduce the risk of noxious weed establishment by stabilizing the site and providing competition. This alternative would have the lowest potential of spreading noxious weeds. ALTERNATIVE 3: The likelihood and potential extent of weed spread would be higher than in the No Action and Proposed Action alternatives. As in the other alternatives this increase would be in roadside weed populations. However, some of this potential weed spread would be offset by the proposed road decommissioning. Most of the potential would come from an increased number of roadside weed populations due to the construction of temporary roads. An increase in wind-dispersed species, such as Canada thistle, could also lead to new weed infestations in susceptible undisturbed habitats away from roads. Infestations in these areas would degrade native plant communities and have a greater ecological impact than the roadside weed populations. Cumulative Effects: Development of a transportation system provides corridors for the introduction and spread of noxious weeds. Adjacent landowners also contribute to the development of the transportation system and noxious weed spread. These past actions influence the present composition and distribution of these species in the analysis area. Other ongoing and reasonably foreseeable actions include timber sales, mineral development, and road construction and maintenance, all of which would contribute to the spread of noxious weeds in the analysis area. Invasive plant treatments are an ongoing and reasonably foreseeable action that is beneficial in reducing noxious weeds in the analysis area. These treatments would minimize impacts from noxious weed spread. Range Affected Environment Domestic livestock grazing is a historical use in the Gore and Red Dirt Geographic Areas. Grazing is managed under the grazing permit system. Permits specify permittee responsibilities for the maintenance of range improvements and salting necessary for the management of livestock while on the Forest. Improvements include fences, water developments, ponds, and corrals. Access to these improvements is critical for proper management of the allotment. Access by grazing permittees varies from motorized to non-motorized use. Periodic motorized access is needed. Access that is exclusive to the permittee should be authorized in the grazing permit, allotment management plan, or annual operating instructions. Numerous trails exist to facilitate proper distribution of livestock within allotments. These trails are maintained by the grazing permittee and are considered range features; therefore, they are not included as features in the transportation system. The Forest supports numerous viable livestock operations. Nearly 100 percent of the analysis area contains active allotments. Many roads and trails that are used by the public are also used to facilitate management of livestock and forage resources. Some roads and trails that cross allotments can lead to conflicts between livestock and recreation users. The presence of people in close proximity can disturb livestock, and livestock can make roads and trails rough for recreation. The analysis area contains six allotments which are as follows: . Blacktail Cattle & Horse (C&H) – July 1 to September 15 for 480 cow/calf pairs . Coberly-Maudlin C&H – June 25 to September 24 for 644 yearling cattle . French Creek C&H – July 1 to September 15 for 140 cow/calf pairs . Horse Creek C&H – July 1 to September 25 for 110 cow/calf pairs . Long Park C&H – July 1 to September 30 for 238 cow/calf pairs . Red Dirt C&H – July 1 to September 27 for 250 cow/calf pairs Environmental Consequences ALTERNATIVE 1 - No Action: This alternative would not affect livestock management. ALTERNATIVE 2 - Proposed Action: This alternative would decommission approximately 7 miles of temporary roads. Once a road or trail is decommissioned, motorized access by grazing permittees, as well as the general public, is prohibited. The roads that are proposed for decommissioning would have minimal impact on livestock permittee operations due to the high density of roads in the analysis area. The closure of system and non-system roads, when combined with livestock herding, should allow for more even distribution of livestock and utilization throughout the six allotments. Livestock would also be expected to have higher weight gains due to lack of disturbance. ALTERNATIVE 3: This alternative also proposes decommissioning approximately 7 miles of temporary roads; however, it also increases the amount of new temporary road to be built. The new temporary road will be decommissioned after use and will not affect livestock grazing; therefore, impacts to livestock grazing would be essentially the same as the Proposed Action. Cumulative Effects: The more miles of roads and trails that exist on an allotment, the easier the access is for livestock management, yet the higher the potential for conflict with recreational users. The conflict between recreation and livestock management may even become more pronounced as an increasing number of recreation users visit the Forest. Conflicts with other users or loss of accessibility due to road decommissioning usually result in increased labor cost in managing livestock. Other conflicts may occur when timber production, oil and natural gas production, or mining creates roads in the allotment areas. Recreation Affected Environment Within the analysis area there are two campgrounds and the Lagunita day-use recreation Area. The Blacktail Creek campground has 12 sites, and the Lynx Campground has 11 sites. The typical season of use for these sites is from late May until early November, generally based on weather. Occupancy levels are very low at the campgrounds during the week, moderate on weekends and high on holidays. The Lagunita recreation area is used by anglers as well as mountain bikers accessing the Gore Pass bike loops. The Lynx Pass guard station is an administrative site providing summer seasonal employee housing, a horse pasture, and storage. Most of the lodgepole pine around this site was killed during the beetle epidemic and has been cleared. Dispersed recreation is the main recreation component of the analysis area. There are approximately 150 inventoried dispersed campsites within the analysis area. The majority of the use occurs during the big game hunting seasons. Many of these sites are user created and do not meet the Forest Plan Standard of a 100 foot buffer from water (Routt Forest Plan page 1-18), which leads to a potential negative impact on water quality. There are multiple system trails throughout the analysis area, which accommodate hiking, horseback riding, cycling, snowmobiling, and off highway vehicle (OHV) use. Many of these routes are used year-round. The Gore Pass bike trails are unique in that they are located on routes that consist of open and closed Forest Service roads with some system trail connectors. There are a total of 61 miles of bike trails within this loop system. Some of these trails are heavily used, while others receive little to no use. National Forest Service roads (NFSRs) and trails (NFST) that make up the bike trails are listed below and shown on Figure 4. . Circle Park Loop: NFSRs 242, 250, and 241 . Gore Creek Loop: NFSRs 241, 243 and 250 . Farnham Loop: NFSRs 250, 100, 185 and 241 . Shoe and Stocking Loop: NFSRs 270, 206, 202, 275 and NFST 1001 . Teepee Creek Loop: NFSR 263 and NFST 1173 . Rock Creek Loop: NFSRs 263, 272, 268 and NFST 1000  All level 2 and above NFSRs in the analysis area are open to OHV use with the exception of NFSR 270. In addition, the Morrison Divide Trail, NFST 1174, is open to OHVs. Resource managers have noticed a dramatic rise in unauthorized OHV use on closed roads, as well as in increase in new unauthorized OHV trails. There are multiple pullouts on State Highway 134 for snowmobile parking. These parking areas allow for access throughout the analysis area. The season of use for snowmobiles is generally from December through March, and is dependent on the amount and quality of snow. Use is primarily on open and closed NFSRs, with 270, 225, 250, 243, and 185 receiving the greatest use. Two commercial outfitter/guide operations are permitted within the analysis area. Trailwind Tours is permitted to guide mountain biking on the Gore Pass mountain bike trails and the Morrison Divide trail. Steamboat Adventure Tours is permitted for winter day use snowmobile tours. Use of both outfitter operations has been minimal use over the past 5 years. The lower portion of Rock Creek is identified as an eligible Wild River due to its outstandingly remarkable values for its geologic, cultural, scenic, and fishery resources. The primary recreational use is fishing. Environmental Consequences ALTERNATIVE 1 - No Action: There will be no effect to developed recreation sites, the Lynx Pass guard station, or Wild River eligibility. Identified dispersed campsites in close proximity to water would continue to threaten water quality. Illegal OHV use would continue on existing closed roads. The Forest would continue to maintain relatively unused trails. The remaining salvage harvest associated with the Rock Creek EIS would result in timing limitations to those recreating due to closures on open roads associated with the logging operations. Tree removal would increase potential for unauthorized motorized access on skid trails leading to other open accessible country. ALTERNATIVE 2 - Proposed Action: Effects from timber harvest would be the same as those described in the No Action alternative. The restoration of the two dispersed campsites and loss of existing Forest access due to road closures and decommissioning would impact recreationists. The road decommissioning projects would primarily affect hunters’ access to the areas. Some hunters will view these closures as a loss of access while others will see it as more area for elk security and better hunting. Displaced dispersed campers will utilize other sites or create new ones. The Circle Park, Farnham and Gore Creek bike loops share some of the roads set to be decommissioned. Approximately 5 miles of bike trails will be taken off of the current trail system resulting in the some of the current loop trails becoming out and back trails (Figure 4). Due to the very limited use of these trails and the numerous cycling opportunities in the area, very few users will be impacted. If public need is demonstrated in the future, these sections, through analysis, could be converted to single-track trails. There is the potential for continued illegal OHV use on closed roads if they are not effectively closed or decommissioned. Snowmobiling and skiing opportunities may incur short term negative affects if roads normally covered in snow are plowed for tree harvesting. Since the slash heights will be low on roads to be closed, it will likely have no effect on over the snow use. There would be no effects to developed recreation sites, the Lynx Pass guard station, or Wild River eligibility. ALTERNATIVE 3: Effects to recreationists would be similar to the Proposed Action. The additional miles of temporary road and increase in associated timber harvest would have little effect on visitor experience in a landscape that has historically had a timber management emphasis. The building of new temporary roads for timber harvest would result in fewer timing limitations to those recreating due to closures associated with the logging operations as loading and decking operations could occur off of open roads and be done on the temporary roads. Tree removal would increase potential for unauthorized motorized access on skid trails and temporary roads leading to other open accessible country.   Figure 4. Map of Gore Pass Bike Trails within the Analysis Area  Cumulative Effects: Along with recent road closures in the area, recreationists will have reduced camping opportunities and vehicle access within the geographic area. However, with the current road densities and abundance of campsites, the overall recreation experience will be relatively unchanged. Soils Affected Environment The analysis area is dominated by igneous crystalline rocks of the Pre-Cambrian granites (Xg) with less extensive exposure of Tertiary and Mesozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Glacial till of the Pre-Bull Lake age is preserved on some areas of Green Ridge and in some areas north of Gore Pass. Alluvium and wetland organics are present in the riparian zones and includes some fen-like conditions in a few areas. Timber harvest areas are largely in the Xg igneous parent material. Soils formed from Pre-Cambrian parent materials are shallow on convex ridges and in upper slope positions and become deep to very deep on lower slopes. These soils are coarse textured, very to extremely gravelly loamy sands and sandy loams. Soil limitations are low inherent fertility and shallow depth to bedrock on convex ridges and upper south facing slopes. Past timber harvest, site preparation activities, and the harvest infrastructure of temporary roads, landings, burned piles, and skid trails has detrimentally impacted the soil with site preparation impacting the largest area. Soil management concerns related to vegetation management are landscape stability, erosion hazard, compaction hazard, and reforestation potential. Landscape stability, for example mass movement potential, is low throughout this area and is not a concern. Erosion potential ratings for past and proposed harvest activities are moderate16 on slopes less than 20 percent and severe17 on steeper slopes. Shallow soils, which are the dominant condition in the harvest units, are more sensitive to soil erosion than deeper soils because of very low available water capacity and very low native fertility. The compaction potential hazard rating for coarse textured soils affected by disturbance and mechanical equipment is generally moderate, indicating that some compaction is likely. 16 Some erosion is likely; occasional maintenance may be needed; simple erosion control measures needed. 17 Significant erosion can be expected; roads require frequent maintenance; costly erosion measures are needed (USDA Forest Service 2003). Soil quality has been greatly reduced in treatment areas as a result of past timber harvest and site preparation, through scarification. There are areas of severe erosion and gullying on steep slopes, low vegetative cover, and loss of litter cover. Site preparation has created large areas of impaired or unsatisfactory soils. A rating of unsatisfactory indicates that a loss of soil quality has occurred and soil condition has been detrimentally impacted (FSH 2509.18-92-1). Detrimental soil impacts result in the inability of soil to maintain resource values, sustain outputs, and recover from impacts. Environmental Consequences ALTERNATIVE 1 - No Action: No management action would occur and soils that have been detrimentally impacted would remain in that condition. This alternative would not address the need for mitigation to soil damage throughout the analysis area. Allowing timber to be sold in small sales utilizing the existing infrastructure will have additional impacts on soil health, including detrimental displacement, compaction, erosion, and burning as a result of landings, skid trails, and slash piles. The amount of soil disturbance associated with these actions is dependent on multiple factors including slope, soil type, and when the timber is harvested, with greater impacts in the summer versus the winter. ALTERNATIVE 2 - Proposed Action: Restoration would occur on temporary roads, landings, piles, and skid trails and would improve soil condition in these areas. Erosion control would be done on steep slopes, although a large amount of erosion has already occurred in some areas. Watershed improvement projects would have positive impacts to soil health by reducing soil erosion and improving areas impacted by roads and dispersed campsites with better vegetative cover. However, the rapid drying of the soil surface makes revegetation difficult to achieve and may require soil amendments to promote faster revegetation. The impacts from timber sales would be the same as those described in the No Action alternative. This alternative would likely result in a net gain of soil health in the analysis area through restoration activities. ALTERNATIVE 3: Detrimental displacement, compaction, and erosion caused by road construction cannot be fully mitigated; therefore, the 5 miles of temporary road construction, which could include up to 0.5 miles of specified or designed temporary road, would result in a long-term loss of soil productivity in these areas. Impacts from timber harvest would be increased, since more timber would be harvested and a greater area would be impacted. The number of landings, burn piles, and skid trails would be higher and the impacts associated with these actions would be greater, which would offset the gain in soil health associated with the restoration activities. Cumulative Effects: The main actions impacting soil health in the analysis area are past and future timber harvest. Past timber harvest throughout the area has created large areas with detrimental soil impacts. Soil productivity within the past harvest sites has been impaired through detrimental displacement, disturbance, compaction, and burning. The loss of soil organic material contributions over the long-term due to the removal of live biomass, especially in clearcut areas, may lead to decreases in soil moisture, holding capacity, nutrient availability, and microbial activity. Other activities impacting soils in the area include livestock grazing and fire. Livestock grazing occurs throughout the analysis area, however impacts to soils is minimal. The Mountain Pine Beetle epidemic has increased the risk of a stand replacing fire. If this was to happen the likely result would be an increase in soil erosion on slopes greater than 15 percent, until effective ground cover was established over the area. Timber Affected Environment The Gore Creek Restoration analysis area includes 33,078 acres of forested land. Forest vegetation cover types in the analysis area consist of lodgepole pine dominated forest (85%), interspersed with Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir (4%), quaking aspen (10%), and Douglas fir and mixed conifer (1%). The elevation of the proposed project ranges from approximately 8,300 feet to a maximum of approximately 10,300 feet. Within the analysis area 461 acres are within Management Area (MA) 5.11, Forest Vegetation Emphasis, and 27,791 acres are within Management Area 5.13, Forest Products. MA 5.11 requires the Forest to provide wildlife habitat, forest products, livestock forage, and recreation, while MA 5.13 requires production of commercial wood products. In order to accomplish these objectives certain silvicultural standards are required such as regeneration surveys and planting, if necessary, after harvest (Forest Plan page 1-11). There is also a requirement that forested areas are managed so that insect infestation outbreaks remain locally restricted (Forest Plan page 2-41). The Rock Creek Record of Decision (ROD) authorized approximately 13,500 acres of timber harvest. To date approximately 4,140 acres have been harvested or are currently under contract. There are approximately 9,360 acres yet to be harvested from the Rock Creek ROD, the majority of which is unlikely to be harvested because mortality of lodgepole pine trees, due to the bark beetle epidemic, exceeded the levels that allowed non-salvage prescriptions to be implemented. Many of the areas that are remaining for harvest were not analyzed for salvage harvest or contain steep slopes, therefore harvest in these areas would not be practicable. ALTERNATIVE 1 - No Action: This alternative would allow for timber sales analyzed under the Rock Creek EIS to move forward with no additional temporary roads being built. Timber sales currently under contract include: Big Rock, Blacktail, Porcupine, Twisted Antler, and Two Elks. These five timber sales would be completed using existing NEPA in the Rock Creek EIS. Future sales within the Rock Creek analysis area may move forward using existing infrastructure. Assuming an average skid distance of 600 feet and discarding areas with sustained slopes over 35 percent, there is approximately 240 acres that have been identified as accessible using existing roads. Figure 5 shows the location of these units. Field verification of stands during layout may result in more or less acres being included in future timber sales. During implementation of the future sales, log trucks and loaders would utilize existing open roads. It may be necessary to close these roads during logging operations in order to protect public safety and provide for traffic control. ALTERNATIVE 2 - Proposed Action: The Proposed Action would allow for the same amount of timber harvest to occur and have the same effects as described in the No Action alternative. ALTERNATIVE 3: Alternative 3 would allow for the construction of up to 5 miles of additional temporary roads, of which 0.5 miles could be specified or designed temporary road, to complete timber sales analyzed under the Rock Creek EIS. Using approximately 3.5 miles of this temporary road approximately 360 acres of additional harvest could occur above that which could be done under the No Action and Proposed Action alternatives (see Figure 5). The additional 1.5 miles of temporary road would be used to access the units identified if needed. From a timber perspective, this would be the preferred alternative since it would allow for improved regeneration over a greater area. With the addition of temporary roads loading and decking could be done off of the current road system eliminating the need for road closures.  Figure 5. Map of Proposed Timber Harvest Units  Cumulative Effects: A large amount of past and current timber harvest has occurred within the analysis area (Table 16). These timber sales have removed dead and dying lodgepole pine and improved timber regeneration. Many of these sales were in response to the Mountain Pine Beetle epidemic, which has affected nearly all of the analysis area to some degree. Due to the rapid progression of this epidemic it was not possible to stop the spread of the Mountain Pine Beetle. Salvage of dead and dying trees was completed to improve regeneration and reduce fuels, but also to remove hazard trees along roads and in developed recreation areas. The majority of future harvest would be in Management Areas 5.11 and 5.13 to meet Forest Plan guidance for these areas and improve timber production and forest regeneration. Table 16.

Passenger car roads require a higher degree of user comfort; these are defined as maintenance level 3, 4, and 5 roads. Road surfaces for these roads range from asphalt to aggregate to native surfaces. Level 2 roads are high-clearance roads, typically not suitable for low-clearance passenger style vehicles. These are typically low-standard, low volume roads that demand lower speeds. Project roads include all roads managed for intermittent use. They are normally closed to full-size vehicles, in a vegetated state, and considered to be at a maintenance level 1. An estimated 2 miles of unclassified road were identified in the roads analysis as being roads constructed with previous timber sales that were never added to the transportation system. Table 17 shows the miles of road within the analysis area by maintenance level. Primary access for the area is provided by Colorado State Highway 134. Routt County Road 270 is an aggregate surface road that provides access to the area for many residents along Morrison Creek and in the Stagecoach area. National Forest System roads which are outside the planning area but are used to access portions of the planning area include: NFSRs 100, 207, 211, 285 and 574. Table 17.

These levels are broken into those elements that are performed on an annual or continual basis, and those that are referred to as deferred maintenance. Annual or continual maintenance includes surface grading, ditch cleaning, culvert cleaning, dust abatement, gravel replacement, and roadside clearing. Annual maintenance costs for local roads can range from $750 per mile for maintenance of dips and outlet ditches, which are the minimum requirements for level 2 roads, to $4,125 per mile for light reconditioning of a local road. Annual maintenance costs for arterial and collector roads can range from $2,100 per mile for road surface grading and ditch cleaning, to $4,125 per mile for light reconditioning. Maintenance costs are higher because these roads tend to be wider, require a higher standard of maintenance, and may have aggregate surfacing. Elements of deferred maintenance are improvements to mitigate the impacts of a road or to keep a road at its current operating level. This work is often required to repair roads that have deteriorated or where events such as landslides, flooding, or heavy spring runoff has affected the road condition. Light reconstruction work includes reconditioning of the roadbed, moderate roadside clearing and brushing, reconstruction or installation of dips, replacement or installation of smaller diameter culverts, and replacement or installation of signs. Moderate reconstruction includes light reconstruction work plus installation of medium sized culverts, moderate roadside clearing and brushing, turnout construction, spot surfacing with gravel, and re-enforcing dips with gravel. Heavy reconstruction includes all of the above plus heavy roadside clearing and brushing, adding dips and culverts, adding larger diameter culverts, plating over rocky sections, realignments, and adding fabric and gravel material to soft sections. This is beyond the usual maintenance work done annually. Deferred maintenance costs for local roads can range from $4,125 per mile for light reconstruction, to $9,625 per mile for moderate reconstruction, and up to $16,500 per mile for heavy reconstruction work. Deferred maintenance costs for arterial and collector roads can range from $4,825 per mile for light reconstruction, up to $12,375 per mile for moderate reconstruction, and $20,625 per mile for heavy reconstruction. Again, the costs are higher because these roads generally contain more drainage features, require more safety features due to higher volumes of traffic, and are of a higher standard. Other costs include gates, cattleguards, signs, aggregate surfacing, culverts, pit development, and mobilization. Depending on the amount of work, these costs can add up quickly, from $3,125 for a gate to $82,500 per mile for aggregate surfacing. Moderate to heavy reconstruction work many times requires a contract to accomplish the work. Additional contract costs include contract preparation, inspection, and administration. When a system road is no longer necessary, it needs to be either converted to some other use such as a trail or allowed to be returned to the surrounding natural condition. This is called decommissioning, and can be defined as those activities that result in the stabilization and restoration of unneeded roads or trails to a more natural state. The road or trail is put back into production and permanently removed from the transportation system. The activities include blocking the entrance, scattering debris on the roadbed such as logs, rocks, branches, and stumps, revegetating, water barring, removing fills and culverts, reestablishing drainage-ways, pulling back shoulders, and full recontouring of the cut and fill slopes for full obliteration. Each road that is designated to be decommissioned, whether it is a system or non-system road, needs to have some level of treatment so that it can return to a natural state. The costs for treatment methods described above range from $250 for blocking the entrance, to $10,000 per mile for full obliteration. These methods, if effective, are a onetime cost. Once returned to a natural state, the impacts of the road no longer exist and no further maintenance expenditures are required. Environmental Consequences ALTERNATIVE 1 - No Action: Roads would continue to be used by the public and for administrative use as they are presently. Maintenance needs would continue to accumulate and outweigh current maintenance budgets. The No Action alternative would not alleviate resource problems, such as erosion, watershed conditions and resource damage, caused by the current road system. It is likely that additional user created roads would be established increasing the current road network. This alternative has the lowest short-term cost because there are no roads to decommission, and no rehabilitation would occur; however, it also has the greatest miles of road requiring maintenance, which would increase the costs over the long-term. Other indirect costs may come from, but are not limited to, increased law enforcement presence, continued degradation of resources, and reduced visitor experience. ALTERNATIVE 2 - Proposed Action: Implementation of road closures and obliteration of system and non-system roads would decrease road densities, decreasing erosion, benefitting wildlife, and allowing for a more effective transportation system. Use of gates, barriers and road rehabilitation are proven effective measures for road closures. Motorized activities would be restricted to system open roads. Newly created routes would be closed as soon as possible after discovery. Non-motorized uses would be allowed on closed roads as long as no resource damage was occurring. Reducing the miles of road would make the transportation network easier to maintain and would reduce the overall costs associated with road maintenance. Keeping users on properly built and maintained roads would make motorized recreation safer in the analysis area. In addition to road decommissioning, skid trails, landings, burn piles and steep slopes would all be rehabilitated using a variety of methods. The costs for treatment methods such as reseeding, scarification by heavy equipment, recontouring, etc. vary greatly from $50 for basic hand seeding to $500 for scarification by heavy equipment, per pile or landing. The cost associated with skid trail rehabilitation depends greatly on how much, if any, rehabilitation is necessary. The costs for treatment methods such as reseeding, scarfication and full obliteration vary greatly from $50 for basic hand seeding to $2,500 for full obliteration per mile. Each burn pile, skid trail, and landing will be assessed individually as to what rehabilitation method will be appropriate by the resource specialist. A total cost of the rehabilitation work for the burn piles, skid trails and landings cannot be determined at this time due to the site specific variability of the proposed work. This alternative would have a higher cost associated with decommissioning and rehabilitation than the No Action alternative; however, it also decreases the amount of road maintenance required over the long-term. The Proposed Action fully complies with the current Forest Plan and fully meets the intent of the travel rule by decommissioning non-system routes. ALTERNATIVE 3: Effects from this alternative would be similar to those in the Proposed Action. The proposed 5 miles of new temporary road construction would be closed and rehabilitated after use; however, up to 0.5 miles of this could be specified road, which could be left open. This could slightly increase road densities above that in the Proposed Action. The costs associated with this construction and rehabilitation would be included in the timber sale contracts. With the building of more temporary road there is an increased likelihood of illegal use on these routes, which may add to the resource damage that has already occurred in the area. Alternative 3 also fully complies with the current Forest Plan and meets the intent of the travel rule by decommissioning non-system routes. Cumulative Effects: A route identified for decommissioning is a route no longer needed for access. Returning the route to a natural state helps to prevent illegal use, reduce further resource damage, and mitigate unnecessary wildlife fragmentation. However, it does take funding to accomplish this. One of the factors in deciding the method for decommissioning will need to be the amount of available funding. Over time and as funding permits, the travel management plan will be implemented on the ground. The Forest will continue to evaluate the road systems in an effort to provide a safe, economically sustainable, and environmentally sound transportation system that provides the user with a quality experience. The Forest will also continue to evaluate roads designated for motorized mixed use as traffic increases on these roads due to the emphasis on motorized recreation on certain roads and in certain areas. The transportation system will continue to evolve in an effort to meet future access needs for commodities and access to recreational opportunities across the Forest. On the commodity side, oil and gas production, mining, and timber harvesting may use the existing road system and could expand the current system. When new roads are developed, the Forest Service will decide the best location, whether they should provide temporary or permanent access, and the best way for the roads to serve not only the individual commodity need, but the overall access needs of the entire area. As local communities continue to grow and as tourism continues to increase, more people may come to the area to visit and recreate, increasing the demand on the transportation system. This increased demand will lead to increased maintenance needs. Decommissioning roads within the analysis area will decrease redundancy in the road system while maintaining access throughout the area and ultimately improve watershed health. Over the short-term, costs will be greater due to road decommissioning and rehabilitation of skid trails, burn piles, and landings. Over the long-term the costs associated with road maintenance would decrease. Wildlife Affected Environment A variety of habitats are found within the analysis area and these habitats provide for a high diversity of terrestrial wildlife. A large number of bird and mammal species inhabit the analysis area year round and many more migrate to the area seasonally to breed and raise young. Extensive timber harvest has occurred throughout the analysis area, which has changed the character of the area for wildlife. A brief summary of the animals that occur in the Gore Creek Restoration analysis area is below. Management Indicator Species (MIS) The MIS analysis prepared for this project indicates that implementation of an action alternative may impact habitat for two Routt National Forest terrestrial MIS, the golden-crowned kinglet and the Northern goshawk. The action alternatives are anticipated to have no impact to the other two Routt National Forest terrestrial MIS, Wilson’s warbler and vesper sparrow. Golden-crowned kinglet (Regulus satrapa) The preferred habitat of the golden-crowned kinglet is spruce-fir forests. The mountain pine and spruce beetle populations are impacting spruce trees at low levels and some changes to stand structure and canopy closure in spruce-fir communities is expected at a small scale. Available population and habitat information suggests golden-crowned kinglets on the Routt National Forest have a population trend that is currently stable. Skorkowsky (2003b) demonstrated potentially higher densities of golden-crowned kinglets on the Routt National Forest relative to the state as a whole. In addition, the golden-crowned kinglet is well distributed on the Forest and throughout all mature-forest areas in Colorado. Golden-crowned kinglets are expected to remain fairly common on the Routt National Forest, though anticipated declines in mature spruce-fir associated with natural beetle infestations may contribute to some localized decline. However, decline is expected to remain within the natural range of variation because bark beetles have evolved with this disturbance in the spruce-fir ecosystem. Maintenance of intact, mature spruce-fir forests should ensure that golden-crowned kinglets remain characteristic residents on the Routt National Forest. Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentiles) There are numerous goshawk nest sites and observations on the Routt National Forest. To date, more than 50 goshawk breeding areas (nesting territories) have been located across the Routt National Forest with nine located in the Gore Geographic Area. Goshawks are considered relatively common and well distributed across the Routt National Forest. Goshawk populations on the Forest have shown an upward trend due to the late seral forest conditions. The distributions of goshawks will likely change as the forest is converted to an early successional stage. The changes to stand characteristics that are advantageous for goshawk nesting may occur slowly from 3 to 5 years and potentially up to 20 years following the bark beetle epidemic as dead lodgepole pine trees fall over and the nest stands deteriorate. Some decline in the goshawk population may occur on the Routt National Forest due to the lack of mature forest conditions, suitable nest locations and lowered reproduction. The goshawk population will likely return to stable in 80 to 200 years as the lodgepole pine community returns to late seral or mature forest conditions (Skorkowsky 2009). Sensitive Species Of the sensitive species, three terrestrial wildlife species are likely to occur within or near the analysis area, have potential habitat in or near the analysis area, or may be affected (i.e., directly, indirectly or cumulatively) by the implementation of an action alternative. The species have been reviewed and all have been considered. Species may have been eliminated from detailed analysis because they fall into one of the three following categories: 1. Suitable habitat and/or elevation range does not exist for these species in the project area. 2. The type or intensity of the activity under the alternatives is expected to have no impact/effect on these species or their habitat. 3. The associated conservation design or mitigations eliminate any potential for impact to the species. The Region 2 sensitive species that had no apparent reason to be excluded were carried forward and will be further analyzed in the remainder of the document. The species that were carried forward are the American marten, Pygmy shrew, and Northern goshawk. American marten (Martes americana) The preferred habitat of pine marten is old-growth spruce-fir forests, but they will also occupy lodgepole pine, Douglas fir, and occasionally cottonwood and riparian areas. The mountain pine and spruce beetle are impacting spruce trees at a low level and lodgepole pine at an epidemic level. Therefore, changes in stand structure in these forest types are expected. Pine marten occur throughout the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, with 22 documented sightings in the Gore Geographic Area. A pilot study within the Gore Creek analysis area determined that marten occupancy of the area is at 76 percent. Marten were frequently documented throughout the Gore Creek analysis area, and are often seen when completing field work. Loss of primary habitat and possibly, loss of connectivity in patches of late successional forest reduces habitat suitability for marten. Martens are affected by timber management through loss of overhead cover, inadequate retention of downed wood, and conversion of very dry sites that changes prey communities (Ruggiero et al. 1994). Pygmy shrew (Microsorex hoyi) The pygmy shrew ranges from Alaska, across Canada and into the northern United States, with a scattered population in the Rocky Mountains. The preferred habitat of the pygmy shrew is damp spruce-fir and lodgepole pine forests, sphagnum bogs, wet meadows, and other wet areas at high elevations (USDA 1997). Population status, trends, and distribution are unknown; however, a field survey was done on the Hahns Peak/Bears Ears Ranger District near Rabbit Ears Pass and Buffalo Pass during the summer of 2012. Pygmy shrews were found at four of the nine sites surveyed. This verifies that pygmy shrews are found on the Routt National Forest in appropriate habitats. Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentiles) The Northern goshawk was discussed in the MIS section of this document. Threatened and Endangered Species The Fish and Wildlife Service Colorado Field Office provides a list of Threatened, Endangered, Candidate and Proposed Species by county. The Gore Creek Restoration Project occurs in Grand and Routt County. This report will address only the Canada lynx because the lynx has the potential to occur or potential to be impacted by the implementation of the Alternatives. The Greater sage-grouse, North American wolverine, and Yellow-billed cuckoo were excluded due to lack of suitable habitat within the analysis area. Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) The historic range of Canada lynx extends from Alaska across most of Canada and south into parts of the western United States, the Great Lakes states, and New England. Many of the lynx habitats in the southern Rocky Mountains occur as islands of coniferous forest surrounded by shrub-steppe habitats. Primary habitat for lynx consists of early successional forests where snowshoe hares are plentiful as well as late successional conifer stands. An important characteristic of both these habitat types is dense branching of conifer species where tree crowns touch the ground, and the persistence of the canopy above winter snow levels. Conifer stands provide greater concealment from predators, lighter snowpacks, and warmer temperatures during winter than hardwood stands. Between 1999 and 2006 218 lynx were reintroduced into southwestern Colorado. Tracking of these animals indicates that lynx have travelled through and potentially may occupy portions of the Routt National Forest for a certain period of time. Environmental Consequences Management Indicator Species (MIS) Under the No Action alternative no direct effects to the golden-crowned kinglet and Northern goshawk populations or habitat are anticipated; however, there is potential for negative long-term indirect effects to their habitat. The Proposed Action may temporarily lower the quality of habitat for a limited number of pairs of golden-crowned kinglets while work is occurring. Short-term effects to Northern goshawks may also occur; however, the restoration activities are expected to improve habitat over the long-term. Alternative 3 is likely to have greater negative effects to habitat for both species because more timber will be harvested through the addition of up to 5 miles of temporary road, although these impacts are not substantial enough to cause changes to the population trend. Table 18 indicates the likely impacts to MIS species by alternative. Table 18.

If the resource damage is left without rehabilitation the quality of the landscape would be affected with a subsequent reduction in quality habitat. However, this loss of habitat is not likely to affect overall marten populations on the Forest. The No Action alternative is a net positive for marten and their habitat since the remaining timber sales would be smaller in scale than planned under the Rock Creek EIS, which would impact less habitat and reduce loss of habitat connectivity. Pygmy shrew – Landing and burn pile locations may be used for denning and foraging by pygmy shrew; therefore, leaving these locations in their current condition may provide some benefit. Many of the roads that are proposed for decommissioning are within riparian areas, which make up 80 to 90 percent of pygmy shrews’ habitat. These roads will continue to degrade riparian condition and may cause habitat disturbances and trampling of individuals. Northern goshawk – With no implementation of any restoration projects there will be very limited impact to goshawks. ALTERNATIVE 2 – Proposed Action American marten – Short-term impacts are expected from the implementation of the restoration projects; however, the disturbance to individuals would be minimal as marten are primarily inactive during the day time. Over the mid- to long-term marten habitat would be improved by the proposed projects. Overall, the improvement in marten habitat would outweigh the minimal short-term impacts to marten. Impacts from timber harvest would be the same as those described in the No Action alternative. Pygmy shrew – The Proposed Action has the potential to affect pygmy shrew and their habitat through disturbance to individuals during implementation of the restoration, watershed improvement, and road decommissioning projects. If temporary roads, landings, or burn piles are located near suitable pygmy shrew habitat these actions could have short-term impacts on pygmy shrews through site disturbance and potential trampling of individuals from hand and mechanical treatments. Though short-term impacts are expected under the Proposed Action the watershed improvement projects, including the decommissioning of 7 miles of road, removal of culverts, and closing of dispersed campsites, would improve overall habitat quality for the pygmy shrew over the long-term. These actions would restore and improve stream and wetland function, resulting in beneficial impacts to pygmy shrew and their habitat. Overall, the improvement of pygmy shrew habitat is expected to outweigh the short-term impacts associated with project implementation and have a beneficial effect on pygmy shrew. Northern goshawk – Goshawk habitat occurs throughout the analysis area. Minor short-term impacts to habitat may occur with the implementation of the restoration and road decommissioning projects. However, in the mid- to long-term these projects would have a positive impact on goshawk habitat. Reduction in motorized and public use associated with the road decommissioning would restore habitat connectivity and improve goshawk habitat for breeding, nesting, hunting and fledging young. Overall, the restoration will have a net positive effect on the Northern goshawk and their habitat over the mid- and long-term. ALTERNATIVE 3 American marten – The impacts from the restoration activities would be the same as described in the Proposed Action. The impacts from the additional 5 miles of authorized temporary road and increased timber harvest include further resource damage, disturbance to individuals, and direct habitat loss. Pygmy shrew – The construction of temporary roads and increased timber harvest may cause negative impacts to pygmy shrews. The increase in temporary roads raises the likelihood of mechanical equipment trampling individuals. This alternative would increase habitat loss for this species, and have greater impacts than both the No Action and Proposed Action alternatives. Northern goshawk –This alternative would have additional negative impacts to Northern goshawk due to the temporary road construction and associated increase in timber harvest, which can hinder connectivity and function of a landscape for goshawk. The restoration and road decommissioning projects may not offset the negative impacts associated with the increase in salvage logging. This alternative may cause short- and mid-term negative effects associated with the loss of foraging habitat and decrease in habitat connectivity. Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects need to be placed in the context of changes that have occurred across northern Colorado and southern Wyoming with the Mountain Pine Beetle epidemic. The salvage of beetle killed lodgepole pine has collectively simplified forest structure on thousands of timbered acres across the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests and adjacent National Forests. American marten – The bark beetle epidemic has created negative cumulative effects due to the loss of connected and functional habitats when considering the extent of vegetation that has been cleared within the analysis area. These projects when combined with the existing road infrastructure, domestic livestock grazing, and to a lesser extent permitted and public recreational activities, may create barriers to movement that are necessary for marten to meet their life history needs (breeding, denning, foraging, and rearing young). Cumulatively, these vegetation management projects could change distribution and abundance of pine marten. Pygmy shrew - The spread of bark beetle outbreaks and eventual accumulation of downed trees next to riparian areas would be considered a positive impact, increasing the amount of coarse woody debris for denning and foraging. This would be a particular benefit during winter when pygmy shrews rely on the increased coarse woody debris for improved survival in subnivean (under the snow) environments. This improved habitat will last for decades after the beetle outbreak ends as coarse woody debris continues to accumulate on the forest floor. Overall, Forest-wide habitat quality is expected to increase through time. The pygmy shrew population across the Forest is expected to follow the changes in coarse woody debris through time. Even though the pine beetle epidemic is anticipated to be a cumulative beneficial effect for pygmy shrews, there are negative cumulative effects when considering the extent of vegetation being cleared across the Yampa Ranger District. These projects when combined with the existing road infrastructure, domestic livestock grazing, water depletions, water developments, snow compaction from winter sports, roads, and permitted and public recreational activities, may inhibit pygmy shrews from meeting their life history needs (breeding, denning, foraging, and rearing young). Northern goshawk – The beetle epidemic has dramatically altered the lodgepole pine cover type from a late seral to a somewhat early successional community. Though stand structure is changing standing dead trees will provide nesting and foraging habitat for the goshawk in the interim. Goshawk populations will continue to shift as the forest changes to an early successional forest and as vegetation treatments are implemented. Negative cumulative effects may occur due to the loss of connected and functional habitats when considering the extent of vegetation being cleared across the Yampa Ranger District. These projects when combined with the existing road infrastructure, domestic livestock grazing, and permitted and public recreational activities may hinder goshawks from meeting their life history needs (breeding, nesting, foraging, and fledging). The bark beetle epidemic when combined with vegetation treatments and the associated road network could cumulatively change distribution and abundance of Northern goshawks. Threatened Species Canada lynx – The Southern Rockies Lynx Amendment (SRLA) amended Forest Plans in Colorado and the Medicine Bow National Forest in Wyoming (USDA 2008). The SRLA provides Standards and Guidelines for various management activities such as, vegetation management, recreation, forest roads and trails, highways, and oil and gas leasing to establish management direction that conserves and promotes the recovery of lynx, and reduces or eliminates potential adverse effects from land management activities. ALTERNATIVE 1 – No Action: The No Action alternative would not cause any temporary disruption to lynx through temporary road construction, road decommissioning, or restoration activities. The Mountain Pine Beetles have created the existing condition of lynx habitat that is considered “Currently Unsuitable” in the lodgepole pine cover type (stands with greater than 70 percent mortality). By avoiding temporary road construction and consequently implementing timber sales piecemeal through existing roads, those stands with greater than 70 percent mortality from the pine beetle epidemic may take longer to regenerate. Though stands may regenerate more quickly after harvest, it is anticipated that the bark beetle epidemic may provide improved habitat conditions for lynx by leaving abundant coarse woody debris, a high density of young trees, as well as a high density of snowshoe hares, all of which are important for lynx denning. Over the long-term, stands may recover more slowly without harvest treatments specified in the Rock Creek EIS, but may provide improved conditions overall. Because of the relatively large home range that this species occupies and the remaining late successional habitat available in this geographic area for this species, the habitat impacts associated with not completing restoration activities will not eliminate lynx use of the analysis area. ALTERNATIVE 2 – Proposed Action: The management actions associated with the Proposed Action will create short-term impacts to Canada lynx habitat. Over the long-term, habitat components will recover and provide for lynx habitat. Because of the relatively large home range that this species occupies and the remaining late successional habitat available in this geographic area for this species, the habitat impacts associated with the Proposed Action will not eliminate lynx use of the analysis area and will not be a significant difference from the No Action alternative. Any short-term direct effects from mechanical disturbance during implementation of restoration activities will be offset by the habitat that is improved in the restoration and road decommissioning projects over the mid- and long-term. ALTERNATIVE 3: Increases in temporary roads and associated timber harvest can hinder connectivity, and function of a landscape for a large carnivore such as a lynx. All temporary roads would be decommissioned after implementation of the project, which would reduce the impacts to lynx and their movements across the landscape over the long-term. However, during the interim, localized effects of road construction and salvage would create negative, indirect effects for lynx by altering habitat and landscape connectivity. Cumulative Effects – The bark beetle epidemic has had the biggest effect on lynx habitat due to the increased harvest and changes in stand structure. There has been a fair amount of historic logging as well as recent timber harvest related to the bark beetle epidemic. Multiple timber projects have occurred on National Forest, private and state lands clearing lodgepole pine that has been affected by the bark beetle. This harvest affects lynx habitat and landscape connectivity. Salvage harvest eliminates habitat over the intermediate-term because a high proportion of existing vegetation is completely removed. The temporary lack of trees and other plants does not support preferred prey, including red squirrels and snowshoe hares, even at low abundances, nor does it provide the cover needed by lynx for hunting. Thus, all regeneration harvest areas represent a temporary but complete habitat loss for lynx over the short-term if beetle activity hasn’t already changed the stand substantially. If beetle activity occurred several years ago, then these changes are already occurring and salvage would not change the stand’s characteristics over the short-term. Much of the harvest is occurring, or has occurred, in areas that are considered “Currently Unsuitable” lynx habitat and would not substantively affect the condition of lynx habitat, nor are they likely to influence Canada lynx. Table 19.

There is also elk winter range, and migration corridors for elk, mule deer, and pronghorn within the analysis area. Burn piles, landings and campsites undergoing rehabilitation occur in habitat used by all three species considered. However, the large number of burn piles and landings means that rehabilitation would occur at a slow pace, over several years, if not decades. Thus, the effects would be spread out over time. In addition, the burn piles and landings currently exist as unsuitable habitat for these species. While rehabilitation efforts may result in a short-term disruption to individual animals, overall population numbers would not be significantly affected. Over the long-term, a significant amount of habitat would be returned to suitable for these species. Thus, the overall effect of these activities would be positive. Similarly, the addition of temporary roads would have a short-term localized negative effect on these species, but no significant mid- to long-term effects are anticipated. The decommissioning of NFSRs 185, 241, 242, and 246 would result in long term benefits to these species, due to increased habitat availability and reduced disturbance to wildlife related to motorized use. Forest Plan Consistency __________________________ All activities, as embodied in the Proposed Action are consistent with Management Area direction and applicable Forest-wide resource Standards. Guidelines are advisable courses of action which should be followed to achieve forest goals but are optional. Deviations from Guidelines must be analyzed during project level analysis and documented in the project decision document but do not require a Forest Plan amendment. The No Action alternative is not consistent with Forest Plan Standards and Guidelines for water, soils and heritage resources. This alternative is not consistent with water and aquatic Standards 2 and 3 and soils Standard 4 and is in violation of the National Historic Preservation Act, as amended. Both action alternatives are consistent with Forest Plan standards and guidelines. With proper implementation of Design Criteria, there would be no additional irreversible or irretrievable effects. The No Action and Proposed Action alternatives are less consistent with Forest Plan direction for Management Areas 5.11 and 5.13 compared to Alternative 3. Forest Plan direction states that within these Management Areas forest products should be emphasized. Increased timber harvest under Alternative 3 would allow for better timber management as more acres of dead lodgepole pine could be cut in response to the Mountain Pine Beetle epidemic. Short-term Uses and Long-term Productivity _________ NEPA requires consideration of “the relationship between short-term uses of man’s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity” (40 CFR 1502.16). As declared by Congress, this includes using all practicable means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated to foster and promote the general welfare, to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans (NEPA Section 101). The proposed activities would improve resource concerns throughout the analysis area. Overall condition of the area would be improved through lowered road density and improved soil productivity and stream health. Unavoidable Adverse Effects_______________________ The application of the Forest Plan Standards and Guidelines and the listed Design Criteria should limit the extent and duration of any adverse environmental effects due to this project. However, it is impossible to avoid all potential impacts completely. Refer to the discussion of environmental consequences for each resource in the EIS for the disclosure of all environmental effects. Specific adverse effects from the Proposed Action include: a potential increase in noxious weeds, more destructive, less manageable wildfires, and detrimental effects to archeological resources. Specific adverse effects from Alternative 3 include: possible degraded watershed condition, increased impacts from new temporary road construction, decreased soil productivity, potential increase in noxious weeds, and detrimental effects to cultural resources. Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments of Resources ______________________________________ Irreversible commitments of resources are those that cannot be regained, such as the extinction of a species or the removal of mined ore. Irretrievable commitments are those that are lost for a period of time such as the temporary loss of timber productivity in forested areas that are kept clear for use as a powerline right-of-way or road. There are no identifiable commitments of resources for this Proposed Action that are irretrievable or irreversible, as determined by the interdisciplinary team. Cumulative Effects _______________________________ See preceding environmental consequences discussions for cumulative effects under each resource area. In summary, the Mountain Pine Beetle epidemic, past and present vegetation management, road construction, livestock grazing, and recreation have all affected the existing condition in the project area. The Mountain Pine Beetle has killed lodgepole pine throughout the entire Forest. Vegetation management and road construction activities have increased ground disturbance and affected soil and watershed health; however these vegetation treatments have decreased the risk of a high intensity wildfire and improved forest revegetation. Livestock grazing and dispersed campsites immediately adjacent to streams have compacted soil, affected native plant species, degraded riparian condition, and increased sedimentation in certain stream reaches. Conversely, watershed restoration actions have helped to improve watershed and soil conditions. These have included road decommissioning, road relocation, road improvements, burn pile rehabilitation, and closure of dispersed recreations sites near streams. Reasonably foreseeable actions or events that may affect resources in the analysis area include an increased risk of large-scale high intensity wildfire resulting from the bark beetle epidemic and future timber harvest and associated road construction which may affect watershed health, soil productivity, fire intensity, wildlife habitat and botanical and heritage resources. Other Required Disclosures _______________________ NEPA at 40 CFR 1502.25(a) directs “to the fullest extent possible, agencies shall prepare draft environmental impact statements concurrently with and integrated with …other environmental review laws and executive orders.” The Proposed Action complies with other laws and regulations such as the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act. There will be no adverse effects on any threatened or endangered species or on cultural resources. Best management practices will be applied to meet state water quality standards and section 404 of the Clean Water Act, therefore a separate 404 permit is not required. All new construction activities would be for silvicultural purposes only, and therefore a section 402 permit for stormwater discharge is not required. New construction activities consist of road construction, landings etc. needed to support timber harvest. Any activities associated with road decommissioning would not change the alignment of the road, and would restore timber productivity, and therefore would not constitute construction activities. The No Action alternative would result in further deterioration of at least one significant archeological site due to increased erosion, which could increase the potential for collection and vandalism at the site as well. By not mitigating the effects of harvest activities through restoration of disturbances, the No Action alternative would be in violation of the National Historic Preservation Act, as amended. The USDA has entered into consultation with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Colorado State Historic Preservation Office regarding this project. Implementation of the project will be based on concurrence with these agencies. CHAPTER 4.
