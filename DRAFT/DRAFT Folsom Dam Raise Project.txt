FOLSOM DAM RAISE PROJECT

DRAFT SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT/
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT
July 2016

Type of Statement: Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact
Report (DSEIS/SEIR)
Lead NEPA Agency: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District (Corps)
Lead CEQA Agency: State of California, Central Valley Flood Protection Board (CVFPB)
Cooperating Agency: U.S. Bureau of Reclamation
Abstract: The Corps and its non-Federal partners, the CVFPB and SAFCA, propose to provide
flood risk management and increased flood protection to the Sacramento metropolitan area by
constructing a 3.5-foot combination earthen raise and reinforced concrete flood wall for Folsom
dams and reservoir dikes while implementing refinements to existing emergency spillway tainter
gates. This draft DSEIS/SEIR evaluates the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects on
environmental resources from alternative plans and identifies avoidance, minimization, and
mitigation measures. The project is not expected to cause substantial loss, degradation or
fragmentation of any natural communities or wildlife habitat – most potential adverse effects
would be short-term, reduced, or avoided when conducted with best management practices (e.g.
air quality, recreation, and noise impacts). The proposed project alternatives are evaluated and
include mitigation measures to reduce, minimize, or avoid, where feasible, any significant and
potentially significant adverse impacts.
Public Review and Comment: The 45 day public review period would begin on July 19, 2016,
and the official closing date for receipt of comments on the draft DSEIS/SEIR would be
September 1, 2016. All comments received would be considered and, as appropriate,
incorporated into the final SEIS/SEIR. Written comments or questions concerning this
document should be directed to the following: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento
District; Attn: Ms. Mariah Brumbaugh.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

ES.1 PURPOSE OF THE DSEIS/SEIR
This draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report
(DSEIS/SEIR) has been prepared by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), Sacramento
District, as the Federal Lead Agency under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and
the State of California Central Valley Flood Protection Board (CVFPB) as the State Lead
Agency under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), for the Folsom Dam Raise
Project. The Folsom Dam Raise proposed action is a cooperative effort between the Corps, the
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), the Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency (SAFCA),
and the CVFPB, through the California Department of Water Resources (DWR).
The Folsom Dam Raise Project, along with the Folsom Modifications Project, was
reevaluated together in the Post Authorization Change Report (PACR) for the American River
Watershed Project dated March 2007. This report resulted in the recommendation of a JFP
auxiliary spillway at the Folsom Dam – to be constructed jointly with the USBR – as well as a
3.5-foot combination earthen raise and concrete floodwall construction on the dams and reservoir
dikes, refinements to existing emergency and service spillway tainter gates, and three ecosystem
restoration projects (design of this phase of the project would begin after construction of the dam
raise features). After the authorization of emergency spillway gate work in the 2007 PACR,
Reclamation completed structural improvements to the existing service and emergency tainter
gates, as well as the spillway piers in 2011. Due to these improvements, emergency gate
refinements have been developed in lieu of complete gate replacement – this resulted in the
development of an Engineering Documentation Report (EDR) in 2013 to support a variation to
the emergency spillway gate replacement concept. In addition, a series of Design
Documentation Reports (DDRs) are being developed to determine the designs for increasing the
height of Folsom dikes and dams by 3.5 feet – it is anticipated the DDRs for all of the
engineering designs would be completed by the end of 2019.
This DSEIS/SEIR examines the impacts of proposed construction of the Spillway Gate
Modification (Tainter Gate) and Combination Earthen Raise/Concrete Floodwall. The 3.5-foot
raise was not fully designed in the 2007 PACR, nor was a full environmental analysis completed
in the associated 2007 Folsom Dam Safety/Flood Damage Reduction DSEIS/SEIR (Folsom
DS/FDR/EIS/EIR). Consequently, additional design documentation was determined to be
necessary and this Folsom Dam Raise DSEIS/SEIR is being prepared to fully disclose revised
project alternatives and updated project-related effects.

ES.2 PROJECT AREA
The project is located in the area surrounding Folsom Lake that falls within the Counties
of Placer, El Dorado, and Sacramento – Folsom Dam and its associated facilities are located 23
miles northeast of the city of Sacramento. The Folsom Dam and Reservoir (Folsom Lake) are
located downstream from the north and south forks of the American River. The study area is
contained around the Folsom Facility which consists of four dams – the Main Concrete Dam, the
Left Wing Dam (LWD), the Right Wing Dam (RWD), and the Mormon Island Auxiliary Dam
(MIAD) – as well as eight Dikes (Dikes 1 through 8), and the emergency spillway. Site access to
the project area would occur through a Bureau of Reclamation facility on existing paved roads
and through the crest of the LWD. Staging areas proposed for the current Bureau of
Reclamation (Reclamation) work yard are adjacent to the borders of remaining blue oak
woodland.
In this document, the project area consists of the emergency spillway, Dikes 1 through 8
and MIAD, as well as the LWD and RWD (which tie into the main dam). The existing tainter
gates on the emergency spillway, Dikes 1 through 8, and MIAD would have a 3.5-foot earthen
embankment raise implemented, and the LWD and RWD (which tie into the main dam) would
have a 3.5-foot concrete flood wall constructed and reinforced. General construction access to
the site would come from Folsom Dam Road via Auburn-Folsom Road. A total of 31 staging
areas have been defined within the project area – all the staging areas have been previously
disturbed for a total of 157.2 acres. The project area is shown on maps ES.1 and ES.2.

ES.3 BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR ACTION
Currently, ongoing construction work, such as the Folsom Dam Modification Project
Approach Channel, and updates to the Folsom Water Control Manual (WCM) may allow Folsom
Dam to safely pass the PMF without further improvements, including the Folsom Dam Raise and
Emergency Spillway Gate Modifications. However, affixing top seal bulkheads over the
emergency gates would allow higher flood pools across the spillway, adding flood damage
reduction benefits while still safely passing the PMF without overtopping the tainter gates.
Raising the dam by 3.5 feet would allow for longer holding discharges by creating additional
surcharge space (temporary water storage space utilized during rare flooding events) within the
reservoir. Structural modifications associated with the Folsom Dam Raise Project are proposed

to provide increased flood damage protection by increasing the flood storage capacity and/or
pool release mechanisms at the Folsom Facility.
Sacramento is identified as one of the most at-risk communities in the nation for
flooding, resulting in a need to reduce this risk through numerous flood damage reduction
measures. The existing system leaves the highly urbanized Sacramento area at an unacceptably
high level of flood risk. The Sacramento metropolitan area has a high probability of flooding
due to its location at the confluence of (and within the floodplain of) two major rivers. Both of
these rivers have large watersheds with very high potential runoff which has overwhelmed the
existing flood management system in the past. The existing levee system was designed and built
many years ago, before modern construction methods were employed. These levees were
constructed close to the river to increase velocities which would flush out hydraulic mining
debris. This debris is essentially gone now, and the high velocities associated with flood flows
are eroding the levees, which are critical components of the flood management system needed to
reduce flood risk.
Historic flood events in 1986 and 1997 raised concerns over the adequacy of the existing
flood risk management system; these concerns prompted a series of investigations regarding the
need to provide additional protection to the Sacramento metropolitan area. The results of these
investigations led to the authorization of several flood risk management projects in the American
River watershed, including the Folsom Dam Raise Project.
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) evaluation is required when a major Federal
action is under construction and may have significant impacts on natural and human
environmental quality. The Corps has determined that the proposed project may have significant
effects on the environment; therefore, an EIS is required. This draft DSEIS/SEIR provides
supplemental documentation and evaluates the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative
environmental effects of alternative plans for the Folsom Dam Raise. This draft DSEIS/SEIR
also identifies mitigation measures to avoid, minimize, and compensate for impacts.

ES.4 ALTERNATIVES
The Folsom Dam Raise Project plan formulation process was developed and discussed in
Chapter 4.0 of the 2002 Long Term Study, Plan Formulation and Screening of the Flood Damage
Reduction Measures, in Chapter 5.0, Flood Control Alternatives, and in Chapter 6.0, Ecosystem
Restoration for Flood Plain and Fisheries Resources.
Potential design alternatives were identified for assessment of engineering,
environmental, and cost considerations. The two alternatives discussed in this DSEIS/SEIR are

the final array of alternatives considered – the other alternatives were screened out for reasons
described in the table below.
Table ES.1 Measures and Alternatives Considered but Eliminated.
Alternative
Reduce the Stop Log Fabrication and
Installation from Two Sets to Zero
New Sets; Utilize Existing Set

Reason for Elimination
Two gates would need to be non-operational during the
construction, which Bureau of Reclamation does not
agree with that action.

Tainter Gate Refinement:
Replacement of Emergency Tainter
Gates

Alternative 2 was chosen based on achieving the same
benefit as this alternative but with more flexibility in
operations for less cost.

Refined Emergency Gate
Replacement

Alternative 2 was chosen based on achieving the same
benefit as this alternative but with more flexibility in
operations for less cost.

Tainter Gate Refinement: Horizontal
Top Seal

The geometry and location of the Horizontal Top Seal
made this refinement option more complex and difficult
to design.

Tainter Gate Refinement: Skin Plate
Extension

Modifications necessary for this alternative were deemed
excessive and, more significantly, transverse seal loading
is not recommended or practiced in tainter gate designs.

Dredging

Dredging would be expensive, and environmentally and
culturally damaging process. Because of its very high
cost, this measure was not considered further.

The 3.5-Foot Dam Raise: Concrete
Floodwall

This alternative was not carried forward because of the
potential recreation and environmental effects based on
feedback from the public and environmental team.

The 3.5-Foot Dam Raise: Earthen
Raise

It was rejected for the left and right wing dams due to
space constraints associated with steeper embankment
slopes compared to other reservoir dikes.

The 3.5-Foot Dam Raise: Concrete
Masonry Unit (CMU)

This alternative was rejected because reinforced CMU
tend to crack more readily during earthquakes and other
heavy movements.

3.5-Foot Dam Raise: MechanicallyStabilized Earthen (MSE) Cap

The primary concern is that the stress-strain differential
between the anchors and soil material would cause a
seepage path through the MSE wall.

ES.4.1 Alternative 1 – No Action
Under Alternative 1, the Corps would not implement the emergency spillway gate
modifications or the 3.5-foot combination earthen raise and floodwall construction. Under the

No Action Alternative, significant loss of life is expected with a great enough flood event or
PMF, as well as injuries, illnesses, and the release of hazardous and toxic contaminants to the
downstream floodplain. The urban areas downstream of Folsom Dam would continue to be at
risk of flooding, and lives would continue to be threatened. The gates and dam would be at risk
for failure, threatening the levee system downstream with a surge of flow beyond the current
160,000 cfs levee capacity. If a dam or gate failure were to occur, the chance of levee failure
downstream would increase. If a levee failure were to occur, major government facilities and
transportation corridors would be impacted until flood waters recede. A temporary shut down or
slowing of State and Local government functions would occur, and workers would be unable to
perform their duties until the buildings are restored and can once again be occupied.
ES.4.2 Alternative 2 – Spillway Tainter Gate Modification and Combination Earthen
Raise/Concrete Floodwall (environmentally preferred plan)
The 3.5-foot dam raise alternative is currently at a lesser level of general development
and analysis than the Spillway Modification (tainter gates). It is likely that supplemental design
and environmental documentation would be required for the dam raise prior to construction.
Any post-construction operational changes would be defined in a WCM update and
accompanying environmental documentation.
While there will be no changes in normal operations with the construction of the dam
raise, the raise would result in an ablity to sustain an increased flow of 160,000 cfs for a longer
period of time, and would have possible inundations up to 486.34’ (NAVD88). The WCM
update, based on the Folsom Joint Federal Project, is scheduled to be completed in October
2017; any new operations that the project would have as a result of the Dam Raise would be
dependent upon the updated WCM. As it stands, the proposed 3.5-foot raise is only an increase
in the surcharge zone, not the operational space, and would only have an effect in the events that
encroach in that surcharge zone.
The 2013 Engineering Documentation Report (EDR) identified refinements to the
existing tainter gates in lieu of the complete gate replacement originally proposed in the 2007
PACR. Refinements include additional strengthening features to the existing tainter gates and a
new “top seal” bulkhead that would prevent overtopping of the spillway gates during a major
flood event. This alternative includes the following modifications:


A hydraulic structure (the top seal bulkhead) would be mounted above the
spillway tainter gates in order to prevent overtopping during a major flood event.



Additional retrofit elements (skin plate ribs, lower girder, and trunnion anchorage)
on the tainter gates are necessary to address and account for the loading
conditions imposed by the PMF.



A vertical concrete extension to the top of the pier would provide the necessary
elevated platform for the new hoist system. The top seal bulkheads would mount
to and seal against the pier extension. This concrete extension would also serve
as the water barrier between top seal bulkheads when the reservoir reaches
elevations above 478.59’ NAVD88.



Modifications to the existing steel “pier wrap” installed by Reclamation are
specified to handle additional loads resulting from a PMF scenario. These
modifications include extensions to the height and width of the existing steel
“wrap” as well as additional anchoring requirements.



A 3.5-foot raise to the heights of Dikes 1 through 8 and MIAD with an earthen
embankment raise, using an engineered fill material similar to the existing
composition of the earthen dikes, would allow seepage and pore pressure to be
maintained through the interface between the old and the new material.



A reinforced 3.5-foot concrete flood wall would be constructed on the LWD and
the RWD that would tie into the main dam, the new control structure, and the
existing terrain. A reinforced concrete retaining wall (parapet wall) with footing
embedded in the earth-fill of the embankment would be constructed along the
embankment crest to the required height.

ES.5 ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
Significant resources that may be affected by the alternatives include existing vegetation
and wildlife resources. Under Alternative 1, the proposed construction would not occur. No
construction related effects to vegetation and wildlife would occur, and the conditions in the
project area would remain consistent with existing conditions.
Alternative 2 is proposed to have a construction footprint of up to 50 feet on both sides of
Dikes 1 through 8 and MIAD, with vegetation removal and ground-surface disturbance in
staging areas; disturbance caused by staging and stock pile construction activity, noise, traffic,
and night lighting are expected to displace wildlife species through multiple years of
construction from year 2017 to 2020. Disturbance from the project is expected to intermittently
compromise water access to the shoreline for a period of five years. The duration of construction

related disturbances would be overlapping and continuous throughout Dikes 1 through 8.
However, displacement would be considered temporary in nature and would have a less than
significant impact on wildlife populations with the implementation on mitigation, minimization,
and avoidance measures.
Annual grassland constitutes a substantially higher acreage within the project area. To
avoid significant impact to grassland habitat, mitigation measures would be employed. The
project area would be returned to pre-existing condition (to the extent practicable) after project
completion, and then improved with the use of native flora. Staging areas and other disturbed
soil surfaces would be re-vegetated with native grass species directly after construction activities
cease.
The emergency tainter gate improvements would result in a localized construction
footprint for three years. Construction noise and traffic are expected to disturb and/or displace
local wildlife that utilize oak and pine woodlands, as well as grasslands, over the project
duration.
Construction staging areas are proposed primarily for disturbed areas that appear to have
formerly supported oak woodland vegetation but now consist of bare soil or ruderal vegetation.
Up to two acres of oak woodland savannah is included in staging area boundaries within the
tainter gate project area. Though small in acreage, loss of these trees would contribute
disproportionately to the reduction of oak woodland habitat in the project area. Mitigation
measures for protecting existing trees would reduce these impacts to less-than-significant.
A wetland delination was conducted on 10 June 2014 (Appendix D). Additional
delineation would be conducted at MIAD to determine wetland status or drainage characteristics
which require protection. Any delineated wetlands in the project area would be fenced and
signed for protection from construction activity. Alternative 2 would have no dredge or fill
material below the ordinary high water mark of the reservoir, and is not expected to affect open
or other waters of the U.S. as defined by Section 404 of the CWA.
Construction associated with raising embankment dams and dikes could temporarily
disturb nesting birds in the project area. Certain species of migratory and resident birds have
commonly nested on structures and construction equipment on the Folsom Dam Modification
Project and are expected to continue this behavior on structures and equipment in Alternative 2.
Pre-emptive measures would be conducted by a qualified biologist to prevent birds from nesting
on construction equipment and the structures undergoing modification. Environmental
protection training would occur for all construction personnel regarding avian nests and
environmental protection.

The valley elderberry longhorn beetle (VELB) may be effected by incidental damage to
elderberry shrubs caused by construction personnel or equipment. Impacts may also occur if
elderberry shrubs need to be transplanted due to their location in areas that cannot be avoided by
construction activities—this could cause direct mortality of beetles and/or disruption of their life
cycle. Indirect effects from haul trucks driving in close proximity to elderberry shrubs and the
resultant vibration and dust could disturb the beetle. Long-term effects of the project may
include reduced viability of elderberry shrubs due to the placement of project area materials.
Temporal loss of habitat or species abundance may also occur due to transplantation of
elderberry shrubs. These direct and indirect effects would be considered potentially significant if
they cause adverse effects on elderberry shrubs and/or cause mortality or stress to VELB residing
in the shrubs. However, with the implementation of mitigation measures from the USFWS
“Conservation Guidelines for the Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle,” July 1999, in
combination with transplanting of shrubs, mitigation plantings, and the creation of habitat, these
impacts are not likely to adversely affect the valley elderberry longhorn beetle.
For the Folsom Dam Raise Project, the entire construction footprint of Dikes 1 through 8,
the LWD, RWD, and MIAD, along with the Emergency Spillway, were analyzed under the CAA
to determine the worst case scenario for air quality impacts. The analysis conducted determined
that the emissions associated with construction of this action would be above the de minimis
level – emission reductions were incorporated into the project analysis. Even with
implementation of mitigation measures, emissions would not be reduced below the USEPA’s
general conformity de minimis threshold. Compliance with the CAA would be accomplished
with the completion of a General Conformity Analysis, or with the inclusion in the State
Implementation Plan.
Overall, Alternative 2 is not expected to cause substantial loss, degradation, or
fragmentation of any natural communities or wildlife habitat when conducted with the specified
mitigations, and is expected to have a less-than-significant effect. The project area would be
returned to the pre-existing condition to the extent practicable at the completion of this project.
The implementation of Alternative 2 is not expected to conflict with local policies or ordinances
protecting biological resources because Sacramento County tree and USFWS recommended
habitat protections and prescriptions would be observed. There are no applicable Habitat
Conservation Plans (HCPs) or National Community Conservation Plans (NCCPs) in the project
area. The implementation of Alternative 2 is not expected to conflict with any other approved
local, regional, or state habitat conservation plan.
While there will be no changes in normal operations with the construction of the dam
raise, the raise would result in an ablity to sustain an increased flow of 160,000 cfs for a longer
period of time, and would have possible inundations up to 486.34’ (NAVD88). Any new
operations that the project would have as a result of the construction of the Dam Raise would be

dependent upon the updated WCM. As it stands, the proposed 3.5-foot raise is only an increase
in the surcharge zone, not the operational space, and would only have an effect in the events that
encroach in that surcharge zone.

ES.6 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, POLICIES, AND PLANS
This document would be adopted as a joint draft DSEIS/SEIR, and would fully comply
with the National Environmental Policy Act and California Environmental Quality Act
requirements. The project would comply with all Federal environmental laws and regulations, as
well as all state, regional, and local laws, regulations, and ordinances. In addition, the nonFederal sponsor would comply with all State and local laws and permit requirements.

ES.7 PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT
Two public scoping meetings for the Folsom Dam Raise Project were held on Wednesday,
February 19, 2014 at the Folsom Community Center and on Monday, February 24, 2014 at the
Sacramento Library Galleria. Mail and e-mail announcements were also sent to stakeholders and
other interested parties. In addition, a Notice of Intent was filed with the Federal Register on
February 6, 2014.

ES.8 ISSUES OF KNOWN CONTROVERSY
Some significant and controversial issues have been raised by agencies and the public
relating to the construction of the 3.5-foot dam raise, spillway modifications, and related
features. These issues are based on feedback gathered in preliminary studies from formal and
informal agency meetings, workshops, public meetings, telephone discourse, letters, and emails.


Preliminary air quality emission calculations indicate that all active construction
alternatives of the project would result in air emissions that could lead to violations of
applicable State ambient air quality standards and would not comply with the Federal
Clean Air Act (CAA). Concurrent construction activity within the Folsom Lake
region would contribute additional emissions that could cumulatively fail to meet the
general conformity rule of the CAA.



Construction is expected to increase noise levels, affecting local recreationists and
adjacent residents, even under circumstances of compliance with the City of Folsom
noise ordinances.



Degradation of public recreational experiences in and adjacent to the project – noise,
visual aesthetics, and access would be compromised during construction from 2017 to
2020.



Two homeowners and their homeowner’s association want the Dike 7 Office
Complex area fully restored as part of the proposed project, as described in the March
2016 Phase V SEA/EIR. Their concerns focus on the future conversion of a portion
of this area to a public trailhead. Conversion to a trailhead is not included in the
proposed project. Regardless of whether the area is restored, establishing a trailhead
here would be a State Parks project beyond the control of the Corps since the Corps
does not own the Dike 7 Office Complex property that is part of the Folsom Lake
State Recreation Area.

ES.9 UNRESOLVED ISSUES
There are no unresolved environmental issues at this time.

ES.10 PREFERRED PLAN
Alternative 2, Spillway Tainter Gate Modification and Combination Earthen
Raise/Concrete Floodwall, has been identified as the preferred plan. This alternative would
include additional strengthening features to the existing spillway tainter gates with a new “top
seal” bulkhead that would prevent overtopping of the spillway gates, a 3.5-foot earthen raise on
the dikes and dam, as well as construction of a reinforced 3.5-foot concrete flood wall.
Alternative 1 was not selected because it was not considered to be in the best interest of public
safety – it did not provide for increased flood protection or allow for an increase in Folsom Dam
safety measures. Alternative 2 is expected to provide continuous flood-risk management
benefits to the Sacramento metropolitan area and provide flood damage reduction while safely
passing the PMF flow without overtopping the spillway gates.

CHAPTER 1.0 - INTRODUCTION
This document is a joint draft supplemental environmental impact
statement/environmental impact report (DSEIS/SEIR) prepared by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (Corps), Sacramento District as the Federal Lead Agency under the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the State of California Central Valley Flood Protection
Board (CVFPB) as the State Lead Agency under the California Environmental Quality act
(CEQA). The Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency (SAFCA) is the local sponsor.
This DSEIS/SEIR is a supplement to the 2007 Final EIS/EIR for the Folsom Dam Safety
and Flood Damage Reduction Project (FEIS/EIR) prepared by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.
This DSEIS/SEIR has been prepared to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the
alternatives proposed in the Folsom Dam Raise Project. This document evaluates project
alternatives and includes mitigation measures to reduce, minimize, or avoid, where feasible, any
significant and potentially significant adverse impacts.

1.1 Authorization
There are several authorizations that have led to this supplemental DSEIS/SEIR. They
include:


Section 209 of the Flood Control Act of 1962 (Pub. L. No. 87-875, § 209, 76 Stat. 1180,
1196-98 (1962)), authorizes studies for flood control in northern California. This is the
basic authority for the Corps to study water resource related issues for the American and
Sacramento Rivers.



1996 Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) (Pub. L. No. 104-303, § 101(a)(1),
110 Stat. 3658, 3662-3663 (1996)): Congress authorizes levee improvement features
common to all three plans in the 1996 American River Watershed Project, California,
Supplemental Information Report (1996 SIR). The 1996 SIR described multiple
alternative plans, of which certain levee and other flood system improvements were
"common" to all alternatives: “Common Features.”



1999 WRDA, Section 101(a) (6) (Pub. L. 106-53, § 101, 113 Stat. 274 (1999)) authorizes
the Folsom Modification Project (modified river outlets), as identified in the 1996 SIR.



2004 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act (EWDAA), Section 128 ((Pub.
L. No. 108-137, § 128, 117 Stat. 1838, (2003)) authorizes a 7-foot raise of Folsom Dam
(including replacement of 8 spillway tainter gates), based on the recommendations

10

contained in the November 2002 Chief of Engineers Report in the Corp’s 2002 Long
Term Study Final Supplemental Plan Formulation Report.


2006 EWDAA, Section 128, (Pub. L. No. 109-103, §128, 119 Stat. 2259-2260 (2006))
The Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Interior are directed to collaborate on
authorized activities to maximize flood damage reduction improvements and address dam
safety needs at Folsom Dam and Reservoir, California. The Secretaries shall expedite
technical reviews for flood damage reduction and dam safety improvements. In
developing improvements under this section, the Secretaries shall consider reasonable
modifications to existing authorized activities. The Secretaries are authorized to expend
funds for coordinated technical reviews, joint planning, and preliminary design activities.



WRDA 2007, Section 3029 (b) (Pub. L. No. 110-114, §3029, 121 Stat. 1112 (2007)):
Based on recommendations from the 2007 Post Authorization Change Report (PACR),
the Folsom Dam Raise and Folsom Modification Projects were revised to include the
Joint Federal Project (JFP) auxiliary spillway. It is a 3.5-foot dam raise, including
reservoir dikes, replacing 3 emergency spillway tainter gates, and 3 ecosystem restoration
projects.

1.2 Project Location and Study Area
The project is located in the area surrounding Folsom Lake that falls within Placer, El
Dorado, and Sacramento Counties (Figure 1). The Folsom Dam and Reservoir (“Folsom Lake”)
are located downstream from the confluence of the north and south forks of the American River.
The area mainly consists of Federally-owned lands that are leased to and managed by the
California Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR). The study area is contained around
Folsom Lake, at Dikes 1 through 8, the Left Wing Dam (LWD), Right Wing Dam (RWD),
Mormon Island Auxiliary Dam (MIAD), and at the main dam and spillway (Appendix A).

11

Figure 1. Project Area Map.

1.3 Background
Folsom Dam and Reservoir is located on the main stem of the American River
approximately 29 miles upstream from the City of Sacramento. It is a multipurpose dam owned
and operated by the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) as part of the Central Valley Project
(CVP). The Corps prescribes storage requirements for flood risk management purposes at the
dam. Folsom Lake is a multiuse facility authorized for flood risk management, fish & wildlife,
water quality, water supply, hydroelectricity, recreation, and navigation. However, it is primarily
operated to maximize flood risk management and water supply benefits.
The Folsom Dam and Appurtenant Facilities consists of four (4) dams (Main Concrete
Dam, MIAD, RWD, LWD), and 8 dikes (Dikes 1-8), which impound flows on the American
River, forming Folsom Lake (Figure 2). Folsom Lake has a capacity of 977,000 acre-feet with a
surface area of 11,450 acres. The maximum sustained flood control release that can currently be
safely conveyed by the downstream channel is 115,000 cubic feet per second (cfs), however, the
proposed project is being designed with the assumption that, with the construction of the
American River Watershed Common Features GRR, the downstream levees have been improved
to safely convey as much as 160,000 cfs.
12

Figure 2. Folsom Lake and the Location of the Structural Aspects of the Folsom Dam.

Folsom Dam was originally authorized in 1944 for flood control, but was reauthorized in
1949 as a multi-purpose facility. The Corps constructed Folsom Dam and transferred it to the
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) for coordinated operation as an integral part of the Central
Valley Project (CVP). Construction of the dam began in October 1948 and was completed in
May 1956. Water was first stored in February 1955. In the Energy and Water Development
Appropriations Act (EWDAA) of 2004, Congress authorized a plan to raise Folsom Dam; the
Folsom Dam Raise Project, including raising Folsom Dam by 7 feet, modifies the spillway,
constructs a bridge downstream from Folsom Dam, and modifies the emergency release
operations to permit surcharge. This would provide flood benefits while also resolving certain
dam safety issues associated with passing the probable maximum flood (PMF). The Folsom
Dam Raise project and the Folsom Modifications Project were reevaluated together in the PACR
for the American River Watershed Project, dated March 2007. This report resulted in the
13

recommendation of a JFP auxiliary spillway at Folsom Dam (to be constructed jointly with
USBR), a 3.5-foot dam raise (including emergency spillway gates, the reservoir dikes, and three
ecosystem restoration projects). This automates/reconfigures the temperature control shutters at
Folsom Dam and restores the Bushy and Woodlake sites downstream. Under the original
authorized plan, the main concrete dam, the RWD and LWD, MIAD, and Dikes 1 through 8
would be raised 7 feet, adding approximately 93,000 acre-feet of flood storage capacity to the
reservoir. In addition, the five main dam service tainter gates and the three main dam emergency
tainter gates would be replaced.
Since the work authorization of emergency spillway gates in the 2007 PACR,
Reclamation has completed structural improvements to the existing service and emergency
tainter gates, as well as the spillway piers in 2011. In light of these improvements, emergency
gate refinements have been developed in lieu of complete gate replacements. As a result, in
2013, an Engineering Documentation Report (EDR) was developed to support a variation to the
emergency spillway gate replacement concept.
Additionally, a series of Design Documentation Reports (DDRs) are being developed to
determine the designs for increasing the height of Folsom dikes and dams by 3.5 feet. It is
anticipated the DDRs for all of the engineering designs would be completed by 2018. The 3.5foot raise was not fully designed in the 2007 PACR, nor was a full environmental analysis
completed in the associated 2007 Folsom Dam Safety/Flood Damage Reduction EIS/EIR
(Folsom DS/FDR EIS/EIR). Therefore, additional design documentation was determined to be
necessary and this supplemental Dam Raise EIS/EIR is being prepared to fully disclose revised
project alternatives and updated project-related effects.
The primary objectives of the Folsom Dam Raise Project are (1) flood risk management,
(2) ecosystem restoration, and (3) construction of a permanent bridge downstream of Folsom
Dam, which was completed in 2009. The Dam Raise project has been prioritized with the first
phase on the main dam tainter gates portion of the 3.5-foot raise. The beginning of construction
is estimated to be concurrent with the Joint Federal Project, which includes construction of an
auxiliary spillway consisting of an approach channel, a six tainter gate control structure, and a
chute and stilling basin scheduled to be completed in 2017. Design on the remaining phases
(ecosystem restoration) would begin after construction of the dam raise features. If necessary, a
supplemental NEPA/CEQA document would be prepared for the ecosystem restoration.

14

1.4 Project Purpose and Need for Action
Purpose
The purpose of the Folsom Dam Raise project is to provide flood risk management
benefits to the Sacramento area. The authorized top of flood pool would remain at reservoir
water surface elevation 468.34 feet NAVD 88. Affixing top seal bulkheads over the emergency
gates would allow higher flood pools across the spillway, adding flood damage reduction
benefits while still safely passing the PMF without overtopping the tainter gates. With added
operational flexibility and enhanced management of the enlarged flood storage capacity (in the
form of surcharge), flood damage benefits are realized with delayed operation for the emergency
gates and prolonged outflows at or below the 160,000 cfs threshold for more infrequent events
up to a 1/240 year event (the authorized objective).
There would be no changes in normal operations with the construction of the dam raise;
however, the raise would result in an ablity to sustain an increased flow of 160,000 cfs for an
extended period (as defined by the Emergency Spillway Release Diagram in the Water Control
Manual), and could have possible inundations up to 486.34’ (NAVD88). The dam raise project
could eventually offer increased operational flexibility given the greater surcharge zone and
ability to delay operation for the emergency gates and prolonged outflows at or below the
160,000 cfs threshold; however any new operations that might occur as a result of the Dam Raise
would be dependent upon the updated WCM, as based on the Folsom JFP.
The 2006 EWDAA authorized activities to maximize flood damage reduction
improvements and address dam safety needs at Folsom Dam. At this time, ongoing construction
work, such as the Folsom Dam Modification Project Approach Channel, and updates to the
Folsom WCM may allow Folsom Dam to safely pass the PMF without further improvements,
including the Folsom Dam Raise and Emergency Spillway Gate Modifications. An economic
update would be conducted to confirm the flood risk management benefits of the Dam Raise and
related construction activities. As the WCM update is finalized, it would be determined whether
additional dam safety measures are required to pass the PMF that could be addressed by the Dam
Raise component.

Need
Sacramento is identified as one of the most at-risk communities in the nation for
flooding. Therefore, there is a need to reduce this risk through numerous flood damage
reduction measures. The existing system leaves the highly urbanized Sacramento area at an
unacceptably high level of flood risk.

15

The initial need for increased flood protection in Sacramento was realized when major
storms in northern California in 1986, and again in 1997, caused record flood flows in the
American River watershed. Outflows from Folsom Dam, together with high flows in the
Sacramento River, caused the river stages to exceed the designed safety margin of levees
protecting the City of Sacramento. If these storms had lasted much longer, major sections of the
levee would likely have failed, causing probable loss of human life and billions of dollars in
damages.
The effects of the 1986 and 1997 storms raised concerns over the adequacy of the
existing flood risk management system. This led to a series of investigations on the need to
provide additional protection for the Sacramento metropolitan area. The results of these
investigations led to authorization of several flood risk management projects in the American
River watershed, including the Folsom Dam Raise Project.
With the construction of the Joint Federal Project, the current storage capacity of the
reservoir does allow for passing the PMF. However, the current crest elevation of the reservoir
dikes and embankment dams would not provide sufficient freeboard to meet design criteria for
resisting wave height and wave runup1. A large enough flood event could cause the current
dikes and/or embankment dams to sustain enough damage as to cause failure or overtop.

1.5 Purpose of the DSEIS/SEIR
Construction of the Folsom Dam Raise Project is considered to be a major Federal and
State project subject to compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), respectively. Because the proposed action has
the potential to significantly affect the quality of the human environment, the Corps and the
Central Valley Flood Protection Board (CVFPB) through the California Department of Water
Resources (DWR) have prepared this joint Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact
Statement/Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (DSEIS/SEIR) to satisfy the
environmental evaluation and review requirements of these two laws.
This DSEIS/SEIR (1) describes the development and features of the alternatives; (2
discusses the environmental resources in the local and regional project areas; (3) evaluates the
direct, indirect, and cumulative effects and significance of the alternatives on these resources;
and (4) proposes best management practices and mitigation measures to avoid or reduce any
effects to less than significant, when possible. The type and extent of any effects that cannot be
reduced to less than significant are identified so that decision-makers can consider the trade-offs
of implementing the proposed action.
1

Wave runup is the maximum vertical extent of wave uprush on a beach or structure above the still water level.

16

1.5.1 National Environmental Policy Act
NEPA provides an interdisciplinary framework for Federal agencies to develop
information that would help them to take environmental factors into account in their decisionmaking (42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq. and 40 C.F.R. § 1500.1 et seq.) To comply with NEPA, an EIS
is required whenever a proposed major Federal action may result in significant effects on the
quality of the natural and human environment (42 U.S.C. § 4332[2] [C]; 40 C.F.R. § 1508.18[a]).
Additionally, in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 1502.9[i] [ii], the Federal agency shall prepare a
supplemental to either draft or final EIS documents when relevant, substantial changes in the
proposed action occur or significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental
concerns are realized.

1.5.2 California Environmental Quality Act
According to the State CEQA Guidelines (14 CCR Section 15064[f] [1]), preparation of
an EIR is required whenever a project may result in a significant environmental impact. An EIR
is an information document used to inform public agency decision makers and the general public
of the significant environmental effects of a project; identify possible ways to mitigate, reduce,
or avoid the significant effects; and describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the project that
can feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project while substantially lessening or
avoiding any of the significant environmental impacts. Public agencies are required to consider
the information presented in the EIR when determining whether to approve a project. The Corps
and the CVFPB intend to use this DSEIS/SEIR in their decision making (per 15124(d)(1)(A).
CEQA requires that state and local government agencies consider the environmental
effects of projects of which they have discretionary authority before taking action on those
projects (California Public Resources Code [PRC] Section 21000 et seq.) CEQA also requires
that each public agency avoid or reduce to less-than-significant levels, whenever feasible, the
significant environmental effects of the project it approves or implements. If a project would
result in significant environmental impacts that cannot be feasibly mitigated to less-thansignificant levels, the project can still be approved but the lead agency’s decision makers must
issue a “statement of overriding considerations” explaining, in writing, the specific economic,
social, and/or other considerations that they believe, based upon substantial evidence, make
significant and unavoidable effects acceptable.
Permits and approvals required to implement to project can be found in Chapter 5.0 of
this document, a long with consultation requirements required by federal, state, or local laws,
regulations or policies.

1.6 Related Documents and Resources Relied on in Preparation of the DSEIS/SEIR
In 2002, the Corps, along with the CVFPB and SAFCA, completed the American River
Watershed Long-Term Study Final Supplemental Plan Formulation Report EIS/EIR (LTS
EIS/EIR), which analyzed the environmental impacts of a 7-foot dam raise. There was no
Record of Decision (ROD) for this analysis. In 2007, the Folsom Dam Raise was reevaluated in
the PACR and the associated Folsom Dam Safety/Flood Damage ReductionEIS/EIR, which
recommended the replacement of the three emergency spillway gates and a 3.5-foot raise, as well
as various other Folsom projects.
Although the environmental analysis of the Folsom Dam Raise is generally covered in
the Folsom DS/FDR EIS/EIR, it is not fully designed and a complete environmental analysis was
not completed. Additionally, the project was not covered by the 2007 ROD. The PACR states
“It is important to note that the effects associated with the authorized Corps projects (Folsom
Modification and Folsom Dam Raise projects) are the impacts identified in the original
environmental documents for those projects, and impacts are not updated to a current
assessment.” Therefore, the majority of the Dam Raise analysis in the Folsom Dam Safety/Flood
Damage Reduction EIS/EIR is based on the 2002 LTS EIS/EIR and the description, evaluation,
and analysis are outdated and incomplete. This supplemental Dam Raise EIS/EIR is being
prepared to fully disclose revised project alternatives and updated project-related effects.

1.7 Significant Issues
Significant issues identified as areas of controversy by agencies and the public related to
construction of the 3.5-foot dam raise, the spillway gate modifications, and related features are
summarized below. These issues were based on preliminary studies and comments from formal
and informal agency meetings, workshops, public meetings, telephone discourse, letters, and
emails.


Preliminary air quality emission calculations indicate that all active construction
alternatives of the project would result in air emissions that could lead to violations of
applicable State ambient air quality standards and would not comply with the Federal
Clean Air Act (CAA). Concurrent construction activity within the Folsom Lake region
would contribute additional emissions that could cumulatively fail to meet the general
conformity rule of the CAA.



Potential issues were identified with temporary turbidity, mobilization of existing
sediment contaminants and reintroduction into the water column, and contaminants from
constructions materials.

18



Construction is expected to increase noise levels, affecting local recreationists and
adjacent residents, even under circumstances of compliance with the City of Folsom
noise ordinances.



Degradation of recreational experience in and adjacent to the project area. Noise, visual
aesthetics, and access would be compromised during construction years 2017 to 2020.

1.8 Application of NEPA and CEQA Principles and Terminology
NEPA and CEQA are similar in that both laws require the preparation of an
environmental study to evaluate the environmental effects of proposed activities. However, there
are several differences between the two regarding terminology, procedures, content of
documents, and substantive mandates to protect the environment. NEPA language is primarily
used in this document but can be interchanged with CEQA language. In some case in this
document, both NEPA and CEQA terminology are used, as in Chapter one where the project
purpose, need, and project objectives are discussed.

1.9 Organization of the DSEIS/SEIR
The content and format of this DSEIS/SEIR is designed to meet the requirements of
NEPA as set forth by the CEQ and the Corps’ NEPA policy and guidance, and by the CEQA and
the State CEQA Guidelines. The DSEIS/SEIR is organized as follows:


The Executive Summary abridges the purpose and intended uses of the DSEIS/SEIR,
lead agencies, project location, project background and phasing, need for action, and
project purpose/objectives. It presents an overview of the proposed alternatives under
consideration, as well as the major conclusions of the environmental analysis while
documenting the known areas of controversy and issues to be resolved. It ends with a
summary table that lists the environmental impacts, mitigation measures, and significance
determination for the alternatives under consideration.



Chapter 1 explains the NEPA and CEQA processes; lists the lead, cooperating, and
responsible agencies that may have discretionary authority over the project, including
non-Federal Partners; specifies the underlying project purpose/objectives and need for
action that the lead agencies are responding to in considering the proposed project and
project alternatives; and outlines the organization of the document; .



Chapter 2 presents the proposed alternatives under consideration. This chapter constitutes
the project description and describes the components for each action alternative as well as
19

the No Action Alternative. This chapter also describes alternatives considered but
eliminated from further consideration and provides a summary matrix that compares the
environmental consequences of the alternatives under consideration.


Chapter 3 describes the baseline or existing environmental and regulatory conditions. It
provides an analysis of the impacts of each alternative under consideration, and identifies
mitigation measures that would avoid/reduce/eliminate significant impacts to less-thansignificant levels, where feasible. In addition, compensation is discussed for significant,
adverse effects that cannot be reduced to a less than significant level.



Chapter 4 describes the cumulative impacts of the project when combined with other
past, presents, and reasonably foreseeable future projects within the study area. In
addition, it analyzes the growth-inducing impacts of the proposed action. The remainder
of the chapter includes the requirements of NEPA and CEQA that are not addressed
elsewhere in this DSEIS/SEIR such as the relationship between short-term uses of the
environment and long-term productivity, significant and unavoidable environmental
impacts, and irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources.



Chapter 5 summarizes Federal and State laws and regulations that apply to the project
and describes the project’s compliance with them, and also summarizes required permits,
approvals, and authorizations



Chapter 6 summarizes public involvement activities under NEPA and CEQA; Native
American consultation; and coordination with other Federal, state, regional, and local
agencies. A list of organizations and individuals receiving a copy and/or notice of this
DSEIS/SEIR is also included.

CHAPTER 2.0 - ALTERNATIVES

2.1 Introduction
The Folsom Dam Raise Project plan formulation process is discussed in Chapter 4.0 of
the 2002 Long Term Study, Plan Formulation and Screening of the Flood Damage Reduction
Measures, in Chapter 5.0 of the Flood Control Alternatives, and in Chapter 6.0 of the Ecosystem
Restoration for Flood Plain and Fisheries Resources.

2.1.1 Alternative Formulation and Screening
American River Watershed Long-Term Study, 2002
The purpose of the Long-Term Study is to address the residual flood risk remaining
once the Folsom Modifications project is completed. The Long-Term Study
evaluated an array of flood risk management (FRM) alternatives that included dam
raises ranging from 3.5 to 12 feet. The study determined that a 7.0-foot raise of
2

Folsom Dam that provided both additional FRM and dam safety would be the most
optimal economic solution, exclusive of the Detention Dam alternative.
Congress, through the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for Fiscal
Year 2004, authorized several project features which were recommended by the
Long-Term Study: raising Folsom Dam by 7 feet, modifying the L.L. Anderson
Dam spillway, constructing a permanent bridge downstream from Folsom Dam, and
modifying the emergency release operations to permit surcharge. At the time, this
project was estimated to reduce the risk of flooding to about a 1 in 175 chance.
Two project components of the 2002 Long-Term Study, the 3.5-foot dam raise and
the 7.0-foot dam raise, were also evaluated in the 2007 PACR, which is described
below.
American River Watershed PAC Report, 2007
The purpose of the 2007 PACR is to document changes to two authorized projects: the
Folsom Modifications Project and the Folsom Dam Raise Project. Both projects share
an objective of improving flood risk management on the Lower American River,
primarily through structural modifications to the existing Folsom Dam. In the PAC
report, project elements from both the Folsom Modifications and the Long-Term
Study were considered not only for the purpose of flood risk management but also for
2

Dam safety in this instance refers to enabling the dam facility to pass one-hundred probable percent of the maximum flood, or PMF.

21

dam safety. During the design refinements for Folsom Modifications, it was believed
that due to significant increases in the cost estimates, the authorized project may not
be optimal or even economically feasible. During this preliminary analysis, it
appeared that adding operational gates to the proposed Bureau of Reclamation dam
safety auxiliary spillway would provide a more efficient way to meet two project
purposes. The Folsom Dam Joint Federal Project is intended to meet the goals of the
Corps of Engineers as well as the Bureau of Reclamation; its analysis became one of
the main focuses of the 2007 PACR which evaluated a final array of four action
alternatives shown in Table 1 below. Alternative C was the recommended plan and
included a six-submerged tainter gate auxiliary spillway, a 3.5-foot dam raise, and
three emergency spillway gate replacements.

Future Without Project Conditions
The future without project condition would be the most likely condition expected to exist
in the future without a proposed Federal water resources project. While all the alternatives
considered in this EIS/EIR must be compared to existing conditions, the future without project
condition constitutes the benchmark against which these alternatives must be compared for
Federal planning purposes. Other adopted plans in the planning area and local planning efforts
with high potential for implementation or adoption shall be considered as part of the forecasted
without project condition.
Under the future without project condition, neither the modifications to the spillway gates
nor the 3.5-foot dam raise would be implemented, nor would the associated improved flood risk
management benefits occur.
Under the future without project condition, significant loss of life is expected with a great
enough flood event, or PMF, as well as injuries, illnesses, and the release of hazardous and toxic
contaminants to the downstream floodplain. Post-flood debris clean-up, repairs, and recovery
22

could be a major undertaking. Additionally, infrastructure, such as transportation corridors and
power and water supplies, would be incapacitated. The economic impact of the restricted
movement of people and goods across the region, the emergency costs associated with
evacuation, and all the emergency services associated with such an event, would be huge.
The following general assumptions have been made in regard to the future without
project condition for this study:


In 2017, the Folsom Joint Federal Project (JFP) auxiliary spillway at Folsom Dam would
be completed and a new water control manual would be adopted (Folsom Dam
Modifications). This includes a 400,000 acre-feet to 600,000 acre-feet (400/600) variable
flood space operation that takes incidental storage space in upstream reservoirs into
consideration when determining flood storage requirements at Folsom Dam during the
flood season. The JFP would allow dam operators to release larger quantities of water at
lower reservoir stages and more efficiently utilize flood space in the reservoir. Operation
of the JFP is to some degree dependent on the American River levees downstream of the
dam being able to safely pass the objective release of 160,000 cfs. At the time of the
Folsom PAC report in 2007, assumptions were made based on the available information
that the downstream improvements authorized by WRDA 1996 and 1999 would be in
place and allow for the safe passage of the objective releases identified in the Folsom
PAC report. However, as noted in the Folsom PACR, an erosion study of the
downstream channel was needed to provide more information on this subject. Results of
this erosion study identified the need for additional erosion protection. Therefore,
erosion protection to these levees would enable more optimal operation of the JFP.



The levee modifications recommended in the 2010 Natomas PAC Report and authorized
by WRRDA 2014 (Pub. L. No 113-121) are assumed to be in place, which improve the
levees surrounding the Natomas Basin but do not include levee raises to address higher
volume, low frequency flows.



The elements of the American River Common Features project as authorized by WRDA
1996 and WRDA 1999 are assumed to be in place. These features addressed the levee
seepage and stability concerns along the American River but do not address the erosion
risk.

2.1.2 Measures and Alternatives Considered but Eliminated
Some measures originally identified that could contribute to addressing the Folsom dam
raise were reviewed and dropped from further consideration. These measures, which are
23

described in the subsections below, include a skin plate extension, a horizontal top seal in order
to refine the tainter gates, an earthen raise of the dam and dikes, dredging to lower the reservoir
bottom, a Concrete Masonry Unit (CMU), or a Mechanically-Stabilized Earthen (MSE) cap to
raise the dam. Variants of tainter gate refinement and the 3.5-foot dam raise alternative remains
the common element between all alternatives and are the primary focus of the remaining
alternatives detailed in Sections 2.1.2.1 through 2.1.2.10 below.

2.1.2.1 Reduce the Stop Log Fabrication and Installation from Two Sets to Zero New Sets;
Utilize Existing Set
The Folsom Dam tainter gate upgrade includes the fabrication of two new sets of stop
logs in order to complete construction within one year, a relatively short construction window.
There already exists a set of stop logs which meet the height requirements. However, with the
JFP auxiliary spillway expecting completion in 2017, there is a 3 year window for the Folsom
Dam tainter gate upgrades to be constructed. The Corps would reduce the quantity of acquired
stop log sets to zero and consequently extend the construction period to 3 years. This alternative
essentially recommends the re-use of existing stop logs to meet upgrade requirements.
The advantages to this alternative are:


Reduces risk of trying to complete all work within a one year construction window, the
failure of which would result in cost overruns and potential reduction in release capacity
during late calendar year conditions of rising pool elevation.



Shifting costs from additional and unnecessary sets of stop logs to that of an additional
two sets of mobilization and demobilization costs.



Space constraints on the site make completing multiple gates at once difficult, and the
proposed design would alleviate this issue by essentially extending the period of
performance.



“Re-using” the existing stop log sets eliminates arguably wasteful spending.

The disadvantages include:


Loss of flexibility of having two new sets of stop logs.



Increased mobilization costs.

24

The justification for this alternative is, although mobilization costs would approximately
triple, the reduction in project costs of a single, full set of stop logs is $2,876,309.57 each
compared to the complementary increase in mobilization/demobilization project costs of
$289,383.91. Incrementally, this proposal decreases end performance by 1/3 (3 sets reduced to
2) for each set of stop logs, and decreases costs by approximately 45%. In terms of incremental
performance, the third set of stop logs is not justified without additional inputs or performance
requirements that would place a higher value on the third set of stop logs over the first and
second ones.
Overall, this alternative was rejected as two gates would need to be non‐operational
during the raise of the gate hoists, gear assemblies, motors and gantry way. Construction would
move more efficiently if more than two gates are taken off line at a time; however, Bureau of
Reclamation (USBR) does not see this as an option and requires that no more than two gates be
offline at a time. Therefore, as USBR already has one set of stop logs; one additional set of new
stop logs would be needed for the project.

2.1.2.2 Tainter Gate Refinement: Replacement of Emergency Tainter Gates
As the current authorized alternative per the 2007 PACR, this alternative would include
the complete replacement of the existing three emergency spillway tainter gates (ESTGs) with
newly fabricated, larger tainter gates (64.16-ft high, 54.5-ft radius). Trunnions would be
elevated and relocated further downstream, requiring vertical and horizontal extension of
existing piers, supplemental rock-bolts, and trunnion anchorage requirements, as well as new,
elevated mechanical hoisting features and associated pier modifications. This alternative allows
for the emergency gates to remain closed until the pool elevation approaches the PMF pool. A 2foot partial gate opening would provide one foot of freeboard above PMF pool (483.34-ft NAVD
88).
This alternative was not carried forward for analysis, as the Alternative 2 (Section 2.3
below) was chosen based on achieving the same benefit as this alternative but with more
flexibility in operations for less cost. Additionally, the horizontal top seal portion of this
alternative raised significant concerns on ability to install, and it requires double the amount of
steel.

2.1.2.3 Refined Emergency Gate Replacement
This alternative would include the complete replacement of the existing three emergency
gates, with newly fabricated, larger tainter gates (58.84-ft high, 48.33-ft radius). This alternative
was developed based on hydraulic criteria that have been updated since the 2007 PACR. With
25

the top of gate at elevation 478.34, operational requirements would require the emergency gates
to open at a pool elevation of 476.34’. The gate geometry for this concept would not require
extensive pier modifications such as those required for the PACR replacement concept.
While maintaining the same gate sill location as the existing tainter gates, the slightly
longer gate radius moves the trunnion further downstream but within the footprint of the existing
pier geometry. This alternative would provide one foot of freeboard on the gates when the gates
are fully open with a PMF pool. This option would also require new mechanical hoisting
equipment to be elevated in order to keep motors above PMF elevation.
Similar to the alternative described above (2.1.2.2 Tainter Gate Refinement:
Replacement of Emergency Tainter Gates), this was not carried forward for analysis as the
Alternative 2 (Section 2.3 below) was chosen based on achieving the same benefit with more
flexibility in operations for less cost.

2.1.2.4 Tainter Gate Refinement: Horizontal Top Seal
The Horizontal Top Seal refinement option is characterized by the main bulkhead, which
spans horizontally across the emergency spillway bays. With the upper bulkhead and lower
bulkhead, the “Horizontal Top Seal” would hold back water when pool elevation exceeds the top
of the emergency tainter gate.
The upper bulkhead would be comprised of I-beams while hangers would bear on the
spillway bridge parapet and would be welded to the top of the upper bulkhead. The upper
bulkhead would also rest on the stop log guide extension. The upper bulkhead would have
clearance with the stop log extension, and thus would not restrain cross canyon movement of the
piers. The upper bulkheads would seal against the stop log guide extension and the main
bulkhead with J-bulb plastic seals. An elliptical skin plate extension would be connected to the
bottom of the upper bulkhead to promote better hydraulic flow characteristics. The bolted
connection would allow the skin plate extension to be added after both the main bulkhead and
the upper bulkhead are in place. The exact shape of the skin plate extension would be
determined by physical modeling by hydraulic engineers.
The lower bulkhead would be comprised of seal-welded, wide-flange I-beams. It would
span across the spillway bay and be supported on top of the piers. Steel angles anchored on the
pier faces would also support this feature. At the pier support, a low friction bearing pad would
be installed to allow the lower bulkhead to move freely in the cross canyon direction. The lower
bulkhead would have two hoist openings to allow for passage of the gate hoist chains. At each
opening, a rubber seal would be installed to minimize leakage.
26

The horizontal top seal would address the emergency gates’ hydraulic deficiency by
allowing the gates to remain closed with pool elevation above the top of gate leaf. As for
modifications needed to address the structural deficiency, the same gate modification for the
Vertical Top Seal design would apply since the existing emergency tainter gates were reused for
both design refinements.
This alternative was rejected for several reasons, including:


With possible controlled leakage through the horizontal top seal bulkhead, the hoist
motor may need to be elevated to maintain dry operation.



The geometry and location of the Horizontal Top Seal made this refinement option more
complex and difficult to design. All the bulkheads can be shop fabricated, but their large
size can complicate installation.



The larger main bulkhead in the Horizontal Top Seal concept would likely be more
difficult to install than the vertical bulkhead of the Vertical Top Seal concept. The
Horizontal Top Seal refinement would have the same constructability challenge at the
downstream pier nose due to limited work space.

2.1.2.5 Tainter Gate Refinement: Skin Plate Extension
This concept considered extending the skin plate to a height that met the new freeboard
elevation. To accomplish this, the skin plate would have to extend on a tangent path
approximately 24-feet long. This would require at least one additional rib support girder, an
additional gate strut arm, and a completely redesigned/replaced trunnion assembly.
The heightened skin plate and added members would increase the gate weight, requiring
larger hoists. Further, tainter gate side seals typically seal against an embedded seal plate, in
which the seal rubs along the arc of the gate as it is opened. The tangent section would not
follow this arc and introduce transverse friction loads which side seals would not easily resist.
The excessive wear induced on seals from transverse friction would also increase maintenance
requirements. Pier modifications would likely be necessary to add extensive side seal plate
embedment. These modifications were deemed excessive and, more significantly, transverse
seal loading is not recommended or practiced in tainter gate designs.

2.1.2.6 Dredging
Dredging as a viable solution was initially analyzed and screened out in the LTS
27

EIS/EIR. The geology of Folsom Reservoir is rocky hills with a very thin (3-4 foot) soil veneer.
The only major quantities of removable soil are found in the American River streambed, which is
underwater most of the time. Thus, the removal would require soil and rock dredging which is
expensive, and an environmentally and culturally damaging process. Because of its very high
cost, this measure was not considered further and would not be considered in the current
EIS/EIR. The environmental effect of disposal is also very high due to potential mercury content
and would further increase the cost.

2.1.2.7 The 3.5-Foot Dam Raise: Concrete Floodwall
The 3.5-foot dam raise alternative would consist of a cast-in-place, reinforced concrete
wall located near the reservoir side of the crest of each of the dikes, the left and right wing dams,
and MIAD. The existing access ramps crossing the dikes would be raised 3.5 feet to match the
new concrete crest wall height. The 2007 PACR, with supporting engineering documentation
report (EDR), authorized this alternative to raise these features by means of a concrete “crestwall” (otherwise referred to as floodwall or parapet wall). This floodwall would be installed on
the lakeside edge of the crest.
This alternative was not carried forward because of the potential recreation and
environmental effects based on feedback from the public and environmental team. Additionally,
the main engineering rationale supporting the embankment design was the geotechnical
preference for similar and consistent materials. The concrete wall has more susceptibility to
seepage paths at concrete-soil interfaces.

2.1.2.8 The 3.5-Foot Dam Raise: Earthen Raise
This concept would raise all of the dams and dikes 3.5 feet through placement of fill
derived from the auxiliary spillway excavation and/or from other borrow sources. It was rejected
for the left and right wing dams due to space constraints associated with steeper embankment
slopes compared to other reservoir dikes. There is inadequate space, particularly at the wing
dam toes, at which an earthen fill would widen and conflict with existing project features and
access.

2.1.2.9 The 3.5-Foot Dam Raise: Concrete Masonry Unit (CMU)
This alternative was rejected because reinforced CMU tend to crack more readily during
earthquakes and other heavy movements. Additionally, CMU is not as effective at preventing

28

water from seeping through and entering the landside. Reinforced concrete walls and/or an
earthen raise in general would last longer than reinforced a CMU wall.

2.1.2.10 3.5-Foot Dam Raise: Mechanically-Stabilized Earthen (MSE) Cap
This alternative was not deemed feasible for several reasons. The primary concern is that
the stress-strain differential between the anchors and soil material would cause a seepage path
through the MSE wall. Further, the use of MSE for such a small height is not common and may
further pose constructability challenges on the steep sloped, wing dam embankments. Another
concern with the MSE concept is the vertical drop off on both upstream and downstream sides,
which creates a safety risk or else requires additional guardrail features. Vertical alignment
transitions would also be challenging at each end of the wing dams due to footprint limitations.
The transitions would likely need a partial, water-stopped concrete flood wall tie-in to the MSE.

2.2 Alternative 1: No Action Alternative
A No Action Alternative is required pursuant to NEPA, and a No Project Alternative is
required for CEQA (for consistency, in this DSEIS/SEIR, it is referred to as the No Action
Alternative). The No Action Alternative constitutes the future without project conditions that
would reasonably be expected in the absence of the proposed action and serves as the
environmental baseline, per NEPA, against which the effects and benefits of the action
alternatives are evaluated. The environmental baseline for CEQA is assumed to be the existing
conditions.
Under the No Action Alternative, the Federal government would not implement the
emergency spillway gate modifications or the 3.5-foot raise, and the associated improved flood
risk management benefits would not occur, as also described in the Future Without Project
Conditions. Since no other projects are currently planned that are similar or equivalent to the
emergency spillway gate modifications or the 3.5-foot raise, it would be speculative to assume
that any work would occur absent the Corps project.
Under the No Action Alternative, significant loss of life is expected with a great enough
flood event or PMF, as well as injuries, illnesses, and the release of hazardous and toxic
contaminants to the downstream floodplain. The urban areas downstream of Folsom Dam would
continue to be at risk of flooding, and lives would continue to be threatened. The gates and dam
would be at risk for failure, threatening the levee system downstream with a surge of flow
beyond the current 160,000 cfs levee capacity. If a dam or gate failure were to occur, the chance
of levee failure downstream would increase. If a levee failure were to occur, major government
facilities and transportation corridors would be impacted until flood waters recede. A temporary
29

shut down or slowing of State and Local government functions would occur, and workers would
be unable to perform their duties until the buildings are restored and can once again be occupied.

2.3 Alternative 2: Spillway Tainter Gate Modification and Combination Earthen
Raise/Concrete Floodwall
Proposed construction elements for Alternative 2 are discussed below in detail, beginning
with the design elements of the tainter gates, followed by the design elements of the 3.5-foot dam
raise. While modification to all 8 gates (3 ESTGs and 5 service spillway tainter gates (SSTG)
are analyzed in this document, the modification of the gates would be phased. Currently, the top
seal would only be constructed on the emergency gates, while the modifications to the service
spillway tainter gates would occur at a later date.
The 3.5-foot dam raise is currently at a lesser level of general design development and
analysis than the Spillway Modification (tainter gates). Because of this, the descriptions of the
dam raise alternatives would be briefer than the descriptions of the tainter gate alternatives. It is
likely that supplemental design and environmental documentation would be required for the dam
raise prior to construction.
Operation and Maintenance requirements of the proposed alternatives would not initially
change with Alternative 2. However, the raise would result in an ablity to sustain an increased
flow of 160,000 cfs for a longer period of time, and would have possible inundations up to
486.34’ (NAVD88). Any post-construction operational changes would be defined in a Water
Control Manual update and accompanying environmental documentation.
2.3.1 Tainter Gate Design Elements
The 2013 Engineering Documentation Report (EDR) identified refinements to the
existing tainter gates in lieu of the complete gate replacement originally proposed in the 2007
PACR. Refinements include additional strengthening features to the existing tainter gates and a
new “top seal” bulkhead that would prevent overtopping of the spillway gates during a major
flood event. Design elements of the tainter gates include:


Top Seal Bulkhead: The top seal bulkhead is a hydraulic structure that would be
mounted above the spillway tainter gates in order to prevent overtopping during a major
flood event.



Tainter Gate Retrofit: Reclamation’s seismic retrofit of the tainter gates did not account
for some of the loading conditions imposed by Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) design
30

load case. As such, some additional retrofit elements are necessary to address this (skin
plate ribs, lower girder, and trunnion anchorage).


Pier Height Extension: A vertical concrete extension to the top of the pier would
provide the necessary elevated platform for the new hoist system. The top seal bulkheads
for the emergency spillway tainter gates would mount to and seal against the pier
extension. When the gates are in the closed position, the concrete extension would also
serve as the water barrier between top seal bulkheads when the reservoir reaches
elevations above 468.34’ NAVD88.



New Hoist System: A new hoist system would be installed to handle increased
hydrostatic PMF loads, as well as slightly heavier gates from additional retrofit
requirements. The new hoist system would also incorporate a new cable.

In light of the Bureau of Reclamation’s structural improvements to the tainter gates in
2011, this option would make use of these existing strengthened gates and incorporates a “top
seal” feature that increases the height in which the emergency spillway bays can hold back a
flood pool before requiring gate opening (EL. 483.34’). This alternative would provide top seals
on all 8 gates (3 ESTGs and 5 service spillway tainter gates (SSTG). It would include bulkhead
elements that are mounted vertically above the existing tainter gates and span between the
emergency spillway piers.
The emergency gate top seal bulkhead would extend from the top of the emergency
tainter gate at the closed position, to elevation 486.34 (NAVD 88), while the service gate top seal
bulkhead would extend from the top of the service gate at the closed position, to elevation
486.34. This is the elevation of the PMF pool at elevation 483.34, with an additional 3 feet of
freeboard.
The top seal bulkhead consists of welded, built-up plate sections. There is a skin plate on
the upstream face, and downstream there would be welded, built-up T-sections consisting of a
web and flange plate which span continuously across the spillway bays. Between every Tsection along the elevation, there would be an intermediate web plate that is half the depth of the
T-section and welded continuously along the span of the skin plate. The purpose of this
configuration is to create an open cell structure and to reduce weight by removing the flange
plate on alternating built-up sections. The top seal bulkheads would be supported by, and bear
on, parallel steel angles which would be attached to each pier face with 1- ¼” epoxy anchors and
shear lugs in the existing pier concrete, and with 1-¼” F1554 cast-in-place anchors in the new
pier concrete. The anchors and shear lugs are designed to transfer the hydrostatic and dead loads
to the piers. The dead weight would be supported by a built-up plate section which is welded to
the top seal bulkhead, and bears on cantilevered wide flanges that are anchored to each face of
31

the pier. The top seal bulkhead would not be restrained in the cross canyon direction, and
therefore would not restrain pier movement during normal loading or seismic conditions. It
would be sealed along the top of the tainter gate using a J-Bulb rubber seal with a 3/8” gap. This
is to ensure that during normal gate operations, the top seal would not contact the tainter gate
skin plate. During high pool elevations, the top seal should be flexible enough to bend toward
the skin plate and seal the gate along the top edge.
The upstream spillway bridge parapet wall would provide three feet of freeboard
consistent with the rest of the dikes and JFP Auxiliary Spillway. Due to increased hydrostatic
load on the emergency gates, some additional retrofits are required to further strengthen the three
emergency gates, including the replacement of gate arms, thickened skin plate girder flanges, and
skin plate knee braces.

2.3.2 Earthen Raise Design Elements
The increased storage capacity associated with the Folsom Dam Raise project would
allow an elevated probable maximum flood (PMF). As such, the current crest elevation of the
reservoir dikes and embankment dams would not provide sufficient freeboard to meet design
criteria for resisting wave height and runup. Accordingly, increasing the height of all reservoir
dikes and embankment dams would be required.
The 3.5-foot dam raise alternative would raise the height of Dikes 1 through 8, and
MIAD, with an earthen embankment raise using an engineered fill material similar to the
existing composition of the earthen dikes. This would allow seepage and pore pressure to be
maintained through the interface between the old and new material. The slopes of the dikes and
crest widths would conform to the Corps’ standards while maintaining Reclamation’s
requirements for security and maintenance. The existing riprap and underlying filter layers
would be stripped off the upstream side of the dikes, as well as the existing dike top asphalt road
and underlying base course, prior to placing the fill to raise the dike. The riprap would be
reprocessed for use on the raised dike. The dike raise would have 1V:2.25H sideslopes and a
varied width (e.g. 22 to 26-foot wide) crest width to allow for construction of the new dike tip
road. Figure 3 is an example cross section.
Beyond any USBR modification, the remainder of the dike raise would straddle the
existing dike in order to maintain alignment with the raise over the USBR modifications. For
this portion of the raise, the protection layers would be stripped off both the upstream and
downstream sides of the dike.

32

Figure 3. Example Cross Section of A 3.5-foot Earthen Dike Raise.

2.3.3 Concrete Floodwall Design Elements
In combination with the earthen dam raises on the dikes and MIAD, the Corps would also
construct a reinforced 3.5-foot concrete flood wall on the LWD and RWD that would tie into the
main dam, the new control structure, and the existing terrain (Figure 4). A reinforced concrete
retaining wall (also termed a parapet wall), with footing embedded in the earthfill of the
embankment, would be constructed along the embankment crest to the required height. This
would require excavating a portion of the dam or dike crest to place the footing and to replace
the embankment fill along with a drainage element to control pore pressures.
The analysis and design of the flood wall on the left wing dam and the right wing dam
would be in accordance with EM 1110-2-2100, EM 1110-2-2104 and EM 1110-2-2502. The
flood wall would be constructed using cast-in-place reinforced concrete. The reinforced concrete
design and detailing would be in accordance with EM 1110-2- 2100, EM 1110-2-2104 and ACI
318-11. The floodwall would be designed with joints at every 30 feet. A construction joint type
J would be provided in the base slab, and expansion joints would be provided in the wall.
Seepage through the wall would be controlled by providing a Type “Y” water stop in the stem.
Joint filler thickness would be determined from the estimated contraction and expansion from
maximum temperature variation.

33

At the LWD and RWD, filter zones would be required only in the upper portion of the
dams. Processed material filter zones would be constructed from the crest to an elevation of
approximately 20 to 40-ft below the dam crest. This filter zone would be constructed by
excavating a 20 to 40-ft portion of the downstream shell and placing the filter material against
the core. The filter zone would then be covered by a layer of excavated shell material. This
filter zone would exit into the downstream shell material of the embankment.

Figure 4. Example Cross Section of Concrete Floodwalls.

2.3.4 Construction Details
Tainter Gate Access, Staging Areas and Haul Roads
General construction access to the site would come from Folsom Dam Road via AuburnFolsom Road. The contractor would require staging areas for activities including, but not limited
to, assembly of construction and excavation equipment, stockpiling of materials, and fuel
storage. Four potential staging areas have been defined (Figure 5), and are located within
Reclamation’s work yard just north of the Central California Area Office (CCAO) facilities and
on top of the main concrete dam.

34

Figure 5. The Four Staging Areas for Spillway Modification with Existing Tainter Gates.

Staging areas 1 and 2 combined are 0.5 acres of previously disturbed area. Staging area 3
is 12.2 acres, the largest of the four areas. Staging area 4 is located on the left side of the main
dam, is to include one lane of the road, and is approximately 0.5 acres. The vegetation and
habitat within each of these staging areas is discussed in detail in Section 3.4.
There are two access points for the Right Wing Dam and the spillway (Figure 6 and
Figure 7). The first is at the CCAO entrance at the USBR facility yard. The haul routes follow
established roads along the top of the Right Wing Dam and through the CCAO/USBR facility.
This access is restricted, however, used only with special request to USBR. The second access
point, and the primary point of access for the Left Wing Dam and staging area, is at the Gate 1
access off of Folsom Lake Crossing, and the haul route would be over the control structure to the
southeast end of the Left Wing Dam (Figures 6 and 7). One lane would be open to traffic across
the dam at all times during the construction period. However, the traffic lane would not need to
be continuous across the dam so long as a vehicle (auto/pickup) can navigate from one side to
the other. Haul routes on public roads are further described in Section 3.9.

36

3.5-Foot Raise Access, Haul roads, and Staging Areas
There are several access points throughout the project area for the 3.5 dam raise
alternative. Access to Dike 1 would be from the the Granite Point entrance. Haul roads would
go to the top of Dike 1 as well as travel parallel to Dike 1 to the east (Figure 8), where the haul
road would provide access to Dike 2. Access to Dike 3 would be from Douglas Blvd on the
south end of the Dike; the haul road would follow the top of the dike.
Access to Dikes 4, 5, and 6 would be from Auburn-Folsom Road, near Dike 5 (Figure 9).
The haul route to Dike 4 would follow previously used access roads from the southwest up to the
toe of the dike. A second access point, also from Auburn-Folsom Road at Beal’s Point, is
located south of Dike 6. This also offers access to the northern end of the Right Wing Dam. The
haul roads to Dikes 5 and 6 follow previously used access roads from the access point on
Auburn-Folsom Road south along the toe of both dikes (Figure 9). The route near the entrance
of Dike 5 would need minor grading to make it passable.
There are two access points for the Right Wing Dam (Figure 9). The first, as previously
mentioned, would be from Auburn-Folsom Road at Beal’s Point. The second would be at the
Central California Area Office (CCAO) entrance at the USBR facility yard. This access,
however, is for restricted use only. The haul routes follow established roads along the top of the
Right Wing Dam and through the USBR facility. The access point for the Left Wing Dam and
staging area is at the Gate 1 access off of Folsom Lake Crossing, and the haul route would be
over the control structure to the southeast end of the Left Wing Dam (Figure 10).
While there are two access points off of Folsom Lake Crossing indicated on Figure 10,
only one would be used to access Dike 7. The northern access point is along an established,
paved entrance, and the southern access point indicated on Figure 10 would not be used at all.
The haul route follows the northwestern end of Dike 7 around to the northeastern side, through
the staging area and up to the previously established haul road down to Dike 8.
Dike 8 has a single access point off of E. Natoma Street and Briggs Ranch Road, along
an established, paved access. The haul road, from the access point, is paved for approximately
0.01 miles before shifting to a previously disturbed dirt access road and haul routes along the
east end of the dike (Figure 10).
There are three different ways to access MIAD and the associated staging areas. The first
is to follow the haul road from Dike 8. The other two are off of Green Valley Road (Figure 11),
one about 1/3rd up the dike, and the second at the northeastern end of the dike where Green
Valley Road intersects with Access Road. The haul road, which comes from Dike 8, follows
currently used access roads up to the top of MIAD and across to the Access Road (Figure 10).
37

In general, all the dirt haul routes would need to be routinely graded with a blade to repair
ruts from truck usage. Rock would be added to control mud and dust, and water trucks would
also be used to control dust on all roads. Haul routes on public roads are further described in
Section 3.9. Entrances and exits of the roads at the toe of each dike would be rocked; there
would be no need to rock the existing roads at the top of the dikes. The existing road base at the
top of the dikes would be used to haul road rock, as necessary.

Dikes 4, 5, and 6 and the Right Wing
Dam.

Dikes 1, 2, and 3.

39

There are a total of 31 staging areas within the project area for this alternative (Figures 6
through 11, also Appendix B). All of the staging areas have been previously disturbed for a total
of 157.2 acres. The vegetation and habitat within each of these staging areas is discussed in
detail in Section 3.4. The staging areas would not be used simultaneously, but would be utilized
in association with each construction phase of each dike (see Construction Schedule below). For
example, the 12.91 acres of staging areas associated with Dikes 1, 2, and 3 would be utilized
during the construction phase scheduled for calendar year 2018-2020.
Two staging areas near Dikes 4, 5, and 6 are located within the water-side of the lake.
These staging areas are, during periods of drought-induced low water levels in the lake, have
been used by the USBR for previous work on the three dikes. They are to be used for staging
equipment, vehicle parking, stockpiling of random unsorted materials, etc. Fuels and other
hazardous material would not be stored in the lakeside staging areas. However, if lake levels rise
due to a change in drought conditions, these staging areas would not be used; other staging areas
located on the land side of the dikes would be utilized instead. As a general note, all staging
areas are proposed at this time, but staging would generally occur in previously disturbed areas
with limited vegetation.
Borrow and Disposal Sites
The majority of materials necessary for each alternative would be obtained from an
established borrow site within 30 miles of the proposed project site. All disposal sites would be
at permitted landfills or established disposal sites within 30 miles of the proposed project site.
Some rip-rap could be available and utilized from the stockpile at the MIAD East
location (resultant from Prior JFP phases and the restoration of the Dike 7 Office Complex
staging area. See below, and Figure 12.) Rip-rap removed from the Dike 7 Office Complex
(Dike 7) staging area for the post-construction restoration of the staging area would be placed
within the disposal area of MIAD East. This could involve as much as 100,000 cy of rip-rap and
would not exceed a maximum of 200,000 cy of rip-rap. The rip-rap would be removed from the
Dike 7 staging area using equipment such as excavators and bulldozers, placed in dump trucks,
then hauled to the MIAD East disposal area using the existing internal haul road. It is likely that
the rip-rap would be placed (disposed of) in the northwestern portion of the disposal area near
the existing haul road as shown in Figure 12 (purple hatching). The placement area would be
positioned at least 100 feet away from the southern toe of the Mormon Island Auxiliary Dam.
The maximum area occupied by the disposed rip-rap would range from approximately 6.5 to
almost 8 acres, based on a rip-rap pile height ranging from 8 to 10 feet above the soil surface.
The top of the completed rip-rap disposal pile would be relatively level, although it would follow
the topography of the underlying soil, and edges of this pile would have approximately 1H:2V
side slopes
40

As described in the Folsom Dam Modification Project: Phase V Site Restorationand
Related Mitigation Activities Final Supplemental Environmental Assessment/Environmnetal
Impact Report, March 2016 [Phase V]), following disposal of the rip-rap, a state agency such as
DWR would have until October 1, 2017 to remove all the disposed rip-rap from the MIAD East
Area and transport it off-site for use in another project. This deadline could be extended if
approved by Reclamation via a third-party agreement between Reclamation and the state agency.
The Corps would also execute an agreement with Reclamation indicating that if a state agency
ultimately decides not to remove the rip-rap, then the Corps would remove the rip-rap from the
MIAD East Area for use in the Dam Raise Project. Regardless of the party removing/using the
rip-rap, it would ultimately be removed from the MIAD East Area, which is why the proposed
initial disposal of rip-rap in this area is considered to be temporary. The reader is advised,
however, that the rip-rap may not be removed from the MIAD East Area for several years.
If a state agency decides to remove the rip-rap, that agency would be responsible for
preparing an appropriate environmental document to address the environmental impacts
associated with the collection, transport, and use of the rip-rap removed from the MIAD East
Area. If instead the Corps removes the rip-rap, the Corps would be responsible for preparing an
appropriate environmental document to address the environmental impacts associated with
removal and use of the rip-rap. Such environmental documents would include implementation of
mitigation measures and/or BMPs if necessary (March 2016)
Site Preparation and Post-Construction Restoration and Cleanup
Prior to construction, the staging areas and dikes would be cleared of grasses and
herbaceous vegetation. All the trees in the staging areas or in the footprint of the dikes would be
avoided to the greatest extent practicable. If some trees need to be trimmed or removed prior to
construction, the Corps would conduct a site visit to determine the impact to the trees and make a
determination about possible actions prior to construction. All trimming of trees would be done
outside of the nesting season as much as possible.
Following the completion of the major proposed construction activities within the
proposed project area, a mixture of native grass and forb seeds would be planted throughout in
order to establish a permanent vegetative groundcover. All seeds would be procured from
California native seed growers. Table 2 below provides a preliminary list of the grass/forb seed
mixture that would be planted. This list and/or the seeding rates (pounds per acre) may be
revised somewhat to account factors such as specific site conditions, the planting method used,
and the availability of seed stock.

Disking would be performed prior to seeding to prepare the soil for seed placement. In
compacted areas, the soil would be ripped or scarified to help reduce compaction. The method
of seeding would be left to the contractor to determine, using hydroseeding, broadcast seeding,
drill seeding, or a combination of these methods. In addition, soil imprinting may be employed
in some areas to minimize seed runoff and help with local rainwater infiltration. Imprinting is a
technique of soil-rolling that leaves small depressions in the soil surface that help break runoff,
improve water infiltration, and prevent seed washout. Additonally, after the construction is
complete, all temporary construction items such as signage, temporary fencing, etc., would be
removed.
The staging area located at the Dike 7 Office Complex, currently a paved parking lot and
temporary structures, would be restored to habitat. This area has been used by prior phases of
the Folsom JFP (Phase V, March 2016), and the 2007 FEIS/EIR previously addressed use of the
Dike 7 Office Complex Area as a construction staging and storage area. A construction office
complex/construction staging and storage area was built immediately south of Dike 7 during
prior phases of the Folsom JFP. This area includes two parking areas; one located southeast of
the entry road to the complex and one located northwest of the entry road. Restoration work is
necessary to comply with prior commitments set forth in the PACR 2007 FEIS/EIR and in the
Land Use Agreement (LUA). All equipment, temporary buildings, fencing, and structures would
be removed from the complex. Both parking lots, consisting of asphalt and base material, would
be removed, stored at MIAD East, and eventually used as rip-rap, and the area would be restored
42

topographically and revegetated, as described in the Phase V SEA/EIR (March 2016). The
proposed topographic restoration of the Dike 7 Office Complex staging area would largely be
accomplished by re-distributing the existing native ground materials (“soil”) located within the
area through excavation, filling, and grading. This process would not require importing new fill
or exporting excavated soil. Restored areas would be re-contoured in a manner to mimic natural
slope appearance and to restore natural hillside slopes where practicable to pre-project
conditions, and would be reseeded with native grasses and forbs (see above). As described in the
Phase V SEA/EIR (Corps 2016) the resultant rip-rap field stored at MIAD East from the Dike 7
Office Complex staging area restoration would occupy as much as 6.5 to 8 acres. See Figure 12
for the rip-rap storage site at MIAD East.

43

Figure 12. MIAD East Area and the Potential Stockpile (purple hatching) within this Area
(Corps 2016).
Construction Works and Schedule
The number of private construction employees present onsite each day would vary with
scheduled construction activities. Up to 60 workers can be expected onsite any one day for the
Spillway Modification with Existing Tainter Gates work. Up to 50 workers can be expected
onsite any one day for the 3.5 foot dam earthen raise and concrete floodwall portion of the
44

alternative. The construction work schedule would consist of 10-hour days over 6 days per week
throughout the entire year. Twenty-four hour shift schedules may be requested when the
construction schedule cannot be met in any other way. However, the double-shift schedule
would be temporary and short-term, and potential impacts resulting from a 24-hour work
schedule would be analyzed in the event such would need to occur.
The work on the emergency spillway and tainter gates would have an expected project
length of approximately 3 years, starting calendar year 2017. This includes pre-work planning,
site preparations, setting up office facilities, haul route improvements, and the construction of the
tainter gates. Demobilization and site restoration after construction would require approximately
16 days.
The 3.5 foot dam earthen raise and concrete floodwalls would have an expected project
length of approximately 4 years, starting calendar year 2017. This includes pre-work planning,
site preparations, setting up office facilities, haul route improvements, and the construction of the
tainter gates. Demobilization and site restoration after construction would require approximately
16 days. The alternative would be broken up into three “work packages”, separating out the
dikes into work years. Work package 1, consisting of work on Dikes 4, 5, and 6, would be
awarded in calendar year 2017, with a construction duration of 2 years. Work package 2,
consisting of work on Dikes 7, 8, MIAD, and the LWD and RWD, would be awarded in calendar
year 2019, with a construction duration of 2 years. Work package 3, consisting of work on Dikes
1, 2, and 3, would be awarded in calendar year 2018, with a construction duration of 2 years.

2.3.5 Operation and Maintenance
Operation and Maintenance requirements of the proposed project would not initially
change with Alternative 2. However, the raise would result in an ablity to sustain an increased
flow of 160,000 cfs for a longer period of time, and would have possible inundations up to
486.34’ (NAVD88). Any post-construction operational changes would be defined in a Water
Control Manual update and any O&M effects from the Dam Raise Project would be covered in a
subsequent environmental document.
Generally speaking, until the Water Control Manual is updated after construction, the
Operation and Maintenance requirements would be no different than existing O&M for both the
3.5-foot dam raise and the spillway tainter gate modification, with the exception of some reduced
maintenance in a couple of areas:


The new cable hoist system would be stainless steel with greaseless bearings, so chain
maintenance is significantly reduced to periodic inspection.

45



The removal of hoist motor redundancy linkage would also remove associated
maintenance of this element.



There would be an added inspection element with the new top seal. The current design is
that it would be concrete with embedded steel components for connection of rubber seals
and connections to the piers. The top seal would be an extremely low maintenance
element but would be an extra item to look at during periodic inspections.

2.3.6 Environmental Commitments
The following avoidance and minimization measures are required and would be
conducted by the Corps or the project contractor, as appropriate, to reduce impacts to a less-thansignificant level for Recreational Resources:


Throughout the construction period, an effort would be made to maintain as much
public access to recreation areas and trails by implementing traffic control
measures, grade separated vehicular and/or pedestrian crossings, and/or temporary
alternate public access detours for both pedestrian and vehicular traffic, as
described in Section 3.3.5.



Warning signs and signs restricting access would be posted for public safety
before and during construction, as necessary.



Public outreach would be conducted through mailings, posting signs, meetings,
and coordination with interested groups, if necessary, in order to provide
information regarding changes to recreational access in and around Folsom Lake.

The following avoidance and minimization measures are required and would be
conducted by the Corps or the project contractor, as appropriate, to reduce impacts to a less-thansignificant level for Wildlife and Vegetation:


To minimize dust impacts to vegetation, wetlands, and breeding wildlife, dust
control measures consistent with SMAQMD fugitive dust control measures would
be implemented. Unpaved access roads would be frequently watered with raw
water to prevent visible dust.



To prevent importation of exotic and invasive plant and animal material,
contractors would clean all mud, soil, plant, and animal material from vehicles
and equipment before entering the project area.

46



Before the project commences, native vegetation and habitat areas would be
identified to be protected. Detailed pre-construction site drawings would be
created to identify vegetated and habitat areas to be avoid, and would be fenced
and signed for protection. Site drawings would be accompanied by a narrative
detailing the vegetation and wildlife protection plan. No off-road traffic would
occur outside of identified staging areas.



Areas not to be disturbed would be clearly defined by signing, fencing, or other
techniques. Impact to native trees, shrubs, and aquatic vegetation would be
avoided to the greatest extent possible. Construction would be implemented in a
manner to minimize disturbance of such areas.



Woody vegetation at all staging areas, borrow sites, and haul routes would be
enclosed with protective construction fencing. Where possible, a buffer would be
provided one and a half times the distance of the drip-line. Temporary fencing
would also be used during construction to prevent damage to native trees.
Coordination with a Corps biologist would occur prior to commencement.



Except as identified in the project drawings or plans, no tree or shrub would be
removed without prior agency consultation and examination of alternatives – all
feasible construction or staging alternatives would be exhausted before removal of
any oak, pine, or riparian tree occurs.



Before and during the nesting season, a qualified biologist would conduct nesting
surveys along proposed construction sites, haul roads, staging areas, and stockpile
sites. Work activity around nests would be avoided until young have fledged.



Avoidance measures would be conducted before nesting season to prevent nesting
on equipment and structures. No active nests would be disturbed so as to cause
take in the forms of disturbance, harassment, or nest abandonment.



A qualified avian biologist/environmental monitor would be employed up to a
full-time basis onsite, as needed, to ensure project compliance with the Migratory
Bird Treaty Act and other environmental mitigations/protections.



All construction personnel would undergo environmental protection training to be
aware of all required environmental protections per these mitigations and by
federal/state law.

47



Construction materials least likely to lead to entrapment of wildlife would be used
and/or removed nightly as applicable. All trash and food-related waste would be
placed in self-closing trash containers and removed nightly.



All BMPs would be strictly followed to prevent spills of toxic substances. No
fueling would be allowed onsite, and appropriate materials for spill containment
and cleanup would be maintained onsite. No staging of vehicles or equipment
would be conducted within 50 feet of the water edge of Folsom Lake to prevent
accidental inundation and toxic infiltrations.

The following avoidance and minimization measures would be required and conducted
by the Corps or project contractor, as appropriate, to reduce impacts to a less-than-significant
level for Special Status Species:
Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle


A minimum setback of 100 feet from the drip-line of all elderberry shrubs would
be established (if possible). If the 100-foot minimum buffer zone is not possible,
the next maximum distance allowable would be established. These areas would
be fenced, flagged, and maintained during construction. When a 100-foot (or
wider) buffer is established and maintained around elderberry shrubs, complete
avoidance (i.e. no adverse effects) would be assumed.



Where encroachment on the 100-foot buffer has been approved by the USFWS, a
setback of 20 feet from the drip-line of each elderberry shrub would be
maintained whenever possible.



During construction activities, all areas to be avoided would be fenced and
flagged. Any damage done to the buffer area would be restored and buffer areas
would continue to be protected after construction.



Signs would be placed every 50 feet along the edge of the elderberry buffer zones.
The signs would include: “This area is the habitat of the valley elderberry
longhorn beetle, a threatened species, and must not be disturbed. This species is
protected by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. Violators are
subject to prosecution, fines, and imprisonment.” The signs shall be readable
from a distance of 20 feet and would be maintained during construction.



No insecticides, herbicides, fertilizers, or other chemicals that might harm the
beetle or its host plant would be used in the buffer area.
48



Elderberry shrubs that cannot be avoided would be transplanted to an appropriate
riparian area at least 100 feet from construction activities – any areas that receive
transplanted elderberry shrubs and elderberry cuttings would be protected in
perpetuity.



If possible, elderberry shrubs would be transplanted during dormant season
(approximately November through the first two weeks in February). If
transplantation occurs during the growing season, increased mitigation ratios
would apply.



Environmental awareness training would be conducted for all workers before they
begin work. The training would include status, the need to avoid adversely
affecting the elderberry shrub, avoidance areas and measures taken by the workers
during construction, and contact information.



Monitoring of the mitigation site would occur for ten consecutive years or for
seven non-consecutive years over a 15-year period. Annual monitoring reports
would be submitted to USFWS. The mitigation site would be selected prior to
construction.

Swainson’s Hawk


Swainson’s hawk surveys would be completed in compliance with the CDFW
survey guidance (Swainson’s hawk Technical Advisory Committee 2000).



If active nests are found, a one-half mile buffer between construction activities
and the active nest(s) would be maintained.



In addition, a qualified biologist would be present onsite during construction
activities to ensure the buffer distance is adequate and the birds are not showing
any signs of stress.



If signs of stress that could cause nest abandonment are observed and noted,
construction activities would cease until a qualified biologist determines that
fledglings have left an active nest.

49

Bald Eagle


Bird nest surveys for bald eagles and other special status migratory birds could be
conducted concurrently with Swainson’s hawk surveys – at least one survey
would be conducted no more than 48 hours before the initiation of project
activities to confirm the absence of nesting.



If active nests are found, a one-half mile buffer between construction activities
and the active nest(s) would be maintained.



In addition, a qualified biologist would be present onsite during construction
activities to ensure the buffer distance is adequate and the birds are not showing
any signs of stress.



If signs of stress that could cause nest abandonment are observed and noted,
construction activities would cease until a qualified biologist determines that
fledglings have left an active nest.



Would be conducted within one-half mile of construction activities, including
grading, for all trees and shrubs that would be removed or disturbed.

The following avoidance and minimization measures would be required and conducted
by the Corps or the project contractor, as appropriate, to reduce impacts to a less-than-significant
level for Air Quality:


Maintain all construction equipment in proper working condition
according to manufacturer’s specifications – equipment checked by
certified mechanic before operation.



Use diesel-fueled equipment manufactured in 2003 or later, or retrofit
equipment manufactured prior to 2003 with diesel oxidation catalysts.



Any equipment found to exceed 40 percent opacity (or Ringelmann 2.0)
would be repaired immediately.



At least 48 hours prior to use of heavy-duty, off-road equipment, the
project contractor would provide SMAQMD with the anticipated
construction timeline including start date, and the names and phone
numbers of the project manager and onsite foreman.

50



SMAQMD’s Basic Construction Emissions Control Practices would be
implemented to control fugitive dust and diesel exhaust emissions.



To further reduce hydrocarbon emissions, SMAQMD recommends that
the project implement a set of Enhanced Exhaust Control Practices.



If the project’s construction contractor determines that construction
activities would actively disturb more than 15 acres per day, then the
contractor would be required to conduct PM10 and PM2.5 dispersion
modeling.

The following avoidance and minimization measures would be required and conducted
by the Corps or project contractor, as appropriate, to reduce impacts to a less-than-significant
level for Climate Change:


Minimize the idling time of construction equipment to no more than 3 minutes or
shut equipment off when not in use.



Maintain all construction equipment in proper working condition.



Encourage carpools, shuttle vans, and/or alternative modes of transportation for
construction worker commutes.



Use locally sourced or recycled materials for construction materials as much as
practicable.



Develop a plan to efficiently use water for adequate dust control.



Use low carbon concrete if economically and engineering feasible.



BMPs and the standard construction avoidance and minimization measures as
recommended in the SMAQMD’s “Guidance for Construction GHG Emissions
Reductions” would be implemented to further reduce GHG emissions.

The following avoidance and minimization measures would be required and conducted
by the Corps or project contractor, as appropriate, to reduce impacts to a less-than-significant
level for Aesthetics and Visual Resources:


Modifications to dikes and dams around Folsom Reservoir would occur in phases,
limiting the extent of construction affects at any one time.
51



Measures would be incorporated into the project design to minimize effects on
riparian vegetation, and ensure use of appropriate erosion control methods,
thereby lessening the visual effects of vegetation loss.



Staging areas would be located throughout the project area on previously
disturbed areas and their use would not constitute a substantial change from
existing visual resource conditions.

The following avoidance and minimization measures would be required and conducted
by the Corps or project contractor, as appropriate, to reduce impacts to a less-than-significant
level for Traffic and Circulation:


The construction contractor would be required to prepare a traffic management
plan, outlining proposed routes to be approved by the appropriate agencies, and
implement the plan prior to initiation of construction.



High collision intersections would be identified by the appropriate local entity,
and avoided if possible.



Construction and haul drivers would be informed and trained on the various types
of haul routes, and areas that are more sensitive (e.g. high level of residential or
education centers, or narrow roadways).



The project would develop and use signs to inform the public of the haul routes,
route changes, detours, and planned road closures to minimize traffic congestion
and ensure public safety.

The following avoidance and minimization measures would be required and conducted
by the Corps or project contractor, as appropriate, to reduce significant impacts to a less-thansignificant level for Noise:


Construction times would be limited in accordance with the City of Sacramento
Noise Ordinance exemption for construction (City of Folsom, 2009).



Construction equipment noise would be minimized during project construction by
muffling and shielding intakes and exhaust on construction equipment (per the
manufacturer’s specifications), and by shrouding or shielding impact tools.

52



All equipment, haul trucks, and worker vehicles would be turned off when not in
use for more than 30 minutes.



Equipment warm-up areas, water tanks, and equipment storage areas shall be
located as far away from existing residences as feasible.



Provide written notice of construction activities within 2,000 feet of residences or
other sensitive receptors, identifying the type, duration, and frequency of
construction activities. Notification materials would also identify a mechanism to
register complaints if construction noise levels are overly intrusive or if
construction occurs outside specified hours.



Residences and businesses would be notified about the type and schedule of
construction at least two weeks prior to mobilization.



The contractor would measure surface velocity waves caused by equipment,
monitoring vibration up to threshold values established and approved in writing
by USACE – no vibrations would exceed 0.2 inch per second.



Public meetings would be scheduled with affected residents to ensure they are
informed of the project schedule and its potential effects.

The following avoidance and minimization measures would be required and conducted
by the Corps or project contractor, as appropriate, to reduce impacts to a less-than-significant
level for Water Quality:


Implement appropriate measures, such as straw wattles and silt fencing, to prevent
debris, soil, rock, or other material from entering the water.



Use of a water truck or other appropriate measures to control dust on haul roads,
construction areas, and stockpiles.



Oil and other liquids would be properly disposed of. Fuels and hazardous
materials would not be stored onsite. Inspect vehicles and equipment to prevent
dripping of oil or other fluids.



Fuel and maintain vehicles in a specified area that is designed to capture spills –
cannot be near any ditch, stream, or other body of water or feature that may
convey spills to a nearby body of water.

53



Schedule construction to avoid the rainy season as much as possible. If rain is
forecast during construction, additional erosion and sedimentation control
measures would be implemented.



Maintain sediment and erosion control measures during construction. Inspect the
control measures before, during, and after a rain event.



Train construction workers in storm water pollution prevention practices.

In addition, in accordance with 29 CFR 1926.62 Lead and 8 CCR 1532.1 Lead, on all
construction jobs where lead is present, the following is required:


Lead dust on surfaces, especially in eating areas, must be controlled by HEPA
vacuuming, wet clean-up, or other effective methods.



Workers must have washing facilities with soap and clean water for hand and
face washing.



Workers must receive training on lead hazards and how to protect themselves.



A written compliance program to assure control of hazardous lead exposures.



Employers must assess the amounts of lead breathed by workers – usually
done by employee breathing-zone air sampling.
All consultation and permits required by federal, state or local laws, regulations or
policies are found in Chapter 5.0 of this document.

2.4 Comparison of Alternatives
Table 3 shows the overall level of significance for each issue area. It also provides a
comparison of significance determinations among the No Action Alternative and Spillway
Tainter Gate Modification and Combination Earthen Raise/Concrete Floodwall. These three
alternatives are analyzed in this DSEIS/SEIR as the final array of alternatives considered. Other
alternatives have been screened out due to various reasons described in Section 2.1.1.

54

Table 3. Comparison of the Environmental Impacts of the Folsom Dam Raise Project.
Alternative 1 – No Action Alternative
Recreational Resources
Effects

Existing recreational opportunities would not
be disturbed. The public would have
continued use of the FLSRA without any
closures or access restrictions unless a flood
event occurs.

Alternative 2 — Spillway Tainter Gate
Modification and Combination Earthen
Raise/Concrete Floodwall
Modification of the spillway gates would
not restrict access to recreational facilities
or resources. There would be no
substantial disruptions to the use of
existing recreational facilities.
The direct effects would result in a severe
restriction to recreational facilities and
resources with a substantial long-term
disruption to the use of an existing
recreational facility.

Significance

Not applicable.

Mitigation

None required.

Mitigation, avoidance, and minimization
efforts would likely reduce the effects of
the proposed alternative to recreational
users to less-than-significant, however
once the detours are identified and
analyzed, a subsequent environmental
document will be prepared if needed.
Expected to be less than significant;
however, significant effects could remain
even with mitigation, avoidance, and
minimization measures.
Traffic control measures, grade separated
vehicular and/or temporary alternate public
access detours for both pedestrian and
vehicular traffic would be used.
To ensure public safety, warning signs and
signs restricting access would be posted
before and during construction.
Public outreach would be conducted
through mailings, posting signs,
coordination with interested groups, in
order to provide information regarding
changes to recreational access in and
around Folsom Lake.

Vegetation and Wildlife
Effect

No construction related effects (direct or
indirect) to vegetation or wildlife would
occur—conditions in the project area would
remain consistent with existing conditions.

55

A construction footprint of up to 50 feet on
both sides of Dikes 1 through 8 and MIAD
would remove vegetation and disturb the
ground surface at up to thirty-one staging
areas.

Indirect adverse impacts to woodland
vegetation would include increased
erosion, damage to roots of trees by heavy
equipment, dust impacts to roadside
vegetation, and invasion of exposed
substrate by exotic and noxious plant
species.
Construction associated with gate
modifications and raising embankment
dams and dikes could temporarily disturb
nesting birds. Disturbance from vehicle
and pedestrian traffic and machinery
would particularly disturb nesting raptors,
turkeys, and migragtory birds in the project
area.

Significance
Mitigation

Construction noise and traffic is expected
to disturb and/or displace local wildlife
that utilizes oak and pine woodlands and
grasslands over the project duration.
Less than significant with mitigation.
State and USFWS protocols for survey and
protection of nesting raptors and migratory
birds would be followed for the project.

Not applicable.
None required.

Mitigation would occur, with the project
area returned to pre-existing conditions to
the extent practicable at the completion of
this project. Mitigation will be completed
for any oak woodland habitat adversely
affected by the project.
Implementation of BMPs listed in Section
3.4.5 would be conducted by the Corps or
project contractor, as appropriate, to
reduce impacts to a less-than-significant
level.
Special Status Species
Effects

Significance

There would be no construction-related
effects to existing special status species or
critical habitat; however, a PMF flood event
may result in the loss of critical habitat and
special status species could be adversely
affected.
The types of special status species and their
associated habitats would remain the same.
Not applicable.

56

Construction could potentially result in
both direct and indirect effects to
elderberry shrubs. Direct effects due to
removal or damage to shrubs during site
preparation and construction activities.
Indirect effects would include physical
vibration and an increase in the dust during
operation of equipment and during
construction activities.
Less than significant with mitigation.

Mitigation

None required.

Loss/removal of elderberry shrubs would
be compensated for by transplanting
shrubs to an approved location and
monitored for 5 years. Additionally,
elderberry shrubs and associated natives
would be planted at an existing Corps
mitigation site or credits would be
purchased at a USFWS approved
mitigation bank.
Implementation of BMPs discussed in
Section 3.5.5 would also be necessary
during construction to prevent mortality or
incidental take of special status species
(Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle,
Swainson’s Hawk, and the Bald Eagle).

Air Quality
Effects

There would be no construction-related
effects on air quality in the project area. Air
quality would continue to be influenced by
climatic and geographic conditions, local and
regional emissions from vehicles and
households, and local commercial and
industrial land uses.
A possible flood event may temporarily
increase the amount of vehicle emissions
during flood-fighting activities, as well as
increase the amount of vehicle emissions
resulting from clean-up activities.

Significance

Not applicable.

Mitigation

None required.

Combustion emissions would result from
the use of construction equipment, truck
haul trips, and worker vehicle trips to and
from the construction site. Combustion
emissions would vary from day to day, and
would temporarily contribute
incrementally to regional ozone
concentrations over the construction
period.
Exhaust emissions from these sources
would include ROG, NOX, and PM10.
Exhaust emissions would vary depending
on the number and type of equipment, the
duration of its use, and the number of
construction worker and haul trips to and
from the construction site.
Construction emissions would last
approximately 4 years.
Significant effects would occur even with
the implementation of avoidance and
minimization measures. Emissions would
not be reduced below the USEPA’s
general conformity de minimis threshold.
However, compliance would be
accomplished with the completion of a
General Conoformity Analysis, or with the
inclusion in the State Implementation plan,
therefor impacts would be less than
significant with mitigation.
SMAQMD recommends the project
implement a set of Enhanced Exhaust

57

Control Practices for further reduction in
hydrocarbon emissions.
In order to achieve the required reductions
in emissions the BMPs in Section 3.6.5
would be followed, in addition to the
SMAQMD Guidance for Construction
GHG Emissions Reductions.
Climate Change
Effects

Significance
Mitigation

There would be no construction-related
effects on climate change. Locally generated
emissions, including levee operations and
maintenance, would continue.

There are no conflicts with any Statewide
or local goals with regard to reduction of
GHG; therefore, there would be no
significant effects on climate change.
Significant short-term increase in CO2
would occur but this effect would be
temporary.
Less than significant with mitigation.
BMP and GHG mitigation plans would be
implemented—the GHG mitigation plan
would consist of feasible mitigation
measures (one or multiple), being
implemented to reduce impacts. BMPs to
be implemented and incorporated in the
design of the work are listed in Section
3.7.5.

Not applicable.
None required.

In addition to implementing BMPs, the
State would monitor emissions and
implement all feasible mitigation
measures.
Aesthetics and Visual Resources
Effects
The visual resources around Folsom
Reservoir would remain undisturbed.
Construction work, outside of routine
maintenance and projects that are already
underway or planned, would not contribute
to any change in visual quality within the
study area.

Raising the dams and dikes would not
significantly alter the visual character of
the FLSRA.
The 3.5-foot raise of the dikes and dams
may temporarily impair visual resources
during each 2 year construction period.
Increased construction traffic on AuburnFolsom Road would affect views of the
area from several homes from across the
street and may be visible to recreation
users on the trails.

Significance

During construction, recreationalists would
not have access to the trail on top of the
dikes and would need to utilize the trail
detour.
Less than significant with mitigation.

Not applicable.

58

Mitigation

None required.

Modifications to dikes and dams around
Folsom reservoir would occur in phases.
Measures would be incorporated into the
project design to minimize effects on
riparian vegetation and ensure use of
appropriate erosion control methods.
Staging areas would be located throughout
the project area on previously disturbed
areas.

Traffic and Circulation
Effects

The project would not create additional
traffic during construction around the
proposed project area.
The existing roadway network, types of
traffic, and circulation patterns would be
expected to increase traffic by 2% each year.

Significance

Not applicable.

Mitigation

None required.

Noise
Effects

Vehicle trips to Folsom Dam from the
surrounding area would increase slightly as
a result of labor force trips and haul truck
trips.
Transportation and circulation effects
resulting from this action are temporary in
nature and would not result in permanent
traffic increases to the surrounding area.
Construction of the dike and dam raises
would have temporary direct effects on the
traffic and circulation in the project area.
Traffic would substantially increase in
relation to existing traffic load and
capacity of the roadway system and has the
potential to substantially disrupt the flow
and/or travel time of traffic.
Impacts are considered significant and
unavoidable as it will substantially
increase traffic even with proposed
avoidance, minimization, and mitigation
measures.
BMPs listed in Section 3.9.5 would be
implemented to avoid or minimize any
effects, as well as ensure public safety on
project area roadways.

There would be no construction-related
effects to the acoustic environment,
including the generation of ground-borne
vibration.

Construction on the southeastern perimeter
of the reservoir could cause substantial
temporary increase in the ambient noise
level.

The noise levels in the study area would
remain consistent with the existing ambient
noise levels present under current conditions.
Sources of noise and noise levels would
continue to be determined by local activities,
development, and natural sounds.

Residents, wildlife, and recreationists
could be affected and experience noise
from construction vehicle motors and
construction activities—noise increases
would be temporary and intermittent.

59

Significance

Not applicable.

Mitigation

None required.

Temporary noise effects associated with
the raise and modification of Folsom Dam
would be considered less than significant,
due to the distance between noise sources
and potential receptors being large enough
to attenuate noise.
Implementation of minimization measures
would reduce noise effects on residences
close to the dam, but not to a less than
significant level.
Construction times would be limited in
accordance with the City of Folsom,
Sacramento County, and Placer County
Noise Ordinances.
BMPs listed in 3.10.5 would be
implemented to further reduce the effects
of construction noise to a less-thansignificant level.

Water Quality
Effects

Water resources and quality would not be
affected by construction in the project area.
The surface and groundwater conditions
would continue to be affected by
contaminants through runoff.
Extreme flooding events could wash siltation
and contaminants into the water system, and
if emergency work became necessary to
prevent dike failure, measures required for
the protection of water quality might not be
used.

Some of the work on the spillway gates
would be done over water with potential
for lead paint to enter surface water
downstream of the dam—lead paint is
assumed present in all underlying primer
on the structure.
Project activities, such as drilling,
excavation, hauling, and fill placement
may disturb or mobilize sediments, having
the potential to affect total suspended
solids, pH, turbidity, and dissolved
oxygen.
The dike raises and construction of the
concrete floodwall with the use of
identified staging areas could have shortterm direct impacts on water quality from
ground-disturbing activities.
Debris and inadvertent spills of fuels, oils,
or concrete mix materials from
construction equipment, work areas, or the
staging areas could be a source of
contamination into adjacent waterways.
Run-off could result from excavation
activities with potentially higher
concentrations of total dissolved solids—

60

there is a potential to create turbidity and
introduce associated contaminants into the
receiving waters.

Significance

Not applicable.

Mitigation

None required.

Across the entire construction site, debris,
soil, or oil and fuel spills could temporarily
adversely affect the water quality at
Folsom Lake.
Impacts would be less-than-significant
with mitigation, NPDES permits, and
implementation of BMPs.
Construction contractor is required to
obtain permit coverage under the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES).
BMPs listed in 3.11.5 would be
incorporated into the project. All
necessary measures would be followed as
required when lead is present during
construction in accordance with 29 CFR
1926.62 Lead and 8 CCR 1532.1 Lead.
Construction and post-construction
monitoring should be conducted to ensure
that all pollution prevention efforts are
being performed as described in the Storm
Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP).

Cultural Resources
Effects

Significance
Mitigation

A potential adverse effect to historic
properties (cultural resources eligible for
listing in or listed in the National Register of
Historic Places) or tribal cultural resources
could result from a large storm event. The
effects would depend on the location of the
failure in the system and severity of the
storm. As a result, a precise determination of
adverse effect and the significance of the
effect is not possible and cannot be made.
Not applicable.
None required.

61

Alternative 2 would result in no adverse
effects to historic properties. Existing
historic properties would undergo physical
changes, however these modifications
constitute no adverse effect to the qualities
that make the historic properties eligible
for inclusion in the NRHP. No adverse
effects to tribal cultural resources are
anticipated.
Not applicable.
None required.

CHAPTER 3.0 - AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT, ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES,
AND MITIGATION

3.1 Introduction
This chapter describes the existing environmental resources in the area that would be
affected if any of the alternatives are implemented, and it describes the environmental
consequences of the alternative plans on those environmental resources. A description of the
existing conditions is presented in the Affected Environment section of each resource. Potential
effects of project alternatives to the resource are discussed in the Environmental Consequences
section. Mitigation measures identified to avoid, minimize, or compensate for adverse project
effects are discussed in the Mitigation Measures section. Further explanation on how these
sections were developed follows.
This chapter describes existing conditions and future without project conditions in the
study area. The future without project conditions are the expected physical, environmental, and
social conditions in the study area if no dam raise or gate modifications are constructed. The
without project condition is the condition against which flood protection plans are formulated
and evaluated, and also serves as the environmental baseline for assessing effects of the
alternatives. The No Action Alternative constitutes the future without project conditions that
would reasonably be expected in the absence of the proposed action and serves as the
environmental baseline, per NEPA, against which the effects and benefits of the action
alternatives are evaluated. The environmental baseline for CEQA is assumed to be the existing
conditions.
The baseline environmental conditions assumed in this DSEIS/SEIR for analyzing the
effects of the Folsom Dam Raise Project consist of the existing physical environment as of 2014,
the year when the Notice of Preparation (NOP) was published to prepare a DSEIS/SEIR with the
State Clearinghouse. The 2014 existing physical environment is consistent with the current
conditions in the project area because no major changes to resources has occurred within the last
several years. The Corps published the Notice of Intent (NOI) in the Federal Register for this
DSEIS/SEIR concurrent with issuance of the State’s NOP.
3.1.1 Affected Environment
For each resource, this section describes the existing pre-project conditions of the
environmental resource in the project area. Resources not evaluated in detail are described first,
followed by the resources that may be significantly affected by the alternatives.

62

Although all conditions are subject to some change over time, most of these resources are
not expected to change significantly over the 50-year period of analysis for this study. However,
any changes expected in the future without project condition are described as part of the No
Action Alternative in the Environmental Consequences section. The Analysis of Effects
described in the Environmental Consequences sections uses the pre-project condition as its
baseline to identify changes to the resource under future with and without project conditions.
The baseline environmental conditions assumed in the DSEIS/SEIR for analyzing the effects of
the Folsom Dam Raise Project consist of the existing physical environment as of 2014.
3.1.2 Environmental Consequences and Mitigation
In the evaluation of environmental consequences, the conditions described for each
resource are compared with future conditions with each alternative plan in place. As appropriate,
the effects are discussed either by the alternatives identified in Chapter 2, or for the study as a
whole. This is because the effects of several resources are realized over the entire project area
rather than limited to a specific part of the project area.
Under NEPA, the effects of the proposed action and alternatives under consideration,
including the No Action Alternative, is determined by comparing effects between alternatives
and against effects from the No Action Alternative. Under NEPA, the No Action Alternative
(i.e., expected future conditions without the project) is the benchmark to which the action
alternatives are compared, and the No Action Alternative is compared to existing conditions.
Under CEQA, the environmental analysis compares the alternatives under consideration,
including the No Project Alternative, to existing conditions as defined at the time when the NOP
is prepared. For consistency, in this DSEIS/SEIR it is referred to as the No Action Alternative.
Both adverse and beneficial effects are considered, including direct effects during
construction and indirect effects resulting from the alternatives. Each section, where appropriate,
contains a discussion of the methods used to analyze effects. In addition, significance criteria for
each resource is used to evaluate the level of significance of any adverse effects. Finally,
measures are proposed to avoid, minimize, or mitigate (compensate) any significant adverse
effects for each resource.
Significant criteria (or “thresholds of significance”) are used to define the level at which
an impact would be considered significant in accordance with CEQA. NEPA does not have
specific thresholds of significance, and environmental effects are analyzed based on their
intensity and duration. Because this DSEIS/SEIR is a joint NEPA/CEQA document, the CEQA
thresholds have been applied because they are more stringent. Generally, however, thresholds of
significance are consistent with Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines, as amended, and
NEPA, where defined.
63

Thresholds may be quantitative and qualitative; they may be based on agency or
professional standards, or on legislative or regulatory requirements that are relevant to the impact
analysis.
Significance criteria used in this DESIS/SEIR are based on the checklist presented in
Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines; factual or scientific information and data; and
regulatory standards of Federal, State, regional, and local agencies. These thresholds also
include the factors taken into account under NEPA to determine the significance of the action in
terms of the context and the intensity of its effects.
An environmental document prepared to comply with CEQA must identify the
significance of the environmental effects of a proposed project. Therefore, for each effect
(impact), a conclusion is provided regarding its significance. A “significant effect on the
environment means a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in any of the physical
conditions within the area affects by the project” (State CEQA Guidelines, 11 Section 15382).
This DSEIS/SEIR uses the following terminology based on CEQA to denote the
significance of each environmental effect (impact), and includes consideration of the “context”
of the action and the “intensity” (severity) of its effects in accordance with NEPA guidance (40
CFR 1508.27):
No Impact indicated that the construction, operation, and maintenance of the Proposed
Action and Action Alternatives would not have any direct or indirect impacts on the
environment. It means that no change from existing conditions would result. This impact level
does not require mitigation.
Beneficial Impact would result in a beneficial change in the physical environment. This
impact does not require mitigation.
Less Than Significant Impact would not result in a substantial or potentially substantial
adverse change in the physical environment. This impact level does not require mitigation, even
if applicable measures are available under CEQA.
Significant Impact is defined be CEQA Section 21068 as one that would cause “a
substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the
area affected by the project.” Levels of Significance can vary by alternative based on the setting
and the nature of the change in the existing physical condition. Under CEQA, mitigation
measures or alternatives to the Proposed Action must be provided, where applicable, to avoid or
reduce the magnitude of significant impact.

64

Potentially Significant Impact is one that if it were to occur, would be considered a
significant impact as describe above. However, the occurrence of the impact cannot be
immediately determined with certainty. For CEQA purposes, a potentially significant impact is
treated as if it were a significant impact. Therefore, under CEQA, mitigation measures or
alternatives to the Proposed Action must be provided, where necessary and applicable, to avoid
or reduce the magnitude of significant impacts.
An impact may have a level of significance that is too uncertain to be reasonably
determined, which would be designated too speculative for meaningful consideration, in
accordance with State CEQA Guidelines Section 15145. Where some degree of evidence points
to the reasonable potential for a significant effect, the DSEIS/SEIR may explain that a
determination of significance is uncertain but is still assumed to be “potentially significant” as
described above. In other circumstances, after thorough investigation, the determination of
significance may still be too speculative to be meaningful. This is an effect for which the degree
of significance cannot be determined for specific reasons, such as because aspects of the impact
itself are either unpredictable or the severity of consequences cannot be known at this time.

3.2 Resources Not Considered in Detail
Initial evaluation of the effects of construction of the selected alternative indicated that
there would likely be little to no direct, indirect, or cumulative effects on several resources.
These resources are described in Sections 3.2.1 through 3.2.10 to add to the overall
understanding of the environmental setting.

3.2.1 Hydrology and Hydraulics
Hydrology
Surface Water
The American River Basin covers an area of approximately 2,100 square miles, and has
an average annual unregulated runoff of 2.7 million acre-feet; however, annual runoff has varied
in the past from 900,000 acre-feet to 5,000,000 acre-feet. The major tributaries in the American
River system include: the North Fork American River, Middle Fork American River, and South
Fork American River. These tributaries drain the upper watershed carrying runoff from
precipitation and snowmelt into Folsom Lake (Figure 13).

65

Figure 13. The Hydrology of Folsom Lake, Including Tributaries and Streams.

At an elevation of 466 feet above mean sea level (NGVD 29), Folsom Lake is the
principal reservoir on the American River, impounding runoff from a drainage area of
approximately 1,875 square miles. Folsom Lake has a normal full-pool storage capacity of
approximately 975,000 acre-feet.
Flood-producing runoff occurs primarily during the months of October through April,
and is usually most extreme between November and March. From April to July, runoff is
primarily generated from snowmelt from the upper portions of the American River watershed.
Runoff from snowmelt usually does not result in flood producing flows; however, it is normally
adequate to fill Folsom Lake’s available storage. Approximately 40 percent of the runoff from
the watershed results from snowmelt.
The Lower American River extends 23 miles from Nimbus Dam to the confluence with
the Sacramento River. The upper reaches of the Lower American River are unrestricted by
levees and are hydrologically controlled by natural bluffs and terraces. Downstream, the river is
leveed along its northern and southern banks for approximately 13 miles from the Sacramento
River to the Mayhew drain on the south, and to the Carmichael Bluffs on the north.
Water levels would not be impacted during construction on the gates, dams or dikes.
Therefore, the construction of any of these alternatives would not alter the hydrology of the
66

American River nor current reservoir operations. Water would continue to flow through the
Basin in the same manner. The project would not substantially alter the existing drainage pattern
of the site or area in a manner which would result in substantial erosion, siltation, or flooding on
or off site. Therefore, there would be no effect on hydrology due to the spillway tainter gate
modification; however, if as a result of the 3.5 foot dam final design, significant adverse effects
to hydrology are expected and an appropriate NEPA/CEQA document would be prepared.
Groundwater
Folsom Lake is located at the eastern edge of the Sacramento Valley Groundwater Basin
in the North American and South American sub-basins. The area surrounding Folsom Lake
consists primarily of bedrock formations of the Sierra Nevada foothill complex.
Ground water is found primarily in fractured geologic formations, and water can be
present within the fractured formations. Fractured aquifer systems are typically low yielding;
therefore, surface water sources are primarily used for drinking water or irrigation sources rather
than wells. Although groundwater is not a major resource in the vicinity of the Folsom site,
small amounts of groundwater are typically found in granitic fissures and cracks. Bedrock is
close to, or in some areas, at the surface; therefore, high water tables exist in a few locations.
Due to the presence of the impermeable material near the surface, natural drainage cannot
regularly occur, thus low areas frequently become water-logged.
The Dam Raise Project would not substantially deplete groundwater supplies or interfere
substantially with groundwater recharge such that there would be a net deficit in aquifer volume
or a lowering of the local groundwater table level. Therefore, there would be no effects to
groundwater hydrology with implementation of the project.
Hydraulics
Folsom Dam’s current configuration has three general types of outlet structures
including: 1) three power penstocks, 2) eight gated outlets (four upper and four lower), and 3)
eight spillway gates (five operational service gates and three emergency gates). Reservoir
releases are restricted by both the capacity of the discharge structures and by regulatory limits on
the increases in release rates. The maximum capacity of the low-level outlets is 34,000 cfs
(8,000 cfs total capacity through the three power penstocks and 26,000 cfs maximum total
capacity through the eight gated river outlets).
During a flood event, releases are made through the low-level outlets until water levels in
the reservoir reach the spillway crest and releases can be made from the main spillway gates.
Once water is above the spillway crest, releases can then be raised incrementally to 115,000 cfs
(design release), which represents the maximum safe carrying capacity of the lower American
67

River. The maximum rate of increase in flows is limited to 15,000 cfs per hour until outflow
reaches 115,000 cfs. As inflows continue to increase, more water is released from the spillways
to protect the dam. A maximum of 160,000 cfs can be released on a limited emergency basis
without causing a downstream levee failure and flooding in the Sacramento area. The three
emergency spillway gates may not be used unless the total outflow from the dam exceeds
300,000 cfs. This restriction makes the emergency gates unusable for normal flood management
purposes and limits the use of the gates to dam safety outflows.
The JFP auxiliary spillway, under construction through 2017, would provide additional
flood risk management benefits for Folsom Lake (the maximum discharge capacity of the newly
constructed auxiliary spillway is approximately 312,000 cfs). The Water Control Manual
(WCM) is currently being updated to take advantage of the additional release capabilities that the
JFP would provide in 2017, the effects of which would be analyzed in a subsequent
NEPA/CEQA document.
This DSEIS/SEIR focuses on effects associated with construction of the selected
alternative. Because there would be no initial changes to the operation of Folsom Lake in this
initial construction effort, impacts to hydraulics during the construction of the Dam Raise would
be negligible. A subsequent WCM update would occur to take into account changes in
operations due to additional capabilities of the Dam Raise; this would include appropriate
NEPA/CEQA documentation.

3.2.2 Hydropower
The CVP hydropower system consists of eight power plants and two pumping-generating
plants. This system is fully integrated into the Northern California Power System and provides a
significant portion of the hydropower available for use in Northern and Central California. The
installed power capacity of the system is 2,044,350 kilowatts (kW). By comparison, the
combined capacity of the 368 operational hydropower plants in California is 12,866,000 kW.
Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is the area’s major power supplier with a generating
capacity from all sources of over 20 million kW.
The Folsom power plant has three generating units with a total generating capacity of
196.72 megawatts (MW), and a release capacity of approximately 8,600 cfs. By design, the
facility is operated as a peaking facility. Peaking plants schedule the daily water release volume
during the peak electrical demand hours to maximize generation at the time of greatest need. At
other hours during the day, there may be no release (and no power generation) from the plant.

68

The construction of the Folsom Dam Raise would have no effect on the ability of Folsom
Dam to generate hydropower. The project would not change any water diversions that can affect
power generation.

3.2.3 Water Supply
Folsom Lake is operated as part of the CVP for many purposes, including water supply.
The reservoir meets the majority of water demands for the City of Roseville, the City of Folsom,
the San Juan Water District, and Folsom Prison. The San Juan Water District provides water to
the City of Folsom, Orangevale Water Company, Fair Oaks Water District, and Citrus Heights
Water District. Placer County Water Agency and El Dorado Irrigation District also receive
water from Folsom Lake (USBR 2005).
Folsom Lake provides water through a diversion at Folsom Dam to the cities of Folsom
and Roseville, the San Juan Water District, and Folsom State Prison. An 84-inch pipeline, which
is part of the North Fork distribution system, passes through the right abutment of the dam,
providing water to the City of Roseville and San Juan Water District. A second 42-inch pipeline,
which is part of the Natoma distribution system or Natoma Pipeline, passes through the left
abutment. Water is conveyed from the Natoma Pipeline to the City of Folsom and California
Department of Corrections water treatment plants, and the Corps' Resident Office Fire Protection
System.
The Dam Raise Project would have no effect on groundwater supplies or interfere
substantially with groundwater recharge. The project design, such as having concrete floodwalls
on the Left and Right Wing Dams, was designed to avoid any impact to the Natoma Water Line.
Thus, water allocations and the timing of deliveries would not be impacted by the construction of
the proposed alternative. However, while it is expected that operation of the dam raise features
would have no effect on water supply, effects related to a change in reservoir operations as a
result of the dam raise would be investigated in a subsequent analysis.

3.2.4 Fisheries and Aquatic Resources
Native and introduced fishes are present in the Folsom Lake area. Native fishes occur
primarily as a result of their continued existence in the tributaries of Folsom Lake and Lake
Natoma. Two native species are planted in Folsom Lake for fishing, rainbow trout and Chinook
salmon. The populations of most other species are currently self-supporting. Introduced fishes
are more commonly found in the reservoirs than are native fishes. Most of these fishes were
introduced into the State as game fish or as forage fish to support game fish populations.

69

No work would occur in a wet or aquatic environment, and there would be no
interference with the movement of migratory fish. Therefore, the proposed action is not
expected to affect fishery or aquatic resources. As part of standard construction practices, the
contractor would be required to develop and submit a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWPPP) and a Spill Preventions and Countermeasure Plan (SPCP) prior to initiating
construction activities to minimize the potential for soil or other contaminants to enter the river.
The SWPPP and SPCP must be approved by the Corps.
No materials would be discharged into Folsom Lake or the American River. Water
trucks would be used for dust suppression along all areas of disturbed soil and along the haul
routes; trucks would be monitored so over watering and runoff does not occur. The contractor
would not be allowed to store fuels, lubricants, or other potential hazardous substances onsite. If
equipment is to be refueled onsite, BMPs would be used to avoid and contain any possible spills.
Although no adverse effects to fisheries or aquatic resources are expected, the SWPPP and SPCP
in place ensures that this project would have no effect; therefore, impacts would be considered
less than significant.

3.2.5 Geology, Mineral Resources, Seismicity, and Soils
The project area is between the Central Sierra Nevada and the Central Valley
Geomorphic Provinces. The Sierra Nevada geomorphic region is characterized by a northnorthwest trending mountain belt with extensive foothills on the western slope. The Folsom
Lake geomorphic region primarily consists of rolling hills and upland plateaus between major
river canyons. There are three major geologic divisions within the study area. The oldest
consists of a north-northwest trending belt of metamorphic rocks. Younger granitic plutons have
intruded and obliterated some of the metamorphic belt. The youngest geologic division consists
of relatively flat deposits of volcanic ash, debris flows, and alluvial fan deposits. These deposits
overlie the older rocks.
Igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rock types are present within the project area.
The four major rock divisions of the project area include 1) ultramafic intrusive rocks, 2)
metamorphics, 3) granodiorite intrusive rocks, and 4) volcanic mud flows and alluvial deposits.
The project area is within the Foothills Fault system, which is located in the metamorphic
belt. This system consists of northwest trending vertical faults and is divided into two zones, the
western Melones Fault zone and the western Bear Mountains Fault zone. The west trace of the
Bear Mountains Fault zone transects the upper reaches of the North Fork arm near Manhattan
Bar Road, and crosses the South Fork arm in the region of New York Creek.

70

Potential seismic hazards resulting from a nearby moderate to major earthquake can
generally be classified as primary and secondary. The primary effect is fault ground rupture,
also called surface faulting. No active faults have been mapped within the project area by the
California Geological Survey or U.S. Geological Survey (Jennings, 1994). The project area is
not located within the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones, and therefore the Alquist-Priolo
Earthquake Fault Zoning Act does not apply to this project (California Geological Survey, 2007).
The risk of fault ground rupture is negligible in the project area (Knudsen, et al. 2008).
The dikes throughout the project site were constructed in the mid-1950s. Each dike was
constructed as a zoned embankment with a silty sand (SM) core of approximately 30% fines, and
a silty sand (SM) embankment shell with a fines content of <30%, or less than that of the core
material. This construction also included a coarse gravel blanket drain at the downstream toe.
The foundation is hard, moderate to highly weathered granite. The slope protection materials
consist of rock riprap underlain by a coarse filter primarily consisting of 3-inch minus dredge
tailings, and a fine filter material of 2-inch minus sands and gravels placed in 1 foot layers.
Additionally, USBR has recently (2007 through 2015) conducted dam safety improvements on
Dikes 4, 5, 6, the Wing Dams, and MIAD. These include modification to the sand filters, toe
drains, and the berms to mitigate against seismic and seepage concerns.
To ensure public safety, proposed new levees, other flood control facilities, and proposed
modifications to existing flood control facilities would be designed to withstand the maximum
earthquake and associated ground failures (EM 1110-2-2104, 2105, ER 1110-2-1806).
Therefore, there would be no project-related effects to geology and or seismicity-related effects
because flood control improvements would be designed to withstand ground shaking and
associated ground failures. The project would not result in the loss of availability of a known
mineral resource of value to the region. Therefore, there would be no adverse effects to mineral
resources due to the project. The project is not located on expansive soil that can cause
significant damage to or disruption of engineered utilities or structures, and would not result in
soil erosion or the loss of topsoil. Although the dikes would be disturbed during construction of
the 3.5-foot raise, the soil and road would be restored upon completion of the project.

3.2.6 Land Use and Planning
The land surrounding Folsom Dam and Reservoir is primarily Federally-owned and
designated for recreation and flood control use. The major land use in the project area is
USBR’s Central California Area Office and the Folsom Dam industrial complex, along with a
utility corridor. Additionally, residences on the southwestern perimeter of the reservoir near
Granite Bay are located between 600 and 1,200 feet of Dikes 1 through 6. There are a few
residences within 1,000 feet of the RWD, but none within the same distance of the LWD. On the
southeastern perimeter of the reservoir, some residences are located within 400 feet of Dikes 7
71

and 8. The closest residences to MIAD are located approximately 1,200 feet away off Green
Valley Road.
State Parks, under an agreement with USBR, manages Folsom Lake, Lake Natoma, and
adjacent lands designated as the Folsom Lake State Recreation Area (FLSRA). Most of the
project area is designated as part of the FLSRA; however, the lands directly surrounding the
project area are closed to the public. As part of the FLSRA, a portion of the American River
bicycle, pedestrian, and equestrian trail is located adjacent to the project area.
Adjacent to the project area is a portion of the California State Prison, Sacramento. This
multi-mission institution consists of about 1,200 acres located on Prison Road. California’s
second oldest prison, Folsom State Prison, is located at 300 Prison Road on a 40-acre parcel
adjacent to and south of Folsom Dam. Both prisons collectively house nearly 8,000 inmates, the
Regional Corporation Yard for Inmate Day Labor, and the main headquarters for the Prison
Industry Authority. The prison property includes access to the Sacramento-Folsom firing range,
office and storage facilities, and the Green Valley Conservation Camp.
The land located west of the project area is within the City of Folsom and is zoned as an
Open Space Conservation District. This zoning district was established to maintain these
properties as open or undeveloped, or developed as permanent open uses such as parks or
greenbelts. This zoning district also includes Folsom State Prison. East of the prison, the land is
zoned as an Agricultural Reserve District. This area provides a buffer between Folsom Lake and
developed areas to the south. This zoning district is intended to provide for interim agricultural
and livestock grazing uses until community services are available for urban development
(Reclamation 2006). The designated land zones within and adjacent to project area would
remain unchanged after implementation of the selected alternative.
To access Dikes 1 through 3, construction vehicles will possibly use the park entrance at
the concurrence of Douglas Blvd and Park Road (Folsom Lake Park/Granite Point). This impact
to residential areas is temporary and less than significant. The land use in and around the project
area, including the recreation and prison lands, would not change as a result of construction of
the Dam Raise Project. The project would not physically divide an established community or
conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy, or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction
over the project area. There would be no conflict with any applicable conservation plans or
natural community conservation plans. Therefore, there would be no effect to land use as a
result of the project.

72

3.2.7 Agriculture and Forestry Resources
There is no farmland or forestry land within the project area. Therefore, there would be
no adverse effects on agricultural and forestry resources.

3.2.8 Socioeconomics
The City of Folsom is within Sacramento County, approximately 25 miles east of
downtown Sacramento on Highway 50. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that the population of
Folsom was 76,375 in 2015, which was a population growth of approximately 5.8% since the
2010 Census. The population of Folsom is approximately 74% white, 12% Asian, 6% African
American, 0.6% Native American, and 0.2% Pacific Islander, with the remaining percentages
classified as other or more than one race (Census 2015). People of Hispanic origin make up
approximately 11% of the city’s population. It is important to note that these estimates may not
be accurate because the U.S. Census Bureau only updates population data every ten years, and
the next update will not be until the year 2020.
The labor force in the City of Folsom was 35,487 people in May 2016, with an
unemployment rate of 3.10%.. The city’s unemployment rate is well below the unemployment
rate for the Sacramento – Roseville – Arden-Arcade Metropolitan area at 4.7% during the same
time period (EDD 2016). The median family income in the City of Folsom from the years 2010
through 2014 was $100,163, and the per capita income is $38,472 (Census 2015). Employment
opportunities near the project area include technology, food manufacturers, retail, health care,
and education (City of Folsom 2011).
No actions associated with the project would limit either current or future opportunities
for agriculture, business, employment, or housing. While there are residents located adjacent to
the project area, these populations do not comprise a substantial population of minorities. No
populations would be displaced as a result of project construction, and no local industry would
be disrupted by project activities. There would be no disproportionately adverse effects to
minorities or low-income populations. Therefore, socioeconomics is not evaluated further in this
DSEIS/SEIR.

3.2.9 Population and Housing
Although there are no homes located directly within the project footprint, there are
several residences near the construction areas. Residences on the southwestern perimeter of the
reservoir near Granite Bay are located between 600 and 1,200 feet of Dikes 1 through 6. There
are a few residences within 1,000 feet of the RWD, but none within the same distance of the
73

LWD. On the southeastern perimeter of the reservoir, some residences are located within 400
feet of Dikes 7 and 8. The closest residences to MIAD are located approximately 1,200 feet
away off Green Valley Road.
Because no existing housing is within the project area, the Dam Raise Project would not
displace any existing housing or people, necessitating the construction of replacement housing
elsewhere. The Dam Raise would not cause population growth in the nearby area, either directly
or indirectly. Therefore, there would be no effects to population and/or housing.

3.2.10 Public Utilities and Services
Electric utilities near the project area include Sacramento Metropolitan Utility District
(SMUD), Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), and Western Area Power Administration (WAPA)
lines and facilities. SMUD owns and operates the Folsom-Elverta 230-kilovolt (kV)
transmission line that runs along the northern boundary of Folsom Prison and carries electricity
from the Upper American River Project facilities, to the Lake Folsom Transmission Line, and
then to the Orangeville Transmission Line. The Folsom-Elverta transmission line also connects
the SMUD grid, a component of the Sacramento County electrical system. The utility corridor
north of the prison is considered a building-restricted area and does not permit certain uses
incompatible with the safety, operation, maintenance, and construction of the transmission line
facility. PG&E’s only transmission line within the project area is the Halsey Junction-Newark
115 kV line. Additionally, WAPA has a 15-kilovolt Folsom-Nimbus transmission line and
associated fiber optic link within the project area. No natural gas infrastructure or facilities exist
within the project area.
Modifications to the wing dams and dikes could disrupt buried and aerial utilities
including sewage, water, gas, electric, telephone, and cable lines. Severing any of these lines can
result in substantial disruption to services provided by the utilities. Prior to initiating ground
disturbing activities, the contractor would coordinate with Underground Service Alert to insure
that all underground utilities are identified and marked. All utilities would be protected in place
and no disruption of service is expected. If for any reason utilities would require a disruption in
service, residents and businesses within the potentially affected area would be given notice of the
anticipated time and duration of the disruption before the start of construction.
Wastewater services would not be disrupted as a result of the construction of this project,
and no additional wastewater facilities would need to be constructed to deal with any project
water discharges. No additional water supply or landfill resources are needed to support the
project. The Dam Raise Project complies with federal, state, and local statutes and regulations
related to solid waste.

74

At the current level of design, construction would not access or realign the existing
potable water supply, sanitary sewerage, or storm sewer systems. Existing haul routes would be
used by construction vehicles to avoid overloading public roadways and causing delays to public
services. Therefore would be no effects to public utilities or services as a result of project
construction.

3.2.11 Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste
A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (Phase I) was conducted in accordance with
ASTM E1527-13 guidance. The Phase I did not identify any HTRW sites located at the project
area; however, due to historical mining activities, the project has the potential to contact
contaminated groundwater and soil. Elevated levels of arsenic have been detected in the
groundwater adjacent to MIAD.
Dredge tailings from placer mining in the area were used in the construction of the dikes,
a slope protection, and riprap bedding. Placer mine tailings do not typically contain elevated
levels of HTRW, and do not represent an environmental impact if disturbed.
During construction, there is potential for hazardous materials such as fuels, oils, or
paints to be accidentally spilled or released into the environment. Prior to construction, a
hazardous materials management plan would be prepared and implemented. The plan would
include measures to reduce the potential for spills of toxic chemicals and other hazardous
materials during construction. The plan would also describe a specific protocol for the proper
handling and disposal of these hazardous materials, as well as contingency procedures to follow
in the event of an accidental spill.
As a result, construction of the project is not expected to result in any adverse effects due
to HTRW. If any HTRW sites are identified during construction, appropriate response activities
would be conducted to prevent potential adverse effects. Lead is assumed present in all
underlying primer on the dam structure and is further addressed in Section 3.11, Water Quality.
The construction of the Dam Raise Project would not create a significant hazard to the
public or the environment through the routine transport, use, or disposal of hazardous materials
or release of hazardous materials into the environment. It would not interfere with any
emergency response or evacuation plans. The project would not expose nearby schools or other
sensitive receptors to hazardous emissions or materials. It is not located on a hazardous
materials site that would create a significant hazard to the public or the environment. Therefore,
the Dam Raise Project would not result in adverse effects to HTRW resources or to the public.

75

3.2.12 Public Safety
The construction of the Dam Raise Project would not create a significant hazard to the
public or the environment through interference with any emergency response or evacuation
plans. The project would not expose nearby schools or other sensitive receptors to hazardous
emissions or materials. The Dam Raise Project would not increase the risk of wildland fires that
would expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury, or death. Therefore, the
construction of the Dam Raise Project would little to no effect effect on public safety.

3.3 Recreation

3.3.1 Environmental Setting
The Folsom Lake State Recreation Area (FLSRA) is an important local, regional, and
state recreation resource. Figure 14 shows recreation area features in conjunction with the Dam
Raise Project dikes and wing dams. With an average of 1.5 million average annual visitors, the
FLSRA is one of the most popular sites within California for recreation in the State Parks system
(State Parks and USBR 2007). The popularity of FLSRA is largely due to easy public access,
being located next to a growing metropolitan area, and opportunities for year-round use.
Recreational uses include water-based activities and land-based activities.
Water-based activities account for approximately 85 percent of all visits to the FLSRA
(State Parks and USBR 2007a) and include boating, personal water craft use, water skiing, wake
boarding, sailing, windsurfing, swimming, and fishing. The remaining 15 percent of visitors
participate in a variety of land-based activities, such as hiking, biking, picnicking, camping, and
horseback riding. Approximately 75 percent of users visit the FSLRA during the warmer spring
and summer months. State Parks obtains revenue from use fees paid by the public, and rental
fees associated with concession operations in the FLSRA. FLSRA spans across three counties
(El Dorado, Placer, and Sacramento), as well as the City of Folsom.
There are three campgrounds in the FLSRA providing a total of 176 campsites that
accommodate tent, trailer, RV, and group camping. Peninsula campground includes 104 family
campsites. Negro Bar campground is comprised of three reservation-only group campsites, two
of which are designed to accommodate 50 people with the third site designed to accommodate 25
people. Beal’s Point campground includes 49 family campsites and 20 RV sites with full
hookups, sanitary dump station, three restrooms, and two shower buildings. The RV sites were
constructed as mitigation for the loss of the family campsites at Negro Bar that were removed for
the construction of the Lake Natoma crossing. Campers have easy access to all of the day use

76

facilities provided at Beal’s Point, including trails, the beach, picnic area, and snack bar. Full
capacity is often reached at all three campgrounds during the peak season.
There are 94 miles of existing trails within the FLSRA (Figures 12 and 13). Currently,
there are 46 miles of pedestrian/equestrian trails, 20 miles of multi-use trails, 16 miles of Class 1
paved trails, 9 miles of mountain bike/pedestrian trails, and 3 miles of pedestrian-only trails, of
which 2 miles are ADA accessible. Trails connect Folsom Lake to Lake Natoma and the Auburn
State Recreation Area. There is not a continuous trail connection around Folsom Lake.

Figure 14. Folsom Lake State Recreation Area General Features, Associated with the
Dikes and Wing Dams of Folsom Dam. Area above the red line and within the blue line
denotes boat camping areas.

Granite Bay and Beal’s Point are the primary visitor areas on the western shoreline of
Folsom Lake. On the eastern shoreline, Brown’s Ravine and Folsom Point are the primary
visitor areas.
77

Granite Bay. Granite Bay is the most popular day use facility within the FLSRA.
Annual attendance in 2011 was 499,630 visitors. Facilities include picnic areas; a guarded swim
beach for summer use; informal unguarded swim areas; equestrian staging area; hiking trails
including an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accessible trail, a pedestrian only trail;
parking; two reservable group picnic sites; and fishing and boating. There are also restrooms and
bicycle/pedestrian trails. The boat launch area capacity varies with water levels. Dependent
upon water levels, a maximum of 20 lanes of boat launch are available. Concessions in the area
include a snack bar and beach equipment rentals, boat and personal watercraft rentals, equestrian
trail rides, fitness training, and vessel repair and tow services.
The North Granite area is popular for fishing, horseback riding, and mountain biking and
hiking. This area includes an informal beach area at Oak Point, an equestrian staging area,
Doton’s Point, and Beeks Bight. An activity center just north of the launch ramps is available by
reservation for group use and includes a picnic area.
Trail facilities at Granite Bay include the equestrian and pedestrian Pioneer Express Trail
running north to Auburn State Recreation Area, 8 miles of unpaved multi-use trails running
through the area, and an unpaved ADA assessable, pedestrian only trail in the Beeks Bight area.
As with Beal’s Point, capacity is a major concern at Granite Bay, particularly during peak
season weekends when the day use parking area at Main Beach and the parking areas at the
launch ramps fill by midday. There is only one entrance to Granite Bay at Douglas Boulevard,
and significant backups occur along the roadway and onto Auburn-Folsom Road when the
parking areas fill.

78

Figure 15. Recreational Trail System within the Folsom Lake State Recreation Area
(Folsom Lake State Recreation Area, 2015).

79

In addition, there is no external access to the sprawling and relatively remote North
Granite area. Unrestricted vehicle access along the shoreline at low water is also a concern.
Unrestricted vehicle access causes erosion, potentially impacts water quality, damages
vegetation, and threatens cultural resources below the high water line.
Maximum usable elevation of the boat launches areas range from about 360 feet to 470
feet. When the reservoir surface level is at 466 feet, a 16-lane ramp and a 4-lane ramp are
usable. Elevations of the structures (other than the boat launch ramps), parking lot, and roads at
Granite Bay range from approximately 465 feet to 475 feet.
Beal’s Point. Beal’s Point includes day use facilities and a campground. Annual
attendance in 2011 was 244,148 visitors. Facilities include a guarded swim beach for summer
use, parking for approximately 400 vehicles, hiking trails, picnic areas, and campsites.
Concessions include a snack bar and beach equipment rentals. A large grassy area along the
reservoir includes picnic tables, barbeques, and restroom facilities.
The paved multi-use Jedediah Smith Memorial Trail begins at Beal’s Point and connects
to Lake Natoma and the American River Parkway. The unpaved multi-use Granite Bay Trail
connects Beal’s Point to other facilities along Folsom Lake.
During peak season weekends, the parking area generally fills by midday, causing traffic
to back up onto Auburn-Folsom Road and surrounding neighborhood streets. This also makes it
difficult for campers with reservations to enter the FLSRA.
The structures, parking lot, and roads at Beal’s Point range in elevation from 465 feet to
475 feet. When the reservoir surface level reaches 466 feet, water levels are just below the road,
parking lot, restrooms/dressing room building, and concessions building. At 466 feet, the beach
area would be inundated, although turf areas for picnicking, sunbathing, and other passive uses
are still usable.
Brown’s Ravine. Brown’s Ravine is home to the Folsom Lake Marina which provides
675 wet slips, 175 dry storage spaces, boat launch facilities, marine provisions, pump-a-head
station, a fueling station, a small picnic area, and restrooms. The Brown’s Ravine Trail is an
unpaved multi-use trail that extends four miles between Folsom Point and Brown’s Ravine. The
trail begins in the day use area at Folsom Point and ends at the Brown’s Ravine. The
equestrian/pedestrian Browns Ravine/Old Salmon Falls Trail begins at Browns Ravine and
extends twelve miles to Old Salmon Falls.
Folsom Point. Folsom Point, located off East Natoma Street, is the most popular day use
area on the Folsom Lake eastern shore. Attendance in 2011 from April through September was
80

85,917 visitors. Facilities include a picnic area with parking for 77 vehicles, and the largest
formal boat launch area on the east side of the lake with parking for 121 vehicles with trailers.
The maximum usable boat ramp elevation at Folsom Point is 468 feet with a minimum of
approximately 405 feet. Aquatic and day use facilities quickly reach capacity during peak
season weekends as it is a popular site for staging special aquatic events. During the summer,
California State University, Sacramento (CSUS) utilizes Folsom Point at Folsom Lake for their
youth wake board and water ski camp.

3.3.2 Environmental Consequences
Methodology
The FLSRA supports a diverse range of outdoor recreation activities and opportunities.
Impacts to recreational opportunities within the project area are evaluated based on temporary
and permanent changes to those resources that would occur during implementation of the project.
In making a determination of the extent and implications of recreational changes, consideration
was given to:


The closure or reduced public availability to recreational sites and access points;



Truck traffic and construction activities interfering with recreation activities and access
points;



Requirements for the construction or expansion of recreational facilities; and



Potential receptors in the area include staff, day use recreationist, campers, boaters and
other water based recreationists. All recreational groups were taken into account during
analysis of impacts.

Basis of Significance
Effects to recreational resources are considered significant if construction would:


Substantially restrict or reduce the availability or quality of existing recreational facilities
and opportunities in the project vicinity; or



Displaced recreation from sites affected by construction would substantially contribute to
overcrowding or exceed the facility capacity at other recreational sites (including sites
within the FLSRA).

81

3.3.3 Alternative 1: No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, the Dam Raise would not be constructed. Therefore,
the project would not disturb existing recreational opportunities. The conditions at FLSRA
would remain similar to existing conditions. The public would have continued use of the
FLSRA without any closures or access restrictions.

3.3.4 Alternative 2: Spillway Tainter Gate Modification and Combination Earthen Raise
and Concrete Floodwall
Under this alternative, there would be no effects to recreational opportunities due to the
modification of the spillway gates, as this portion of the project area is not open to public access.
Staging areas are on Reclamation’s work yard just south of the RWD, and site access is off
Folsom-Auburn Road through Reclamation’s Central California Area Office (CCAO), both of
which are not accessible to the public.
The implementation of Alternative 2 would not eliminate or severely restrict access to
recreational facilities or resources, or result in substantial disruption to the use of an existing
recreation facility. It would not have any significant effect on any nearby parks or require
construction or expansion of recreational facilities. Therefore, the construction of the tainter
gates and the modification of the spillway gates would not have an impact on these recreation
resources.
During the construction of the 3.5-foot raise, access to the northern half of the Granite
Bay State Park is via Park Road, a paved, two-lane road that runs across the crest of Dikes 1
through 3. Park Road would be closed for up to 2 years during construction. A detour for
vehicles and pedestrian traffic would be established near Dikes 1 through 3. At the conclusion of
construction, the detour would be removed and the area restored to pre-project conditions.
Potential detours (Figure 16) would be determined prior to construction and discussed in further
detail in subsequent environmental document, if needed. The location of detours will take into
account the lake water level, the ease of signage and relation of information to the public, the
potential impact on already heavily used parking lots, and emergency access issues.

82

Figure 16. Potential Dike 1 Vehicle Detour.

The trails on the tops of Dikes 4, 5, and 6 are heavily utilized by pedestrians, bicyclists,
and equestrians. These trails would be closed to the public for up to 2 years for the duration of
construction of the earthen embankment raise. Bicycle detours are currently in place that allow
for continuous use of trails around the dikes during construction (Figure 17).

83

Figure 17. Potential Trail Detour for Dikes 4, 5, and 6.

Dikes 7 and 8, and MIAD, would be closed for up to 2 years during construction. A trail
detour currently exists at MIAD, and this trail would remain accessible during construction
(Figure 18) given that the access would provide reasonable pedestrian and equestrian access to
Folsom Point. This detour area is not impacted by other, concurrent projects such as the
widening of the Green Valley Road.
84

Figure 18. The Current MIAD Bike Trail Detour.

If there are such issues, another detour would be proposed and assessed prior to
construction. As there is no access for vehicles or the general public at Dikes 7 and 8, a detour
would not need to be established. A concrete floodwall on the top of the LWD and RWD would
have no impact to recreation because these areas are not publically accessible. Construction
duration of the floodwall would be up to one year.
Folsom Point may be used for construction access to MIAD and Dikes 7 and 8, but it
would remain publically accessible during construction with the use of proper signage and public
education. The Brown’s Ravine recreational area and trails are adjacent to a potential access
point for MIAD at Sophia Parkway. If this potential access point is used, trail detours would be
established. Use of these access points would be temporary. Beal’s Point would not be used for
access.
Because trail detours would be maintained or established as necessary, it is unlikely that
the project would increase the use of other nearby recreational facilities to the point that
substantial physical deteriorations of the facilities would occur or accelerate. It is also unlikely
that trail detours would have a significant adverse effect on the surrounding environment.
With the exception of the tops of the dikes and dams, as well as the staging areas, all
existing recreational areas near the construction area would remain accessible to the public.
85

Because of the trail detours and other recreational opportunities in the area, it is assumed that the
majority of the recreation activity would not change and that most recreation users would
continue to visit the FLSRA and use the trails. Once construction has been completed, the tops
of the dikes would again become publically accessible.
The direct effects to recreation as a result of the implementation of this alternative are
considered significant because it would result in a severe restriction to recreational facilities and
resources due to a substantial, long-term disruption of existing recreation facility usage. All
trails in the FLSRA, including those on Dikes 1 through 6 and MIAD, are used extensively
throughout the seasons. Existing trails on Dikes 1 through 6 and MIAD accommodate
pedestrian, bicycle, and equestrian users. Additionally, these trails are approximately 20 feet
wide and allow for a large number of people to use them at once. Although trail detours would
be accessible, these detours would not offer the same level of service as the paved roads on the
tops of the dikes and dams, and are not suitable for all types of recreation users. This would lead
to both direct and indirect effects to those users who might choose to no longer recreate on the
trails. Additionally, the creation of new trails would have the potential to cause adverse physical
effects on the environment. Some trail users may decide to make their own trails or use trails not
designated for their type of recreation. This can lead to both direct and indirect effects due to
environmental impacts and may cause conflicts on existing trails leading to a potential increase
of calls for service by the State Park Rangers, or the increased chance of accidents on
unsanctioned trails.

3.3.5 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures
Although contractor staging would emphasize use of areas with no current public access
and away from residential areas, there may be temporary impacts to recreation access. In an
attempt to maintain as much public access to recreation areas and trails throughout the
construction period as possible, traffic control measures, grade separated vehicular and/or
pedestrian crossings, security fencing, and/or temporary alternate public access detours for
pedestrian, equestrian, bicycle, and vehicular traffic would be used.
To ensure public safety, warning signs and signs restricting access would be posted
before and during construction as necessary. Public outreach would be conducted through
mailings, posting signs, coordination with interested groups, and meetings, if necessary, in order
to provide information regarding changes to recreational access in and around Folsom Lake. The
detours, traffic control measures, access restrictions, increased signage, increased education, and
public outreach would help mitigate effects to recreational users of the FLSRA. The effects are
expected to be less than significant, however, significant effects could remain even with
mitigation, avoidance, and minimization measures in place. Once the detour routes are
86

identified, an analysis of potential impacts would be completed and, if needed, included in a
supplemental environmental document.

Sacramento County Ordinance, Chapter 19.12, Tree Preservation and Protection

This ordinance regulates the removal or disturbance to all species of oak trees native to
Sacramento County. These species include valley oak (Quercus lobata), interior live oak
(Quercus wislizeni), blue oak (Quercus douglasii), oracle oak (Quercus x moreha), and black oak
(Quercus kelloggii). The ordinance applies to any native oak tree. Typically, only trees 6 inches
in diameter at breast height (dbh), or greater, are protected.
Existing Conditions
Vegetation and Wildlife
This section describes the existing vegetation and wildlife resources in the project area.
This description is based on field visits and a review of pertinent literature, and gathered in
coordination with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in accordance with the Fish and
Wildlife Coordination Act.
The project area currently supports the following habitat types: oak woodland, riparian
woodland, seasonal wetland, chaparral, and annual grassland. In addition, developed areas are
87

present and may be devoid of vegetation or host non-native grasses and ruderal vegetation in
construction staging and material storage sites in the project area.
The Folsom Dam Raise Project footprint is dominated by annual grassland habitat
(approximately fifty acres) as well as stands of oak woodland (approximately five acres) with
scattered oak/pine woodland. Smaller areas (less than one acre each) of riparian woodland and
seasonal wetlands are found within the project footprint. More specifically, the northern portion
of the project area is predominantly oak woodland with pine, and the southern portion is
characterized by larger annual grassland acreages situated among stands of oak and scattered
pine woodland. In addition, urban/developed areas, Chaparral, as well as Lacustrine (open
water), and Riverine habitat also occur within the project area.
Oak Woodland and Oak/Pine Woodland
Oak woodland and oak/pine woodland is the largest woodland acreage affected by the
project. Oak and oak/pine woodland is characterized by various oak species and a single pine
species. Tree canopy cover is continuous, intermittent, or savanna-like with grassy understories.
The understory shrub layer is usually sparse to intermittent, and can include species such
as Mexican elderberry (Sambucus Mexicana), California buckeye (Aesculus californicus),
Pacific poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), and wedgeleaf ceanothus (Ceanothus
cuneatus). However, mesic soils under valley oaks can contribute to a dense herbaceous
understory and an increase in understory herbaceous layers. This lower tree canopy cover
includes non-native grass species such as cheat grass (Bromus diandrus), slender oat (Avena
barbata), soft chess (Bromus hordeaceus), and Italian thistle (Carduus pycnocephalus) (CNPS
2015). Other ruderal species include shortpod mustard (Hirschfeldia incana), telegraph weed
(Heterotheca grandiflora), and yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis). Bare ground or leaf
litter is predominant in areas of dense tree cover.
In project areas where pine comprised a two to eight percent crown cover with oak, it was
mapped as an oak woodland/pine association. Blue oak (Quercus douglasii) woodland is usually
dominant or co-dominant where it intergrades with scattered foothill/grey pine (Pinus
sabiniana). Other oak species include low densities of valley oak (Quercus lobata) and interior
live oak (Quercus wislizenii). Associations of blue oak and valley oak are relatively rare and
qualify for global and state rankings of G3 and S3 (CNPS 2015).
In project areas containing deeper soils, proportions of valley oak increases, and small
pockets of dominant valley oak woodland can be found. Valley oak stands form woodlands and
(rarely) forests along floodplains and terraces in seasonally saturated soils (CNPS 2015). Stands
of dominant valley oak were not mapped as distinct alliances in the project area due to small
88

size; however, valley oak associations with alder (Alnus rhombifolia), California scrub oak
(Quercus berberidifolia), poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), and Himalayan blackberry
(Rubus armeniacus) have global and state rankings of G3 and S3 respectively, indicating rarity
of these alliances (CNPS 2015).
Oaks in particular provide a highly productive mast food (acorns) utilized by organisms
found in the project area including deer, birds, and small mammals. It has been reported that
thirty bird species are known to include acorns in their diet (Verner 1980). In addition, oak
woodland and oak/pine woodland provides nesting cavities for birds and small mammals,
including bats, as well as dense, contiguous coverage that provides connectivity (wildlife
corridors) for larger, ranging mammals. Two dozen breeding bird species have been
documented in the oak woodland (Gaines 1977). Most species found in oak woodlands,
including deer and wild turkeys, also utilize annual grasslands.
Annual Grassland
Annual grassland is the largest acreage affected within the Dam Raise Project footprint.
Annual grassland lacks a vegetative overstory and consists of a heterogeneous mix of non-native
grasses, annual forbs, and wildflowers. The general grouping of California annual grassland
includes a large variety of plant species, the majority of which are non-native and considered to
be dominant species (J.O. Sawyer and T. Keeler-Wolf 2011).
Introduced annual grasses include wild oat (Avena fatua), ripgut brome (Bromus
diandrus), and rattail fescue (Festuca myuros) (CNPS 2015). Herbaceous forbs and wildflowers
within this group include both native species such as fiddle neck (Amsinckia spp.), western
ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya), popcorn flower (Plagiobothrys spp.), and non-native species
such as shortpod mustard (Hirschfeldia incana), yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis), and
dove weed (Eremocarpus setigerus).
Quail, wild turkeys, and deer are the most common species observed within the project
area grasslands; however, numerous wildlife species have been observed within the project area,
including various species of birds, snakes, and mammals.
Raptors (predacious birds) utilize expanses of grasslands for primary foraging of rodents
such as voles, and include red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), turkey vultures (Cathartes
aura), great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), and white-tailed kites (Elanus leucurus). Within
the grassland and water interface other bird species including Canada geese (Branta canadensis),
the great egret (Ardea alba), house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus), and spotted towhees (Piplio
maculates) can also be seen. Other animals include snakes such as gopher snakes (Pituophis

89

catenifer), rattlesnakes (Crotalus viridis), and common kingsnakes (Lampropeltis getula), as
well as mammals like the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis).
Riparian Woodland
Less than one acre of Riparian woodland is found within the project footprint. Riparian
vegetation occurs in association with mesic soils provided by flowing water sources.
Additionally, frequent regeneration of vegetation occurs where plants are located within flood
channels and scoured with flood flows. Within the project area and Folsom vicinity, riparian
vegetation has decreased substantially due to land development; this contributes to its rarity in
global and state rankings.
Riparian woodland consists of dominant tree species in the upper canopy layer including
the Fremont’s cottonwood (Populus fremontii), California sycamore (Platanus racemosa), and
valley oak (Quercus lobata). A subcanopy is also present and consists of less dominant trees
like the white alder (Alnus rhombifolia), and Oregon ash (Fraxinus latifolia) (CDFG 2015).
There is a typical understory shrub layer consisting of California wild grape (Vitis californica),
California wild rose (Rosa californica), California blackberry (Rubus ursinus), blue elderberry
(Sambucus cerulea), and poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum); however, in shallower soils
or frequently inundated banks, the shrublayer is primarily composed of willows and young trees.
Additionally, there is an herbaceous layer consisting of sedges, rushes, and grasses including
miner’s lettuce (Claytonia perfoliata), Douglas sagewort (Artemisia douglasiana), poisonhemlock (Conium maculatum), and hoary nettle (Urtica dioica) (CDFG 2015).
Forage coverage and nesting habitat is of high value in riparian woodland for birds such
as ruby-crowned kinglets (Regulus calendula), bushtits (Psaltriparus minimus), warbling vireos
(Vireo gilvus), Hutton’s vireos (Vireo huttoni), Wilson’s warblers (Wilsonia pusilla), American
robins (Turdus migratorius), and Bullock’s orioles (Icterus bullockii). Cottonwood trees in
particular, found in the project area’s riparian woodland, are used for nesting by several species
of owls, woodpeckers, and wrens as well as American kestrels (Falco sparverius), northern
flickers (Colaptes auratus), white-breasted nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis), oak titmice
(Baeolophus inornatus), hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus), western bluebirds (Sialia mexicana), as
well as western gray squirrels (Sciurus griseus) and raccoons (Procyon lotor).
Seasonal Wetlands
Seasonal wetlands occur within the project area next to drainages, seeps, springs, and
depressions of ponded water. Less than one acre of emergent wetland habitat is present in the
potential project footprint (Appendix D). Seasonal wetlands are characterized by erect, rooted,
herbaceous hydrophytes, excluding mosses and lichens. Vegetation, typically perennial, is
present for most of the growing season in most years (Cowardin et al. 1979). Seasonal wetlands
90

are characterized by non-woody, erect, rooted hydrophytes including sedges, rushes, and cattails
but excluding mosses and lichens. For regulatory purposes, wetlands are a subgroup of waters in
the United States defined as areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a
frequency and duration sufficient to support hydrophytic vegetation, and that under normal
circumstances, support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated
conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas (33 CFR
Section 328.3; 40 CFR Section 230.3).
A wetland delineation report (USFWS 2014) was produced on the landside of dikes 4, 5,
and 6, which identified a total of 0.083 acre of seasonal wetlands in two distinct parts adjacent to
Dike 6. Although these wetland features are outside the project area as currently planned, the
wetland features are within areas that potentially can be used for staging areas. No wetlands are
identified in the staging and construction areas of Dike 4 and Dike 5.
Other wetlands tentatively identified by the Northern Sierra Nevada Foothills Vegetation
project within the project area include a fresh emergent wetland of 0.53 acres in size, in a staging
area identified directly south of MIAD (Appendix D). This small wetland is shown to drain into
a larger wetland basin outside the staging area. Determination of this area has yet to be
conducted for wetland status. Saturated soils and wetland species were also found during a site
visit to drainage areas of the westernmost staging area of MIAD; these limited areas were not
mapped by the Northern Sierra Nevada Foothills Vegetation Project. Seasonal ponded standing
water has produced cottonwood and willow growth, along with a few hydrophytes at this site.
Willow and cottonwood trees were cut by the Phase 4 JFP contractor, and the remnant stumps
with vegetative regrowth are scheduled for relocation to linear wetland drainage adjacent to a
downslope housing development. These areas have not yet been formally evaluated for hydric
soils and hydrophytic vegetation to make a determination on wetland status. Substantial amounts
of wetland and seasonal riparian habitat has been removed from the south Folsom Lake vicinity
for dike/dam and residential development.
Urban/Developed Area
Approximately 54 acres of urban and developed areas are identified within the project
area and potential project footprint (Appendix C). The project area is found within the southern
portion of Folsom Dam Lake, of which a major portion is urbanized and the largest portion of the
recent development is residential. Urban and developed areas are intensively used land with the
major portions covered in pavement or by structures. This urban community includes
residential, commercial, and industrial development.
Parks and other developed areas, outside of the reservoir influence, are dominated by
horticultural or ruderal species. Developed areas within the project area include riprap slopes of
dams and dikes, roads, trails, or parking lots. Currently, several construction staging and
91

material storage sites are in use by the Folsom Dam modification projects, and they host nonnative grasses, ruderal vegetation, or are devoid of vegetation.
Recent dam and dike construction, and structure modification, has contributed to
substantial habitat disturbance and removal of riparian wetland and oak woodland habitat to
accommodate construction, structures, and material disposal. Dikes and dams are generally
devoid of vegetation with concrete, gravel, and compacted dirt surfaces but can include ruderal
species such as non-native invasive grasses, including the shortpod mustard (Hirschfeldia
incana), yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis), and tree tobacco (Nicotiana glauca). Twentynine mature oaks and cottonwoods were identified for removal, along with the loss of seasonal
wetland and riparian woodland acreage for dam modification projects in the project area.
Remnant habitat remains, primarily in a linear strip between residential areas and dam/dike
structures along the project area shoreline. They support avian species and resident wildlife of
lower trophic levels that are able to co-exist with urban disturbances.
A large portion of the project area consists of disturbed ground or is devoid of vegetation,
with the exception of sparse annual grasses and forbs. Various buildings, dams, water control
facilities, and related facilities have been constructed on or near the project area and provide
limited or no wildlife habitat. Equipment and structures on active construction sites of the
Folsom Dam Modification Project have attracted nesting bird species including Anna’s
hummingbird (Calypte anna), mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), house finches (Carpodacus
mexicanus), cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota), and Say’s phoebe (Sayornis saya); it is
feasible that predator avoidance overrides construction disturbance as an attractant to these sites.
In addition, bald eagles (Halieaeetus leucephalus) and Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) have been
sighted fishing, foraging, and roosting between open water and blue oak woodland directly over
and around active construction areas. Effects of construction disturbance on the bioenergetics of
these species have not been assessed. Many species have low tolerance for disturbance and
would not utilize habitat near active anthropogenic sites.
The south Folsom Reservoir shoreline has incurred substantial residential and dam/dike
development in the last 50 years. Urban and residential development has reduced habitat
significantly in the Folsom vicinity and it constitutes marginal habitat, or is no longer considered
suitable for wildlife species. Remaining habitat that is constrained by bordering urban
development also supports a concentration of dam structures and construction activity along the
linear shoreline. Incremental losses of oak, pine, and riparian woodlands and wetlands are at
issue for retaining wildlife populations in the project area. Oak and riparian woodland habitat
has been fragmented and reduced to a lower level of bioenergetics which does not sustain higher
wildlife trophic levels. Urban and current Folsom construction disturbance precludes residential
status for many wildlife species, particularly for those species sensitive to anthropomorphic
disturbance.
92

Continuity and connectivity of woodland habitat around the lakefront is currently the
most limiting factor for maintaining wildlife populations as development continues to fragment
remaining acreages. Remaining oak, pine, and riparian woodlands are heightened in importance
and critical to maintaining current wildlife populations. Wildlife populations and diversity are
compromised with incremental reduction and fragmentation of habitat acreage. Sufficient
habitat acreage to support bioenergetics for larger land-based mammals such as gray foxes
(Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcats (Lynx rufus), mountain lions (Puma concolor), and coyotes
(Canis latrans) are much reduced or no longer present. These species may occasionally utilize
contiguous, vegetated acreages for travel, cover, and for access to suburban food sources.
Wildlife species with a capacity for urban noise and activity, commonly referred to as urban
wildlife, are more likely to utilize the fragmented woodlands and ruderal grasslands.
Disturbance factors such as roads, urban noise, construction sites, night lights, and toxic
substances are additional contributions of developed areas which have reduced wildlife diversity
and numbers. Mortality factors are high for suburban wildlife due to collisions with vehicles and
power lines, toxic substances, depredation, noise, disturbance of nests and burrows, predation by
dogs and humans, and other factors. Small acreages of remaining habitat can function as
mortality sinks where species are attracted by useable habitat attributes but incur mortality due to
unexpected anthropogenic factors.
Chaparral
Less than one acre of Chaparral is found within the project area and does not occur within
the project footprint. Chaparral is usually found on drier sites with shallow, well drained soils
and south-facing slopes. Vegetation is characterized by a dense overstory of woody evergreen
shrubs, and understory growth is sparse or non-existent. In the project vicinity, species may
include chamise (Adenostoma fasiculatum), manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.), toyon
(Heteromeles arbutifolia), ceanothus (Ceanothus spp.), and scattered California scrub oak
(Quercus berberidifolia).

Lacustrine (Open Water) and Riverine
Lacustrine areas shown upon the Sierra Nevada Foothills map base indicate lake surfaces
(open water). Aquatic and emergent vegetation is not found within the project footprint and is
limited within the project area which abuts, but does not impede, on open water. Riverine
indicates aquatic vegetation within the stream channel as opposed to riparian vegetation on
stream bank or flood channels. The project footprint borders over 12 miles (65.756 feet) of
lacustrine shoreline. Aquatic vegetation in open water and streams is sparse or not present due to
93

fluctuations in the reservoir and intermittent flows within streambeds. Extreme seasonal water
level fluctuations can occur in the reservoir ranging from elevations of 357 feet to 466 feet. A
mix of barren area and sparse ruderal species seasonally vegetate the flood zone after reservoir
drawdown. Sporadic willows and cottonwoods can be found in the shoreline. The continuum
between lacustrine and riverine wetlands and woodlands is the most productive wildlife habitat
in the vicinity. Greater wildlife diversity is provided by native ecological areas that support
water access, aquatic prey, and mesic forage. Dikes and dams cover much of the lacustrine zone
in the project area.

Wildlife
The project area is found within the southern portion of Folsom Dam Lake, of which a
major portion is urbanized. The largest portion of recent development in the area is residential.
Recent dam and dike construction, and structure modification, has also contributed to substantial
habitat disturbance and removal of riparian wetland and oak woodland habitat to accommodate
construction, structures and material disposal. Twenty-nine mature oaks and cottonwoods were
identified for removal, along with the loss of acres of seasonal wetland and riparian woodland for
dam modification projects in the project area. Remnant habitat remains, primarily in a linear
strip between residential areas and dam/dike structures along the project area shoreline. They
support avian species and resident wildlife of lower trophic levels that are able to co-exist with
urban disturbances. Additionally, cliff swallows seasonally nest on the dam and gates.
Vegetative diversity within the project area provides a productive mosaic of habitat edge,
cover, water, food-rich sources, and functional structure for wildlife which has likely been a
salient element in retaining existing wildlife use of the area. Vegetation transitions as a
continuum, such as from oak woodland to grass land, which provides additional habitat diversity.
Oak woodland habitat is the largest woodland acreage affected by the project. Oak in
particular provides a highly productive mast food (acorns) utilized by species found in the
project area such as mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo),
western grey squirrels (Sciurus griseus), western scrubjays (Aphelocoma californica), and acorn
woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus). Verner (1980) reported that thirty bird species are
known to include acorns in their diet. Tree cavities in oaks, pines, and particularly cottonwood
trees found in the project area’s riparian woodland are used for nesting by American kestrels
(Falco sparverius), several species of woodpeckers, northern flickers (Colaptes auratus), whitebreasted nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis), oak titmice (Baeolophus inornatus), western gray
squirrels (Sciurus griseus), raccoons (Procyon lotor), hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus), wrens
(Troglodytidae), western bluebird (Sialia mexicana), and several species of owls. Two dozen
breeding bird species have been documented to breed in the oak woodland (Gaines 1977).
94

The woodland also provides hiding cover, thermal regulation, nesting cavities, and
structure for birds and mammals. Proximity to water increases this habitat value and increases
food diversity. Dense, contiguous cover can provide connectivity (wildlife corridors),
particularly used by larger ranging mammals. Cover forage and nest habitat is of high value in
riparian woodland for birds such as ruby-crowned kinglets (Regulus calendula), bushtits
(Psaltriparus minimus), warbling vireos (Vireo gilvus), Hutton’s vireos (Vireo huttoni), Wilson’s
warblers (Wilsonia pusilla), American robins (Turdus migratorius), and Bullock’s orioles
(Icterus bullockii).
Most species found in oak and riparian woodlands also utilize annual grass lands.
California quail (Callipepla californica), wild turkeys, and deer are the most common species
observed within the project area grasslands. Raptors utilize expanses of grass lands for primary
foraging of rodents such as voles. Raptors observed in the project area include red-tailed hawks
(Buteo jamaicensis), red-shouldered hawks (Buteo lineatus), turkey vultures (Cathartes aura),
great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), and white-tailed kites (Elanus leucurus). Also found
within the grass lands and water interface are Canada geese (Branta canadensis), great egret
(Ardea alba), house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus), spotted towhees (Piplio maculates),
gopher snakes (Pituophis catenifer), rattlesnakes (Crotalus viridis), common kingsnakes
(Lampropeltis getula), and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis).
A large portion of the project area consists of disturbed ground or is devoid of vegetation,
with the exception of sparse annual grasses and forbs. Various buildings, dams, water control
facilities, and related facilities have been constructed on or near the project area and provide
limited or no wildlife habitat, with the exception of cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota),
who build their mud nests on the surface of structures, such as the dam face and gates.
Equipment and structures on active construction sites of the Folsom Dam Modification Project
have attracted nesting bird species including Anna’s hummingbird (Calypte anna), mourning
doves (Zenaida macroura), house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus), , owls and Say’s phoebe
(Sayornis saya). It is feasible that predator avoidance overrides construction disturbance as an
attractant to these sites. Bald eagles (Halieaeetus leucephalus), osprey (Pandion haliaetus) and
waterfowl have been sighted fishing, foraging, and roosting between open water and blue oak
woodland directly over and around active construction areas of the Folsom Dam Modification
Project. Effects of construction disturbance on the bioenergetics of these species have not been
assessed. Many species have low tolerances for disturbance and would not utilize habitat near
active anthropogenic sites.
The south Folsom Reservoir shoreline has incurred substantial residential and dam/dike
development in the last 50 years. Urban and residential development has reduced habitat
significantly in the Folsom vicinity and it constitutes marginal habitat, or is no longer considered
95

suitable for wildlife species. Remaining habitat that is constrained by bordering urban
development also supports a concentration of dam structures and construction activity along the
linear shoreline. Incremental losses of oak, pine, and riparian woodlands and wetlands are at
issue for retaining wildlife populations in the project area. Oak and riparian woodland habitat
has been fragmented and reduced to a lower level of bioenergetics which does not sustain higher
wildlife trophic levels. Urban and current Folsom construction disturbance precludes residential
status for many wildlife species, particularly for those species sensitive to anthropomorphic
disturbance.
Continuity and connectivity of woodland habitat around the lakefront is currently the
most limiting factor for maintaining wildlife populations as development continues to fragment
remaining acreages. Remaining oak, pine, and riparian woodlands are heightened in importance
and critical to maintaining current wildlife populations. Wildlife populations and diversity are
compromised with incremental reduction and fragmentation of habitat acreage. Sufficient

mortality sinks where species are attracted by useable habitat attributes but incur mortality due to
unexpected anthropogenic factors.

3.4.2 Environmental Consequences
This section describes methodology, basis of significance, and effects to existing
vegetation and wildlife resources within the project area. Proposed active construction that
would potentially cause ground disturbance is referred to as the construction footprint.
Methodology
Assessment of vegetation and habitat was made from aerial photography and from
vegetative delineations conducted by the Northern Sierra Nevada Foothills Project (CNPS 2015)
as described under Section 3.4.1 above. Geographic Information System (GIS) overlays of the
96

proposed project were used to quantify acreages of affected vegetation (Appendix C). A
qualitative field assessment was not conducted on the entirety of the project area, but consisted
primarily of vegetation and wildlife assessment over a period of four years in the vicinity of the
current JFP Folsom Dam Modification Project, Approach Channel.
Project area vegetation was delineated by the Northern Sierra Nevada Foothill Project
(Klein, A., J. Crawford, J. Evens, T. Keeler-Wolf, and D. Hickson 2007). The Dam Raise
project footprint was mapped over delineated vegetation groups and alliances by the Corps
utilizing the mapping program from the CDFW interactive website (CDFW 2015). Acreages
were determined with ESRI ArcMap 10 GIS.
Mapped information provides vegetation alliances and general groupings of vegetation
types as assessed from dominant vegetative overstory and understory floristic composition
(Sawyer, J.O and T.Keeler Wolf 2009). An alliance is a category of vegetation classification
which describes repeating patterns of plants across a landscape (Sawyer and Keeler-Wolfe
2009). Plant species composition defines an alliance, incorporating the effects of local climate,
soil, water, disturbance, and other environmental factors (CNPS 2015). Vegetation assessment
was conducted on a spatial scale of a minimum of eight acre size parcels (Klein, A., et al. 2007).
Since habitat groups under eight acres in size were not included, an under estimation of
woodland and wetland vegetation acreages occurred due to the fragmented nature in the project
area. This size parcel also precluded site-specific identification of floristic composition down to
an alliance or association level. Floristic field surveys to determine alliance or associations were
not conducted for the Dam Raise project area. As a result, some mapping units are characterized
by a group or macro-group. California Annual Grassland represents a grouping of all grass and
herb species without a shrub or tree overstory. The macro-group of broad-leaf forest and
woodland was mapped to a specific alliance of blue oak (Quercus douglasii). An association
level was delineated for blue oak–woodland pine (Quercus sabina). Additional macro-groups
identified and mapped within the project area include Chaparral Shrub, Valley Foothill Riparian,
Wetland, Lacustrine (lake), Riverine (river), and Urban (developed) land.
Using vegetation data from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife that was input
into ArcGIS allowed for the creation of an interactive vegetation map of Folsom Lake. In GIS, a
construction boundary was made around the Lake’s perimeter in order to estimate the vegetative
areas that had been affected by construction. Using this boundary allowed for the calculation of
the area of the original vegetative cover when the dam was built, minus what had been removed
by the parking lot areas and urban areas. Next, assumptions were made for what kind of
vegetation was removed from the construction of the parking lots and urban areas. The acreage
of these areas was found using GIS and allowed for the calculation of the area of each type of
vegetation that was removed. Finally, the calculations could be made for original vegetation
acreage when the dam was built, the vegetation acreage removed by project construction, and the
97

percentage of total vegetation lost. Original vegetation acreage when the dam was built was
calculated by the vegetative areas that exist within the construction boundary now, plus the
vegetative acreages that have been removed from the parking lots/staging areas. The project
removed vegetation acreage was calculated by adding the vegetation losses expected from phase
VI of the JFP to the vegetative area lost from the parking lots/urban areas. Percentage lost was
calculated by the removal area divided by the total area.
Basis of Significance
Direct and indirect effects on vegetation and wildlife would be considered significant if
the alternatives result in any of the following:
1. Substantial loss, degradation, or fragmentation of any natural communities or wildlife
habitat.
2. Substantial reduction in the quality or quantity of important habitat with the result that
native wildlife could not live or successfully reproduce in the project area.
3. Interfere substantially with the movement of any native wildlife species (habitat
connectivity) or with established native resident or migratory wildlife corridors.
4. Conflict with any local, state or federal policies or ordinances protecting biological
resources, such as a tree preservation policy or ordinance.
5. Substantial effects on a sensitive natural community, including Federally-protected
wetlands and other waters of the U.S. as defined by Section 404 of the CWA.

3.4.3 Alternative 1: No Action Alternative
Under Alternative 1, No Action, the proposed construction would not occur. No construction
related effects (direct or indirect) to vegetation and wildlife would occur, and conditions in the
project area would remain consistent with existing conditions assessed in Section 3.4.2.

3.4.4 Alternative 2: Spillway Tainter Gate Modification and Combination Earthen Raise
and Concrete Floodwall
Alternative 2 is proposed to affect a construction footprint of up to up to 50 feet on both
sides of Dikes 1 through 8 and MIAD, and remove vegetation and disturb the ground surface at
98

up to thirty-one staging areas (Appendix C). The proposed project extends along the southern
Folsom Reservoir shoreline for a distance of over 12 miles. Approximately fifty acres of annual
grasslands, five acres of blue oak woodlands and blue oak-wood pine, and less than an acre of
valley foothill riparian vegetation and fresh emergent wetland within the project footprint have
the potential to be removed as a result of implementing Alternative 2 (Table 4). Smaller
vegetation type acreages, however, are understated in size as blocks of vegetation under eight
acres were not mapped as distinct units. The majority of the construction footprint acres are
intended for use as staging or material storage areas. With the exception of staging areas, the
construction of concrete floodwalls on the left wing dam (LWD) and right wing dam (RWD)
would not extend past the current dam footprints and would not require an additional removal of
vegetation.
The left wing dam and right wing dam surfaces are faced with large diameter rocks and
boulders, usually on steep gradients. Direct construction upon the 3.5-foot concrete wall on the
wing dams, dikes, and tainter gate installation is not expected to adversely affect wildlife
movement because the structure impediments preclude animal travel and use. Disturbance
caused by staging and stock pile construction activity, noise, traffic, and night lighting are
expected to displace wildlife species through multiple years of construction from year 2017 to
2020. Interference with water access by terrestrial mammals would occur for intermittent
periods from years 2017 to 2021. Loss of remaining woodland acres would substantially reduce
habitat cover used to access summer and fall water sources by terrestrial wildlife populations.
Disturbance from the project is expected to intermittently compromise water access to the
shoreline for a period of five years. The duration of construction-created disturbances would be
overlapping and continuous throughout Dikes 1 through 8. Project construction would begin at
Dikes 7 and 8 shortly after the completion of restoration efforts on the Folsom Dam Approach
Channel Project in the vicinity of Dikes 7 and 8. However, if habitat remains intact,
displacement would be temporary in nature and would not be considered a significant impact for
area wildlife populations.
Due to the fragmented nature of remaining oak, pine, and riparian woodland, Alternative
2 has a disproportionate potential to significantly impact remaining habitat connectivity by the
removal of additional woodland. Permanent loss of these small acreages would be significant to
local wildlife populations for access, connectivity, breeding, and foraging. Species that would be
most impacted by loss of woodland include turkey, bobcats, striped skunks, gray foxes, mule
deer, gray squirrels and some rodent species. Resident and migratory birds would lose foraging
and breeding areas.
Table 5 shows the approximate loss or conversion of vegetation acres since the Folsom
Dam and Dikes were completed within the project area. Wetlands show the greatest habitat loss
from the area, while riparian woodland was largely protected in a uniform block south of
99

Mormon Island Dam. There is added risk of wildlife population loss due to the linear
configuration of remaining habitat bordering an urban area; however, more intensive
bioenergetics analysis is necessary to quantify incremental or cumulative loss to wildlife
populations. With additional habitat decreases of even small or incremental acreage losses in
this area, it is expected that remaining species, such as deer and turkey, would be lost as the
bioenergetic requirements of individual species exceed the productivity of remaining habitat.
Because remaining habitat is narrow and does not exceed 2,000 feet in width, it is
substantially more vulnerable to anthropogenic impact than a configuration supporting greater
interior habitat area and wildlife cover. The magnitude of project caused disturbance would be
proportionally higher as a result of the linear configuration due to lack of habitat continuity
outside the project boundaries for cover, escape, or alternate use. Terrestrial and avian wildlife
would need to shift primarily north or south to escape construction activity as they cannot shift
into the lake or residential areas bordering residual habitat. As a result, because the habitat
configuration is constrained and remaining acres are low, habitat is highly impacted in
magnitude by incremental or small acreage losses.

Indirect adverse impacts to woodland vegetation would include increased erosion,
damage to roots of tree by heavy equipment, dust impacts to roadside vegetation, and invasion of
exposed substrate by exotic and noxious plant species. These impacts can be partially mitigated
to a less than significant level by providing dust control and a buffer for existing vegetation.
Sufficient staging acreage (157 acres) is available over 31 proposed staging areas to
provide adequate flexibility to avoid loss of woodland habitat. The majority of proposed staging
areas are currently delineated on disturbed and grassland substrates. Five of the staging areas are
proposed within the high water line of Folsom Lake for periods of low lake level and would not
impact vegetation or habitat. Tree avoidance measures and adjustment of staging area
boundaries, to prevent damage or removal to individual trees and woodland boundaries, would
substantially reduce impacts to remaining woodland acreage. Incorporation of mitigation
measures listed in Section 3.4.5 would reduce the permanent effects of the project to less than
significant. These mitigation measures require assessment of alternatives to individual oak, pine,
and riparian tree removal. The achievement of no-net-loss of woodland habitat, or less than one
quarter acre (or 5 trees) with Section 3.4.5 tree mitigation replacement would constitute a less
than significant-action with mitigation.
Annual grassland constitutes a substantially higher acreage within the project area.
Disturbance or removal of grassland can be restored/improved within a relatively short time
frame due to its annual nature. However, invasive and exotic weed growth occurs rapidly in
disturbed areas, and the spread of invasive species such as star thistle can preclude wildlife and
human use. Introduction of invasive plants can easily occur by vehicle and construction
equipment transport and can cause significant affects to existing habitat. To avoid significant
impact to grassland habitat, mitigation measures listed in Section 3.4.5 would be employed. The
project area would be returned to pre-existing conditions to the extent practicable at the
completion of this project and improved with the use of native flora. Staging areas and other
disturbed soil surfaces would be revegetated with native forb and grass species directly after
construction activities cease.
Construction associated with raising embankment dams and dikes can temporarily disturb
nesting birds in the project area. While some bird species acclimate to construction disturbance,
it has also been shown that noise generated by motor vehicles is sufficient to decrease breeding
bird fecundity (Rheindt 2003, Reijnen et al. 1995, Reijnen and Foppen 1994, and Ferris 1979).
Disturbance by vehicle and pedestrian traffic and machinery would particularly disturb nesting
raptors and turkeys in the project area. While some species abandon nests upon being disturbed,
others exhibit adaptation to area construction. Certain species of migratory and resident birds
[cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota), mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), Anna’s
hummingbirds (Calypte anna), Say’s phoebes (Sayornis saya), and house finches (Carpodacus
mexicanus)] have commonly nested on structures and construction equipment on the Folsom
102

Dam Modification Project and are expected to continue this behavior on structures and
equipment in Alternative 2. Cliff swallows are known to nest on supporting structures for the
Tainter gates. Compliance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act would not constitute a significant
issue because nest surveys conducted per Mitigation Section 3.4.5 would require nesting surveys,
and nest avoidance and protection, to prevent harm to avian species. In addition, State and
USFWS protocols for survey and protection of nesting raptors would be followed for the project.
Pre-emptive measures would be conducted continuously by a qualified biologist to prevent birds
from nesting on construction equipment and structures undergoing modifications.
Environmental protection training would occur for all construction personnel regarding avian
nests and environmental protection.
The modification of emergency tainter gates would result in a localized construction
footprint (Figure 19) for three years. Construction noise and traffic is expected to disturb and/or
displace local wildlife that utilizes oak and pine woodlands and grasslands over the project
duration; however, it is expected that local wildlife utilization of the area would return to preconstruction levels post-contsturction.

Figure 19. Tainter Gate Replacement Project Area.

Site access to the project area would occur through a Bureau of Reclamation facility on
existing paved roads and through the crest of the right wing dam. Staging areas, proposed for the
current Bureau of Reclamation work yard, abut the borders of remaining blue oak woodland.
Construction staging areas are proposed primarily for disturbed areas that appear to have
formerly supported oak woodland vegetation, but now consist of bare soil or ruderal vegetation.
103

Up to two acres of oak woodland savannah is included in staging area boundaries within the
tainter gate project area; however, this smaller acreage was not included in the Northern Sierra
Foothills Project mapping due to limited size and was delineated as urban acreage. Though
small in acreage, loss of these trees would contribute disproportionally to the reduction of oak
woodland habitat in the project area. Sufficient land area is available for staging and temporary
stockpiling in disturbed or open ruderal habitat to avoid removal of additional oaks, and would
curtail incremental losses of contiguous oak woodland habitat. Mitigation measures for
protecting existing trees would reduce these impacts to less than significant with mitigation.
Other construction activity would be conducted in developed and concreted areas of the dam that
would not cause impacts upon existing vegetation or habitat.
Alternative 2, Spillway Tainter Gate Modification and Combination Earthen
Raise/Concrete Floodwall project is not is not expected to cause substantial loss, degradation, or
fragmentation of any natural communities or wildlife habitat when conducted with mitigation
specified in Section 3.4.4. The USFWS has provided a Draft Coordination Act Report (2014)
(Appendix E) that specifies recommended oak mitigation measures. Native trees within the
unincorporated area of Sacramento County are protected by the County Tree Preservation
Ordinance and the Sacramento County General Plan Conservation Element. Compliance with
this mitigation and local ordinances would ensure that significant impacts would not occur.
Alternative 2 is expected to be less than significant with mitigation when measures specified in
Section 3.4.4 are applied. As a result of incorporating these measures, substantial reduction
would not occur to the quality or quantity of critical habitat with a result that native wildlife
cannot live or successfully reproduce in the project area. Construction disturbance would
interfere temporarily but not to a significant magnitude affecting the connectivity of habitat,
movement of native wildlife species, established native residents or migratory corridors.
Utilization of mitigation measures in Section 3.4.5 are necessary to prevent additional wildlife
habitat degradation in the project area.
A wetland delineation conducted by USFWS in 2014 shows 0.083 acres of seasonal
wetlands adjacent to Dike 6. Any delineated wetlands in the project area would be fenced and
signed for protection from construction activity. USFWS-delineated wetlands within the vicinity
of the project area would also be defined and signed for protection in the event a vehicle
trespasses from the project area. Alternative 2 is not expected to affect open or other waters of
the U.S. as defined by the CWA and its implementing regulations.
Local and State identified natural communities are present in oak and riparian woodland,
but with incorporation of mitigation, significant effects are not expected. The project area would
be returned to the pre-existing condition to the extent practicable at the completion of this
project. Staging areas and other disturbed soil surfaces would be revegetated with native forb
and grass species. The implementation of Alternative 2 is not expected to conflict with local
104

policies or ordinances protecting biological resources because Sacramento County tree ordinance
and USFWS recommended habitat protections and prescriptions would be observed. There are
no applicable Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs) or National Community Conservation Plans
(NCCPs) in the project area. The implementation of Alternative 2 is not expected to conflict
with any other approved local, regional, or state habitat conservation plan.

3.4.5 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures
The following avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures, including
recommendations from the USFWS Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act Report for the Folsom
Dam Raise Project (February 2015), would be required and conducted by the Corps or project
contractor, as appropriate, to reduce significant impacts to a less than significant level.
1. To minimize dust impacts to vegetation, wetlands, and breeding wildlife, dust control
measures consistent with SMAQMD fugitive dust control measures would be
implemented. Unpaved access roads would be frequently watered with raw water to
prevent visible dust.
2. To prevent importation of exotic and invasive plant and animal material, contractors
would clean all mud, soil, plant, and animal material from vehicles and equipment before
entering the project area. The Corps or its project contractor would conduct inspections
to ensure vehicles comply with this measure.
3. Before the project commences, the Corps and the contractors would identify native
vegetation and habitat areas to be protected. Detailed pre-construction site drawings
would be created identifying vegetated and habitat areas to be avoided, fenced, and
signed for protection. These drawings would be accompanied by a narrative detailing the
vegetative and wildlife protection plan. No off-road traffic would occur outside of
identified staging areas.
4. Disturbance, damage, and interference to plants and wildlife, including their habitat,
would be minimized. Areas that are not to be disturbed would be clearly defined by
signing, fencing, or other techniques. The contractor would avoid impacts to native trees,
shrubs, and aquatic vegetation to the greatest extent possible. Construction would be
implemented in a manner to minimize disturbance of such areas.
5. Woody vegetation at all staging areas, borrow sites, and haul routes would be enclosed
with protective construction fencing. Where practicable, a buffer would be provided; it
would be one and a half times the distance of the dripline. Temporary fencing would also
105

be used during construction to prevent damage to native trees that are located adjacent to
construction areas but can be avoided. Coordination on these areas would occur with a
Corps biologist prior to work commencement.
6. Except as identified in the project drawings or plans, no tree or shrub would be removed
without prior consultation and examination of alternatives with the contracting officer
and a qualified Corps biologist. To minimize tree removal related to construction/staging
purposes, all feasible construction or staging alternatives would be exhausted before
removal of any oak, pine, or riparian trees occurs. After consultation, any native trees
identified for removal would be replaced onsite, at a ratio of 1.2:1 for oak/grey pine
woodland, 1/1:1 for riparian woodland in kind, as defined by the USFWS Coordination
Act Report requirements (USFWS 2015). Plantings must be managed and monitored for
five years until determined to be established and self-sustaining.
7. Any tree or shrub, or part thereof, identified for removal would be removed during the
period of November through January (i.e. months within the designated non-nesting
season for local avian species) with the assistance of a trained arborist as applicable. Any
requested exceptions to these dates would be preceded by a survey conducted by a
qualified avian biologist to identify any active avian nests. If active nests are found,
vegetation would not be removed until any young have fledged.
8. Before and during the nesting season, a qualified biologist would conduct nesting surveys
along proposed construction sites, structures within the construction sites (e.g. gate
strutures and other parts of the dam subject to modification or disturbance), haul roads,
staging areas, and stockpile sites. If nests are found, work activity around the nests
would be avoided until the young have fledged. CDFW protocol survey for Sacramento
Swainson’s hawks would suffice for most preconstruction nest surveys for raptors. Great
horned owls in particular would be surveyed at an earlier date. The following protocol
would suffice for pre-construction survey for raptors:
A focused survey for Swainson’s hawk nests would be conducted by a qualified
biologist during the nesting season (February to August 31) to identify active
nests within 0.25 mile of the project area. The survey would be conducted for no
less than 14 days and no more than 30 days prior to the beginning of construction.
If nesting Swainson’s hawks are found within 0.25 mile of the project area, no
construction would occur during the active nesting season of February 1 to
August 31, or until the young have fledged (as determined by a qualified wildlife
biologist), unless otherwise negotiated with the California Department of Fish and
Wildlife. If work is begun and completed between September 1 and February 28,
a survey is not required.
106

9. Pre-emptive avoidance measures would be conducted before nesting season occurs to
prevent nesting on equipment and structures, such as the use of netting on structures to
prevent cliff swallow nesting activity. Any discovered nests would be reported to the
Corps biologist, and the nest would be avoided until assessment. No active nests would
be disturbed so as to cause disturbance, harassment, or nest abandonment.
10. A qualified avian biologist/environmental monitor, approved by the Corps, would be
employed up to a full time basis onsite, as needed, to ensure project compliance with the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act and other environmental mitigations and protections.
11. The Corps and the project site biologist/monitor would ensure that all construction
personnel undergo environmental protection training to be aware of all required
environmental protections (bird, wildlife, and vegetation protection) per these
mitigations, and by federal and state law. Any vegetation or wildlife habitat issues would
be reported directly to the Contracting Officer and Corps biologists.
12. Construction materials likely to lead to entrapment of wildlife would be removed nightly
as applicable. Wildlife escape ramps would be installed in construction areas that contain
steep-walled holes or trenches. All trash and food-related waste would be placed in selfclosing trash containers and removed nightly.
13. Native species specific to the project area would be planted through a revegetation plan
with a mitigation and monitoring plan to address revegetation of all disturbed or
destroyed vegetation within the project area. The revegetation plan would be
implemented immediately following construction in accordance with requirements in the
SWPPP and Mitigation, Monitoring, and Reporting Plan. Reseeded grassland areas
would be periodically monitored until 85 percent vegetation cover is achieved. The
targets will be established by the Corps, and the contractor will implement planting and
conduct monitoring to meet those targets for 3 years.
14. All revegetated or disturbed areas would be monitored during the contract warranty
period by a qualified biologist for percent coverage and invasive non-native plant species.
15. Assessment would be conducted of any drainage depression or channels that provide
hydrological contributions to wetlands. These channels would be maintained to assure
continuing drainage into off site wetlands. No entry or disturbance of wetlands would be
allowed within the project area or off site, and they would be fenced and signed.
Wetlands identified by the Northern Sierra Foothills project at MIAD would be assessed
before project commencement, and appropriate protections would be provided.
107

16. In the event that mitigation is not initiated within a two year period after each phase of
project completion, mitigation ratios would increase by 0.5:1 if initiated within two to
five years and by 1:1 if mitigation is initiated more than five years after the permanent or
temporary impacts occur (USFWS 2012).
17. All BMPs would be strictly followed to prevent spills of toxic substances. Appropriate
materials for spill containment and cleanup would be maintained onsite. No staging of
vehicles or equipment would occur within 50 feet of the water edge of Folsom Lake to
prevent accidental inundation and toxic infiltrations.
18. All restoration would be coordinated with the Bureau of Reclamation, USFWS, and
Sacramento County as appropriate.

ESA. In October of 2012, the USFWS recommended in the Federal Register (78 FR 4812) that
the beetle be delisted. After review of updated species information, the recommendation was
withdrawn in September of 2014 (79 FR 55879 55917). The range of the beetle extends
throughout the Central Valley and associated foothills, from the 3,000-foot-high contour in the
east foothills, through the valley floor, to the watershed of the Central Valley in the west
foothills. Elderberry shrubs are found in the remaining riparian forests and grasslands of the
Central Valley and adjacent foothills. This beetle is often associated with various plant species,
such as Freemont’s cottonwood, California sycamore, willow, and oak (USFWS 1999a).
112

Elderberry shrubs (Sambucus sp.) are the host plant for VELB and are a common
component of the remaining riparian forests of the Central Valley. Elderberry shrubs are also
common in upland habitats. Field surveys have found that adult VELB feed on elderberry
foliage, and perhaps flowers, and are present from March through early June. It is during this
time that the adults mate. The females lay their eggs, either singularly or in small clusters, in
bark crevices or at the junction of stem and trunk or leaf petiole and stem. After hatching, a
larva burrows into the stem of the elderberry where it creates a gallery, which it fills with grass
and shredded wood. After the larva transforms into an adult beetle, it chews an exit hole and
emerges from the elderberry. The life span of VELB ranges from 1 to 2 years. Studies of the
spatial distribution of occupied shrubs suggest that the beetle is a poor disperser (USFWS
1999a). No critical habitat has been identified for this species.
During two biological surveys conducted by USACE, USFWS, DWR, and Reclamation
staff on April 9th and 19th, 2014, a total of 22 elderberry shrubs were identified within or nearby
the project area. Twelve (12) shrubs were located at the Right Wing Dam, three (3) were located
at Dike 6, two (2) were located between Dikes 5 and 6, and five (5) were located at Dike 1
(Figure 20).

Bald Eagle.
This species is a permanent resident and uncommon winter migrant in California.
Breeding is mostly restricted to Butte, Lake, Lassen, Modoc, Plumas, Shasta, Siskiyou, and
Trinity Counties. About half of the wintering population is in the Klamath Basin. The bald
eagle is fairly common as a local winter migrant in a few favored inland waters in Southern
California. The largest numbers of bald eagles occur at Big Bear Lake, Cachuma Lake, Lake
Matthews, Nacimiento Reservoir, San Antonio Reservoir, and along the Colorado River. Bald
eagles are typically found in coniferous forest habitats with large, old growth trees near
permanent water sources such as lakes, rivers, or ocean shorelines. This eagle requires large
bodies of water with abundant fish and adjacent snags, or other perches for foraging. Bald eagles
prey mainly on fish, and occasionally on small mammals or birds, by swooping from a perch or
during mid-flight. This eagle also scavenges dead fish and other dead animals. Nests are found
in large, old growth or dominant trees, especially ponderosa pine with an open branch-work,
usually 50 feet to 200 feet above the ground. It breeds February through July, with peak activity
from March to June. Clutch size is usually two. Incubation usually lasts 34 to 36 days (Zeiner et
al. 1990a).
The bald eagle is known to occur within the project area and vicinity, and based on the
availability of adequate nesting sites and foraging habitat, would continue to utilize habitat
within the project area. Bald eagles have over-wintered in the area but there are no reports of
successful nest building activities. No critical habitat has been designated for this species.
Swainson’s hawk.
Swainson’s hawks are protected under the MBTA and are State-listed as threatened.
Swainson’s hawks inhabit grasslands, sage-steppe plains, and agricultural regions of western
North America during the breeding season, and winter in grassland and agricultural regions from
central Mexico to southern South America (England et al. 1997). In California, the nesting
distribution includes the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys, the Great Basin sage-steppe
communities and associated agricultural valleys in extreme northeastern California, isolated
valleys in the Sierra Nevada in Mono and Inyo Counties, and limited areas of the Mojave Desert
region (CDFG 1994).
Since 1980, based on nesting records alone, populations in California appear relatively
stable. However, continued agricultural conversion and practices, urban development, and water
development have reduced available habitat for Swainson’s hawks throughout their range in
California; this habitat reduction could potentially result in a long-term declining trend. The
status of populations, particularly with respect to juvenile survivorship, remains unclear.

115

In California, Swainson’s hawk habitat generally consists of large, flat, open,
undeveloped landscapes that include suitable grassland or agricultural foraging habitat and
sparsely distributed trees for nesting. Foraging habitat includes open fields and pastures.
Preferred foraging habitats for Swainson’s hawk include alfalfa fields, fallow fields, lowgrowing row or field crops, rice fields during the non-flooded period, and cereal grain crops.
Prey species include ground squirrels, California voles, pocket gophers, deer mice, reptiles, and
insects (CDFG 2000; England et al. 1997).
Swainson's hawk often nests peripherally to riparian systems, and are known to utilize
lone trees or groves of trees in agricultural fields. Valley oak (Quercus lobata), Fremont’s
cottonwood (Populus fremontii), walnut (Juglans nigra), and large willow (Salix spp.) with an
average height of about 60 feet are the most commonly used nest trees in the Central Valley.
Breeding occurs late March to late August, with peak activity from late May through July.
Clutch size is two to four eggs (Zeiner et al. 1990a). This species may use the riparian trees in
the project area as nest sites, and they may forage in the uplands.

3.5.2 Environmental Consequences
Methodology
Based on the USFWS list for the quadrangles within the study area (Clarksville, Folsom,
and Rocklin), a review of CNDDB occurrences within a 10-mile radius of the study area, and
biologist’s observations during reconnaissance-level surveys, three special-status wildlife species
were identified as having potential to occur within the study area and surrounding region.
Basis of Significance
For this analysis, a direct and indirect effect, based on professional practice and NEPA
and CEQA Guidelines to special status species, was considered significant if it met one or more
of the following significance criteria:


Have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or indirectly, on species growth,
survival, or reproductive success through habitat modification, on any species identified
as a candidate, sensitive, or special-status species in local or regional plans, policies, or
regulations or by CDFW or the USFWS;



Interfere substantially with the movement of any native resident or migratory fish or
wildlife species, or with established native resident or migratory wildlife corridors, or
impede the use of native wildlife nursery sites;
116



Contribute to a substantial reduction or elimination of species diversity or abundance; or



Have an adverse effect on a species’ designated critical habitat, if applicable.

3.5.3 Alternative 1: No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, the Corps would not participate in the construction of
the proposed project. There would be no construction-related effects to existing special status
species or critical habitat. The types of special status species and their associated habitats would
remain the same. Current dam and dike maintenance, recreation, and public activity would not
change. The effects of these activities on special status species and their associated habitat
would be the same; however, a PMF flood event may result in the loss of critical habitat, and
special status species could be adversely affected.

3.5.4 Alternative 2: Spillway Tainter Gate Modification and Combination Earthen Raise
and Concrete Floodwall
A draft Biological Assessment (BA) has been completed and sent to USFWS and NMFS
for their review and comment. The Corps would initiate formal consultation with USFWS and
NMFS in November 2015.
Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle (VELB).
Direct effects to VELB may occur if elderberry shrubs are incidentally damaged by
construction personnel or equipment. Impacts may also occur if elderberry shrubs need to be
transplanted because they are located in areas that cannot be avoided by construction activities.
Potential impacts due to damage or transplantation include direct mortality of beetles and/or
disruption of their lifecycle. Indirect effects to VELB could occur when haul trucks are driving
in close proximity to elderberry shrubs. This could disturb the beetle due to vibration and dust.
Long-term effects of the project may include reduced viability of elderberry shrubs due to
the placement of project area materials. Loss of habitat or species abundance may also occur due
to transplantation of elderberry shrubs. Although compensation measures include restoration and
creation of habitat, mitigation plantings would likely require five or more years to become large
enough to provide supporting habitat. Furthermore, associated riparian habitats may take 25
years or longer to reach their full value. Removal of plants may also fragment remaining

117

habitats, which may make dispersal more difficult. However, there is no designated critical
habitat for VELB.
The construction of Alternative 2 would potentially result in both direct and indirect
effects to elderberry shrubs, the critical habitat of the VELB. Direct effects would include
removal or damage to the shrubs during site preparation and construction activities near the
RWD, Dike 6, and Dike 1 (see Figure 16 for exact locations). Indirect effects would include
physical vibration and an increase in dust during operation of equipment and trucks during
construction activities. These indirect effects would be short-term during construction and are
considered less than significant with the implementation of the avoidance and minimization
measures discussed below. Direct and indirect effects would be considered potentially
significant if they cause adverse effects on elderberry shrubs and/or cause mortality or stress to
VELB residing in the shrubs. However, with the implementation of mitigation measures,
transplanting of shrubs, mitigation plantings, and creation of habitat, these impacts are
considered less than significant and not likely to adversely affect VELB.

Effects to Bald Eagle.
The bald eagle is known to occur within the general vicinity of the staging areas.
However, the staging areas are highly disturbed and do not provide high quality habitat for this
species. Replacement of emergency tainter gates would not have a direct or indirect effect on the
growth, survival, or reproductive success of the bald eagle. The construction of Alternative 2
would not cause direct mortality, long-term habitat loss, or lowered reproduction success of the
bald eagle. No critical habitat has been designated for this species. Although there are oaks
present within the CCAO yard, the primary staging area for this alternative, it is currently used as
an active maintenance and staging yard for the main dam and is highly disturbed habitat.
Because this area is already heavily utilized, it is unlikely that additional staging for Alternative
2 would further disturb any bald eagles in the area. Additionally, due to the disturbed nature of
the habitat and mobility of the Bald Eagle, project construction activities would not interfere
substantially with the movement Bald Eagles in the vicinity of the project area or affect the
population or diversity.
However, prior to construction activities, bald eagle surveys would be conducted within
the study area to determine the locations of potential nest sites. The surveys would be conducted
annually in close proximity to construction locations and within one-half mile of any anticipated
construction. If any active nests are found within one-half mile of construction sites,
coordination with USFWS and CDFW would occur to determine avoidance and minimization
measures, and construction would not be initiated until nestlings are fledged and the bald eagles
move out of the project area. Therefore, the effect to bald eagles is considered less than
significant.
Effects to Swainson’s Hawk.
The Swainson’s hawk is known to occur within the general vicinity of the project area.
However, there have been no recorded nesting sites above the Nimbus Dam on the American
River. In addition, the staging and construction areas for this project are highly disturbed and do
not provide high quality habitat for this species. Replacement of emergency tainter gates would
not have a direct or indirect effect on the growth, survival, or reproductive success of the
Swainson’s hawk. The construction of Alternative 2 would not cause direct mortality, long-term
habitat loss, or lowered reproduction success of the Swainson’s hawk. No critical habitat has
been designated for this species. Although there are oaks present within the CCAO yard, the
primary staging area for this alternative, it is currently used as an active maintenance and staging
yard for the main dam and is a highly disturbed habitat. Because this area is already heavily
utilized, it is unlikely that additional staging at Alternative 2 would further disturb any
Swainson’s hawks in the area. Additionally, due to the disturbed nature of the habitat and

119

mobility of the Bald Eagle, project construction activities would not interfere substantially with
the movement Bald Eagles in the vicinity of the project area or affect the population or diversity.
However, prior to construction activities, hawk surveys would be conducted within the
study area to determine the locations of potential nest sites. The surveys would be conducted
annually in close proximity to construction locations and within one-half mile of any anticipated
construction. If any active nests are found within one-half mile of construction sites, then
coordination with USFWS and CDFW would occur to determine avoidance and minimization
measures, and construction would not be initiated until nestlings are fledged and the Swainson’s
hawks move out of the project area. Therefore, the effect to Swainson’s hawk is considered less
than significant.

3.5.5 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures
The following measures were proposed by the Corps to avoid, minimize, or mitigate
significant effects associated with the Dam Raise Project to less than significant.
Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle.
The Corps would compensate for the loss of elderberry shrubs if they are removed. The
elderberry shrubs would be transplanted to a USFWS approved location and monitored for 5
years. Compensation would also consist of planting elderberry shrubs and associated native
plants at an existing Corps mitigation site in the American River Parkway, or credits would be
purchased at a USFWS approved mitigation bank. If the shrubs are not removed, and the
proposed Dike 8 disposal area is used, the following measures taken from the USFWS
“Conservation Guidelines for the Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle, July 1999” would be
incorporated into the project to minimize potential take of the VELB:


A minimum setback of 100 feet from the dripline of all elderberry shrubs would be
established, if possible. If the 100 foot minimum buffer zone is not possible, the next
minimum distance allowable would be established. These areas would be fenced,
flagged, and maintained during construction. When a 100-foot (or wider) buffer is
established and maintained around elderberry shrubs, complete avoidance (i.e., no
adverse effects) would be assumed.



Where encroachment on the 100-foot buffer has been approved by the USFWS, a setback
of 20 feet from the dripline of each elderberry shrub would be maintained whenever
possible.

120



Environmental awareness training would be conducted for all workers before they begin
work. The training would include status, the need to avoid adversely affecting the
elderberry shrub, avoidance areas and measures taken by the workers during
construction, and contact information.



Signs would be placed every 50 feet along the edge of the elderberry buffer zones. The
signs would include: “This area is the habitat of the valley elderberry longhorn beetle, a
threatened species, and must not be disturbed. This species is protected by the
Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. Violators are subject to prosecution, fines,
and imprisonment.” The signs should be readable from a distance of 20 feet and would
be maintained during construction.



During construction activities, all areas to be avoided would be fenced and flagged.



Any damage done to the buffer area would be restored.



No insecticides, herbicides, fertilizers, or other chemicals that might harm the beetle or its
host plant would be used in the buffer areas.



Trimming of elderberry plants would be subject to mitigation measures.



Elderberry shrubs that cannot be avoided would be transplanted to an appropriate riparian
area at least 100 feet from construction activities.



If possible, elderberry shrubs would be transplanted during their dormant season
(approximately November, after they have lost their leaves, through the first two weeks
in February). If transplantation occurs during the growing season, increased mitigation
ratios would apply.



Any areas that receive transplanted elderberry shrubs and elderberry cuttings would be
protected in perpetuity.



The Corps would work to develop off site compensation areas prior to or concurrent with
any take of valley elderberry longhorn beetle habitat.



Management of the area within the project impact zone would include all measures
specified in USFWS’s conservation guidelines (1999a) related to weed and litter control,
fencing, and the placement of signs.

121



Monitoring would occur for ten consecutive years or for seven non-consecutive years
over a 15-year period. Annual monitoring reports would be submitted to USFWS.



Offsite areas would be protected in perpetuity and have a funding source for maintenance
(endowment).

Impacts to VELB would be considered less than significant with the implementation of
the USFWS conservation guidelines for the beetle.
Bald Eagle, Swainson’s Hawk, and Special Status Migratory Birds
To avoid and minimize effects to Bald Eagle, Swainson’s hawk, and other migratory
birds, the Corps would implement the following measures:


A breeding season survey for nesting birds would be conducted for all trees and shrubs
that located within 0.5 miles of construction activities, including grading. Swainson’s
hawk surveys would be completed in compliance with the CDFW survey guidance
(Swainson’s hawk Technical Advisory Committee 2000). Other migratory bird nest
surveys can be conducted concurrent with the Swainson’s hawk surveys, with at least one
survey to be conducted no more than 48 hours from the initiation of project activities to
confirm the absence of nesting. If the biologist determines that the area surveyed does
not contain any active nests, construction activities, including removal or pruning of trees
and shrubs, can commence without any further mitigation.



If active nests are found, the Corps would maintain a 0.5-mile buffer between
construction activities and the active nest(s). In addition, a qualified biologist would be
present onsite during construction activities to ensure the buffer distance is adequate and
the birds are not showing any signs of stress. If signs of stress that can cause nest
abandonment are noted, construction activities would cease until a qualified biologist
determines that fledglings have left an active nest.



Tree and shrub removal, and other areas scheduled for vegetation clearing, grading, or
other construction activities, would not be conducted during the nesting season (generally
February 15 through August 31 depending on the species and environmental conditions
for any given year).

Impacts to Bald Eagle and Swainson’s hawk would be considered less than significant
with the implementation of the measures identified above.

122

3.6 Air Quality

3.6.1 Environmental Setting
Regulatory Setting
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has established primary
and secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) under the provisions of the
Clean Air Act (CAA). The CAA set emission limits for certain air pollutants from specific
sources, set new source performance standards based on best demonstrated technologies, and
established national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants.
The USEPA classifies the air quality within a control region according to whether the
region meets or exceeds Federal primary and secondary NAAQS. Primary standards define
levels of air quality necessary to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety.
Secondary standards define levels of air quality necessary to protect public welfare (i.e., soils,
vegetation, and wildlife) from any known or anticipated adverse effects of a pollutant. Federal
NAAQS are currently established for seven principal pollutants (known as “criteria pollutants”)
including carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2),
lead (Pb), particulate matter equal to or less than 10 micrometers in aerodynamic diameter
(PM10), and very fine particulate matter (PM2.5).
Responsibility for attaining and maintaining air quality in California is divided between
the California Air Resources Board (ARB) and Regional Air Quality Districts. Areas of control
for the regional districts are set by ARB, which divides the State into air basins. These air basins
are defined by topography that limits air flow access, or by county boundaries.
The following Federal, State, and local laws, regulations, and policies apply to the
resources covered in this Section. Descriptions of the laws and regulations can be found in
Section 5.0, Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations.


Federal:
o Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C §7401, et seq.
o Federal Tailpipe Emission Standards, 40 CFR Part 88
o General Conformity Regulation, 40 CFR Parts 5, 51 and 93
o National Ambient Air Quality Standards, 40 CFR Part 50



State:
o Asbestos Airborne Toxic Control Measure for Construction, Grading, Quarrying,
and Surface Mining Operations
o California Ambient Air Quality Standards
123

o California Clean Air Act, Health and Safety Code, Division 26
o Idling Limit Regulation, Title 13, California Code of Regulations


Local:
o El Dorado County Air Quality Management District Standards
o Placer County Air Pollution Control District Standards
o Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District Standards

Existing Conditions
The study area for the Dam Raise is located in the Sacramento Valley Air Basin (SVAB),
which includes Sacramento County, Placer County, and El Dorado County. Sacramento
Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD) is the lead on air quality
considerations for all air quality districts for the JFP and Dam Raise projects. Criteria air
pollutants relevant to the project were determined based on the existing pollutant conditions in
the SVAB. Toxic Air Contaminants (TACs) relevant to the project were determined based on
SMAQMD guidance and the project site conditions.
Air Pollutants
Air pollutants relevant to the project and their health effects are discussed below and
summarized in Table 8. In addition, sensitive receptors are defined and receptors near the
project area are identified.

Table 8. Summary of Air Pollutants of Concern for the Project.
Pollutant Class
Criteria Pollutants

Pollutant
CO, NO2, O3
(precursors: NOx,
ROG), PM10, PM2.5,
and SO2

Existing Condition
The SVAB has NAAQS and/or CAAQS non-attainment
designations for PM10, PM2.5, and O3. The SVAB is also
a maintenance area (formerly non-attainment) for CO.
Consequently, PM10, PM2.5, CO, and ozone precursor
(ROG and NOx) emissions are the primary criteria
pollutants of concern associated with the project.

TACs

DPM and NOA*

Local geology supports the formation of NOA, although
no NOA has been located within the project site.
The primary DPM sources associated with the project are
diesel-powered on-road haul trucks and off-road
construction equipment.

*DPM = Diesel Particulate Matter
*NOA = Naturally Occurring Asbestos

124

Criteria Pollutants: Criteria pollutants include CO, NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5, and SO2.
Ozone is a secondary pollutant that is not emitted directly into the atmosphere. Instead, it forms
by the reaction of two ozone precursors – reactive organic gases (ROGs) and nitrogen oxides
(NOx) – in the presence of sunlight and high temperatures.
Toxic Air Contaminants (TAC): A TAC is defined by California law as an air pollutant
that “may cause or contribute to an increase in mortality or an increase in serious illness, or
which may pose a present or potential hazard to human health.” The USEPA uses the term
hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) in a similar sense. Controlling toxic air emissions became a
National priority with the passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments, whereby Congress
mandated that USEPA regulate 188 air toxicants. TACs can be emitted from stationary and
mobile sources.
Ten TACs have been identified through ambient air quality data as posing the greatest
health risk in California. Direct exposure to these pollutants has been shown to cause cancer,
birth defects, damage to brain and nervous system, and respiratory disorders. TACs do not have
ambient air quality standards because often no safe levels have been determined. Instead, TAC
impacts are evaluated by calculating the health risks associated with a given exposure.
The TACs of interest to this project are diesel particulate matter (DPM) and NOA. The
Folsom Dam area has been identified as within an area where local geology supports the
formation of NOA, although no NOA has been located within the project site.
Meteorology and Climate
The project is located at the southern end of the Sacramento Valley, which is
characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. The surrounding mountains create a
barrier to airflow that can trap air pollutants in the valley when meteorological conditions are
right and a temperature inversion exists.
Air Quality
Within Sacramento County, on-road motor vehicles are the major source of ROG, CO,
and NOx emissions. Other equipment and off-road vehicles contribute substantially to ROG,
CO, and NOx emissions. Fugitive dust, generated from construction, roadways, and farming
operations, is the major source of PM10 and, to a lesser degree, PM2.5. Residential fuel
combustion also substantially contributes to PM2.5 emissions.
Based on 2008 to 2010 monitoring data of CO, O3, NO2, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5
collected at a monitoring station located 11 miles from the project site, CO, NO2 and SO2 in
125

Sacramento County did not exceed the applicable CAAQS and NAAQS, while O3, PM10 and
PM2.5 did exceed the CAAQS and/or NAAQS.
Sensitive Receptors
Some locations are considered more sensitive to adverse effects from air pollution than
others. These locations are termed sensitive receptors. A sensitive receptor is generally a
location where human populations, especially children, seniors, and sick persons are found, and
where there is a reasonable expectation of continuous human exposure according to appropriate
standards (e.g., 24 hour, 8-hour, and 1-hour). Sensitive land uses and sensitive receptors
generally include residents, hospital staff and patients, as well as school teachers and parents.
There are numerous sensitive receptors within 1,000 feet of the project area. Several
residences to the west of Vogel Valley Road, Haley Drive, and E Hidden Lakes Drive are within
600 feet of Dikes 1, 2, and 3. Residences on Lake Court, Lakeshore Drive, and Sierra Drive are
within 200 feet of Dike 4. Residences to the west of Auburn-Folsom Road are within 1,000 feet
of Dike 5, parts of the Right Wing Dam, and just over 1,000 feet from Dike 6. Many residences
just off of East Natoma Street are within 1,000 feet of Dikes 7 and 8.
Attainment Status
The General Conformity de minimis levels are based on the non-attainment and
maintenance classification of the air basin. General conformity thresholds are for ozone
precursors. The request for reclassification of the 8-hour ozone non-attainment area from
“serious” to “severe” was granted by USEPA on June 1, 2010 and as a result, the GRC de
minimis thresholds for ozone, VOC, and NOX reduced from 50 tons per year to 25 tons per year.
The Lower SVAB is designated as a “severe” non-attainment for the O3 NAAQS (for the
2008 8-hour O3 standard) and as non-attainment for PM2.5 NAAQS. In 2005, the 1-hour O3
NAAQS (established in 1997) was revoked and is no longer applicable. In 2015, the 8-hour O3
NAAQS was revoked and is no longer applicable. However, USEPA is in the process of
reviewing CARB’s request, on behalf of SMAQMD, to formally designate the area as in PM10
attainment. The county is a designated maintenance area for the CO NAAQS. Sacramento
County is in non-attainment for the O3, PM2.5, and PM10 CAAQS, and in attainment for all
other criteria pollutants (CARB 2015; USEPA 2012a; USEPA 2012b).

State Implementation Plans
Due to the nonattainment or maintenance area designations for SVAB discussed above,
SMAQMD is required to prepare SIPs for O3, PM10, and PM2.5, and a maintenance plan for
CO. The status of these SIPs is summarized below (SMAQMD 2015).


O3: A final attainment designation for the 2008 O3 NAAQS of 0.075 ppm has not been
provided by USEPA and an attainment plan has not been prepared.

127



PM10: USEPA is in the process of reviewing a maintenance plan and evaluating a CARB
request to change the designation to attainment.



PM2.5: SMAQMD prepared a PM2.5 attainment plan for submission in 2012. A final
rule for Determination of Attainment was submitted July 2013 and the rule became final
in August 2013.



CO: A maintenance plan was approved by the USEPA in 2005 and is still applicable.

Air Emission Thresholds for Federal and Local Criteria Pollutants
The Federal standards and local thresholds for short-term construction projects in
Sacramento, El Dorado, and Placer Counties are shown in Table 10 below. Local emissions are
calculated per county and compared to their thresholds, whereas Federal standards look at the
project emissions in total on an annual basis.

3.6.2 Environmental Consequences
Methodology
The methods for evaluating impacts are intended to satisfy the Federal and State air
quality requirements, including the Federal General Conformity Rule, and to disclose effects for
NEPA and CEQA.
In coordination with SMAQMD, the Road Construction Emissions Model, Version
7.1.5.1, was used to calculate construction emissions. Daily and totally project emissions were
estimated from appropriate emissions factors using the model or USEPA AP-42 guidance, the
type of equipment being operated, the level of equipment activity, and the associated
construction schedules. The model’s estimated criteria pollutants from a variety of constructedrelated emission sources including mobile sources (trucks, worker vehicles, etc.), construction
equipment, and/or fugitive dust sources. The following construction sources and activities were
analyzed for emissions:


Onsite construction off-road equipment emissions (all criteria pollutants)



Onsite pickup trucks, onsite haul trucks, and off site haul trucks emissions (all
criteria pollutants)



Offsite worker vehicle emissions (all criteria pollutants)



Onsite pickup trucks, onsite haul trucks, off site haul truck, and off site worker
vehicles entrained fugitive dust emissions for paved and unpaved road entrained
dust (PM10 and PM2.5)



Onsite material storage piles handling and wind erosion (PM10 and PM2.5)



Onsite excavation (cut/fill) fugitive dust (PM10 and PM2.5)

Borrow and disposal sites have not been identified at this time but are assumed to be
located within a 30 mile radius from the project areas. Emissions associated with material
borrow activities would fall within SMAQMD.
Basis of Significance
A project would significantly affect air quality if it would:
130






Violate any ambient air quality standard;
Contribute on a long-term basis to any existing or projected air quality violation;
Expose sensitive receptors (such as schools, residences, or hospitals) to substantial
pollutant concentrations; or
Not conform to applicable Federal and State standards or local thresholds on a long-term
basis.

3.6.3 Alternative 1: No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, the project would not be constructed and there would
be no construction-related effects on air quality in the project area. Air quality would continue to
be influenced by climatic and geographic conditions, local and regional emissions from vehicles
and households, and local commercial and industrial land uses. Air quality is expected to
improve in the future based on the stricter standards implemented by CARB and SMAQMD. A
possible flood event may temporarily increase the amount of vehicle emissions during floodfighting activities, as well as increase the amount of vehicle emissions resulting from clean-up
activities.

3.6.4 Alternative 2: Spillway Tainter Gate Modification and Combination Earthen
Raise/Concrete Floodwall
Short-term construction emissions were calculated by obtaining an estimated inventory of
required construction equipment, the hours of operation, and the horsepower of each piece of
equipment for each construction phase. The data was incorporated into the SMAQMD Road
Construction Emission Model, Version 7.1.5.1, recommended by SMAQMD. Combustion
emissions would result from the use of construction equipment, truck haul trips, and worker
vehicle trips to and from the construction site. Exhaust emissions from these sources would
include ROG, NOX, and PM10. Exhaust emissions would vary depending on the number and
type of equipment, the duration of its use, and the number of construction worker and haul trips
to and from the construction site. Combustion emissions from heavy equipment and construction
worker commute trips would vary from day to day, and would temporarily contribute
incrementally to regional ozone concentrations over the construction period.
Maximum daily emissions (lbs/day) and total construction emissions (tons/year) are
estimated for ROG, NOX, PM10, and PM2.5 and GHG CO2 (Climate Change Section 3.7) to
evaluate emissions against SMAQMD, El Dorado, and Placer County thresholds. All emissions
from activities associated with the implementation of Alternative 2 are shown in Appendix G and

131

in Tables 11 -14 below, except for emissions related to AAQA, which require dispersion
modeling. Dispersion modeling would be conducted with General Conformity.

Construction emissions associated with Alternative 2 would last approximately 5 years.
At the time of this analysis, this period begins in 2017 and ends in 2021. Daily emissions are
exceeded for NOx, CO2, and PM levels in all five years of the project if unmitigated (Appendix
G, Tables 11-14). Therefore, construction of the alternative would result in a significant effect if
unmitigated. With the implemntations of BMPs, emissions would not be reduced below to
below threshold levels, remaining a significant effect.
For the Folsom Dam Raise Project, the entire construction footprint of Dikes 1 through 8,
the LWD, RWD, and MIAD, along with the Emergency Spillway, were analyzed under the CAA
to determine the worst case scenario for air quality impacts. The analysis conducted determined
that the emissions associated with construction of this action would be above the de minimis
133

level-emission reductions were incorporated into the project analysis. Based upon preliminary
analysis of air quality effects from the proposed action, it was evident that mitigated construction
actions would result in exceeding SMAQMD standards for NOx, etc. It is likely that during the
Project, sensitive receptors, such as residents within 1,000 feet of construction, will experience
short-term increases in emissions of criteria pollutants. However; compliance with the CAA
would be accomplished with the completion of a General Conformity Analysis, or with the
inclusion in the State Implementation Plan, therefore, impacts to air quality would be less than
significant with this mitigation.
General Conformity
The Federal CAA requires Federal agencies to ensure that their actions conform to
applicable implementation plans for the achievement and maintenance of the NAAQS for criteria
pollutants. To achieve conformity, a Federal action must not contribute to new violations of
NAAQS, increase the frequency or severity of existing violations, or delay timely attainment of
standards in the area of concern (for example, a state or a smaller air quality region). Federal
actions need to demonstrate conformity to any State Implemenation Plan (SIP) of the regional air
basin. Each action must be reviewed to determine whether it 1) qualifies for an exemption listed
in the General Conformity Rule (GCR), 2) results in emissions that are below the GCR de
minimis emissions thresholds, or 3) would produce emissions above the GCR de minimis
thresholds applicable to the specific area.
The proposed action is located in an area with a designated Federal status of severe
nonattainment for O3 (8-hour standard). In addition the State has designated the area as
nonattainment for PM10 and PM2.5. As stated above, the proposed action would not be reduced
below the USEPA’s general conformity de minimis threshold. As a result, the Dam Raise would
complete a general conformity determination (GCD) report. While the GCD is being prepared,
all mitigation measures, including the ability to mitigate back to zero if thresholds are exceeded,
would be required. The report would include project emission estimates in 2017 through the
completion of the project in 2021, and would be completed prior to the start of construction in
2017.

3.6.5 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures
Combustion emissions would result from the use of construction equipment, truck haul
trips to and from the borrow sites, and worker vehicle trips to and from the construction sites.
The contractor would submit a list of vehicles to be used in the construction project for approval
by USACE and SMAQMD. In order to achieve the required reductions in emissions, the

134

following BMPs would be followed, in addition to the SMAQMD Guidance for Construction
GHG Emissions Reductions (Section 3.7.5) (SMAQMD 2015b).


Maintain all construction equipment in proper working condition according to
manufacturer’s specifications. The equipment would be checked by a certified mechanic and
determined to be running in proper condition before it is operated.



Use diesel-fueled equipment manufactured in 2003 or later, or retrofit equipment
manufactured prior to 2003 with diesel-oxidation catalysts; use low-emission diesel products,
alternative fuels, after-treatment products, and/or other options as they become available.



Any equipment found to exceed 40 percent opacity (or Ringelmann 2.0) would be repaired
immediately, and USACE and SMAQMD would be notified within 48 hours of identification
of non-compliant equipment.



Any remaining emissions over the GCR de minimis NOx threshold would be reduced to zero
through the purchase of offsets or other offsite mitigation. Additionally, any remaining
emissions over the PM threshold would be reduced to zero through the purchase of offsets or
other offsite mitigation. The contractor would be responsible for payment of any required
mitigation and administrative fees.



At least 48 hours prior to the use of heavy-duty, off-road equipment, the contractor would
provide SMAQMD with the anticipated construction timeline including start date, and the
names and phone numbers of the project manager and onsite foreman. SMAQMD and/or
other officials may conduct periodic site inspections to determine compliance (SMAQMD
2015a). SMAQMD’s Basic Construction Emissions Control Practices.

Basic Construction Emission Control Practices
The SMAQMD requires construction projects to implement basic construction emission
control practices to control fugitive dust and diesel exhaust emissions. The Corps would comply
with the following control measures for the project:


Water all exposed surfaces twice daily. Exposed surfaces include but are not limited
to: soil piles, graded areas, unpaved parking areas, staging areas, and access roads.



Cover or maintain at least two feet of free board space on haul trucks transporting
soil, sand, or other loose material on the site. Any haul trucks that would travel along
freeways or major roadways should be covered.

135



Use wet power vacuum street sweepers to remove any visible trackout mud or dirt
from adjacent public roads at least once a day. Use of dry power sweeping is
prohibited.



Complete all roadways, driveways, sidewalks, or parking lots to be paved as soon as
possible. In addition, building pads should be laid as soon as possible after grading
unless seeding or soil binders are used.



Minimize idling time either by shutting equipment off when not in use, or reducing
the time of idling to 5 minutes [required by California Code of Regulations, Title 13,
sections 2449(d)(3) and 2485]. Provide clear signage that posts this requirement for
workers at the site entrances.



Maintain all construction equipment in proper working condition according to the
manufacturer’s specifications. The equipment must be checked by a certified
mechanic and determined to be running in proper condition before it is operated.

SMAQMD Exhaust Emission Mitigation Measures
SMAQMD recommends that the project implement a set of Enhanced Exhaust Control
Practices to further reduce hydrocarbon emissions. The Enhanced Exhaust Control Practices that
would be implemented by the contractor during construction include the following:


Provide a plan for approval by the lead agency and SMAQMD demonstrating that the
heavy-duty (50 horsepower [hp] or more) off-road vehicles to be used in the
construction project, including owned, leased, and subcontractor vehicles, would
achieve a project-wide fleet-average 20 percent NOX reduction and 45 percent
particulate reduction compared to the most recent California Air Resources Board
(ARB) fleet average. Acceptable options for reducing emissions may include use of
late model engines, low-emission diesel products, alternative fuels, engine retrofit
technology, after-treatment products, and/or other options as they become available.
The SMAQMD’s Construction Mitigation Calculator can be used to identify an
equipment fleet that achieves this reduction.



Submit to the lead agency and SMAQMD a comprehensive inventory of all off-road
construction equipment, equal to or greater than 50 hp, that would be used an
aggregate of 40 or more hours during any portion of the construction project. The
inventory would include the horsepower rating, engine model year, and projected
hours of use for each piece of equipment. The inventory would be updated and
submitted monthly throughout the duration of the project, except that an inventory
136

would not be required for any 30-day period in which no construction activity occurs.
At least 48 hours prior to the use of subject heavy-duty, off-road equipment, the
contractor would provide SMAQMD with the anticipated construction timeline
including start date, and the names and phone numbers of the project manager and
onsite foreman. The SMAQMD’s Model Equipment List can be used to submit this
information.


Ensure that emissions from all off-road diesel-powered equipment used on the project
site do not exceed 40 percent opacity for more than three (3) minutes in any one (1)
hour. Any equipment found to exceed 40 percent opacity (or Ringelmann 2.0) would
be repaired immediately. Non-compliant equipment would be documented and a
summary provided to the lead agency and SMAQMD monthly. A visual survey of all
in-operation equipment would be made at least weekly, and a monthly summary of
the visual survey results would be submitted throughout the duration of the project,
except that the monthly summary would not be required for any 30-day period in
which no construction activity occurs. The monthly summary would include the
quantity and type of vehicles surveyed as well as the date of each survey. The
SMAQMD and/or other officials may conduct periodic site inspections to determine
compliance. Nothing in this section would supersede other SMAQMD or State rules
or regulations.



If at the time of construction SMAQMD has adopted a regulation applicable to
construction emissions, compliance with the regulation may completely or partially
replace this mitigation. Consultation with the SMAQMD prior to construction would
be necessary to make this determination.

SMAQMD Construction Area Particulate Matter Mitigation Measures
If the project’s construction contractor determines that the construction activities would
actively disturb more than 15 acres per day, then the contractor would be required to conduct
PM10 and PM2.5 dispersion modeling. If that modeling shows violations of SMAQMD’s PM10
or PM2.5 NAAQS thresholds, then the contractor would be required to implement sufficient
mitigation (SMAQMD 2011) to avoid exceeding SMAQMD significance thresholds.
NOX Mitigations Fee to SMAQMD
As of July 1, 2016, the mitigation fee rate is $18,260 per ton of emissions. The
Contractor would provide payment of the appropriate SMAQMD-required NOx mitigation fee to
offset the project’s NOx emissions when they exceed SMAQMD’s threshold of 85 lbs/day.
Estimated calculations of emissions for these mitigation fees are included under the alternative’s
137

effects analysis in Appendix G. The NOX mitigation fee applies to all emissions from the
project: on-road (on and off site), off-road, portable, marine, and stationary equipment and
vehicles.

On February 18, 2010, Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) released the “Draft
Guidance for GHG emissions and Climate Change Impacts” regarding the consideration of
138

GHGs in NEPA documents for Federal actions. The draft guidelines include a presumptive
annual threshold of 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions from a
proposed action to trigger a quantitative analysis (CEQ, 2010).
State
On June 1, 2005, Executive Order S-3-05 (E.O. S-3-05) was signed by Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger. “The order established greenhouse gas reduction targets, created the Climate
action plan Team, and directed the Secretary of Cal/EPA to coordinate efforts with meeting the
targets with the heads of other state agencies. The order also requires the Secretary to report back
to the Governor and Legislature biannually on progress toward meeting the GHG targets, GHG
impacts to California, and Mitigation and Adaptation Plans.” (California Climate Change Portal,
2015)
The following year, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, commonly referred to as
Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), required the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to develop
regulations and policies to regulate sources of emissions of GHGs that cause global warming.
CARB was directed to create a program that would reduce statewide emissions to 1990 levels by
2020, a reduction of approximately 21.7% below emissions expected under a “business as usual
scenario.” These reductions were to be met by adopting regulations that maximize feasible
technology and are cost effective while improving efficiency in land use sectors (i.e. energy,
transportation, waste).
In addition, AB 32 directed CARB to develop a scoping plan to help lay out California’s
strategy for meeting the goals. This scoping plan was to be updated every 5 years and would be
funded through fees collected annually from large emitters of GHGs such as oil refineries,
electricity power plants, cement plants, and food processors.
Senate Bill 97 (SB 97) approved by legislature in 2007, was an act relating to the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) that addressed GHGs. Specifically, SB 97
required Office of Planning and Research to prepare and develop proposed guidelines addressing
the analysis and mitigation of greenhouse gases for the implementation of CEQA by public
agencies. The Amendments to the CEQA Guidelines were adopted by the California Natural
Resources Agency (formerly Natural Resources Agency) March 18, 2010.
Local
The local air quality districts within the project boundaries oversee air quality standards
in their respective areas, and also provide guidance for addressing GHG emissions and
mitigation in CEQA documents. While Placer and Eldorado air quality districts have not
adopted thresholds of significance for GHGs, SMAQMD has. On October 23, 2014, SMAQMD
adopted Resolution 2014-028 that established recommended thresholds for GHGs. Following in
November 2014, SMAQMD updated Chapter 6 of SMAQMD’s CEQA Guide to Air Quality
139

Assessment to provide guidance for agencies to specifically deal with GHG emissions, and
included SMAQMD’s recommended thresholds.
Potential Environmental Effects
Guidance released by CEQ regarding the consideration of GHG’s in NEPA documents
for Federal actions include a presumptive threshold of 25,000 metric tons of CO2e emissions
from a proposed action to trigger a quantitative analysis (CEQ, 2010).
CEQA requires that lead agencies consider the reasonably foreseeable adverse
environmental effects of projects they are considering for approval. CEQA requires that the
cumulative impacts of GHG, even impacts that are relatively small on a global basis, need to be
considered.

Existing Conditions
Warming of the climate system is now considered to be unequivocal (IPCC, 2007).
Global average surface temperature has increased approximately 1.33° F over the last 100 years,
with the most severe warming occurring in the most recent decades. In the 12 years between
1995 and 2006, 11 years ranked among the warmest years in the instrumental record of global
average surface temperature (going back to 1850). Continued warming is projected to increase
global average temperature between 2 and 11 °F over the next 100 years (IPCC 2007).
The causes of this warming have been identified as both natural processes and as the
result of human actions. Increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the Earth’s
atmosphere are thought to be the main cause of human-induced climate change. GHGs naturally
trap heat by impeding the exit of solar radiation that has hit the Earth and is reflected back into
space. The six principal GHGs of concern are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous
oxide (N2O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons
(PFCs).

3.7.2 Environmental Consequences
Methodology
The proposed construction would use large, diesel-fueled construction vehicles during all
phases of the project. The partial degrade of dike crowns would result in emissions from
bulldozers and graders, as well as emissions from the haul trucks used to dispose of material.
The construction of a concrete floodwall would result in emissions from haul trucks and other
equipment, as well as the diesel-powered mixers required for the mixing of the cement. Diesel140

powered cement mixers, pavers, and haul trucks for borrow materials would be used for the
reconstruction of the dike crowns. Trucking material in from borrow sites for an earthen raise
would increase the total GHG emissions for this project.
In addition to the construction vehicles, mixers, and haul trucks involved in the actual
construction of the project, there would also be GHG emissions from the workforce vehicles.
Workers would commute from their homes to the construction site and park in the staging area.
Workers are assumed to commute no farther than 20 miles from the construction site based on
the availability of housing and the urban setting of the project. During construction, there may
be times when large construction vehicles on the roads slow regular traffic, increasing emissions
from vehicles that use the roads on a regular basis.
The most recent version of the SMAQMD Road Construction Emissions Model (v. 7.1.5.1)
now generates an output for CO2. The SMAQMD Road Construction Emissions Model 7.1.5.1
(RCEM) was based on knowledgeable individuals from SMAQMD, California Department of
Transportation (CalTrans), CARB, and the USEPA. The emissions model was updated by Tetra
Tech in 2013 based on the original model prepared by Jones & Stokes (now part of Inner City
Fund International [ICF]) and Rimpo and Associates, Inc., and used the 26th edition of Walker's
Building Estimator's Reference Book (1999).
The Dam Raise includes five separate construction designs that would each be
constructed during a 2 to 4 year duration and span for five consecutive years from 2017-2022.
For each construction design, project parameters were directly input into the data section of the
model which calculates emissions based on the size of the project area(s), amount of construction
equipment, amount of workers required, and the amount of fill (i.e. soil, concrete, rock) to be
transported per construction period (i.e. grubbing/land clearing, grading/excavation, drainage
utilities/sub-grading, and paving). The RCEM creates default values based on the project
parameters, and these values change to reflect the percentage, or amount of time each piece of
equipment would be used during each construction phase.
Basis of Significance
It is unlikely that any single project by itself would have a significant impact on climate
change. However, the cumulative effect of human activities has been linked to quantifiable
changes in the composition of the atmosphere, which in turn have been shown to be the main
cause of global climate change (IPCC, 2007).
SMAQMD developed recommended thresholds to allow review and assessment of about
90% of the projects in the district. For construction-only projects, the annual threshold is 1,100
Metric Tons CO2 equivalents of per year (CO2e MT/year).

141

The proposed project could result in a significant impact if it generates GHG emissions:
(1) either directly or indirectly that may have a significant cumulative impact on the
environment;
(2) that would conflict with any applicable plan, policy, or regulation of an agency adopted
for the purpose of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases, including the State goal of
reducing greenhouse gas emissions in California to 1990 levels by 2020, as set forth by
the timetable established in AB 32, California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006.
If a project’s emissions exceed the thresholds of significance, then the project emissions
may have a cumulatively considerable contribution to a significant environmental impact. If this
were to occur, then all feasible mitigation would be implemented.

3.7.3 Alternative 1: No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, the project would not be constructed and there would
be no construction-related effects on climate change. Locally generated emissions, including
levee operations and maintenance, would continue. However, a flood associated with a PMF
event may result in large amounts of GHG emissions during flood-fighting activities, as well as
large amounts of emissions resulting from clean-up activities and the repair and/or replacement
of flood damaged housing, commercial and industrial properties, and public infrastructure.

3.7.4 Alternative 2: Spillway Tainter Gate Modification and Combination Earthen
Raise/Concrete Floodwall
Construction emissions associated with Alternative 2 would last approximately 4-5 years.
At the time of this analysis, this period begins in 2017 and ends in 2021. In the SMAQMD,
construction-related emissions under this action would exceed yearly emission thresholds for
CO2 by approximately 172 metric tons in 2017, 3,870 metric tons in 2018, 7,557 metric tons in
2019, and 7,359 metric tons in 2021. Based on the estimated emissions, SMAQMD’s GHG
1,100 MT CO2e threshold will be exceeded on an annual basis.

3.7.5 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures

The District provides recommended measures for reducing GHG emissions from
construction activities. These recommended measures are best management practices and can be
found further below in this section. In addition to implementation of BMPs, a GHG Mitigation
plan would be implemented. The GHG mitigation plan would consist of feasible mitigation
measures in which one mitigation measure or a multitude of mitigation measures can be
implemented to reduce impacts to less than significant. To be considered less than significant,
mitigation measures would need to reduce emissions to SMAQMD’s threshold of significance of
1,100 MTCO2e on an annual basis. SMAQMD provides an example of potential mitigation
methods, and feasible mitigation measures are discussed in more detail in the avoidance,
minimization, and mitigation measures section (2014 SMAQMD):


Measures in an existing plan or mitigation program for the reduction of emissions that
are required as part of the lead agency’s decision in which the plan or program
provides specific requirements that would avoid or substantially lessen the potential
impacts of the project;
143



Offsite measures, including offsets, to mitigate a project’s emissions;



Measures that sequester greenhouse gases; and



In the case of the adoption of a plan, such as a general plan, long range development
plan, or GHG reduction plan, mitigation may include the identification of specific
measures that may be implemented on a project by-project basis. A mitigation plan
would be developed for the use of the Dam Raise Project by SMAQMD.

While the project won’t necessarily sequester GHG emissions, the project would prevent
extra carbon productions. Project emissions are short-term construction emissions, and the
project is expected to have long-term benefits from the prevention of extra carbon production
from the demolition, repair, and reconstruction of flood induced infrastructure losses associated
with a catastrophic flood event. The short-term construction emissions are expected to be less
than significant when averaged over the life span of the project and compared to the carbon
production prevented from catastrophic flooding. In addition, BMPs would be incorporated in
the design of the work and implemented by the contractor.
The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) released its Revised Draft Guidance for
GHG Emissions and Climate Change Impacts in 2014. This guidance supersedes the 2010
guidance. The revised guidance includes a presumptive annual threshold of 25,000 MT of CO2e
emissions from a proposed action to trigger a quantitative analysis. Unlike the 2010 draft
guidance, the revised draft guidance applies to all proposed Federal agency actions, including
land and resource management actions. This DSEIS/SEIR is a joint document and required
under CEQA to fully analyze, quantify, and mitigate GHG impacts, and therefore is compliant
with all NEPA requirements.
BMPs and the standard construction avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures as
recommended in the SMAQMD’s “Guidance for Construction GHG Emissions Reductions”
would be implemented to further reduce GHG emissions. In addition to implementing BMPs,
the State would monitor emissions and implement all feasible mitigation measures. The
following measures that could be implemented by the Contractor, the Corps, and/or the State will
reduce GHG emissions levels back to less than significant and less than cumulatively
considerable:


Minimize the idling time of construction equipment to no more than 3 minutes, or shut
equipment off when not in use;



Maintain all construction equipment in proper working condition;

144



Encourage carpools, shuttle vans, and/or alternative modes of transportation for
construction worker commutes;



Use locally sourced or recycled materials for construction materials as much as
practicable;



Develop a plan to efficiently use water for adequate dust control; and



Implement a GHG reduction Plan. Feasible mitigation measures within the plan would
be implemented if GHG emissions exceed 1,100 metric tons CO2e/year. These measures
could include:
o Purchase of low carbon fuel
o Purchase of CO2 offsets to mitigate GHG emissions to less than 1,100 metric tons
CO2e/year. Potential offsets could be purchased from the following sources:
 AB 32 U.S. Forest and Urban Forest Project Resources
 AB 32 Livestock Projects
 AB 32 Ozone Depleting Substances Projects
 AB 32 Urban Forest Projects
 Other-California Based Offsets
 United States Based Offsets
 International Offsets (e.g., clean development mechanisms)
o Funding incentive programs from SMAQMD or supplementing existing programs
such as Sacramento Emergency Clean Air Transportation (SECAT) program to
obtain GHG reductions
o Use of low carbon concrete if economically feasible and engineering feasible

Although construction of the alternative would result in a significant short-term increase
in CO2, this effect would be temporary. The long-term operations and maintenance of the
project sites would remain the same with or without the project; therefore, the project would not
increase emissions due to operations and maintenance. Long-term emissions would be the same
with or without the project; maintenance emissions would be the same, and the cutoff wall itself
has no net long-term emissions. This project does not conflict with any Statewide or local goals
with regard to reduction of GHG. Any emissions exceeding SMAQMD thresholds will be
reduced to less than significant; therefore, there would be no significant effects on climate
change.

145

3.8 Aesthetics and Visual Resources

3.8.1 Environmental Setting
Regulatory Setting
There are no Federal or State laws regulating visual resources.
Existing Conditions
Folsom Reservoir is a significant visual feature in the regional landscape. The lake and
shoreline contrast sharply with the nearby rolling, wooded foothills. Visual quality is highest in
winter and spring when reservoir levels are high. As summer progresses, reservoir drawdown
typically exposes a ring of bare soil along the shoreline, negatively affecting visual quality.
Major viewer groups are the residents of nearby areas and recreationists using the reservoir and
shoreline.
Downstream of Dikes 1 through 6 contains views of grasslands, oak woodlands, and
wetlands. Several unimproved recreation trails are visible in the area. Auburn-Folsom Road is
visible in some of these locations. The existing trail on top of Dikes 1 through 6 has views of
Folsom Reservoir and the shoreline.
The areas surrounding Dikes 7 and 8 are similar to that of Dikes 1 through 6, only with
some visibility from Folsom Lake Crossing and E. Natoma Street.
The LWD and RWD have little viewshed from any residential areas. Construction is
ongoing near the LWD and spillway, where equipment and vehicles are visible throughout the
week.
MIAD is currently under construction for ongoing USBR Dam Safety projects.
Construction equipment and vehicles are visible throughout the week. Construction should be
completed by December 2015. After construction, the construction zones would be
hydroseeded, providing grassy and herbaceous plant growth within the viewshed.

146

3.8.2 Methodology and Basis of Significance
Methodology
Evaluation of the project’s potential impacts on visual resources was based on a review of
scenic vistas and landscapes that could be affected by project-related activities. Visual contrasts
were examined, which included evaluations of changes in form, size, colors, project dominance,
view blockage, and duration of impacts. Other elements, such as natural screening by vegetation
or landforms, placement of project components in relation to existing structures, and likely
viewer groups, were also considered.
Basis of Significance
The thresholds of significance encompass the factors taken into account under NEPA to
determine the significance of an action in terms of its context and intensity. The thresholds for
determining the significance of impacts for this analysis are based on the environmental checklist
in Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines. A proposed alternative would result in a
potentially significant impact to visual resources if it would:


Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista.



Substantially damage scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, rock
outcroppings, and historic buildings.



Substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of the site and its
surroundings.



Create a new source of substantial light or glare that would adversely affect day or
nighttime views in the area.

3.8.3 Alternative 1: No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, the Corps would not participate in construction of the
proposed project and the visual resources around Folsom Reservoir would remain undisturbed.
Dikes and dams would not be modified, and construction work, outside of routine maintenance
and projects that are already underway or planned, would not contribute to any change in visual
quality within the study area.

147

3.8.4 Alternative 2: Spillway Tainter Gate Modification and Combination Earthen
Raise/Concrete Floodwall
During the four year construction period of the emergency tainter gates, visual resources
near the gates and dam structure itself may temporarily be impaired. However, at the time of this
analysis, staging would be at the CCAO area yard, which is not a publically accessible or visible
area. Therefore, construction-related effects on aesthetics and visual resources are considered
less than significant because construction is temporary and existing views would not be
obstructed.
The 3.5-foot raise of the dikes and dams, and other construction activities, may
temporarily impair visual resources during each 2-year construction period of the various work
packages. Increased construction traffic on Auburn-Folsom Road would affect views of the area
from several homes across the street and may be visible by recreation users on the trails. The
traffic light and/or flagmen and turning lanes, as well as construction vehicles, would be visible
at certain times of the day. There may also be flashing lights to the north and south of the new
traffic light to warn drivers of stopped traffic.
The existing trail on top of Dikes 4, 5, and 6 has views of Folsom Reservoir and the
shoreline. During construction, recreationists would not have access to the trail on top of the
dikes and would need to utilize the trail detour, which would not have views of the reservoir
because of its location on the downstream side of the dikes. The trail detour would instead
provide views of natural areas such as grasslands, oak woodland, and other habitats. Several
unimproved recreation trails are visible in the area. The downstream side of Dike 5 contains
mostly grasslands that extend to Auburn-Folsom Road. Existing trails cross through the
proposed staging area at Dike 5. Auburn-Folsom Road is visible from the trails on the
downstream side of Dike 5. Because the trail detour would be temporary and would still provide
views of natural landscapes, no substantial adverse effects are expected to visual resources.
Raising the dams and dikes would not significantly affect the visual character of the
FLSRA. Modifications to dikes and dams around Folsom Reservoir would occur in phases,
limiting the extent of construction affecting viewsheds at any one time. The relatively small
changes in the heights of these large linear features would not significantly alter the quality of
views around the reservoir. Construction-related effects on visual resources near existing wing
dams and dikes are considered less than significant because construction would be short in
duration, the area disturbed would be relatively small, modifications would be limited to existing
linear features, and existing views would not be obstructed.
There would be a temporary degradation of aesthetics/visual resources during
construction, with an extended slight degradation of aesthetics/visual resources due to the
removal of the Dike 7 Office Complex after the area is no longer used as a staging area.
148

However, with the removal of the Dike 7 Office Complex pavement and the subsequent
restoration of habitat to the area, there would be long-term improvement of aesthetics/visual
resources following project completion. Aesthetic impacts of this action were previously
addressed in the 2012 SEIS/EIR and assessed in the 2016 Phase V SEA/EIR.

3.8.5 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures





Modifications to dikes and dams around Folsom Reservoir would occur in phases,
limiting the extent of construction affecting viewsheds at any one time.
Measures would be incorporated into the project design to minimize effects on riparian
vegetation and ensure use of appropriate erosion control methods, thereby lessening the
visual effects of vegetation loss.
Staging areas would be located throughout the project area on previously disturbed areas
and their use would not constitute a substantial change from existing visual resource
conditions.

3.9 Traffic and Circulation

3.9.1 Environmental Setting
Regulatory Setting
The following Federal, State, and local laws and regulations apply to the resources
covered in this section. Descriptions of the laws and regulations can be found in Chapter 5.0.
Federal
 Title 23 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
 Title 23 of the U.S. Code (USC)
State
 California Streets and Highways Code
Regional and Local
The Folsom Dam Raise Project study area includes roadways in the following
jurisdictions:

149




Counties – Sacramento, Placer and El Dorado (limited).
Communities – Cities of Folsom, Roseville, and Community of Granite Bay.

The Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) serves as the area Metropolitan
Planning Organization (MPO) for the region. Local municipalities determine their own criteria
for streets and roads while the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) oversees State
highways.
Existing Conditions
This section describes the environmental setting as it pertains to transportation and
circulation. Any incremental transportation impacts associated with implementation of the
project are limited to the proposed construction years. The proposed project is expected to be
under construction during calendar years 2017 through 2021. Therefore, the analysis years
include all construction years from the project startup in 2016 to project completion in 2020, as
well as the 2016 baseline conditions required by CEQA.
Folsom Dam is located in the City of Folsom (City) north of US Highway 50. Figure 21
shows the project vicinity map in context to the regional circulation system. The roadways
within the study area of this DSEIS/SEIR are located within Sacramento County, Placer County,
and to a limited extent, El Dorado County. Roadways under Caltrans’ jurisdiction are also
adjacent to the project area. Access points to the proposed work sites are restricted to the
western and southern regions of Folsom Reservoir. Direct access to the project area is
disseminated throughout the proposed project area. The figures in Appendix B show the
proposed access points for the project area. Onsite haul routes are not discussed since they are
not considered part of the public roadway system.

150

Figure 21. Proposed Folsom Dam Raise Project Haul Roads Vicinity Map.

The roadway network adjacent to the construction site is well-developed with multiple
access patterns. There are two basic categories of traffic accessing the site, 1) daily workers and
staff, and 2) material deliveries and hauling operations due to construction activities. It is
assumed daily workers would commute locally via the adjacent roadway network, or use
Highway 80 and Highway 50 to gain access to the site.
The area is considered to be primarily a suburban, low-density development to the east of
Sacramento. Transportation facilities and services include interstate and State highways, local
roads and streets, and local transit including local bus service and a light rail line from the City
of Folsom to downtown Sacramento. A number of bicycle paths/routes accompany major roads.
In addition, commuter bus services are provided by counties and cities within the area.
Functional Classification
Sacramento, Placer, and El Dorado Counties use a roadway classification system for
long-range planning and programming. Roadways are classified based on the linkages they
provide and their function, both of which reflect importance to the land use pattern, travelers, and
general welfare. The functional classification system recognizes differences in roadway function
151

and standards between urban/suburban and rural areas. The following paragraphs define the
linkage and functions provided by each class:


Freeways: Operated and maintained by Caltrans, these facilities are designed as highvolume, high-speed facilities for intercity and regional traffic. Access to these facilities
is limited. In some cases, onramps and off-ramps are metered during peak-hours to
reduce congestion caused by merging cars and trucks.



Arterials: Major Arterials (four to six lanes) and Minor Arterials (four lanes) are the
principal network for through-traffic within a community and often between
communities.



Collectors: These two-lane facilities function as the main interior streets within
neighborhoods and business areas. Collectors serve to connect these areas with higher
classification roads (i.e., freeways, arterials, and expressways).



Local Streets: These facilities are two-lane streets that provide local access and service.
They include residential, commercial, industrial, and rural roads.

Level of Service
To evaluate a roadway’s operational characteristics, a simple grading system is used that
compares the traffic volume carried by a road with that road’s design capacity. A measure called
“Level of Service” (LOS) is used to characterize traffic conditions. LOS is a measure of quality
of operational conditions within a traffic stream based on service measures such as speed and
travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, and comfort and convenience. Six LOS
from A (best) to F (worst), define each type of transportation facility (Table 16).

152

Table 16. Regulatory Criteria for Roadways and Intersections.
Level of Service (LOS)
A

Description of traffic conditions
Conditions of free flow; speed is controlled by the driver’s desires, speed limits, or
roadway conditions.

B

Conditions of stable flow; operating speeds beginning to be restricted; little or no
restrictions on maneuverability from other vehicles.

C

Conditions of stable flow; speeds and maneuverability more closely restricted;
occasional backups behind left-turning vehicles at intersections.

D

Conditions approach unstable flow; tolerable speeds can be maintained but
temporary restrictions may cause extensive delays; little freedom to maneuver;
comfort and convenience low; at intersection, some motorists, especially those
making left turns, may wait through more than one or more signal changes.
Conditions approach capacity; unstable flow with stoppages of momentary
duration; maneuverability severely limited

E
F

Forced flow conditions; stoppages for long periods; low operating speeds.

LOS thresholds are based on daily volumes, number of lanes, and facility type. These
definitions and metrics are general transportation industry standards found in the Highway
Capacity Manual (HCM), the American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials (AASHTO) and the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) guidelines and
nomenclature. Table 17 (Roadway Functional Classification Thresholds) shows the relationship
of LOS threshold for various roadway functional classifications.

Notes:
(1) Used to analyze roadways within County of Sacramento. LOS Capacity Thresholds from Traffic Impact Analysis Guidelines, County of
Sacramento, July 2004
(2) Includes mixed flow lanes only. HOV lanes and volumes are excluded from the analysis because a review of existing HOV counts and
forecasts showed the HOV lanes to be operating under capacity.

The City of Folsom General Plan (1995) establishes LOS C as the minimum acceptable
threshold for City roadways. The Sacramento County General Plan (2011) establishes LOS D as
the minimum acceptable threshold for rural roadways, and LOS E for urban roadways. All of the
Sacramento County roadways in the transportation study area are urban roadways. The Placer
County General Plan (1994) establishes LOS C on rural, urban, and suburban roadways except
within one-half mile of state highways where the standard is LOS D. The El Dorado County
General Plan establishes LOS F as the acceptable threshold for county roads. The Community of
Granite Bay establishes an LOS C (except for intersections along Auburn-Folsom Road south of
Douglas Boulevard, and along Douglas Boulevard west of Auburn-Folsom Road where the
standard is LOS E). The standards generally apply to projects that would create a permanent
increase in traffic.
Freeways
There are two prominent freeways with the study area:


Interstate 80 (I-80): I-80 is an east-west route but predominantly runs north-south within
the study area. The study area for I-80 extends from Eureka Road to Sierra College
154

Boulevard. I-80 consists of six lanes, divided by barriers, within the analysis area with
acceleration/deceleration lanes at the interchanges.


U.S. Highway 50: The study area for Highway 50 runs from Hazel Avenue to El Dorado
Hills Boulevard in a predominantly east-west direction. Highway 50 consists of four
lanes with two carpool lanes, divided by barriers, within the analysis area with
acceleration/deceleration lanes at the interchanges.

Bridges
The following bridges play a prominent role and serve as key linkages to the community
within the project study area:


Folsom Historic Truss Bridge: After its reopening to the public in 2000, the historic truss
bridge is currently used as a recreational pedestrian and bicycle bridge. Its colorful
history reflects the City’s long dependence and appreciation for provided service since
the 1800s.



Rainbow Bridge (Greenback Lane): Directly below and south of Historic Truss Bridge,
the Rainbow Bridge provides a more robust two-lane crossing that can handle cars and
heavy vehicles. Although supplanted by wider bridges to the north and south, this
attractive bridge with characteristic arches serves as a key signature symbol for Folsom.



Lake Natoma Crossing Bridge: Completed in 1999, the Lake Natoma Crossing connects
Folsom-Auburn Road from the north to Folsom Boulevard to the south. This has brought
enormous relief to the community which endured long delays and congestion using
Rainbow Bridge and the Folsom Dam Road when it was open to the public.



Folsom Lake Crossing Bridge: Officially opened on March 29, 2009, the Folsom Lake
Crossing Bridge is a modern concrete segmental bridge proving two travel lanes in each
direction with Class 1 & 2 bicycle facilities. Situated below the Folsom Dam, this new
bridge was constructed under the auspices of the Folsom Dam Raise Project, which is a
component of the American River Watershed Long-Term Project.

Arterials, Collectors, and Local Roads by Jurisdiction
Table 18 below shows the roadway segments analyzed in each county. Project area
roadways range from two to six lanes and have speed limits from 35 to 55 miles per hour. The
project area roads provide access to the industrial and residential uses in the vicinity of the
project.

Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
Pedestrian facilities generally include sidewalks, crosswalks, curb ramps, pedestrian
signals, and streetscape/landscape amenities (i.e., benches, tree-lined buffers, planters, bulb-outs,
street lighting, etc.). There are existing bicycle lanes on several roadways in the vicinity of the
proposed project. A Class II bicycle facility is an on-road, striped bicycle lane, and a Class III
bicycle facility is an on-road, signed bicycle route.
156

Class II Bicycle Facilities
 Douglas Boulevard - Bicycle lanes are provided intermittently east of Eureka Road.


Auburn-Folsom Road/Folsom Boulevard - Bicycle lanes are provided in the City of
Folsom north of Greenback Lane/Riley Street and south of Sutter Street.



Natoma Street - Bicycle lanes are provided from Folsom Boulevard to east of Mill Street,
and between Prison Road and Ranch Drive. The City of Folsom Bikeway Master Plan
proposes to connect these two segments so the bicycle lanes would eventually run
continuously between Folsom Boulevard and Green Valley Road.



Green Valley Road - Bicycle lanes are provided from north of Natoma Street to the
Sacramento County line. The Bikeway Master Plan proposes to connect these bicycle
lanes with existing lanes on Blue Ravine Road south of Natoma Street.

Class III Bicycle Facilities
 Auburn-Folsom Road - There is a bicycle route between the Sacramento County line and
Douglas Boulevard.
Transit Service
Public transportation within the proposed project vicinity is provided via bus and light
rail service. Bus service within the City of Folsom, the City of Roseville, Sacramento County,
and Placer County is primarily provided by Folsom Stage Line, Roseville Transit, Sacramento
Regional Transit, and Placer County Transit, while light rail transit is provided by Sacramento
Regional Transit.

3.9.2 Environmental Consequences
Methodology
Traffic effects associated with the project were evaluated in two ways: (1) regarding
average daily traffic, and (2) in terms of specific time periods during the day (i.e., hourly basis,
as needed). The analysis is based on the following criteria:




The construction schedule would be up to 10 hrs a day, up to 6 days per week.
Material hauling activity would occur within normal work hours, from 7am to 7pm.
Equipment hauling activity would occur during normal work hours, from 7am to 7pm.

157

All material necessary for each alternative would be obtained from an established borrow
site within 30 miles of the proposed project site. As specific borrow locations are not known at
this time, subsequent CEQA and NEPA documentation may be necessary to evaluate the impacts
associated with material hauling. However, haul trucks would use existing county and city
designed haul truck routes and approved and established haul routes described in this document.
Haul trucks and staff vehicles are expected to access the site via one of two
predetermined, approved haul routes, one from I-80 and one from Highway 50 (Figures 19 and
20). For Alternative 2, the proposed route is originating from I-80, proceeding south to Sierra
College Boulevard, east on Douglas Boulevard following Douglas Blvd into the project site. The
route originating from Highway 50 would be via East Bidwell Street, Oak Avenue, Blue Ravine
Road, to East Natoma Street, to Folsom Lake Crossing and vice-versa (for Alternative 2). The
aforementioned project haul routes are consistent with city and county designated truck routes.
Additionally, no trucks are allowed to use Auburn-Folsom Road north of Douglas Boulevard.

158

Figure 22. Folsom Dam Raise Project Proposed Staging Areas and Haul Roads.
159

To account for the large percentage of heavy trucks associated with typical construction
projects, the Institute of Transportation Engineers recommends a threshold level of 50 or more
new peak-direction trips during the peak hours. Therefore, an alternative would cause an
increase in traffic that is substantial in relation to the existing traffic load and capacity, and result
in a significant impact related to traffic, if it would result in 50 or more new truck trips during the
morning or evening peak hours.
Basis of Significance
Adverse effects on traffic and circulation are considered significant if an alternative
would result in any of the following:


Substantially increase traffic in relation to existing traffic load and capacity of the
roadway system;



Substantially disrupt the flow and/or travel time of traffic;



Conflict with adopted policies, plans, or programs regarding public transit, bicycle, or
pedestrian facilities, or otherwise decrease the performance or safety of such facilities;



Result in inadequate emergency access;



Reduce supply of parking spaces sufficiently to increase demand above supply;



Result in a change in air traffic patterns, including either an increase in traffic levels or a
change in location that results in a safety risk; or



Substantially increase hazards due to design feature (e.g. sharp curves or dangerous
intersection) or incompatible uses.

3.9.3 Alternative 1: No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, the Corps would not participate in construction of the
proposed alternatives; therefore, the project would not create additional traffic during
construction around the proposed project area. The existing roadway network, types of traffic,
and circulation patterns is expected to increase traffic by 2% each year.

160

3.9.4 Alternative 2: Spillway Tainter Gate Modification and Combination Earthen
Raise/Concrete Floodwall
The existing access into the construction site for the emergency spillway modification
portion of Alternative 2 is via the intersection along Folsom-Auburn Road and Folsom Dam
Road, or from Folsom Lake Crossing. Access from the first point allows vehicular access to
RWD; however, this access is restricted to limited use. Access from the second point, off
Folsom Lake Crossing and across the LWD, would be the primary access to the dam for the
tainter gate refinements. Table 19 details direct access roads for each proposed project feature.

One lane would be open to traffic across the main Folsom Dam structure at all times
during the construction period; however, the traffic lane would not need to be continuous across
the dam so long as a vehicle (auto/pickup) can navigate from one side to the other. Coordination
with USBR on use of the Main Dam road is ongoing on this subject.
Truck trips would involve hauling materials through residential areas; however, proposed
routes are on designated haul roads. Additionally, proposed haul routes occur in the vicinity of
schools throughout the project area. When possible, construction schedules would avoid routes
that impact schools during the school year.
Vehicle trips to Folsom Dam from the surrounding area would increase slightly as a
result of labor force trips and haul truck trips. It is anticipated that 67 haul truck trips would be
required over the duration of construction, beginning calendar year 2016 and lasting
approximately four (4) years. Approximately 54 workers are estimated to commute to and from
the project six (6) days a week, resulting in a total of 134,784 worker commuter trips over the
duration of construction, beginning calendar year 2016 and lasting approximately 4 years (Table
20). Therefore, 134,851 total truck trips are associated with the tainter gate aspect of Alternative
2.
Transportation and circulation effects resulting from this action are temporary in nature
and would not result in permanent traffic increases to the surrounding area. The action would
not create 50 or more new truck trips during peak travel hours (7AM to 8AM and 5PM to 6PM),
as workers would be arriving and leaving onsite between 7am and 7pm. Employee commuter
161

trips and haul truck trips would not result in a deterioration of existing LOS values, nor
substantially disrupt the flow and/or travel time of traffic on public roadways or on Highways 50
and 80. Labor force trips and haul truck trips would not conflict with adopted plans or policies
that effect public transit, bicycle, or pedestrian facilities, nor would it conflict with emergency
access. Therefore, this portion of Alternative 2 would result in less than significant impacts on
transportation and circulation resources.
To access Dikes 1 through 3, construction vehicles could access the project area at the
Granite Point entrance. This impact to residential areas is temporary and less than significant.
The traffic patterns in and around the project area would not change as a result of construction of
the dam raise project.

Direct access routes to the construction sites for the 3.5-foot raise of the Dikes, wing
dams, and MIAD is via Douglas Boulevard, Auburn-Folsom Road, Folsom Dam Road, E.
Natoma Street, and Green Valley Road (Table 21). Access from these points also allows
vehicular access to the primary staging areas.

Construction of this portion of Alternative 2 would have temporary direct effects on the
traffic and circulation in the project area. Traffic generated by the proposed action would result
in growth in two categories: (1) labor force accessing the project site on a daily basis, and (2)
truck trips due to the import of material and equipment for the earthen raise. New trips have
been determined by calculating the number of trips generated by the quantity of materials and
equipment deliveries required for the project construction, as well as trips generated by
construction labor forces. Construction labor force is estimated as round-trips per day, while
haul truck trip is estimated as total trips over the construction duration of each Work Package
(approximately 2 years). Table 22 illustrates these values. The traffic numbers developed are
maximum amounts of traffic volumes based on anticipated work schedules and activities.
Direct access to the proposed work site would vary by project feature/Work Package and
are detailed in Table 21 above. It is anticipated that these roads would be used by workers
accessing LWD, RWD, MIAD and Dikes 1 through 7. Figure 22 illustrates the routes that are
proposed to be used for providing equipment, workers, and materials for the alternatives.
Staging areas are on Reclamation’s work yard just south of the RWD and site access is off
Folsom-Auburn Road through Reclamation’s Central California Area Office (CCAO), both of
which are not public accessible roads.
A paved road for vehicles exists on the crest of Dikes 1 through 3 and would need to be
closed during construction of the earthen raise (approximately 2 years); therefore, a detour road
would be constructed to maintain public access to the park roadway system. Public vehicle
access is not permitted on the crests of Dikes 4 through 8, or the RWD and LWD.
It is estimated that approximately 15,620 truck trips would be necessary for material and
equipment hauling for this alternative during construction (2017 – 2020). Approximately 27
workers are estimated to commute to and from the project 6 days a week for a total of 624 days
in the project lifetime, adding up to 101,088 worker commuter trips. Therefore, 116,709 total
trips are associated with this alternative.

The increased traffic associated with construction will not eliminate any known
emergency access routes and will not affect emergency access. Construction workers would
park in designated locations and would not reduce the supply of parking spaces. Air traffic
patterns would not be affected, design features do not include any changes to traffic design, and
no increase in hazards would occur. However, the implementation of this portion of Alternative
2 would substantially increase traffic in relation to existing traffic load and capacity of the
roadway system and has the potential to substantially disrupt the flow and/or travel time of
traffic. Therefore, potential traffic effects resulting from this action would be significant and
unavoidable.

3.9.5 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures
The effects are identified as significant and unavoidable, however, the following
measures would be implemented to avoid or minimize any effects, as well as ensure public safety
on area roadways:


The construction contractor would be required to prepare a traffic management
plan, outlining proposed routes to be approved by the appropriate agencies, and
implement the plan prior to initiation of construction.



High collision intersections would be identified by the appropriate local entity,
and avoided if possible.



Construction and haul drivers would be informed and trained on the various types
of haul routes, and areas that are more sensitive (e.g., high level of residential or
education centers, or narrow roadways).



The construction contractor would develop and use signs to inform the public of
the haul routes, route changes, detours, and planned road closures to minimize
traffic congestion and ensure public safety.

3.10 Noise

3.10.1 Environmental Setting
Regulatory Setting
 City of Folsom Noise Ordinance
 Noise Control Act of 1972, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4901 et seq.)
164

Existing Conditions
Federal and state governments provide guidelines for construction noise in regards to
worker protection and, for this project, traffic noise. The proposed project is located in the
vicinity of four convergent jurisdictions: the City of Folsom, Sacramento County, Placer County,
and El Dorado County. Construction noise from the project may impact noise sensitive receptors
in each of these four jurisdictions. These noise sensitive receptors consist of both human
receptors and wildlife receptors. There are no established criteria available for the wildlife
species known to occur in the project area. Many regulatory agencies recommend using 60 dBA
Leq hourly levels as the threshold for determining significant impacts for sensitive bird species at
the edge of suitable habitat.
The City of Folsom’s noise standards would be applied to this project because it is the
closest jurisdiction with the most restrictive noise ordinance. The local noise standards for
Sacramento County, Placer County and El Dorado County can be found in Appendix H.
Compliance with the City of Folsom standards would assure compliance with all other local
noise standards. The noise ordinance standards for the City of Folsom are listed in Table 23, and
are based on the L50 metric as the baseline criterion level.

**5 dBA reduction for impact noise during non-exempt times SOURCE: City of Folsom, CA Municipal Code. Chapter 8.42

Construction noise is exempt from these standards during the periods of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00
p.m. on weekdays and 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekends. If construction occurs outside of
these periods, measures would be required to comply with exterior and interior noise limits at
165

residential receptors. In the event that the measured ambient noise level exceeds the applicable
noise level standard, the applicable standard would be adjusted so as to equal the ambient noise
level. For impulse noise (such as impact pile driving or blasting), the limits are reduced by 5
dBA in the noise ordinance.
Background sound levels for residential areas are typically in the range of 40–60 dBA.
This analysis assumed an average background noise level of 50 dBA. However, ongoing
construction projects, such as the auxiliary spillway construction and current MIAD work would
have an impact on this ambient noise level for the tainter gate work, Dikes 7 and 8, MIAD, and
the LWD and RWD. For the most part, the ambient noise for Dikes 1 through 6 would typically
be in the range of 40-60 dBA.

3.10.2 Environmental Consequences
Methodology
Noise effects were evaluated for each construction site by comparing the expected
project-generated construction noise levels with existing noise levels while taking into account
the locations of sensitive receptors, and the noise criteria and standards set forth in applicable
laws and regulations. A reasonable worst-case assumption is that the three loudest pieces of
equipment would operate simultaneously and continuously over at least a one-hour period.
Because the average background noise level in residential areas is estimated to be 50 dBA, a
construction-related increase in noise to levels above 60 dBA would represent a significant
effect.
Construction noise may potentially impact five jurisdictions (City of Folsom, Granite
Bay, and unincorporated areas of Sacramento, El Dorado, and Placer Counties). These
jurisdictions either have non-transportation noise standards based on time of day and land use
sensitivity, or provide exemptions for construction as long as those activities occur during the
daytime. Residential areas are considered the most noise-sensitive land use and have the strictest
noise standards.

Construction activity noise levels at and near the project areas would fluctuate depending
on the particular type, number, and duration of uses of various pieces of construction equipment.
Construction-related material haul trips would raise ambient noise levels along haul routes,
depending on the number of haul trips made and types of vehicles used. In addition, certain
167

types of construction equipment generate impulsive noises (such as pile driving or blasting),
which can be particularly annoying. Table 25 shows typical noise levels during different
construction stages. Table 26 shows typical noise levels produced by various types of
construction equipment.

A reasonable worst-case assumption is that the three loudest pieces of equipment would
operate simultaneously and continuously over at least a one-hour period. The combined sound
level of three of the loudest pieces of equipment listed in Table 26 (jackhammer, scraper, and
truck) is 94 dBA measured at 50 feet from the source. Table 27, which assumes this combined
source level, summarizes predicted noise levels at various distances from an active construction
site. The data shown in the table indicates that the 60 dBA threshold would be exceeded up to
2,000 feet from the point the noise is generated. These estimations of noise levels take into
account distance attenuation, attenuation from molecular absorption, and anomalous excess
attenuation (Hoover 1996).

*This calculation assumes simultaneous operation of one jackhammer, one truck, and one scraper.

The results in Table 27 above indicate the potential for residences within about 2,000 feet
of active construction sites to be exposed to substantial increases in noise, assuming a
background sound level of 50 dBA.

Basis of Significance
Adverse effects on noise and vibration are considered significant if an alternative would
result in any of the following:


Exposure to, or generation of, noise levels in excess of standards established in the local
general plan or noise ordinance, or applicable standards of other agencies;



Substantial (10 dB or greater) long-term increase in ambient noise levels in the project
vicinity above levels existing without the project;



A substantial temporary or periodic increase in ambient noise levels in the project
vicinity above levels existing without the project; or,



Exposure of sensitive receptors or structures to groundborne vibration.

169

3.10.3 Alternative 1: No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, the Corps would not participate in the proposed project.
As a result, there would be no construction-related effects to the acoustic environment, including
the generation of groundborne vibration. The noise levels in the study area would remain
consistent with the existing ambient noise levels present under current conditions. Sources of
noise and noise levels would continue to be determined by local activities, development, and
natural sounds.

3.10.4 Alternative 2: Spillway Tainter Gate Modification and Combination Earthen
Raise/Concrete Floodwall
The nearest noise receptors to Folsom Dam are the Reclamation (USBR) offices on the
north side of the dam. The closest USBR office is approximately 1,000 feet away from the main
dam (Figure 23). The replacement of the emergency tainter gates is expected to result in an
increase in ambient noise levels at the USBR’s and DPR’s offices because of the close proximity
of the proposed roadway to these buildings. Additionally, a portion of the Folsom State Prison
complex just across Folsom Lake Crossing road is within 2,000 feet of the main concrete dam.
Because this area is immediately adjacent to a main road, the ambient noise level in the
background would be higher than 60 dBA. Therefore, temporary noise effects associated with
raising and modifying Folsom Dam would be considered less than significant as the distance
between noise sources and potential receptors is large enough to attenuate noise.

170

Figure 23. 2,000 Foot Buffer around Folsom Main Dam.

There are several sites where sensitive noise receptors are located near the proposed
construction areas for this portion of Alternative 2. Operation of heavy equipment over the
maximum construction duration (2 years for each work package, as previously described), within
2,000 feet of sensitive receptors, would result in a substantial increase in the ambient noise level
exceeding the estimated background level of 50 dBA.
Dike 1. Residences to the northwest of Vogel Valley Road are within 500 to 600 feet of
Dike 1. Residences on Christian Lane are less than 900 feet away from Dike 1. Additionally,
numerous residences near the confluence of Boulder Road and Twin Rocks Road are within
2,000 feet of Dike 1 (Figure 24).

residences are located within 400 feet of Dikes 7 and 8 (Figure 32). The closest residences to
MIAD are located approximately 1,200 feet away off Green Valley Road (Figure 33).
Construction in these areas could cause a substantial, temporary increase in the ambient noise
level and expose sensitive receptors to noise levels that exceed standards established by local
noise ordinances.

*Two buffers were used in assessment due to size of the Mormon Island Auxiliary Dam.

Residences in other areas around the perimeter of Folsom Lake are located far enough
away from construction areas to attenuate construction-related noise to an acceptable level. It is
not anticipated that construction-related noise would create a significant adverse effect on
recreation facilities located at Granite Bay and Beal’s Point.
Vibration associated with construction activities would be short-term and due to the
distance of structures and sensitive receptors, and would not be significant. Other sensitive
receptors that could be affected by this increase include residents, wildlife, and recreationists.
Sensitive receptors would experience noise from construction vehicle motors and construction
activities. Because the increase in vibration would be short-term and intermittent, the impact
would be less than significant.
Temporary noise effects associated with the construction of this alternative are
considered significant because of the close proximity of portions of the dikes to some residential
areas. Implementation of mitigation measures listed below would reduce this effect, but not to a
less than significant level.

180

3.10.5 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures
The following measures would be implemented to reduce the effects of the noise to less
than significant:


Construction noise would be limited in accordance with the City of Folsom, Sacramento
County, and Placer County Noise Ordinance exemption for construction.



Construction equipment noise would be minimized during project construction by
muffling and shielding intakes and exhaust on construction equipment (per the
manufacturer’s specifications), and by shrouding or shielding impact tools.



All equipment, haul trucks, and worker vehicles would be turned off when not in use for
more than 30 minutes.



Equipment warm up areas, water tanks, and equipment storage areas should be located as
far from existing residences as is feasible.



Provide written notice of construction activities within 2,000 feet of residences or other
sensitive receptors. Written notice provided to potentially-affected residences should
identify the type, duration, and frequency of construction activities. Notification
materials would also identify a mechanism to register complaints if construction noise
levels are overly intrusive or if construction occurs outside specified hours.



Residences and businesses would be notified about the type and schedule of construction
at least two weeks prior to mobilization.



The contractor would measure surface velocity waves caused by equipment and monitor
vibration up to a threshold value established and approved in writing by USACE. There
would be no vibration exceeding 0.2 inch per second.

Public meetings would be scheduled with affected residents to ensure they are informed
of the project schedule and its potential effects. Due to the temporary nature of the construction
and the proposed avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures, impacts would be less than
significant.

3.11 Water Quality
Water quality analysis covers the conventional pollutants. For this analysis, conventional
pollutants analyzed are:





pH
Turbidity
Total dissolved solids (TDS)
Dissolved oxygen
Nutrients, including total organic carbon (TOC), nitrogen, and phosphorus
Trace elements, including arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc

Groundwater quality was not analyzed for this report because of the lack of hydraulic
connectivity between the dikes, emergency spillway, and the Folsom Reservoir. Previous studies
(e.g. Sherer 2006) indicate that the data collected throughout the downstream foundation areas
indicate that there is no connection between the reservoir and local groundwater levels.
The area of analysis for this section is the aquatic body of Folsom Lake, particularly
surface waters within the area of the lake along the dikes, the main dam, and the emergency
spillway.

Existing Conditions
Pursuant to the Porter-Cologne Act, the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control
Board (RWQCB) prepares and updates the Water Quality Control Plan for the Sacramento and
San Joaquin River Basins every three years. The most recent update was completed in October
2011. The plan describes the officially designated beneficial uses for specific surface water and
groundwater resources, and the enforceable water quality objectives necessary to protect those
182

beneficial uses. The Folsom Dam Raise project is located within the Central Valley’s RWQCB’s
jurisdiction and is subject to the Basin Plan.
Snowmelt and precipitation from the upper American River Watershed discharges water
into Folsom Lake. In general, runoff from the relatively undeveloped watershed is of high
quality and rarely exceeds the State of California’s water quality objectives (Reclamation Dam
Safety SEIS, 2008). The following beneficial uses have been defined by the Central Valley
Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB) for Folsom Lake: municipal and domestic
water supply; irrigation; industrial power; water contact and non-contact recreation; warm and
cold freshwater habitat; warm freshwater spawning habitat; and wildlife habitat, along with
potential beneficial uses for industrial service supply. Water quality within Folsom Lake and
Lake Natoma is generally acceptable to meet the beneficial uses currently designated for these
water bodies.
Although groundwater is not a major resource in the vicinity of Folsom Lake, small
amounts of groundwater are typically found in granitic fissures and cracks. Because fractured
aquifer systems are typically low yielding, surface water sources are primarily used for drinking
water or irrigation water sources rather than wells.
The CVRWQCB standards are listed in Table 28. The water quality values measured
within Folsom Reservoir from 1992 to 1998 are presented in Table 29. All the data was
collected over a six-year period from 1992 to 1998; 104 samples were taken for both pH and
turbidity; 47 samples were taken for TOC; 101 samples were taken for electric conductivity
(Larry Walker Associates, 1999).

3.11.2 Environmental Consequences
Methodology
Effects on water quality that could result from construction activities were qualitatively
evaluated based on the construction practices and materials to be used, the location and duration
of the activities, and the potential for water-quality or beneficial-use degradation of project
waterways (Table 32). Standard pollution prevention measures, including erosion and sediment
control measures, good housekeeping, proper control of non-stormwater discharges, and
hazardous spill prevention and response measures, would be implemented as part of the project
design.

Basis of Significance
For this analysis, an effect pertaining to surface and ground water quality was considered
significant under CEQA and NEPA if it would result in any of the following environmental
effects, which are based on professional practice, Federal guidelines, and State CEQA
Guidelines Appendix G (14 CCR 1500 et seq.):




Violate water quality standards or waste discharge requirements;
Substantially degrade water quality; and
Alter regional or local flows resulting in substantial increases in erosion or
sedimentation.
185

3.11.3 Alternative 1: No Action Alternative
Under this alternative, water resources or quality would not be affected by construction in
the project area. The surface and groundwater conditions would continue to be affected by
contaminants through runoff. Extreme flooding events could wash siltation and contaminants
into the water system, and if emergency work became necessary to prevent dike failure,
measures required for the protection of water quality might not be used.

3.11.4 Alternative 2: Spillway Tainter Gate Modification and Combination Earthen
Raise/Concrete Floodwall
An assessment was conducted by USBR on the Folsom Dam temperature shutters (2001).
It was concluded that lead paint should be assumed present in all underlying primer on the
structure. Some of the work on the tainter gates would be done over water and there is the
potential for lead paint to enter surface water downstream of the dam. Stop logs would be
installed on the waterside of the tainter gates to hold back the water. This, along with the
implementation of best management practices and the mitigation measures listed below, assumes
that direct effects to water quality for the rehabilitation of the spillway would be less than
significant.
This action would neither increase the occurrence of impervious surfaces such as parking
lots or buildings, nor change the existing land uses such that hydromodification would occur.
Existing drainage infrastructure (function and capacity) would not be altered from the 3.5-foot
raise of the dikes, wing dams, and MIAD. Overall, the drainage patterns would not be
substantially altered; therefore the direct and indirect affect to local drainage would be less than
significant. Implementation of the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) would ensure
that there is no exceedance of the capacity of stormwater drainage infrastructure, and therefore
effects to the infrastructure (dikes, etc.) would be less than significant with mitigation.
Project activities, such as drilling, excavation, hauling, and fill placement may disturb or
mobilize sediments, which have the potential to affect total suspended solids, pH, turbidity, and
dissolved oxygen.
Installation of the dike raises and the concrete floodwalls, and use of the identified
staging areas, could have short-term direct impacts on water quality from ground-disturbing
activities. Exposed soil on the dikes could potentially erode as a result of significant runoff
events, causing increased turbidity in local waters. In addition, debris and inadvertent spills of
fuels, oils, or concrete mix materials from construction equipment, in work areas, or in the
staging areas could be a source of contamination into adjacent waterways.

186

Run-off could result from excavation activities with potentially higher concentrations of
total dissolved solids, both direct and indirectly. Should run-off reach the reservoir, there is a
potential to create turbidity and introduce associated contaminants to the receiving waters.
The contractor would be required to obtain an NPDES Construction Storm Water Permit
from the CVRWQCB because the project would disturb more than one acre of land. Across the
entire construction site, debris, soil, or oil and fuel spills could temporarily adversely affect the
water quality of Folsom Lake. The construction storm water permit pertains to the prevention of
increased turbidity of adjacent waterways as a result of site erosion and sedimentation, as well as
debris, soil, fuel, and oil spill prevention. The contractor would be required to design and
implement a SWPPP prior to initiating construction activities, and to implement standard BMPs.
There is also a potential for fugitive dust and construction runoff to enter waterways due to soil
excavation, equipment use, cutoff wall construction, and movement of trucks in the project areas
and along the haul routes. However, frequent watering of haul routes, proper coverage and
control of material stock piles, and installation of BMPs would help to prevent such pollution
impacts.
By obtaining NPDES permits and the implementation of BMPs, water quality standards
or waste discharge requirements associated with earth moving activities would be met; therefore
impacts would be less than significant.
3.11.5 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures
The contractor would be required to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit from the Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB), Central
Valley Region. As part of the permit, the contractor would be required to prepare a SWPPP and
a SPCP prior to initiating construction activities, identifying BMPs to be used for avoidance or
minimization of any adverse effects during construction to surface waters.
Pollution prevention measures should be incorporated into all final design and
construction plans. The pollution prevention measures would include erosion and sediment
control measures, and measures for non-stormwater discharges (i.e., construction dewatering and
appropriate spill prevention and containment measures). Measures would be implemented to
avoid accidental spills and sediment dispersal during barging of borrow materials. Construction
contractor(s) would be required to obtain coverage under the NPDES General Storm Water
Permit for Construction Activities from the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), and
obtain any applicable waste discharge requirements. Work under NPDES jurisdiction requires
the preparation of a SWPPP. The SWPPP would describe the proposed construction activities
and pollution prevention measures that should be implemented to prevent discharge of
pollutants. The SWPPP would also include a description of inspection and monitoring activities
that shall be conducted. Construction and post-construction monitoring should be conducted to
187

ensure that all pollution prevention efforts are performed as described in the SWPPP. The
SWPPP should be amended in the event modifications to the pollution prevention measures
become necessary.
The following BMPs would be incorporated into the project:


Implement appropriate measures, such as straw wattles and silt fencing, to prevent debris,
soil, rock, or other material from entering the water.



Use a water truck or other appropriate measures to control dust on haul roads,
construction areas, and stockpiles.



Properly dispose of oil or other liquids.



Fuel and maintain vehicles in a specified area that is designed to capture spills. This area
cannot be near any ditch, stream, or other body of water or feature that may convey
runoff to a nearby body of water.



Fuels and hazardous materials would not be stored on the site, unless in a specified area
that is designated to capture spills.



Inspect and maintain vehicles and equipment to prevent the dripping of oil or other fluids.



If rain is forecast during construction, inspect erosion/sedimentation prior to rains and
implement additional measures as needed.



Maintain sediment and erosion control measures during construction. Inspect the control
measures before, during, and after a rain event.



Train construction workers in storm water pollution prevention practices.



Revegetate disturbed areas in a timely manner to control erosion.

In accordance with 29 CFR 1926.62 Lead and 8 CCR 1532.1 Lead, for all construction
jobs where lead is present the following is required:


Housekeeping. Lead dust on surfaces, especially in eating areas, must be controlled by
HEPA vacuuming, wet cleanup, or other effective methods.

188



Hand and face washing. Workers must have washing facilities with soap and clean
water.



Training. Workers must receive training on lead hazards and how to protect themselves.



A written compliance program to assure control of hazardous lead exposures.



Employers must assess the amounts of lead breathed by workers. This is usually done by
employee breathing-zone air sampling. Air sampling results are used to determine if
clean areas for eating and clothing change, showers, full worker training, and medical
monitoring with routine blood testing for lead and zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) is
necessary, as well as the type of respirator that must be worn for protection.

3.12 Cultural Resources
The following section addresses cultural resources impacts that could result from
implementation of one of the proposed alternatives for the Folsom Dam Raise Project. “Cultural
resources” describe several different types of properties: prehistoric and historic archeological
sites; architectural properties such as buildings, bridges, and infrastructure; and resources of
importance to Native Americans (traditional cultural properties and sacred sites). “Artifacts”
include any objects manufactured or altered by humans.
Prehistoric archeological sites date to the time before recorded history, and in this area of
the U.S., sites are primarily associated with Native American use before the arrival of European
explorers and settlers. Archeological sites dating to the time when these initial Native AmericanEuropean contacts occurred are referred to as protohistoric. Historic archeological sites can be
associated with Native Americans, Europeans, or any other ethnic group. In the project area and
surrounding area, these sites include the remains of historic structures and buildings.
Structures and buildings are considered historic when they are more than 50 years old, or
when they are exceptionally significant. Exceptional significance can be attributed if the
properties are integral parts of districts that meet the criteria for eligibility for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), or if they meet special criteria considerations.



Assembly Bill 52 (AB52)

Existing Conditions
For purposes of complying with Section 106 of the NHPA, a Federal agency would make
a determination of the Area of Potential Effects (APE) for the project or undertaking. The APE
is defined as “the geographic area or areas within which an undertaking may directly or
indirectly cause alterations in the character of use of historic properties, if any such properties
exist.” Additionally, the APE “is influenced by the scale and nature of an undertaking and may
be different for different kinds of effects caused by the undertaking.”
The APE may extend beyond the physical impacts associated with a project. Depending
on the scale and nature of the undertaking and the known and anticipated types of cultural
resources, the direct or indirect effects may include, but are not limited to: physical modification,
intrusion to the visual or aesthetic characteristics of landscapes or features, or even access to a
historic property.
The APE for the Folsom Dam Raise Project includes all areas of ground disturbance,
staging areas, and modifications to manmade structures (Folsom Dam, Dikes 1 through 8,
MIAD, LWD, and RWD). The existing conditions, records and literature search, and inventory
and evaluation of cultural resources cover the APE for the Folsom Dam Raise Project.
Prehistoric Cultural Context
Since the Folsom Dam Raise Project area lies within two specific cultural areas, both the
Lower Sacramento Valley and the Northern Sierra slope regions, the context below summarizes
the distinct cultural chronologies for each of these regions.
Lower Sacramento Valley
Prehistorically, the Lower Sacramento Valley has been subjected to archeological interest
since the last decade of the nineteenth century, culminating with early avocational archeologists
establishing a temporal schedule for this region, referred to as the Central California Taxonomic
System (CCTS) (Nilsson and Smith 2006; Moratto 1984). The CCTS is organized into three
very broad divisions, the Early, Middle, and Late Horizon. This broad classification has largely
fallen out of use, mostly due to obscured gradual changes throughout time, ignored diversity in
the archeological record, and ignored smaller spheres of culture within the Central Valley
(Waechter and Mikesell 1994). For these reasons, the cultural history discussion would
concentrate on the pattern-aspect theme, presented by Frederickson (1973), in an effort to take
into account cultural variation between sub-regions as well as material culture and behavior.
190

Windmiller Pattern (4,500-3,000 B.P.)
This pattern exemplifies the earliest occupation in the Sacramento Valley and
encompasses aspects ascribed to the Early Horizon of the CCTS. This pattern is characterized by
the exploitation of both game and plant resources and acquisition of utility goods, as well as
ornamental and ceremonial objects, many of which were apparently obtained as finished items as
opposed to raw materials (Moratto 1984). In regards to settlement practices, the Windmiller
pattern suggests that populations may have established winter villages in the valley, with summer
exploitation of the foothill zones. Within the archeological record, the Windmiller pattern is
characterized by extended burials with westerly orientation as well as the presence of grave
goods, which has been utilized to identify social stratification within the Windmiller peoples.
Berkeley Pattern (3,500-1,500 B.P)
The Windmiller Pattern gives way to the Berkeley Pattern in the Sacramento Valley,
marking a transitional shift as opposed to a sudden and total replacement of the culture that
proceeded. This pattern corresponds with the Middle Horizon of the CCTS and is represented by
an increased dependence on acorn milling, evidenced by an increase in mortars and pestles
within the archeological record for the Berkeley people. Cultural material includes the
occurrence of an extensive bone tool kit, unique flintworking techniques, and certain types of
shell beads and pendants within Berkeley pattern sites. Burial practices of Berkeley peoples
included interring their dead in flexed positions with variable burial orientation. There has also
been evidence of cremation practices within the Berkeley Pattern as well as a decrease in the
numbers and variation of grave goods.
Augustine Pattern (1,500 B.P. to Contact Period)
The Augustine Pattern, assigned to the Late Horizon, is distinguished by intensive
fishing, hunting and gathering, and reflects local innovation in technology and the integration of
new developments with traits from the previous Berkeley Pattern. Settlement patterns exhibit
highly stratified populations, indicated by the increased variation in mortuary practices and types
of grave furnishings (Bennyhoff and Fredrickson 1994). Exhibited within the archeological
collection is evidence for extensive trade networks, connecting the interior to the coast (Nilsson
and Smith 2006). Archeologically, the Augustine Pattern is characterized by baked clay items,
the introduction of the bow and arrow which replaced the dart and atlatl as the favored hunting
implement, and the presence of side-notched, serrated arrow points. In the archeological record,
evidence of the Augustine Pattern is also displayed in the distinctive Olivella shell bead types,
clamshell disc beads, stone tubular pipes, and flat bottomed mortars.

191

Northern Sierra
Many researchers working within the project area have chosen to refer to the Central
Valley sequence, specifically as it relates to work performed adjacent to Folsom Reservoir, when
discussing chronologies. In 1952, archeological investigations were performed by the University
of California at Berkeley, and it was through this research that Heizer and Elsasser (1953)
developed two archeological cultures separated in time and space; the Martis Complex and the
Kings Beach Complex.
Martis Complex (4,000-1,500 B.P.)
The Martis Complex, centered in the Martis Valley, represents the earliest occupation of
the north-central Sierran foothills and mountains. The dates of the complex is determined by
both obsidian hydration measurements and radiocarbon dates (Elsasser and Gortner 1991). The
Martis Complex is characterized by an artifact assemblage dominated by local lithic materials
consisting of basalt as opposed to obsidian tool production. Other cultural material indicative of
this complex includes large, roughly shaped projectile point, and “boatstones” or atlatl weights
(use of atlatl and dart). Plant processing tools such as the mano and millingstones for seed
milling, bowl mortar and cylindrical pestle, are displayed in the artifact assemblages. Based
upon the large numbers of projectile points and milling equipment discovered in the
archeological record, there was an apparent economic emphasis on hunting and seeding (Moratto
1984). Elsasser and Gortner also note the frequent association of Martis assemblages with
petroglyphs of the “Central Sierra Abstract Style” and suggest that these locations may represent
high-elevation summer hunting camps (Waechter and Mikesell 1994).
Kings Beach Complex (1,500 B.P. to Contact Period)
The Kings Beach Complex, named after a site on the north shore of Lake Tahoe, was
distinguished by flaked obsidian and chert tool stones over basalt resources. The archeological
assemblages of Kings Beach are characterized by sparse artifact scatters overlying deeper Martis
settlements (Elston et al 1977). The Complex employed the use of small projectile points,
hunting technology based upon the bow and arrow, bedrock mortars, and cobble pestles.
Although hunting played a role in Kings Beach subsistence patterns, fishing and gathering
strategies are thought to have constituted the main focus of site use. This is indicated by the site
locations situated at the mouths and confluence of streams within the Lake Tahoe region.
Researchers have ascribed this complex to the ethnographic Washoe after 1,000 B.P. (Heizer and
Elsasser 1953). The results of the work originally performed by Heizer and Elsasser dated the
Kings Beach Complex to no earlier than 1000 years B.P, leaving a substantial chronological gap
between the two complexes. Due to the work by W. Davis and R. Elston in the Lake Tahoe

192

region, their efforts proved successful in finding evidence for a transitional phase between both
the Martis and Kings Beach Complexes (Elston 1977).
Ethnographic Background
Ethnographic Overview
The Folsom Dam Raise Project APE is located within the territorial boundaries of the
ethnographic Nisenan. The Nisenan, often referred to as the Southern Maidu in anthropological
literature, are classified as the southern linguistic group of the Maidu tribe, and together with
Maidu and Konkow, form a subgroup of the California Penutian linguistic family (Wilson and
Towne 1978). The Nisenan linguistic group is further subdivided based on dialect into Northern
Hill Nisenan, inhabiting the Yuba River drainage; Southern Hill Nisenan, living along the
American River; and Valley Nisenan, occupying a portion of the Sacramento River Valley
between the American and Feather Rivers (Beal’s 1933; Kroeber 1925, 1929).
Prior to Euroamerican contact, Nisenan territory extended west into the Sacramento
Valley to encompass the lower Feather River drainage, north to include the Yuba River
watershed, south comprising the whole of the Bear and American River drainages and the upper
reaches of the Cosumnes River, and east to the crest of the Sierra Nevada (Wilson and Towne
1978).
The information in this section is derived from a variety of sources, including: Bennyhoff
(1977); Beal’s (1933); Gifford (1927); Kroeber (1925, 1929); Littlejohn (1928); and, Wilson and
Towne (1978). Additional resources on Nisenan and Miwok ethnography include: Faye (1923);
Levy (1978); Powers (1976); and, Schulz and Ritter (1972). The following is a brief synthesis
focusing on selected traits of Valley Nisenan ethnography that may manifest archaeologically.
Habitation Patterns
The Nisenan were organized by tribelet, each tribelet being composed of several large,
semi-autonomous villages that accepted the leadership of the headman of a specific village.
Headmen acted as advisors for major decision making, communal hunts, and ceremonies.
Wilson and Towne (1978) identify three Valley Nisenan tribelet centers in the Sacramento
Valley: at the mouth of the American River (present-day Sacramento); at the mouth of the Bear
River; and, at the confluence of the Yuba and Feather rivers near present-day Marysville.
Nisenan villages varied greatly in size, ranging from three to seven houses up to 40 to 50
houses, with the largest valley villages inhabited by more than 500 people (Littlejohn 1928).
Villages in the lower valleys tended to be located along low rises and mounds adjacent to
streams and rivers.

193

Nisenan built structures, including semi-permanent houses, which were generally conical,
measuring 10 to 15 feet in diameter and covered with tule mats, grasses, or earth. Smaller,
temporary wikiup-like shelters, made of upright poles and cloaked in brush, were used in the
warm seasons while hunting and gathering (Curtis 1924; Kroeber 1925). Other structures
commonly associated with village sites include semi-subterranean dance houses, acorn granaries,
and sweathouses (Wilson and Towne 1978). Each Nisenan tribelet controlled the natural
resources within a bounded tract of land (Littlejohn 1928). These boundaries were often
indicated by piles of stones (Littlejohn 1928). Beal’s (1933) estimated that Nisenan tribelet
territory averaged approximately 100 square miles.
Subsistence
The basic subsistence strategy of the Nisenan was seasonally mobile hunting and
gathering. Acorns from the California Black Oak, the primary staple, were gathered in the fall
and stored in granaries for use during the rest of the year. Other plant resources included seeds,
buckeye, wild onion, wild sweet potato, Indian potato, wild garlic, wild carrot, many varieties of
berries and fruit, grasses, herbs, and rushes. During the warmer months, people moved to
mountainous areas to hunt and collect food resources particular to higher elevations.
Communal hunting drives were undertaken to obtain deer, quail, rabbits, and
grasshoppers. Game was prepared by roasting, baking, or drying. Mountain lions and bobcats
were hunted for their skins as well as their meat, and bears were hunted ceremonially in the
winter when their hides were at their best condition (Wilson and Towne 1978). Runs of salmon
in the spring and fall provided a regular supply of fish, while other fish, such as suckers, pike,
whitefish, and trout were caught with hooks, harpoons, nets, weirs, snares, fish traps, or by using
fish poisons such as soaproot. Birds were trapped with nooses or large nets, or shot with bow
and arrow (Wilson and Towne 1978).
Many wild plants may also have been “managed” by prescribed burning that removed
underbrush and encouraged growth of edible grasses, seed-producing plants, and other useful
plant resources such as basketry materials (Blackburn and Anderson 1993). The use of fire for
environmental modification and as an aid in hunting is frequently mentioned in ethnographic
literature relating to the Nisenan. Littlejohn (1928) noted that the lower foothills in the valley
oak zone were thickly covered with vegetation that was annually burned by the Nisenan to
remove and limit its growth while encouraging the growth of oaks and the harvest of acorns.
The annual fires destroyed seedlings but did not harm established oak trees. Beal’s (1933) also
noted that the Nisenan regularly burned the land, primarily for the purpose of driving game.
Technology and Trade
Stone technology included flaked stone knives, projectile points, and other tools made
from obsidian, basalt, and silicates. Ground stone tools included club heads, pipes, charms, and
194

mortars and pestles made from local coarser-grained rocks (Beal’s 1933; Wilson and Towne
1978). Shells and beads manufactured from bone, shell, and minerals, such as magnesite, were
used for ornamentation. Wood and bone were used for a variety of tools and weapons, including
bows, arrow shafts and points, fishhooks, looped stirring sticks, flat-bladed mush paddles, pipes,
and hide preparation tools. Cordage was made from plant material and was used to construct
fishing nets as well as braided and twined tumplines.
Baskets were used for a variety of tasks, including storing, cooking, serving, and
processing foods. Basketry items consisted of burden baskets, traps, cradles, hats, cages, seed
beaters, and winnowing trays. Basket manufacturing techniques included both twining and
coiling, and baskets were decorated with a variety of designs and materials. Other woven
artifacts included tule matting and netting made of milkweed, sage fibers, or wild hemp. In the
Sacramento Valley, the Nisenan used tule balsa rafts and log canoes (Kroeber 1929) for fishing,
and used the boats extensively for travel among the major river villages.
Trade and exchange networks were established with neighboring groups for food and
other items, both practical and ornamental, which were not available within Nisenan territory.
Clamshell disk beads, used as a mode of currency, were acquired from Patwin and other outside
sources. Obsidian was highly valued and imported. Nisenan informants stated that obsidian
only came from a place to the north, outside of Nisenan territory (Littlejohn 1928). Abundant
archaeological evidence suggests that the vast majority of obsidian in southern Nisenan territory
is derived from either Bodie Hills to the east, or Napa Valley to the west. Nisenan commodities
traded to neighboring groups included salmon, deer, and acorns (Davis 1961).
Intergroup Relations
Nisenan and Miwok peoples frequently interacted as trading partners, at ceremonial
gatherings, and in armed conflict primarily due to perceived territorial encroachment. The
ethnographic literature, particularly in reference to the Nisenan, reports rather regular hostilities
between Hill and Valley Nisenan, and Nisenan and Sierra Miwok (cf., Littlejohn 1928; Beal’s
1933). Most interactions between the two ethnographic groups, however, appear to have been
civil, friendly in nature, and characterized by considerable intermarriage.
Ethnohistory
Initial contact with Euroamericans in the eighteenth century had little effect on the
Nisenan. The earliest contacts were Spanish exploratory expeditions in the Central Valley led by
José Canizares and Gabriel Moraga, followed in the 1820s by American and Hudson’s Bay
Company trappers. Introduced diseases, against which they had no natural immunities, were the
single greatest cause of death among California Native Americans after Euroamerican contact.

195

The great epidemic of 1833 (probably malaria) devastated the Valley Nisenan population by as
much as 75 percent, in some instances wiping out entire villages.
Captain John Sutter settled in Nisenan territory in 1839. Word of James Marshall’s 1848
discovery of gold near the Nisenan settlement of Culloma (Coloma) soon triggered an influx of
thousands of fortune seekers in Hill Nisenan territory (Wilson and Towne 1978). From the
1870s until the 1890s, the Nisenan experienced a cultural and religious resurgence with the
Ghost Dance revival of 1870. Originating with the Paiute, the basic tenets included the end of
the world and/or return of the dead, return of the world to Native Americans, and the destruction
of White People (Bean and Vane 1978:670). Native American “rancherias” were established by
the federal government in the Maidu area between 1906 and 1937. Today, the majority of the
estimated 2,500 Maiduan peoples (including persons descended from Nisenan, Konkow, and
Maidu groups) live within the traditional territory inhabited at historic contact by their ancestors.
Historic Context
The following Historic Context section is taken from the “Cultural Resources Literature
Search, Inventory, and National Register Evaluations for the Folsom Dam Safety and Flood
Damage Reduction EIS/EIR, El Dorado, Placer, and Sacramento Counties, California” report
completed by Pacific Legacy, Inc. (Bartoy 2007).
Exploration into the interior of present day California began in 1808 with an expedition
led by the Spanish explorer Gabriel Moraga, looking for potential sites for new missions
(Thompson and West 1880). The British, working for the Hudson’s Bay Company based out of
Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River, entered the region from the north via the Siskiyou Trail
in the late 1800s (Dillon 1975). The Americans, led by Jedidiah Strong Smith in 1826, followed
an overland route (Hurtado 1888:39-42). Smith led a small band of men across the Sacramento
Valley in 1827, searching for a pass across the Sierra Nevada and camping at a site that is now
part of the City of Folsom.
Fur Trappers were followed by military expeditions in the 1840s, charged with exploring
the region in advance of American westward expansion. A detachment of the Wilkes expedition,
led by Lt. George Foster Emmons, traveled from the Columbia River to Sacramento in 1841.
John Charles Frémont led the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers into present day
California in two separate expeditions in the 1840s.
The area surrounding Folsom Lake was first settled by Euro Americans following the
discovery of gold at Coloma in 1848. This discovery led to an influx of miners who sought rich
placer deposits along the American River and its tributaries. As new deposits were discovered,
towns and camps were established near the discoveries and these quickly developed into
196

communities to provide for needs of the expanding population. These communities included
Mormon Island, Goose Flat, Alabama Bar, Sailor’s Bar, Negro Hill, Salmon Falls, McDowell
Hill, Beal’s Bar, Condemned Bar, Doton’s Bar, Long Bar, Horseshoe Bar, and Rattlesnake Bar
(Hoover et al. 1966:300; Peak and Associates 1990:5; Waechter and Mikesell 1994:11-12).
Mormon Island, site of California’s second important gold discovery, was one of the
most prominent of these early communities. The camp was originally established on a gravel bar
at the confluence of the North and South Forks of the American River. The settlement was
located on a branch of the Coloma Road, the first route into the region which connected Sutter’s
Fort in Sacramento to his sawmill in Coloma. “By 1853, the camp had some 2,500 inhabitants
and had three dry goods stores, five general merchandise stores, two blacksmith’s shops, a
bakery, saloons, hotels, schools, a post office, and express offices for both Wells Fargo &
Company and Adams & Company” (Waechter and Mikesell 1994:12). As with the majority of
the communities formed by miners, Mormon Island went into decline as nearby gold deposits
were exhausted. By the 1880s, the population had dwindled to 20 and no residents were present
when the town site was inundated by the Folsom Reservoir (Waechter and Mikesell 1994).
As hard rock and hydraulic mining replaced placer mining in the 1850s, the need for
large amounts of water led to the construction of numerous dams, ditches, and flumes throughout
the region. The largest and most prominent of these endeavors were undertaken by two joint
stock companies: the Natomas Water and Mining Company, and the American River Ditch
Company. Although several smaller companies were involved in the creation of water
conveyance systems in the region, such as the Salmon Falls Water and Mining Company who
constructed the Clark-Eastman Ditch, and the Negro Hill Ditch Company who constructed the
Negro Hill Ditch, these operations were overshadowed by the large scale projects of the Natoma
Water and Mining Company and the later American River Ditch Company.
First founded by A.P. Catlin in 1851 and later acquired by H.G. Livermore in 1862, the
Natomas Water and Mining Company completed its first water conveyance from near Salmon
Falls on the South Fork of the American River, to Granite City (Folsom) in 1854. That same
year, several shareholders organized the American River Ditch Company to complete a similar
project along the North Fork of the American River. Following the company’s acquisition by
Livermore in 1862, the company became increasingly interested in water development for
industry as well as for logging. The Natomas Water and Mining Company spawned two
additional entities under Livermore, the Folsom Water and Power Company, which promoted
water-powered industry, and the American River Land and Lumber Company, which controlled
the timber-related activities (Waechter and Mikesell 1994:10). As part of this move to water
power and logging, the original Folsom Dam was completed in 1893.

197

Although mining continued in importance through the second half of the nineteenth
century, the depletion of gold deposits led to an increased investment in other activities, most
significantly agriculture. Initially developed for mining, the series of ditches and flumes
throughout the area around Folsom Lake provided the necessary water to provide for the
agricultural productivity of the region. In response to the switch from mining to agriculture, the
Natoma Water and Mining Company as well as the American River Ditch Company organized
several new companies, including the Natomas Vineyards Company and the North Fork Ditch
Company. In the twentieth century, through a series of reorganizations and sales, the Natomas
Water and Mining Company became simply the Natomas Company while the American River
Ditch Company became the San Juan Suburban Water District (Waechter and Mikesell 1994).
As the twentieth century progressed, agriculture replaced mining as the dominant
industry in the region. The ample supply of water and the rich soils of the area provided for the
cultivation of grain, hay, wine grapes, oranges, and other fruits (Peak and Associates 1990:9).
Although a small community existed at Salmon Falls, none of the numerous mining communities
still existed in the area. By the early 1950s when the federal government acquired the land to
create the present Folsom Reservoir, few people inhabited the region.
Folsom Dam was completed in 1956 and consists of a concrete dam flanked by earth
wing dams and dikes, with a total length of approximately nine miles. The reservoir created by
the dam has approximately 10,000 surface acres of water when full, and approximately 75 miles
of shoreline. The reservoir extends approximately 15 miles up the North Fork and 11 miles up
the South Fork of the American River. The Folsom Dam is part of the Central Valley Project,
which includes a vast network of dams, reservoirs, canals, power plants, and pumping plants
throughout California’s Central Valley.
Records and Literature Search
An extensive records search of the APE was conducted at the California Historical
Resources Information System, North Central Information Center, California State University,
Sacramento, in December 2011. The Corps examined previously completed archeological
survey and excavation reports, existing site records, and local and regional overviews within and
adjacent to the Folsom Reservoir. All or portions of the APE have been surveyed in previous
investigations, all consisting of various levels of intensity. In 2007, Pacific Legacy, Inc. (Bartoy
et al) performed a cultural resource literature search, inventory, and NRHP evaluation in relation
to proposed safety and flood control measures undertaken at Folsom Dam that covered much of
the APE. The study area for the 2007 cultural resource inventory consisted of the footprints of
Dike 1 through Dike 8, RWD, the area below LWD, and MIAD and is contained within the
current APE. Also included in the survey were areas in which the contractor could potentially
stage any equipment or materials. Both the records search and survey performed by Pacific
Legacy, Inc. concluded with a finding of four cultural resources within the APE for that project,
198

one of which was previously documented (Folsom Dam [CA-SAC-937H]), two that were newly
identified (CA-SAC-944H and CA-SAC-945H), and the recordation of the Folsom Dam Dikes
(CA-SAC-1103H).
Previously Documented Sites
Folsom Dam (CA-SAC-937H) was deemed eligible for listing on the NRHP (Corps
2006) under Criterion A with a period of significance of 1948 to 1956. Folsom Dam played an
integral role in flood control, resulting in significant flood damage reduction for areas
downstream, specifically the City of Sacramento. The dam was found not eligible under
Criterions B, C, and D. CA-SAC-937H is currently in the process of being listed by
Reclamation as a contributing element of the Central Valley Project Multiple Property Listing.
Similar to CA-SAC-937H, Folsom Lake Dikes (CA-SAC-1103H), which includes Dikes 1
through 8 and MIAD, has been previously determined by Reclamation as eligible for listing in
the NRHP under Criterion A.
Site CA-SAC-944H is located within the APE, within the proposed staging area for Dike
5. This site was originally documented by Reclamation (Welch 2005a) and has since been
revisited by archeologists with Pacific Legacy, Inc. in 2006 (Bartoy, et al.) and 2007 (Jones) to
assess eligibility for listing in the NRHP. The site is an early 20th century trash scatter with a
four-walled concrete box structure appearing to serve as a water conveyance function in
association with the San Juan Water District. The property was not found to meet any of the
criteria for eligibility in its 2007 evaluation (Bartoy, et al. 2007a).
Another site located within the Dike 5 Staging area, Site CA-SAC-945H, is a water
conveyance system likely constructed in the early 20th century. The site was first recorded by
Reclamation (Welch 2005b) and has been revisited by Pacific Legacy, Inc. (Bartoy, et al. 2006b)
as part of intensive survey and inventory efforts, then again to evaluate the property for listing in
the NRHP (Bartoy, et al. 2007). Characteristics of the conveyance system included six
trapezoidal supports, a concrete intake, and the extant remains of an earthen ditch. The property
was not found to meet any of the criteria for eligibility in its 2007 evaluation (Bartoy, et al.
2007a).
Field Survey Results
After a thorough review of the records and literature available, Corps personnel
conducted cultural resource surveys for the presence of cultural resources within the APE. Large
portions of the APE had been previously investigated for the presence of cultural material.
Subsurface testing was conducted within reaches of the APE where ground visibility was less
than sufficient. Much of the areas within the APE were severely disturbed by construction
199

activities associated with the construction of the reservoir. Historic photographs showed grounddisturbing activities involving heavy grading, road building, staging activities, vegetation
removal and a batch plan operation had formally occurred in a majority of the APE (Corps
2004a). The cultural resource survey covered a total of 570 acres. No previously unknown
cultural resources were identified during the cultural resource surveys. Existing cultural
resources Folsom Dam (CA-SAC-937H), CA-SAC-944H, CA-SAC-945H, and Folsom Dam
Dikes (CA-SAC-1103H) are the only known cultural resources within the current APE.

3.12.2 Methodology and Basis of Significance
Analysis of the impacts was based on evaluation of changes to the existing historic
properties that would result from implementation of the project. The term “historic property”
refers to any cultural resource that has been found eligible for listing, or is listed, in the NRHP.
Section 106 of the NHPA requires that Federal agencies evaluate and consider the effects of their
undertakings on historic properties. In making a determination of the effects to historic
properties, consideration was given to:


Specific changes in the characteristics of historic properties in the study area.



The temporary or permanent nature of changes to historic properties and the visual
area around the historic properties.



The existing integrity considerations of historic properties in the study area and how
the integrity was related to the specific criterion that makes a historic property
eligible for listing in the NRHP.

Basis of Significance
Any adverse effects on cultural resources that are listed or eligible for listing in the
NRHP are considered to be significant. Effects are considered to be adverse if they alter, directly
or indirectly, any of the characteristics of a cultural resource that qualify that resource for the
NRHP so that the integrity of the resource's location, design, setting, materials, workmanship,
feeling, or association is diminished.
In California, effects to a historic resource or unique archaeological resource are
considered to be adverse if they materially impair the significance of a historical or
archaeological resource.

200

3.12.3 Alternative 1: No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, the Federal government would not implement the
emergency spillway gate modifications or the 3.5-foot raise, and, therefore, would not cause any
additional effects to cultural resources. The conditions in the project area would remain
consistent with current conditions. If a great enough flood event, or PMF, were to occur, the
gates and dam would be at risk for failure, threatening the levee system downstream with a surge
of flow beyond the current 160,000 cfs levee capacity and affecting the dam as a historic
property. As a result, the No Action Alternative would likely result in an adverse effect to
cultural resources. However, the magnitude of the adverse effect would depend on the location
of the failure in the system and the severity of the storm. As a result, a precise determination of
adverse effect and the significance of the effect is not possible and cannot be made. Because of
this uncertainty, this potential effect is considered too speculative for meaningful consideration.
Additionally, without a Federal undertaking, under the No Action Alternative there would not be
a lead Federal agency required to take into account the effects of a proposed undertaking on
historic properties. No further action would be required by the Corps.

3.12.4 Alternative 2: Spillway Tainter Gate Modification and Combination Earthen
Raise/Concrete Floodwall
The effects of the emergency spillway gate modification and 3.5-foot raise would result
in no adverse effects to historic properties located within the APE for the project. There are four
previously recorded sites within the APE. CA-SAC-944H is an early 20th century trash scatter
and water conveyance structure associated with the San Juan Water District and was determined
not eligible for listing in the NRHP in 2007. CA-SAC-945H is an early 20th century water
conveyance system and was determined not eligible for listing in the NRHP in 2007.
Reclamation submitted these determinations to SHPO, who concurred on July 5, 2007. No
further evaluation or consideration of either CA-SAC-944H or CA-SAC-945H is required.
Folsom Dam, including the RWD and LWD (CA-SAC-937H) has been previously
determined by the Corps as eligible for listing in the NRHP under Criterion A. SHPO concurred
with this determination on June 26, 2006. Folsom Lake Dikes (CA-SAC-1103H), which
includes Dikes 1 through 8 and MIAD, has been previously determined by Reclamation as
eligible for listing in the NRHP under Criterion A. SHPO concurred with this determination on
November 7, 2007. Any federal undertaking is required to determine if the action will result in
an alteration, directly or indirectly, to any of the characteristics of these historic properties that
qualify them for inclusion in the NRHP.

201

In accordance with 36 CFR § 800.5 (b) Finding of no adverse effect, the construction of
the spillway tainter gate modification and combination earthen raise/concrete floodwall would
result in no adverse effects to historic properties within the APE. Folsom Dam would undergo
physical changes due to the spillway tainter gate modification. Refinements include additional
strengthening features to the existing tainter gates and a new “top seal” bulkhead that will
prevent overtopping of the spillway gates during a major flood event. These modifications
constitute no adverse effect to the qualities that make Folsom Dam eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP. Folsom Dam is eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, and the proposed
spillway tainter gate modification will have no effect on the capacity of the dam to portray the
broad patterns of our history. The proposed modifications, in fact, are designed to enhance the
important function of this structure for the purposes of flood control, hydropower, and irrigation.
The RWD and LWD, which are a part of Folsom Dam, and Folsom Lake Dikes, would
undergo physical changes due to the earthen raise and concrete floodwall construction. The
appearance of Folsom Lake Dikes would be slightly altered by raising the height of the dikes by
3.5-feet and by changing the slopes of the dikes and crest widths to conform to Corps’ standards
while maintaining Reclamation’s requirements for security and maintenance. Materials used for
fill would be similar to the existing composition of the earthen dikes, and existing riprap would
be reprocessed for use on the raised dike. These modifications constitute no adverse effect to the
qualities that make Folsom Lake Dikes eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Folsom Lake Dikes
are eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A, and the proposed earthen raise will
have no adverse effect on the capacity of the dikes to portray the broad patterns of our history.
The proposed modifications, in fact, are designed to enhance the important function of these
structures for the purposes of flood control, hydropower, and irrigation.
The appearance of the RWD and LWD would be slightly altered by constructing a
reinforced 3.5-foot concrete flood wall that would tie into the main dam, the new control
structure, and the existing terrain. This would require excavating a portion of the dam or dike
crest to place the footing and to replace the embankment fill. The flood wall would be
constructed using cast-in-place, reinforced concrete. The construction of the flood wall
constitutes no adverse effect to the qualities that make the RWD and LWD, as part of Folsom
Dam, eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Folsom Dam is eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criterion A, and the proposed flood wall will have no adverse effect on the capacity of the
dam to portray the broad patterns of our history. The proposed modifications, in fact, are
designed to enhance the important function of these structures for the purposes of flood control,
hydropower, and irrigation.
The APE for the project also includes areas of ground disturbance, including staging
areas, haul routes, recreation trails, and geotechnical borings. The vertical depth of disturbance
caused by grading the existing ground for use, and in those areas where the footprint of Dikes 1,
202

2, 3, 7, and 8, will be expanded. The Corps has assumed potential disturbance of up to 3 feet
within the APE where there are not currently built environment resources (Folsom Dam and
Folsom Lake Dikes). Observations during the 2015 cultural resources surveys of the APE
concluded that much of the areas within the APE were severely disturbed by construction
activities associated with the construction of the reservoir. Shovel test pits conducted in areas
exhibiting limited ground disturbance did not reveal the presence of any historic properties. As a
result, the Corps has determined there will be no adverse effects to historic properties for the
project.

3.12.5 Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures
Folsom Dam (CA-SAC-937H) and Folsom Lake Dikes (CA-SAC-1103H) are the only
known historic properties within the APE that could be potentially affected by the proposed
project. Consultation with potentially interested Native Americans did not result in the
identification of potential historic properties significant to tribes within the APE, although tribes
have indicated that Folsom Lake and the surrounding area are sensitive for sites and locations of
importance to them. The Corps’ Finding of no adverse effect pursuant to 36 CFR § 800.5 (b)
will be sent to SHPO for comment and concurrence. Based on these identification and
evaluation efforts, there will be no adverse effects to historic properties and no mitigation,
avoidance, or minimization measures will be required.
However, if archeological deposits or other potential historic properties are found during
project activities, work would be stopped pursuant to 36 CFR § 800.13(b), Discoveries without
prior planning, to determine the significance of the find and, if necessary, complete appropriate
discovery procedures.

203

CHAPTER 4.0 - CUMULATIVE IMPACTS, GROWTH-INDUCING IMPACTS, AND
OTHER REQUIREMENTS
NEPA and CEQA require the consideration of cumulative effects of the proposed action,
combined with the effects of the projects. NEPA defines a cumulative effect as an effect on the
environment that results from the incremental effects of an action when combined with other
past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions, regardless of the agency (Federal or nonFederal) or person undertaking such other actions (40 CFR 1508.7). The CEQA Guidelines
(CERES 2007) define cumulative effects as “two or more individuals effects, which, when
considered together, compound or increase other environmental impacts” (Section 15355).

4.1 Methodology
The cumulative effects analysis determines the combined effect of the proposed project
and other closely related, reasonably foreseeable projects. Cumulative effects were evaluated by
identifying projects in and around the Folsom Dam vicinity that could have significant, adverse,
or beneficial effects. These potential effects are compared to the potential adverse and beneficial
effects of the proposed alternative to determine the type, length, and magnitude of potential
cumulative effects. Mitigation of significant cumulative effects could be accomplished by
rescheduling actions of proposed projects and adopting different technologies to meet
compliances. Significance of cumulative effects is determined by meeting Federal and State
mandates and specified criteria identified in this document for affect resources.

4.2 Geographic Scope
The geographic area that could be affected by project effects varies depending on the type
of environmental resource being considered. An example is air and water resources as they
extend beyond the confines of the project footprint; effects on these mediums would not
necessarily be confined to the project area. When the effects of the project are considered in
combination with those of other past, present, and future projects to identify cumulative effects,
the other projects that are considered may also vary depending on the type of environmental
effects being assessed. The following are the general geographic areas associated with the
different resources addressed in the analysis:




Air Quality: the air basin under the jurisdiction of SMAQMD as air quality lead.
Climate Change: the air basin under the Jurisdiction of SMAQMD as air quality
lead.
Water Quality: Folsom Lake
204





Fisheries: Folsom Lake
Aesthetics and Visual Resources: the FLSRA and surrounding neighborhoods in
the City of Folsom
Recreation: the FLSRA
Traffic and Circulation: the roadways in the project region where traffic generated
by multiple projects would interact with the public on a cumulative basis.
Noise: the area under the jurisdiction of the City of Folsom and Sacramento
County.
Cultural Resources: the APE, as described in Section 3.12, Cultural Resources.

4.3 Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Future Projects
The projects with the potential to contribute to cumulative effects during construction and
operation of the Approach Channel Project are briefly described below. Each of these projects
is, or has been, required by Federal, state, and/or local agencies to avoid, minimize, and/or
mitigate any significant adverse effects on environmental resources to less than significant, when
possible. Those effects that cannot be reduced to less than significant are likely to have a greater
cumulative effect. Sequencing and timing of construction for the projects would also affect the
cumulative effects.

4.3.1 Folsom Joint Federal Project Activities
Due to the fact that the Join Federal Project (JFP) is a multi-phased, accelerated effort,
overlapping construction efforts would occur adjacent to and in the vicinity of the project area
throughout the course of construction of the Folsom Dam Raise Project. The concurrent
activities onsite include both the various aspects of the Approach Channel work upstream of the
control structure, as well as other phases of the JFP to be constructed by both the Corps and
USBR. The Folsom Dam Raise Project construction would be calendar years 2017 through
2020. Other activities associated with the Folsom JFP are discussed below.
Phase 1 of Folsom JFP Auxiliary Spillway
Winter 2007 to Sept 2008 included the initiation of the spillway excavation and
construction of MIAD haul road, as well as installation of filter material in the top 20 ft of the
LWD and RWD. This Phase 1 work was completed under USBR contract as part of JFP project.

205

Pier Tendon Installation, Spillway Pier Wraps, and Braces and Main Concrete Dam
April 2011 through Spring 2014. These three projects address seismic concerns at the
main concrete dam. These improvements are designed to help stabilize the main concrete dam
against movement during a major earthquake. This portion of the JFP is covered under the 2007
FEIS/EIR.
Folsom Dam Modification Project Approach Channel
Spring 2013 to Fall 2017. The Approach Channel Project is the final construction
activity of Phase IV of the JFP. The primary and permanent structures consist of the 1,100 foot
long excavated approach channel and spur dike. A transload facility and concrete batch plant
would be constructed as necessary temporary structures to facilitate the construction. Additional
existing sites and facilities that would be utilized for the length of the project include the Folsom
Prison staging area, the existing Bureau of Reclamation Overlook, the MIAD area, and Dike 7.
These sites and facilities are connected by an internal project haul road. Criteria pollutant
emissions from the Approach Channel Project and the downstream project would be less than
significant for ROG, CO, SO2, and PM2.5, and less than significant with mitigation for PM10.
NOx exceeds the GCR de minimis threshold but would be addressed by inclusion in the State
Implementation Plan, which would provide compliance with the GCR of the Federal Clean Air
Act. The supplemental FEIS/EIR was released for public review in December 2012.
Auxiliary Spillway Excavation
Spring 2009 to Fall 2010. Major work under Phase II of the JFP includes partial
excavation of the western portion of the auxiliary spillway, construction of the downstream
cofferdams, relocation of the Natoma Pipeline, and the creation of an access road to the stilling
basin. This portion of the JFP is covered under the 2007 EIS/EIR. Construction was conducted
by the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) and was completed prior to the start of the
Control Structure construction effort.
Control Structure, Chute, and Stilling Basin
Spring 2011 to Fall 2017. Phase III of the JFP consists of construction of the auxiliary
spillway control structure. This effort is currently under construction by the Corps and would be
complete approximately Fall 2014. Concrete lining of the spillway chute and stilling basin
would be conducted by the Corps as the final phase of the JFP. These actions would be
constructed from approximately Summer 2013 to Fall 2017. Construction of the control
structure and the concrete lining of the chute and stilling basin were all covered under the Corps’
2010 EA/EIR (Corps 2010).
206

Dike 1 Modification Project
Winter 2014 to Spring 2015. The Dike 1 Modification is a portion of the Folsom Dam
Safety Project that was approved in 2005 to address seepage exiting from downstream of Dike 1.
Reclamation concluded that the seepage is likely occurring through the foundation and is being
collected by the downstream horizontal blanket drain and exiting onto the ground surface at the
toe. Modifications to Dike 1 include constructing a downstream overlay with sand chimney
filter and toe drain to prevent internal erosion under flood loading conditions.

4.3.2 Folsom Dam Water Control Manual Update
The Water Control Manual Update is being completed in conjunction with the JFP by the
Corps, USBR, CVFPB, and SAFCA. The Water Control Manual Update for Folsom Dam would
develop, evaluate, and recommend changes to the flood control operations at Folsom Dam that
would further reduce flood risks to the Sacramento area. Operational changes may be necessary
to fully realize the flood risk reduction benefits of the following:



The additional operational capabilities created by the auxiliary spillway.
The use of improved forecasts from the National Weather Service.

Further, the Water Control Manual Update would evaluate options for the inclusion of
creditable flood control transfer space in Folsom Reservoir in conjunction with Union Valley,
Hell Hole, and French Meadows Reservoirs (also referred to as Variable Space Storage), the
potential for improved releases for fish flows, and possibly increased flexibility of water storage
during drought periods. The study would result in a Corps decision document and would be
followed by a water control manual implementing the recommendations of the Study. It should
be recognized that the initial water control manual would implement the recommendation of the
study but would not include the capabilities to be provided by the Dam Raise and additional
Common Features project improvements until such time as these projects have been completed.
4.3.3 Other Projects
Dike 4, 5, and 6 Repairs, USBR Dam Safety
Summer 2009 to October 2010. To address seepage concerns due to static and
hydrologic loadings for Dikes 4 and 6, USBR installed full height filters, toe drains, and overlays
on the downstream face of each earthen structure. This portion of the JFP is covered under the
2007 Folsom Dam Safety and Flood Damage Reduction Project EIS/EIR (2007 EIS/EIR).
207

Mormon Island Auxiliary Dam Modification Project
The project has been underway from Summer 2010 to December 2015. USBR released
the Draft EIS/EIR for the MIAD Modification Project in December 2009. Four action
alternatives were analyzed in the MIAD Draft Supplemental EIS/EIR. The preferred MIAD
action alternative of jet grouting selected in the FEIS/EIR was determined to be neither
technically nor economically feasible. The preferred alternatives addressed methods to excavate
and replace the MIAD foundation, place an overlay on the downstream side, and install drains
and filters; the alternatives differ only in their methods of excavation. In addition, the alternative
in the Final Supplemental EIS/EIR include habitat mitigation proposed for up to 80 acres at
Mississippi Bar on the shore of Lake Natoma to address impacts from the JFP.
Johnny Cash Folsom Prison Blues (Folsom Lake) Trail: Historic Truss Bridge to Green
Valley Road Segment
This project is planned to provide approximately 2.5 miles of Class I bike trail from the
Historic Truss Bridge to Green Valley Road. A majority of the trail alignment would be within
the Folsom Prison property. The project is broken into three major segments consisting of:


Phase 1 – Folsom Lake Crossing bike/pedestrian overcrossing to the Hancock Drive
intersection (currently under construction).



Phase 2 – Folsom Prison entry road to Rodeo Park (existing trail end).



Phase 3 – Hancock Drive intersection to the Folsom Prison entry road.



Phase 4 – Folsom Lake Crossing bike/Pedestrian overcrossing to the El Dorado County
Line

Incorporation of a separated grade crossing at the new Folsom Lake Crossing/East
Natoma Street realignment was included within the new bridge crossing construction.
Construction began in 2011, with continued work expected through the early years of the Folsom
Dam Raise project.
Widening of Green Valley Road
Green Valley Road runs between both the City of Folsom and El Dorado County. Both
agencies have proposed projects to widen Green Valley Road from two to four lanes. The El
Dorado County Green Valley Road widening project from the county line to Francisco Drive
208

was constructed prior to 2009, with environmental mitigation to be completed from 2009 to 2012
(El Dorado County 2010). The City of Folsom plans to widen Green Valley Road; however, the
ongoing construction of the Bureau’s MIAD Modification Project limits their ability to conduct
the road widening project. There is currently an environmental compliance documentation but
no construction schedule for the project within the City of Folsom. The project could take four
years to construct.
El Dorado 50 – HOV Lanes
California Department of Transportation would construct bus-carpool (HOV) lanes in the
eastbound and westbound directions by widening U.S. Highway 50 from approximately El
Dorado Hills Boulevard to just west of Greenstone Road. The project would ultimately extend
the current HOV lane system to provide approximately 23 continuous miles of eastbound and
westbound HOV lanes between Sacramento and El Dorado counties. The project also includes
bridge modification, lighting improvements, and new asphalt overlay. The project would be
constructed in three phases: Phase 1 would extend the current HOV lanes from their existing
terminus west of El Dorado Hills Boulevard, to west of Bass Lake Road with construction started
in fall 2008 and completion scheduled for fall 2011; Phase 2 would extend the lands from west
of Bass Lake Road to approximately Ponderosa Road with construction targeted to begin in
Summer 2013 and completion in Fall 2015; Phase 3, currently on hold pending determination of
funding source, would extend the lands from Ponderosa Road to Greenstone Road (Caltrans
2012).
Hazel Avenue Improvement Project
Sacramento Department of Transportation completed Phase 1 of the Hazel Avenue
Improvement Project. The primary portion of Phase 1 involved the widening of Hazel Avenue
from four to six lanes over the American River Bridge from U.S. 50 to Curragh Downs Drive.
Construction was completed in 2010. Phase 2 of the Hazel Avenue Projects includes widening
Hazel Avenue from four to six lanes from Curragh Downs Drive to Madison Avenue. This
phase would also include traffic signal modification at Curragh Downs Drive, Winding Way, La
Serena Drive, the fire station at Roediger Lane, and a new signal at Phoenix Avenue.
Construction of Phase 2 is targeted to begin in 2015 with completion in 2017.

4.4 Cumulative Effects
This section discusses the potential cumulative effects of the Folsom Dam Raise Project
when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions. If the project is not
expected to contribute to a cumulative effect on a resource, that resource is not addressed.
209

Resources include recreation, vegetation and wildlife, special status species, water quality, air
quality, climate change, aesthetics and visual resources, traffic and circulation, noise, and
cultural resources.

4.4.1 Air Quality
The Folsom Dam Raise Project’s construction period (2017-2021) would overlap with
other JFP construction activities, including the Approach Channel Project (2012-2017) and the
control structure, chute, and stilling basin projects (2010-2016). These other activities are
considered to be a codependent project subject to evaluation for the General Conformity Rule by
the USEPA.
Other concurrent projects are considered discrete projects outside the consideration of the
general conformity ruling for the Folsom Dam Raise Project. Long-term emissions associated
with the completion of the JFP would be analyzed in associated environmental documents, such
as the Folsom Dam Modification Project Approach Channel Supplemental EIS/EIR and the 2007
Folsom Dam Safety and Flood Damage Reduction Project EIS/EIR. However, it is anticipated
that any long-term emissions associated with operations of the auxiliary spillway would be
below State and Federal thresholds and would not significantly contribute to the overall
cumulative impacts.
Combined JFP Analysis
This section discusses the quantitative analysis of the cumulative short-term air quality
effects of the Folsom Dam Raise Project alternatives in combination with the other features of
the JFP. Qualitative discussions of the cumulative effects of the Approach Channel Project and
the other projects identified in Section 4.3 are also included. Prior cumulative air quality effects
from the 2007 EIS/EIR did not address the Folsom Dam Raise Project alternatives and other
regional projects in depth. Air emission models, project elements, the NOx de minimis
threshold, and resulting calculated emissions differed substantially between the 2007 EIS/EIR
and the current JFP project.
Construction of the proposed alternatives would result in emissions of criteria pollutants.
However, with the implementation of mitigation measures, these emissions are expected to be
less than significant. With the exception of the Folsom Dam Water Control Manual Update,
which has no construction associated with it, all of the related projects discussed above would
cumulatively contribute to emissions of criteria pollutants throughout the region, particularly if
they are constructed concurrently, which could have a significant cumulative effect on air

210

quality. It is anticipated that each of these projects would implement their own mitigation plan
to reduce the emissions to below the significance levels.
It is likely that the Dam Raise Project would be constructing at the same time as the
Folsom Dam Modification Project Approach Channel and the post-construction restoration. It
would be necessary to ensure that the projects are not constructing sites in close proximity to one
another at the same time. However, on a regional level, these projects would still contribute to a
significant cumulative effect and coordination with the SMAQMD and USBR would need to
occur prior to construction to reduce these effects.

4.4.2 Climate Change
It is unlikely that any single project by itself would have a significant impact on the
environment with respect to GHGs. However, the cumulative effect of human activities has been
linked to quantifiable changes in the composition of the atmosphere, which, in turn, has been
shown to be the main cause of global climate change (IPCC 2007). Therefore, the analysis of the
environmental effects of GHG emissions is inherently a cumulative impact issue. While the
emissions of one single project would not cause global climate change, GHG emissions from
multiple projects throughout the world could result in a cumulative effect with respect to global
climate change.
It is expected that the primary impacts from these concurrent projects would be due to
construction activities. On an individual basis, each of these projects would mitigate emissions
below the general reporting threshold. If these projects are implemented concurrently, it is
possible that the combined cumulative effects could be above reporting requirements for GHG
emissions. However, with the implementation of mitigation measures, which would be required
for each of these projects, it is possible that the effects could be reduced to less than significant.
In addition, the majority of the related projects are flood risk management projects. By
implementing these projects, the action agencies would be reducing potential future emissions
associated with flood fighting and future emergency actions. As a result, the related projects
could combine to reduce long-term potential GHG emissions in the Sacramento region. As a
result, the overall cumulative GHG emissions from these projects are considered to be less than
significant.

211

4.4.3 Aesthetics and Visual Resources
Cumulative impacts to aesthetics and visual resources are primarily related to other
construction projects that have already occurred or could occur in the future within the vicinity
of the study area and result in loss of visual quality both during and after construction. There
would be some overlap with the construction of other projects as mentioned above (e.g. Folsom
Dam Modification Project Approach Channel). Concurrent construction of the Folsom Dam
Raise Project would result in short-term cumulative effects in the visual resources in the project
area. Additional vegetation clearing, earth moving, construction equipment, and stockpile from
the projects could contribute to a larger, temporary overall visual impact. However, cumulative
effects are expected to be less than significant because Folsom Lake’s southern shoreline is of
low visual quality and other large man-made features (such as the main dam) are already well
established in the landscape.

4.4.4 Water Quality
Water quality to be affected within the actual construction area. Construction activities
such as rock placement, clearing and grubbing, and slope realignment have the potential to
temporarily degrade water quality through the direct release of soil and construction materials
into water bodies, or the indirect release of contaminants into water bodies through runoff.
Related projects, including the American River Common Features and the Folsom Dam
Modification Project Approach Channel, could be under construction during the same timeframe
as the Folsom Dam Raise Project. If construction occurs during the same timeframe, water
quality could be diminished primarily due to increased turbidity. All projects would be required
to coordinate with the RWQCB and overall water quality would be required to meet the Basin
Plan objectives. These projects, however, would culminate in long-term beneficial impacts for
flood damage reduction and dam safety. There are no anticipated long-term water quality affects
with the implementation of multiple projects.

4.4.5 Recreation
Cumulative impacts to recreation were primarily related to other construction projects
that could occur during the same timeframe as those considered for this study, and within the
same vicinity as this study. At the time of this analysis, some projects have the potential to
increase recreational access on a long-term basis (e.g. Johnny Cash Folsom Prison Blues
(Folsom Lake) Trail), and some have the potential to have short-term impacts (e.g. Folsom Dam
Modification Project Approach Channel). The Johnny Cash Folsom Prison Blues (Folsom Lake)
Trail would increase bicycle and pedestrian access from the Historic Truss Bridge to Green
212

Valley. Future construction of the bike trail has the potential to have a significant, long-term
positive effect upon recreation and public access to the FLSRA.
The Mormon Island Auxiliary Dam Modification is currently being constructed and is
schedule to be completed in December of 2015. This project would produce short-term impacts
to recreation. The Folsom Dam Modification Project Approach Channel started in 2013 and is
going to continue through 2017, therefore the construction periods of these projects and the
Folsom Dam Raise Project would overlap. The Approach Channel would impact water-based
activities during the construction period. The trails atop MIAD and the associated parking lots
would be closed to the public during construction due to potential public safety hazards at the
construction site. Visitors would need to park at Brown’s Ravine or find alternate parking areas.
While these projects would have a cumulative effect on recreation, the Folsom Dam Raise
Project would only temporarily impact land-based activities, whereas the Approach Channel
construction would impact water-based activities. Because the projects affect different
recreation activities, and the Folsom Dam Raise Project and MIAD Modification Project impacts
would be temporary, it is not expected that visitation would be substantially reduced and
cumulative effects are considered less than significant.

4.4.6 Vegetation and Wildlife
Implementation of the Folsom Dam Raise Project has the potential to remove large
amounts of vegetation within the project area. The Folsom JFP, the MIAD Modification Project,
and the Folsom Dam Modification Project Approach Channel Project would also require the
removal of habitat within the Folsom area. These affects, along with the historical decline of
vegetation due to urbanization, would result in significant cumulative effects.
The avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures would be implemented in
accordance with the recommendations of the Coordination Act Report for the Dam Raise Project.
Additionally, all the projects would include avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures.
However, potential adverse effects on biological resources would remain significant due to the
amount of habitat being removed to construct these projects and the time lapse before new
plantings would mature to the level of those removed. Once all the mitigation and compensation
plantings have matured to the level of those removed, the affects to vegetation and wildlife
would be less than significant, but the temporary loss of vegetation along the levees would be
significant. There is no designated critical habitat for VELB in the project area.

213

4.4.7 Sensitive Species
Potential cumulative impacts from the combination of these projects to each of the listed
species included in this consultation are below. During preconstruction engineering and design,
the Corps designs would avoid impacts to special status species, where possible, or otherwise
minimize effects to each of these species.
Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle
Concurrent construction of multiple projects over the next 10 to 15 years within the
Sacramento area would likely cause mortality to beetles due to construction operations.
Construction activities for the multiple projects would occur each year during the flight season of
beetles. Since construction activities would be adjacent to known VELB locations, it is likely
that some mortality may occur. The exact number injured or killed is unknown but would likely
be minimal due to the exceptional flight ability of the beetle to avoid construction vehicles. No
designated critical habitat would be affected with the construction of any of the projects.
Shrubs within each past, current, and potential future project footprints at Folsom Lake
would be transplanted to areas in close proximately to the current locations as needed and
required by USFWS. Additionally, compensation would be located within the vicinity of
impacted shrubs. Transplanting of shrubs and planting of seedlings and native plant species
within the project vicinity would provide connectivity for the beetle. Connectivity is a primary
cause of the beetle decline and an important element in the recovery and sustainability of the
beetle. The transplanting of shrubs and compensation within the same area as the potential
impacts would result in effects to the beetle but not result in permanent jeopardy to the Valley
Elderberry Longhorn Beetle.
Bald Eagle
Concurrent construction of multiple projects over the next 10 to 15 years within the
Sacramento area would not likely cause any impacts to the bald eagle. The Folsom Dam Project
area for the Folsom Dam Raise and many other concurrent projects (e.g. the Approach Channel
and the MIAD Modification Project) are all highly disturbed areas and do not provide quality
habitat for the eagle. No critical habitat has been designated for this species and the proposed
project would not have a direct or indirect effect on the growth, survival, or reproductive success
of the bald eagle. There would be no cumulative effects caused by the Folsom Dam Raise
project.

214

Swainson’s Hawk
Concurrent construction of multiple projects within the Folsom Lake area would not
likely cause any impacts to the Swainson’s hawk. The Swainson’s hawk is known to occur in
the vicinity Folsom Dam and Reservoir, thus could be a concern for many of the projects in the
area. However, there have been no recorded nesting sites above the Nimbus Dam on the
American River. In addition, the staging and construction areas for this project and others in
progress, or areas planned for the future, are highly disturbed and do not provide high quality
habitat for this species. No critical habitat has been designated for this species, and the proposed
project would not have a direct or indirect effect on the growth, survival, or reproductive success
of the Swainson’s hawk. There would be no cumulative effects caused by the Folsom Dam
Raise project.

4.4.8 Traffic and Circulation
There are several short-term projects that have the potential to effect traffic. The Hazel
Avenue Improvement Project, the widening of Green Valley Road, and the Folsom Bridge
Project are completed projects that have benefited traffic volumes. There is potential for future
projects in the vicinity of Folsom Lake to affect traffic, and some would be constructed
concurrently with the proposed action. The Approach Channel and the MIAD Modification
Projects, both in progress, have had some temporarily increased traffic levels from the transport
of materials and the labor force’s shift work. Construction of the proposed project would
temporarily increase traffic on some local, regional roadways.
While there would be a cumulative effect of the concurrent projects impacts on freeways
and other regional roadways, these roadways are designed to handle increased traffic loads and
the effect would be less than significant. There is enough distance in time between other local
projects that impacts to local roadways would not create a significant cumulative effect. With
the implementation of avoidance and minimization measures, the project is not expected to result
in a cumulatively considerable increase of traffic and be less than significant. This is pending
final routes being identified and analyzed, and would be included in a subsequent environmental
document, if needed.

4.4.9 Noise
There is the potential for future construction activities in the vicinity of the Folsom Dam
and Reservoir to be constructed concurrently with the proposed action and other concurrent
projects. This project and other local projects would result in temporarily increased levels of
215

ambient noise in the study area. Simultaneous construction of projects would increase noise
levels from the onsite construction and the transport of materials. However, the effects would be
limited to the people in the immediate proximity to the construction sites and none of the local
projects are in close enough proximity to the various proposed construction sites to create a
cumulative effect. If there are any projects constructing within audible distance from one
another, the USACE and BOR teams for these projects would coordinate to ensure that both
projects are not constructing at the same time. With this coordination, there would be no
cumulative effects due to noise in the study area.

4.4.10 Cultural Resources
Cumulative impacts to cultural resources would be primarily related to individual ground
disturbance sites, with potential regional implications for sites if they are considered part of a
historic district, landscape, or multiple sites that may be ethnographically significant, and to
other construction projects that could occur during the same timeframe as those considered for
this study and within the same vicinity. For this project, the Corps has determined there will be
no adverse effects to historic properties. Federal undertakings are required to avoid, minimize,
and/or mitigate any significant adverse effects on cultural resources. At the time of this analysis,
there are several ground disturbing construction projects anticipated that could result in adverse
effects to historic properties that have not yet been identified as part of those projects. As a
result, the cumulative overall impact to non-renewable cultural resources is possible, as well as
significant and unavoidable. Individual projects would implement separate mitigation measures
that would address the effects caused by these projects. Although mitigation would minimize
these impacts, there is still a possible significant cumulative effect to cultural resources.

4.5 Growth Inducing Impacts
NEPA and CEQA both require a discussion on how a project, if implemented, could
induce growth. This section presents an analysis of the potential growth-inducing effects of the
proposed project. Direct growth inducement would result if a project involved construction of
new housing. Indirect growth inducement would result, for instance, if implementing a project
results in any of the following:


Substantial new permanent employment opportunities (e.g., commercial,
industrial, or governmental enterprises);



Substantial short-term employment opportunities (e.g., construction
employments) that indirectly stimulates the need for additional housing and
services to support the new, temporary employment demand; and/or



Removal of an obstacle to additional growth and development, such as removing
216

a constraint on a required public utility or service (e.g., construction of a major
sewer line with excess capacity through an undeveloped area.
Growth inducement may lead to environmental effects, such as increased demand for
utilities and public services, increased traffic and noise, degradation of air or water quality,
degradation or loss of plant or animal habitats, and conversion of agricultural and open space
land to urban uses. Growth within a floodplain area increases the risk to people or property from
flooding.
Within the study area, growth and development are controlled by the local governments
of the City of Folsom, and Sacramento, El Dorado, and Placer Counties. Consistent with
California law, each of these local governments has adopted a general plan and each general plan
provides an overall framework for growth and development within the jurisdiction of each local
government. Local, regional, and national economic conditions also directly affect growth and
development.
The alternatives currently being considered for the Folsom Dam Raise Project would not
contribute directly to population or economic growth as no additional housing or businesses
would be built. However, the overall Folsom Dam Safety and Flood Damage Reduction Project
(including the JFP and other aspects of the Folsom Dam project) would generate additional
economic benefits during construction and would contribute to greater flood risk management
for the Sacramento area once complete. The potential for any growth-inducing effects associated
with the overall JFP were analyzed under the 2007 FEIS/EIR (USBR 2007).
The Folsom Dam Raise Project is of a limited scope and would not promote or contribute
to any regional economic or population growth. Any future local growth would be consistent
with the local general plans, as described above.

4.6 Unavoidable Adverse Effects
State CEQA Guidelines CCR Section 21100(b)(2)(A) provides that an EIR shall include
a detailed statement setting forth “any significant effects on the environment that cannot be
avoided if the project is implemented.” Chapter 2 provides a detailed analysis of all potentially
significant environmental impacts of the Folsom Dam Raise Project, feasible mitigation
measures that could reduce or avoid the project’s impacts, and whether these mitigation
measures would reduce these impacts to less than significant levels. Cumulative impacts are
discussed above. If a specific impact cannot be reduced to less than significant level, it is
considered a significant and unavoidable impact.

217

The Folsom Dam Raise would have the following significant and unavoidable
environmental effects (direct, indirect, and/or cumulative):


Traffic on public roadways;



Some loss of vegetation and wildlife habitat along the dikes;



Potential loss/removal of elderberry shrubs;



Noise



Temporary closure of recreation facilities including bike and walking trails during
construction;

4.7 Relationship of Short-Term Uses and Long-Term Productivity
NEPA requires that an EIS include a discussion of the relationship between short-term
uses of the environmental and long-term productivity. Within the context of the EIS/EIR “shortterm” refers to the construction period, while “long-term” refers to the operational life of the
project and beyond.
Project construction would result in short-term construction-related effects such as
interference with local traffic and recreation facilities, increased air emissions, ambient noise
level, and dust, yet are not expected to alter the long-term productivity of the natural
environment. Project implementation would also result in long-term effects, including changes
in visual resources, however minimal.
Project implementation would contribute to long-term productivity of the environment by
improving the dike system and the spillway gates that maintain flood protection to the
downstream area by reducing the overall flood risk.
The long-term beneficial effects of the project would outweigh its potentially significant
short-term impacts to the environment.

4.8 Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitment of Resources
NEPA requires that an EIS include a discussion of the irreversible and irretrievable
commitments of resources which may be involved should the project be implemented. Similarly,
the State CEQA Guidelines require a discussion of the significant irreversible environmental
218

changes that would be caused by the project should it be implemented.
The irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources are a permanent loss of the
resources for future or alternative purposes. Irreversible and irretrievable resources are those that
cannot be recovered or recycled, or those that are consumed or reduced to unrecoverable forms.
Project implementation would result in the irreversible and irretrievable commitments of energy
and material resources during the project construction and maintenance, including the following:


Construction materials, including such resources as soil and rocks;



Land and water area committed to new/expanded projects facilities; and



Energy expended in the form of electricity, gasoline, diesel fuel, and oil for equipment
and transportation vehicles that would be needed for project construction, operation, and
maintenance.

The use of these nonrenewable resources is expected to account for only a small portion
of the region’s resources and would not affect the availability of these resources for other needs
within the region. Construction activities would not result in inefficient use of energy or natural
resources.
As described throughout this DSEIS/SEIR, without implementation of the Folsom Dam
Raise Project, the reduction of flood risk benefits would remain. While a precise quantification
of impacts associated with flood risk reduction is not possible, there is a potential for a variety of
impacts. Flooding and the resulting emergency and reconstruction efforts could expend more
energy, overall, than with construction of the Folsom Dam Raise Project. A large volume of
debris would result from a flood event; such things as cars, appliances, housing materials, and
vegetation would all be generated during a flood event and would likely have to be disposed of
in a landfill. After debris removal is completed, re-building would occur and new materials
would be required to repair and/or construct homes, businesses, roads, and other urban
infrastructure. Thus, project implementation preempts potentially substantial future consumption
and is likely to result in long-term energy and materials conservation.

219

CHAPTER 5.0 - COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND
REGULATIONS
This chapter summarizes the environmental laws and regulations that apply to the Folsom
Dam Raise Project and describes the status of compliance with those laws and regulations. The
project would not only comply with the Federal environmental laws and regulations, but would
comply with all state, regional, and local laws, regulations, and ordinances.

5.1 Federal Laws, Regulations, and Policies
Clean Air Act of 1972, as amended (42 U.S.C. 7401, et seq.)
Partial compliance. The Federal 1970 Clean Air Act (CAA) authorized the
establishment of national health-based air quality standards, and also set deadlines for their
attainment. The Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (1990 CAA) made major changes
in deadlines for attaining National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). State and local
agencies, within areas that exceed the NAAQS, are required to develop state implementation
plans (SIPs) to show how they would achieve the NAAQS for nonattainment criteria pollutants
by specific dates. SIPs are not single documents; rather, they are a compilation of new and
previously submitted plans, programs (such as monitoring, modeling, permitting, etc.), district
rules, state regulations, and federal controls. USEPA is responsible for enforcing the NAAQS
primarily through reviewing SIPs that are prepared by each state. As required by the Federal
CAA, the USEPA has established and continues to update the NAAQS for specific criteria air
pollutants: O3, CO, NO2, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, and Pb.
Pursuant to CAA Section 176(c) requirements, USEPA promulgated the General
Conformity Rule which applies to the most federal actions, including the Folsom Dam Raise
Project. The General Conformity Rule is used to determine if Federal actions meet the
requirements of the CAA and applicable SIPs by ensuring that pollutant emissions related to the
action do not:


Cause or contribute to new violations of a NAAQS.



Increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation of a NAAQS.



Delay timely attainment of a NAAQS or interim emission reduction.

A conformity determination under the General Conformity Rule is required if the Federal
agency determines: the action would occur in a nonattainment or maintenance area; that one or
220

more specific exemptions do not apply to the action; the action is not included in the Federal
agency’s “presumed to conform” list; the emissions from the proposed action are not within the
approved emissions budget for an applicable facility; and the total direct and indirect emissions
of a pollutant (or its precursors) are at or above the de minimis levels established in the General
Conformity Regulations.
For the Folsom Dam Raise Project, the entire construction footprint of Dikes 1 through 8,
the LWD, RWD, and MIAD, along with the Emergency Spillway, were analyzed under the
CAA. For this footprint, emissions associated with the dike raises, the concrete floodwalls, and
the emergency spillway modifications construction equipment were analyzed to determine the
worst case scenario for air quality impacts. The analysis conducted determined that the
emissions associated with construction of this action would be above the de minimis level. These
emission reductions were incorporated into the project analysis. Even with implementation of
mitigation measures identified in Section 3.6, emissions would not be reduced below the
USEPA’s general conformity de minimis threshold. Based upon preliminary analysis of air
quality effects from the proposed action, it was evident that mitigated construction actions would
result in exceeding SMAQMD standards for NOx, and CO2. Compliance with the CAA would
be accomplished with the completion of a General Conformity Analysis, or with the inclusion in
the State Implementation Plan.
Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade, Executive Order 13693, March 19, 2015
Full Compliance. Signed on March 15, 2015, Federal agencies are directed to promote
building energy conservation, efficiency, and management, and reduce energy use by vehicle
fleets. Federal agencies shall also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase water
efficiency in industrial, landscape, agricultural and potable water uses. Specific percentage goals
by year are established. The Corps is requiring lower emission producing equipment for use in
construction.
Clean Water Act of 1972, as amended (33 U.S. C. 1251, et seq.)
Partial Compliance. The potential effects of the proposed project on water quality have
been evaluated and are discussed in Section 3.11. Prior to construction, the contractor would
prepare and implement a Stormwater Pollution Protection Plan (SWPPP). The SWPPP would
help identify the sources of sediment and other pollutants, and establish BMPs for storm water
and non-storm water source control and pollutant control. Additionally, compliance with the
CWA would be accomplished by obtaining certification through the CVRWQCB and internally
through the Corps. As part of the permits, contractors would be required to implement best
management practices to avoid and minimize any adverse effects of construction on surface
waters. The following National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits
would be obtained:

221

1. Storm Water Permit: NPDES General Permit for Storm Water Discharges Associated
with Construction and Land Disturbance Activities.
2. Industrial Storm Water Permit: NPDES General Permit for Discharges of Storm Water
Associated with Industrial Activities Excluding Construction Activities.
3. Limited Threat Discharge Permit: NPDES Permit for Limited Threat Discharges of
Treated/Untreated Groundwater to Surface Water.
Once the work is completed, the contract would submit a Notice of Termination in order
to terminate coverage by the NPDES permit. As there is currently no in-water disposal areas,
404(b)(1) would not be necessary. However, if project changes allow for the need of lakeside
disposal areas, a 404(b)(1) would be completed by the Corps.
Clean-fuel Vehicle Tailpipe Emission Standards for Light-Duty Vehicles and Light-duty
Trucks (40 CFR 88.104-94)
Full compliance. A light-duty vehicle or light-duty truck will be considered as a TLEV,
LEV, ULEV, or ZEV if it meets the applicable requirements of the emission standards. Vehicles
for the project would meet the standards as defined by 40 CFR 88.104-94.
Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531. et seq.)
Partial Compliance. A list of the threatened and endangered species that have the
potential to occur in the Folsom area was obtained USFWS on January 21, 2015. Based on the
analysis contained in this document, the Corps has determined that the project has the potential
to affect the Federally-listed Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle if the work on Dikes 1, 5, 6, and
the Right Wing Dam are to be done. If the proposed work is to move forward, the Corps would
initiate consultation with USFWS under Section 7(a) of the Endangered Species Act to assess the
impacts to VELB and determine appropriate mitigation measures. Either USFWS consultation
and/or receipt of a Biological Opinion or letter of concurrence, or the decision to eliminate this
work, would constitute full compliance with this law. There are no additional potential effects to
Federally-listed species beyond the VELB and elderberry shrubs in the mentioned locations.
Executive Order 11988: Flood Plain Management
Full Compliance. The objective of this E.O. is to avoid, to the extent possible, any long
term and short-term adverse effects associated with the occupancy and modification of the base
floodplain (1% annual event), and to avoid direct and indirect support of development in the base
floodplain wherever there is a practicable alternative. While the proposed project reduces flood
risk to the population in the study area, it also removes an obstacle to growth for portions of the
study area that are slated for redevelopment and are within the base floodplain. The Dam Raise,
in combination with other area flood risk reduction projects, protects the existing urban
population of the greater Sacramento area. Modifying existing structures such as the Folsom
222

Facility was determined to be the only practicable alternative to address the specific dam safety
and flood management issues at Folsom. There is no practicable alternative that does not
indirectly induce development in the flood plain by removing flood risk as an obstacle to growth,
therefore the project is in compliance with the E.O.
Executive Order 11990: Protection of Wetlands
Full Compliance. Executive Order 11990, signed May 24, 1977, directs all Federal
agencies to refrain from assisting in or giving financial support to projects that encroach on
publicly or privately owned wetlands. It further requires that Federal agencies support a policy
to minimize the destruction, loss, or degradation of wetlands. A project that encroaches on
wetlands may not be undertaken unless the agency has determined that 1) there are no
practicable alternatives to such construction, 2) the project includes all practicable measures to
minimize harm to wetlands that would be affected by the project, and 3) the effect would be
minor.
During a 2014 survey, less than 1 acre of seasonal wetland habitat was identified adjacent
to the project area to the west of Dike 6. No other wetlands were identified throughout the rest
of the project area during this survey. These wetlands would not be directly impacted by any
project activities. There is the potential for fugitive dust to affect the wetlands; however, dust
suppression measures would be implemented throughout project construction. With the
implementation of the dust suppression measures listed in Section 3.4, there would be no adverse
effects to wetlands in the vicinity of the project area.
Executive Order 12989, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority
Populations and Low-Income Populations.
Full Compliance. This Executive Order states that Federal agencies are responsible for
conducting their programs, policies, and activities that substantially affect human health of the
environment in a manner that ensures that such programs, policies, and activities do not have the
effect of excluding persons from participation in, denying persons the benefits of, or subjecting
persons to discrimination under such programs, policies, and activities because of their race,
color, or national origin. The proposed construction project is located on public lands and is not
located near any minority or low income communities. The benefits of the Dam Raise would
extend to all areas of the greater Sacramento area; therefore it would not provide
disproportionate burdens, benefits, or effects to any minority or low income populations and is in
compliance with this Executive Order.
Executive Order 13112: Invasive Species
Full Compliance. Executive Order 13112, signed February 3, 1999, directs all Federal
agencies to prevent and control the introduction of invasive species in a cost-effective and
environmentally sound manner. The order established the National Invasive Species Council,
223

which is composed of Federal agencies and departments, and the supporting Invasive Species
Advisory Committee which is composed of state, local, and private entities. The council’s
national invasive species management plan recommends objectives and measures to implement
Executive Order 13112 and to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species (National
Invasive Species Council 2008). Executive Order 13112 requires consideration of invasive
species in NEPA analyses, including their identification and distribution, their potential effects,
and measures to prevent or eradicate them.
Farmland Protection Policy Act (7 U.S.C. 4201, et seq.)
Full Compliance. There are no designated prime or unique farmlands within the project
area; therefore there would be no adverse effects to farmland and the project is in compliance
with this Act.
Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958, as amended (16 U.S.C. 661, et seq.)
Partial Compliance. Federal agencies undertaking water projects are required to fully
consider recommendations made by the USFWS in the provided Coordination Act Report (CAR)
or Planning Aid Letter associated with the project. USFWS and CDFG have participated in
evaluating the proposed project, and USFWS has prepared a preliminary draft CAR which
accompanies this document (Appendix E). Inclusion of the final CAR and consideration of
USFWS recommendations would accomplish full compliance with this law
Migratory Bird Treaty act of 1936, as amended (16 U.S.C. 703, et seq.)
Full Compliance. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act implements various treaties and
conventions between the United States, Canada, Japan, Mexico, and Russian, providing
protection for migratory birds as defined in 16 U.S.C. 715j. The proposed action is located in an
ongoing construction area, which has been active since 2008. There is potential nesting habitat
located in the woodland (oak) habitat scattered throughout the project footprint. The project is in
a very urbanized area where traffic congestion and human activities are very common. Birds in
these areas have adjusted to the human environment and continue to nest in areas with multiple
human activities occurring. To ensure that the project does not affect migratory birds,
preconstruction surveys would be conducted by a qualified biologist in areas adjacent to the
project site. If breeding birds are found in the area, a protective buffer would be delineated and
USFWS and CDFG would be consulted for further actions.
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S. C. 4321, et seq.)
Partial Compliance. NEPA applies to all Federal agencies and most of the activities they
manage, regulate, or fund that affect the environment. This act requires full disclosure of the
environmental effects, alternatives, potential mitigation, and environmental compliance
procedures of proposed actions NEPA requires the preparation of an appropriate document to
ensure that Federal agencies accomplish the law’s purposes. This draft DSEIS/SEIR constitutes
224

partial compliance with NEPA. Full compliance would be achieved when the final SEIS/EIR is
filed with USEPA and the Corps issues a Record of Decision.
Noise Control Act of 1972, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4901 et seq.)
Full Compliance. Inadequately controlled noise presents a growing danger to the health
and welfare of the Nation's population, particularly in urban areas. The major sources of noise
include transportation vehicles and equipment, machinery, appliances, and other products in
commerce. The Noise Control Act of 1972 establishes a national policy to promote an
environment for all Americans free from noise that jeopardizes their health and welfare. The Act
also serves to (1) establish a means for effective coordination of Federal research and activities
in noise control; (2) authorize the establishment of Federal noise emission standards for products
distributed in commerce; and (3) provide information to the public respecting the noise emission
and noise reduction characteristics of such products.
While primary responsibility for control of noise rests with State and local governments,
Federal action is essential to deal with major noise sources in commerce, control of which
requires national uniformity of treatment. EPA is directed by Congress to coordinate the
programs of all Federal agencies relating to noise research and noise control.
Title 23 of the U.S. Code (USC)
Federal statutes specify the procedures that the U.S. Department of Transportation must
follow in setting policy regarding the placement of utility facilities within the rights-of-way of
roadways that received Federal funding. These roadways include expressways, most State
highways, and certain local roads. In addition, 23 USC 116 requires State highway agencies to
ensure proper maintenance of highway facilities, which implies adequate control over nonhighway facilities such as utility facilities. Finally, 23 USC 123 specifies when Federal funds
can be used to pay for the costs of relocating utility facilities in connection with highway
construction projects.
Title 23 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) regulations require that each state develop its
own policy regarding the accommodation of utility facilities within the rights-of-way of such
roads. After FHWA has approved a state’s policy, the State can approve any proposed utility
installation without referral to FHWA, unless utility installation does not conform to the policy.
Federal regulations do not dictate specific levels of operation or minimum delays,
however, which are primarily established by local jurisdiction.

225

National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470)
Partial Compliance. Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)
requires Federal agencies to take into account the effects of a proposed undertaking on properties
that have been determined to be eligible for, or included in, the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP). If cultural resource(s) have been identified during a survey, a records and
literature search, through consultation, or by other means, the federal agency overseeing the
project begins the process to determine whether the cultural resources are eligible for listing in
the NRHP. Section 106 of the NHPA, as amended, mandates the evaluation process. The
implementing regulations for Section 106 are at 36 C.F.R. § 800 et seq.
Inventory, evaluation for listing in the NRHP, and determinations of effects to cultural
resources, are made by Federal agencies for cultural resources within a project’s APE. For
purposes of complying with Section 106 of the NHPA, a Federal agency will make a
determination of the APE for the project or undertaking. The APE is defined as “the geographic
areas or areas within which an undertaking may directly or indirectly cause alterations in the
character or use of historic properties, if any such properties exist.” Additionally, the APE “is
influenced by the scale and nature of an undertaking and may be different for different kinds of
effects caused by the undertaking.”
The APE for an undertaking may extend beyond the physical impacts associated with a
project. Depending on the scale and nature of the undertaking, and the known and anticipated
types of cultural resources, the direct or indirect effects may include physical modification,
intrusion to the visual or esthetic characteristics of landscapes or features, or even access to a
historic property.
After a cultural resource has been determined eligible for listing in the NRHP, it is
regarded the same as any other property that is listed and becomes formally known as a “historic
property,” regardless of age. The term “historic property” refers exclusively to NRHP listed or
eligible properties.
For a federal project to be in compliance with Section 106, one of the following five
scenarios will occur: (1) no historic properties exist in the APE; (2) the undertaking does not
have the potential to affect historic properties; (3) there are known historic properties in the APE
but the undertaking will not adversely affect them; (4) known historic properties will be
adversely affected by the project and a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or Programmatic
Agreement (PA) may be executed that will guide the mitigation or resolution of adverse effects;
or (5) adverse effects are not known and a PA may be executed that will guide the inventory and
identification of historic properties, evaluation of potential adverse effects to historic properties,
and mitigation or resolution of adverse effects. For this undertaking, the Corps has determined
that in accordance with 36 CFR § 800.5 (b) Finding of no adverse effect, the construction of the
226

spillway tainter gate modification and combination earthen raise/concrete floodwall would result
in no adverse effects to historic properties within the APE.
SHPO Consultation
In a letter dated March 3, 2015, the Corps initiated consultation with SHPO, informing
SHPO of the proposed project and asking for comments on and concurrence with the
determination of the APE, and comments on the proposed efforts to identify historic properties
within the APE. In an email dated March 6, 2015, SHPO responded that they would wait to
comment until the Corps submitted a document that fully addresses the identification efforts and
results. The cultural resources survey report documenting the identification and evaluation
efforts, as well the Finding of no adverse effect pursuant to 36 CFR § 800.5 (b), will be sent to
SHPO requesting their concurrence with the Corps’ determinations. Correspondence with SHPO
is included in Appendix I.
American Indian Consultation
As part of the Section 106 process, the Corps is required to identify Native American
Tribes that attach cultural affiliation to historic properties that may be affected by the proposed
undertaking (36 CFR Part 800.3(f)(2). As part of 36 CFR Part 800.4(a)(4), the Corps has
consulted with and is presently consulting with the Wilton Rancheria, the Tsi-Akim Maidu of the
Taylorsville Rancheria, the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians, and the United Auburn
Indian Community of the Auburn Rancheria in an effort to identify sites of religious and cultural
significance that may be affected by the proposed undertaking. A detailed consultation log is
included in Appendix I. If historic properties are identified during this consultation process, and
if the proposed undertaking results in adverse effects to the identified historic properties, then the
Corps will work with appropriate Native American Tribes and SHPO to mitigate adverse effects
to those resources.
Compliance with Section 106
In accordance with 36 CFR § 800, the implementing regulations of Section 106 of
NHPA, the Corps has determined that the project will result in no adverse effects to historic
properties. The Corps has consulted with interested parties, SHPO, and Native American tribes
and individuals in the Section 106 compliance process. The Corps will submit the finding of no
adverse effects to historic properties to SHPO for concurrence, after which the Corps will be in
compliance with Section 106.
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.)
Full compliance. In the unlikely event that human remains are encountered, all activities
in the vicinity of the discovery will cease immediately and a Reclamation official will be
contacted immediately. The Reclamation official will ensure the appropriate officials are
contacted, including contacting Reclamation’s Regional Law Enforcement Officer. If the
remains are skeletal, the Reclamation official will immediately notify Reclamation’s Regional
227

Archaeologist. Information regarding the discovery, including contents and location, will be
kept confidential and relayed only to responsible officials. Human remains will be treated with
respect, will not be disturbed, and must be protected as necessary to lessen further exposure or
impacts. Photographs will not be taken and no postings on social media is permitted. Ongoing
activities in the vicinity of the discovery will not proceed until Reclamation provides
authorization to proceed.
Reclamation will be responsible for identification of skeletal human remains as Native
American. Inadvertent and unpermitted discoveries of Native American human remains and
Native American funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony discovered
on Federal land are subject to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act
(NAGPRA) (25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.) and the implementing regulations at 43 CFR Part 10.
Reclamation is responsible for compliance with NAGPRA and for conducting tribal
consultations. Under NAGPRA, the discovery and location of human remains is confidential
and will not be shared with anyone, especially the press or social media, who is not a designated
official.

5.2 State of California Laws, Regulations, and Policies
Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act
Full compliance. The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (California PRC
Sections 2621-2630 was passed by the California Legislature in 1972 to mitigate the hazard of
surface faulting to structures. The Act’s main purpose is to prevent the construction of buildings
used for human occupancy on the surface tract of active faults. The act addresses only the
hazard of surface fault rupture and is not directed toward other earthquake hazards. Local
agencies must regulate most development in fault zones established by the State Geologist.
Before a project can be permitted in a designated Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone, cities
and counties must require a geologic investigation to demonstrate that proposed buildings would
not be constructed across active faults. The Folsom Dam Raise Project does not contain any
Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones.
Assembly Bill 52
In September of 2014, the California Legislature passed Assembly Bill (AB) 52, which
added provisions to the Public Resources Code regarding the evaluation of impacts on tribal
cultural resources under CEQA, and consultation requirements with California Native American
tribes. In particular, AB 52 now requires lead agencies to analyze project impacts on “tribal
cultural resources,” separately from archaeological resources (PRC § 21074; 21083.09). The Bill
defines “tribal cultural resources” in a new section of the PRC Section 21074. AB 52 also
requires lead agencies to engage in additional consultation procedures with respect to California
Native American tribes (PRC § 21080.3.1, 21080.3.2, 21082.3). Finally, AB 52 requires the
228

Office of Planning and Research to update Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines by July 1, 2016
to provide sample questions regarding impacts to tribal cultural resources (PRC § 21083.09). No
tribal cultural resources have been identified within the Folsom Dam Raise Project.
Asbestos Airborne Toxic Control Measure for Construction, Grading, Quarrying, and Surface
Mining Operations
Full Compliance. As required by the California EPA Air Resources Board, Section 93105
Asbestos Airborne Toxic Control Measure for Construction, Grading, Quarrying, and
Surface Mining Operations requires compliance on any work done in any portion in a geographic
ultramafic rock unit, any portion of the area to be disturbed has naturally-occurring asbestos,
serpentine, or ultramafic rock as determined by the owner / operator, or the Air Pollution Control
Officer (APCO); or naturally-occurring asbestos, serpentine, or ultramafic rock is discovered by
the owner / operator, a registered geologist, or the APCO in the area to be disturbed after the start
of any construction, grading, quarrying, or surface mining operation. The Folsom Dam Project
would be in compliance with the implementation of dust control best management practices, as
defined by Section 93105 (CARB 2016).
California Clean Air Act
Partial Compliance. The California Clean Air Act was signed into law in 1988 and, for
the first time, clearly spelled out in statute California’s air quality goals, planning mechanisms,
regulatory strategies, and standards of progress. The California Clean Air Act provides the State
with comprehensive framework for air quality planning regulation. Prior to passage of the Act,
Federal law contained the only comprehensive planning framework.
The California Clean Air Act requires attainment of state ambient air quality standards by
the earliest practicable date. For air districts in violation of the state ozone, carbon monoxide,
sulfur dioxide, or nitrogen dioxide standards, attainment plans were required by July 1991.
CARB is responsible for the development, implementation, and enforcement of California’s
motor vehicle pollution control program, GHG statewide emission estimates and goals, and
development and enforcement of GHG emission reduction rules. A summary of the major
California GHG regulations that would affect the project’s GHG emissions are presented in
Section 3.7. Section 202(a) of the California Clean Air Act requires projects to determine
whether emission sources and emission levels significantly affect air quality based on Federal
standards established by the USEPA and State standards set by CARB. Compliance with the
California Clean Air Act for GHG emissions is expected with incorporated mitigation specified
in section 3.7. As a result, full compliance with this Act is expected with coordination with
SMAQMD and preconstruction permitting.

229

California Endangered Species Act
Partial Compliance. This Act requires the non-Federal partner to consider the potential
adverse effects to State-listed species. As a joint NEPA/CEQA document, this DSEIS/SEIR has
considered the potential effects to State-listed species, as discussed in Section 3.5. There is the
potential for the Folsom Dam Raise Project to impact the state-listed bald eagle and Swainson’s
hawk, but only if nests are present at the construction sites. The Corps has been coordinating
with CDFW regarding potential impacts to State-listed species. Prior to construction of any site,
the Corps and the State would conduct preconstruction surveys to determine the presence of
nests at construction sites. If nests are present, coordination with CDFW would occur to
determine any mitigation or minimization measures that would need to be implemented. The
project would be in full compliance with this Act once these surveys are conducted and
coordination has occurred.
California Environmental Quality Act
Partial Compliance. CEQA requires that State and local agencies identify the significant
environmental impacts of their actions, and avoid or mitigate those impacts when feasible. The
CEQA amendments of December 30, 2009 specifically require lead agencies to address GHG
emissions in determining the significance of environmental effects caused by a project, and to
consider feasible means to mitigate the significant effects of GHG emissions (California Natural
Resources Agency 2012). The CVFPB, as the non-Federal partner, would undertake activities to
ensure compliance with the requirements of this Act. CEQA requires the full disclosure of
environmental effects, potential mitigation, and environmental compliance for the proposed
project. The CVFPB would consider certifying the final EIR and adopting its findings.
Certification of the final EIR by the CVFPB would provide full compliance with CEQA.
California Seismic Hazards Mapping Act
Full Compliance. The California Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990 (California
Public Resources Code [PRC] Sections 2690-2699.6) addresses seismic hazards other than
surface rupture, such as liquefaction and induced landslides. The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act
specifies that the lead agency for a project may withhold development permits until geologic or
soils investigations are conducted for specific sites, and mitigation measures are incorporated
into plans to reduce hazards associated with seismicity and unstable soils. The project area is
within the Foothills Fault System, which is located in the metamorphic belt. No active faults
have been mapped within the project area by the California Geological Survey or U.S.
Geological Survey. The closest fault is a Quaternary (younger than 1,600,000 years) is just over
8 miles to the northwest. As a result, there would be no significant effects on the project due to
seismicity and the Folsom Dam Raise Project is in full compliance with this Act.

230

California Water Code
Partial Compliance. The Folsom Dam Raise Project is located within the jurisdiction of
the Central Valley RWQCB, within the greater Sacramento Valley watershed. The preparation
and adoptions of water quality control plans, or Basin Plans, and statewide plans, is the
responsibility of the SWRCB according to State law and requires that Basin Plans conform to the
policies set forth in the California Water Code beginning with Section 13000 and any State
policy for water quality control. These plans are required by the California Water Code (Section
13240) and supported by the Federal CWA. Section 303 of the CWA requires states to adopt
water quality standards which “consist of the designated uses of the navigable waters involved
and the water quality criteria for such waters based upon such uses.” According to Section
13050 of the California Water Code, Basins Plans consist of a designation or establishment for
the waters within a specific area of beneficial uses to be protected and water quality objectives to
protect those uses. Adherence to Basin Plan water quality objectives protects continued
beneficial uses of water bodies. Because beneficial uses, together with their corresponding water
quality objectives, can be defined per Federal regulations as water quality standards, the Basin
Plans are regulatory references for meeting the State and Federal requirements for water quality
control (40 CFR 131.20). The potential effects of the proposed project on water quality have
been evaluated and are discussed in Section 3.11. Compliance with the California Water Code
would be accomplished by obtaining certifications from the Central Valley RWQCB for Section
401 and, if applicable, Section 404 review internally by the Corps.
Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act
Partial Compliance. The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act of 1970 established
the SWRCB and RWQCBs within the State of California. These groups are the primary state
agencies responsible for protecting California water quality to meet present and future beneficial
uses, and regulate appropriative surface rights allocations. The preparation and adoption of
water quality control plans, or Basin Plans, and statewide plans, is the responsibility of the
SWRCB. State law requires that Basin Plans conform to the policies set forth in the California
Water Code beginning with Section 13000 and any State policy for water quality control. These
plans are required by the California Water Code (Section 13240) and supported by the Federal
CWA. Section 303 of the CWA requires states to adopt water quality standards which “consist
of the designated uses of the navigable waters involved and the water quality criteria for such
waters based upon such uses.” According to Section 13050 of the California Water Code, Basin
Plans consist of a designation or establishment for the waters within a specified area of beneficial
uses to be protected, and adherence to water quality objectives to protect those uses. The
potential effects of the proposed project on water quality have been evaluated and are discussed
in Section 3.11. This project expects to achieve full compliance with the Water Quality Control
Act by achieving compliance with RWQCB certification mandates for Section 401 of the Federal
CWA.

231

California Streets and Highways Code
The California Streets and Highways Code authorize the California Department of
Transportation (Caltrans) to control encroachment within the State highway right-of-way.
Encroachments allow temporary or permanent use of a highway right-of-way by a utility, a
public entity, or a private party.

232

CHAPTER 6.0 - COORDINATION AND REVIEW OF DRAFT EIS/EIR
This chapter summarizes public and agency involvement activities undertaken by the
Corps, CVFPB, and SAFCA that have been conducted to date, are ongoing, and/or would be
conducted for this project, and which satisfy NEPA and CEQA requirements for public scoping
and agency consultation and coordination. Additionally, Native American consultation activities
are described.

6.1 Public Involvement Under NEPA and CEQA
The lead agencies are implementing a comprehensive public participation program to
fully inform and engage potentially affected agencies, stakeholders, and communities. This
section describes public involvement to date and future steps to be taken with the public.

6.2 Public Interest
Two public scoping meetings with identical formats and materials for the Folsom Dam
Raise Project were held from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday, February 19, 2014 at the
Folsom Community Center, and on Monday, February 24, 2014 at the Sacramento Library
Galleria. The meetings were advertised in February 2014 in the Sacramento Bee and the Folsom
Telegraph. Mail and e-mail announcements were also sent to stakeholders and other interested
parties. In addition, a Notice of Intent was filed with the Federal Register on February 6, 2014.
When the draft SEIS/SEIR is completed, it will be released and a public meeting
scheduled during the public review period.

6.3 Native American Consultation
As part of the Section 106 process, the Corps is required to identify Native American
Tribes that attach cultural affiliation to historic properties that may be affected by the proposed
undertaking (36 CFR Part 800.3(f)(2). As part of the 36 CFR Part 800.4(a)(4), the Corps has
consulted with and is presently consulting with the Wilton Rancheria, the Tsi-Akim Maidu of the
Taylorsville Rancheria, the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians, and the United Auburn
Indian Community of the Auburn Rancheria in an effort to identify sites of religious and cultural
significance in the APE that may be affected by the proposed undertaking. A detailed
consultation log is included in Appendix I. If historic properties are identified during this
consultation process, and if the proposed undertaking results in adverse effects to the identified
233

historic properties, then the Corps will work with appropriate Native American Tribes and SHPO
to mitigate adverse effects to those resources.
The provisions of AB 52 only apply to projects that have a notice of preparation filed on
or after July 1, 2015, and therefore the Bill’s requirements are not applicable to the proposed
Project (the NOP was filed February 17 2014 SCH# 2006022091). Although AB 52
requirements were not in place at the time of the NOP, Tribal coordination noted above and
documented in Appendix I, occurred and is substantially consistent with the intent of AB52 for
this project.

Summary

On behalf of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office (Service) has conducted a delineation of waters of the
United States (wetland delineation) for the proposed American River Watershed
Investigation, Folsom Dam Raise Project (Folsom Dam Raise) in Granite Bay, Placer
County, California. The project site involves Dikes 4-6, north of the right wing dam of
Folsom Dam. This delineation identifies the type and extent of "navigable waters,"
"wetlands," and "other waters" that occur within or adjacent to the 69.9-acre, Dikes 4-6
project area. A total of 0.083 acre of seasonal wetlands in two distinct parts was delineated
adjacent to the Dike 4-6 project area. The Dikes 4-6 project area, as currently proposed,
would include Folsom Lake when the lake is at its maximum pool elevation, normally about
466 feet above sea level. The wetland delineation reported herein discusses two areas
identified as wetlands; both in the vicinity of Dike 6. No wetlands were identified in the
staging and construction areas of Dike 4 and Dike 5.
The delineation of waters of the United States, including wetlands, is subject to verification
by the Corps. The Service advises all parties to treat the information contained herein as
preliminary until the Corps provides written verification of the boundaries of its jurisdiction.
Introduction

The Corps regulates impacts to waters of the United States under the jurisdictional authority
of Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act
of 1972 (33 U.S.C. 403; 33 U.S.C. 1344). Jurisdictional waters of the United States include
all navigable waters, interstate waters, their tributaries, and adjacent wetlands (Environmental
Laboratory 1987).
The purpose of this report is to describe the extent and type of jurisdictional wetlands
present within, or nearby, a portion of the proposed Folsom Dam Raise study area that fall
under the jurisdiction of Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act. Accordingly, this report addresses all identified potential jurisdictional
waters of the United States, including wetlands, for the proposed project in the vicinity of
Dikes 4-6. Data and conclusions contained in this report are based on information gathered
in the field, the 1987 U.S. Amry Corps ofEngineers Wetland Deli11eatio11 Man11al, the Regional
S11pplement to the Corps ofEngineers Wetland Delineation Ma1111al: Arid West Region (Version 2.0)
(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 2008), and Federal regulations governing waters of the
United States.
a) Definitions and Criteria

Navigable Waters of the United States.

Generally, waters of the United States are
subject to the ebb and flow of the tide shoreward to the mean high water mark, and/ or
are presently used, or have been used in the past, or may be susceptible to use transport
interstate or foreign commerce (33 CFR §329).
Other waters of the United States.

As used in this report, this term refers to features
determined to be waters of the United States by the Corps, and includes unvegetated

waterways and water bodies with a defined bed and bank and an ordinary high water
mark, such as drainages, creeks, rivers, and lakes. Other waters of the United States
typically lack hydrophytic vegetation and may also lack hydric soils (33 CFR §328.3).
Wedands. For regulatory purposes, wetlands are a subgroup of waters of the United
States defined as areas that are inundated, or saturated by surface or groundwater at a
frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do
support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated conditions.
Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas (33 CFR §328 3;
40 CFR §230.3).
.

Study Area Location

a)

The study area is located along the west boundary of Folsom Lake
along Dikes 4 6 in Granite Bay, Placer County, California. The study area is located
within the Folsom 7.5-minute U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle. Dike 5 lies between
Dikes 4 and 6 at latitude 38° 43' 44.3" and longitude 121° 10' 15.8," which in Universal
Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 10 coordinates is northing 4288289 and easting
658979.

d)

USGS Hydrologic Unit: The Dikes 4-6 mark the boundary between the North Fork
American, California USGS Hydrologic Map Unit (Number 18020128) on the lakeside,
and the Lower American, California USGS Hydrologic Map Unit (Number 18020111) to
the landside.

The Dikes 4-6 project area of the Folsom Dam Raise Project encompasses
about 69.9 acres (Figure 1). Folsom Lake usually operates at pool elevations between
425 and 466 feet above sea level. The operational normal maximum pool elevation is
466 feet. Other adjacent areas with suitability as potential staging areas also were
analyzed for wetlands and comprise about 35 acres. In total we analyzed an area of
about 105 acres.
Folsom-Auburn Road passes from
Folsom through Granite Bay, northward to Auburn and within 300 feet to the west of
the project area by Dike 5 (Figure 1). At the south end of Dike 6, the entrance to the
Beals Point State Recreation Area crosses from Auburn-Folsom Road to a parking area
for the recreation facility on the waterside.

Environmental Setting

a)

An access road runs north from the Beals Point Road
north across the crowns of Dikes 4, 5, and 6. From the Beals Point Road northward,
across the crown of Dike 6, to the southern end of Dike 5 is paved with asphalt.
Otherwise the access roads are gravel.

Current/Recent Land Use:

The Beals Point State Recreation Area lies at the south end of Dike 6. A large, asphalt
parking area, restrooms, and other recreational facilities are on the waterside, east of the
south end of Dike 6. When the pool of the lake is at design level, most of the waterside
2

represent the dikes and potential staging areas.

3

of the Dikes 4-6 project area is submerged. A camping area occupies about 11.5 acres
adjacent to the landside of Dike 6, just north of the Beals Point entrance road. A
private, equestrian boarding facility is located on the east side of Auburn-Folsom Road,
to the landside of Dike 4. Multipurpose trails for non-motorized use line the landside
area north from the campground by Dike 6 to the equestrian facility by Dike 4 and
beyond.
b)

Site Elevation: The crowns of the dikes have an elevation of about 483 feet above
mean sea level. The lowest area of the Dikes 4-6 project area lies to the landside of
Dike 5, where the elevation is about 380 feet above mean sea level.

c)

Climate:

d)

The City of Folsom is located south of Folsom Dam,
while Granite Bay is located along the western shores of the lake. The Dikes 4-6 project
area is situated within the suburban landscape, with the dikes designed to keep lake
waters from the lower lying areas to the west. The immediate area contains rolling hills
and the dikes are among the highest points on the landscape.

e)

Hydrology/Hydrologic Features/Hydrologic Connectivity: The dikes contain
Folsom Lake to the east. The San Juan Water District facility, containing Hunkle
Reservoir, lies directly south of the Dikes 4-6 project area, adjacent to the right wing dam
of Folsom Dam. From Hunkle Reservoir, an open ditch flows westward about
0.25 mile, under Auburn-Folsom Road to Baldwin Reservoir. Groundwater drainage
from each of the dikes collects to form the headwaters of Linda Creek. Linda Creek
flows in a northwesterly direction toward the City of Roseville and into Dry Creek,
which in turn flows into the Natomas East Main Drainage Canal and eventually the
Sacramento River.

f)

Appendi.'C A contains a soil survey map for the Dikes 4-6 project area. The soils
of the study area are predominantly Andregg coarse sandy loam (Soil Survey Staff 2014).
However, much of the area directly occupied by the dikes appears to be Xerothents as
well. The Dikes 4-6 project area also occupies areas of the Ink-Exchequer complex (Soil
Survey Staff 2014).

The climate is typically Mediterranean, with cool, wet winters and hot, dry
summers. Annual precipitation recorded at Folsom Dam averages 23.92 inches, of
which 20.48 inches fall from October through March (Western Regional Climate Center
2014). Water years 2012 and 2013 were dry years, and 2014 continues the drought trend
(California Department of Water Resources 2014). The annual maximum air
temperature for Folsom is 75.4°F, ranging from an average in July of 97.0 °F to 54.3 °F
in January (Western Regional Climate Center 2014).
Site Topography/Landscape:

Soils:

Andregg Soils - Andregg soils occur on the project site on 2 to 50 percent slopes. This
moderately deep, well-drained soil is located on foothill locations. Parent material for
these soils is granitic. Slopes are complex and can be rocky. Typically surface layers are
grayish-brown coarse sandy loam about 15 inches thick. Sub-soils are pale brown and
very pale brown coarse sandy loam about 14 inches thick.

4

Inks Soils - Inks soils occur on the project site on 2 to 30 percent slopes. This shallow,
well-drained cobbly soil is located on long, broad volcanic ridges and side slopes. Parent
material for these soils is andesitic conglomerate. Inclusions of Exchequer soil may be
present. Typically surface layers are yellowish brown cobbly loam about 5 inches thick.
The sub-soils are brown very cobbly clay loam about 13 inches thick.
Xerothent Soils - Xerothent soils, or cut and fill areas, occur throughout the project site.
This well-drained material consists of mechanically removed and mixed soil in which
horizons are no longer discernable. Surface runoff is very rapid and the hazard for
erosion is moderate. Permeability and available water capacity is variable.

g)

Plant communities: Three major natural plant community cover-types were identified
in the project area: valley oak woodland, riparian woodland, and annual grassland. Also,
much of the land on the waterside of the dikes is bare ground that would be covered in
standing water when not in drought years. These land cover-types include jurisdictional
wetlands and other waters of the United States, as well as non-jurisdictional upland
habitat.

Valley oak woodland - The valley oak woodland habitat is best developed on deep, well­
drained alluvial soils, usually in valley bottoms. Most large, healthy valley oaks are
probably rooted in permanent water supplies. These woodlands are dominated by valley
oak, with black walnut, interior live oak, boxelder, and blue oak as common associates.
Oak woodlands with little or no grazing tend to develop a bird-disseminated understory
cover, which is best developed along natural drainage areas. Poison oak, blue elderberry,
California buckeye, toyon, California coffeeberry, and California blackberry are common
understory species. Ground cover includes wild oats, brome, barley, ryegrass, and
needle-grass.
Verner (1980) reported that 30 bird species, known to use oak habitats in California,
include acorns in their diet. Gaines (1977) reported two dozen breeding bird species in
the habitat, including: California quail, plain titmouse, scrub jay, spotted towhee,
Bewick's wren, bushtit, willow flycatcher, and acorn woodpecker. Western gray and fox
squirrels, as well as mule deer, are common mammals that use the food and shelter of
the habitat.
Riparian woodland - Riparian woodland is found on the waterside of the dikes within
the study area. The upper canopy is dominated by several species including Fremont
cottonwood, box elder, white alder, Chinese tallow, sycamore, valley oak, live oak,
Goodding's willow, and other willow species. The lower shrub canopy is dense and
thicket-like, with dominant species including California buckeye, California rose,
blackberry, blue elderberry, poison oak, and shrub-like forms of the various willow
species. The herbaceous understory ranges from very developed to sparse depending on
the amount of light filtering through the upper canopies, but typically includes various
grasses, sedges, and rushes.
Transition to non-riparian habitat types is usually abrupt and related to water and soil
saturation. Shrubby willow thickets can last 15-20 years before becoming overtopped by
5

cottonwoods. Wildlife guilds of the riparian woodlands are generally the same as those
of valley oak woodlands.
Annual grassland - Annual grasslands occur on both the landside and waterside of the
dikes. Grassland composition and structure is largely dependent on weather patterns
and vegetation management (i.e., mowing). Generally, germination occurs in the fall and
growth remains low in stature until temperatures rise in the spring. In areas of light
grazing, dead plant material accumulates over the summer months, whereas heavy spring
grazing favors the growth of summer-annual forbs. No grazing occurs in the Dikes 4-6
project area. In general, annual grassland habitat occurs mostly on flat plains to gently
rolling foothills.
The dominant species of the annual grasslands are introduced grasses, including wild
oats soft chess, Italian rye grass, ripgut brome, red brome, wild barley, and foxtail fescue.
Common forbs include broadleaf filaree, redstem filaree, turkey mullein, true clovers, bur
clover, and popcorn flower. In moist or lightly grazed areas perennial grasses also are
found, including purple needlegrass and Idaho fescue. Species composition is mainly
dependent on seasonal and annual fluctuations in precipitation levels.
Reptiles of annual grasslands include the western fence lizard, mountain garter snake,
and northern Pacific rattlesnake (Basey and Sinclear 1980). Typical mammals include the
black-tailed jackrabbit, California ground squirrel, Botta's pocket gopher, western harvest
mouse, California vole, badger, and coyote (White et al. 1980). Breeding birds may
include the short-eared owl, horned lark, and western meadowlark ryerner et al. 1980).
Foraging birds include the turkey vulture, northern harrier, American kestrel, black­
shouldered kite, and prairie falcon. Areas with annual grassland vegetation in the project
area are dominated by a mixture of annual grasses and herbaceous, nonnative or ruderal,
weedy species. This cover-type generally occurs on dike slopes and in areas subject to
periodic disturbance. Ruderal areas are common along the edge of agricultural fields and
on the faces of dikes.
Delineation Methods and References

a) Review of aerial imagery: Prior to making field observations, aerial imagery was
reviewed to assess the study area for potential wetland acreage.
b) Date of Field O bservations: The field observations for this delineation occurred on
June 10, 2014. All observations were made by Service biologists Mark Littlefield, Harry
Kahler, and Amber Aguilera. Completed Wetland Data Forms -Arid West Region are
provided in Appendix B.
c) Wetland Vegetation Indicator Status Reference: Taxonomic nomenclature for plant
species is in accordance with the Jepson Mam1al (Hickman 1993), wetland indicator status
for plant species was determined using National List ofPlant Speiies That Occur in Wetlands:
California (Region OJ (Reed 1988), and the "Dominance Test" and "Prevalence Index"
were applied to determine plant dominance (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 2008).

6

d) Hydric Soil Method of Determination Followed: A soil pit to a depth of up to 12
inches was dug within each suspected wetland feature. Soils were examined in order to
assess field indicators of hydric soils. Positive indicators of hydric soils were observed in
the field in accordance with the criteria outlined in Field Indicators of Hydric Soils in the
United States (Hurt 2006) and the Regional Supplement to the Corps ofEngineers Wetland
Delineation Ma1111al.- Arid West Region (Version 2.0) (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 2008).
The color of the soils was determined using a Munsell® soil color chart.
e) Wetland Hydrology Method of Determination Followed: Presence of primary and
secondary wetland hydrology indicators were documented for each suspected wetland
feature. These include inundation, saturation within the upper 12 inches of the soil
profile, water marks, drift lines, sediment deposits, surface soil cracks, oxidized
rhizospheres along living roots, presence of reduced iron, hydrogen sulfide odor, biotic
crust, salt crust, and drainage patterns in wetlands.

f)

Wetland Mapping:

All sample points and wetland polygon boundaries were recorded
using a Garmin Global Positioning System (GPS) unit capable of sub-meter accuracy
(NAD 83 projection, UTM Zone 10). The data was then overlaid onto a site-specific
topographic map and aerial National Agriculture Imagery Program images from 2012.

Delineation Results and Discussion

Two areas were identified as wetlands in our analyses of the Dikes 4-6 project area. The two
wetland features were identified on the landside of Dike 6 (Figure 2). Although each
wetland feature is outside the Dikes 4-6 project area as currently planned, the wetland
features are within areas that potentially could be used as staging areas if the project is
modified.
Wetland WM012 occupies a highly disturbed area near the landside toe of Dike 6. Although
many non-native and upland plant species are present, indicators showed the presence of
hydrophytic vegetation. A strong sulfur odor and redox features indicated a wetland soil.
Also, the ground at the wetland WM012 site is saturated and shows drainage patterns.
Wetland WM013 also is on the landside toe of Dike 6. Hydrophytic vegetation indicators,
the gleyed soils with a sulfurous odor, and the presence of surface water indicate the site is a
wetland.
After examining aerial imagery and ground truthing, we took soil sample points within areas
where wetland species were readily visible within the vegetation strata. Plant species were
noted and the percentage of absolute cover and dominant species were determined
throughout the vegetation community. Species that could not be identified in the field were
collected and identified by experts in the Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office. The wetland
indicator status for each plant species across all vegetation strata were recorded on data
forms found in Appendi..x A.
Soil surveys were conducted in two areas where ocular estimations of plant communities
indicated a potential for the area to meet the wetland definition. Vegetation data collected
on a site on the waterside of Dike 6 indicated wetland status (Figure 3). The soils within that
area consisted of a thin loamy layer (about 6-10 inches) above granite, with no mottling.
However, roots along willow branches, about 10 feet above ground level, indicated the site
7

was within the high water mark of normal pool flooding of Folsom Lake. No other
hydrology indicators were present. At another site by Dike 5 the vegetation data collected
indicated a prevalence and dominance of upland species (Figure 4). Furthermore, the soils
were sandy and demonstrated no wetland characteristics. A drainage area flows nearby, but
it is outside the current project boundary and is not likely to be included in any future
staging plans. No potential wetland areas were identified in or adjacent to project
boundaries near Dike 4.
The Dikes 4-6 project area contains portions of Folsom Lake when the pool elevation is at
its operational maximum pool elevation of 466 feet. No waters of the United States were
identified with the Dikes 4-6 project area, yet other waters (Folsom Lake) lie on the
waterside of the dikes. The WM014 site is about 0.50 acre, yet would be covered by water
when the lake is at the operational maximum pool elevation of 466 feet. Table 1 provides an
acreage summary of waters of the United States.

Dear Ms. Kirchner:
The U.S. Anny Corps of Engineers (Corps) has requested supplemental coordination under the Fish
and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA) for the Folsom Dam Raise Project, in Sacramento, El

Dorado, and Placer Counties, California. This letter transmits the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's
(Service) draft supplemental FWCA report for the proposed project (enclosed). By copy of this

letter, we are requesting the agencies listed below to provide any review comments to the Service so
that they can be incorporated into a final report for inclusion in the Corps' environmental

documents.

If you have any questions regarding this report on the proposed project, please contact

DRAFT SUPPLEMENTAL FISH AND WILDLIFE COORDINATION ACT REPORT
FOR THE FOLSOM DAM RAlSE PROJECT
FEBRUARY 2015
BACKGROUND
Folsom Dam and its associated facilities (collectively referred to as the Folsom Facility) are located
23 miles northeast of Sacramento, near the City of Folsom, California. The Folsom Facility

impounds waters from the north and south forks of the American River and was constructed to
proV'ide flood damage reduction, water supply, and hydropower. The Folsom Facility is made up of
the main concrete dam, the right and left wing dams, Mormon Island Atuciliary Dam (MLAD), and
8 dikes that collectively impound 1,01 0,000 acre�feet (AF) of water at a reservoir water surface
elevation of 466 feet. The concrete datn and earthen wing dams serve to impound water associated

with the main stem of the American River. MIAD serves to datn watet within a historic rivet

channel, while the earthen dikes serve to contain water at low areas in the topography during periods
when the reservoir is full or nearly full.
The Folsom Dam Safety/Flood Damage Reduction Project (FDS/FDR Project), also refer.red to as
the Folsom Dam Modification Project or the Folsom Joint Federal Project, is a cooperative effort
among the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation),
the State of California Central Valley Flood Protection Board, and the Sacramento Area Flood
Protection Agency. The FDS/FDR Project includes measures to remedy dam safety issues
associated with seismic, static, and hydrologic concerns, and to provide increased flood damage
protection by increasing the flood storage capacity and/or pool release mechanisms of the Folsom
Facility. The potential effects of the Folsom FDS/FDR Project on environmental resources were
evaluated in the 2007 Final Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report
(FEIS/EIR) and 2007 Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA) Report. The evaluation in the
2007 FEIS/EIR and 2007 FWCA report were based on technical studies and the level of project
design available at the time.
Portions of the FDS/FDR Project have been constructed or are currently in construction. This

includes construction of a new auxiliary spillway to address dam safety and flood damage reduction
concerns related to the discharge of flood waters from Folsom Dam, the replacement of three
existing emergency spillway gates at the main dam, modifications to the main dam and 6 of the 1 1
eatthen structures to address seismic and static concerns, security imptovements, and development
of an updated water control manual for Folsom Dam.

The Folsom Dam Raise Project is an element of the FDS/FDR Project that would increase the
flood storage capacity by increas1ng the height of Dikes 1 through 8, the left and right wing dams,
and MIAO by 3.5 feet. These facilities would be raised utilizing either an earthen embankment raise
or a reinforced concrete flood wall. Dikes 1 through 8 and MIAD would be raised using earthen
engineered fill material similar to the existing dike and auxiliary dam composition, and a reinforced

3.5 foot concrete floodwall would be constructed on the left and right wing dams. In addition, the
main spillway and emergency spillway gates would be modified to improve flow capacity. This
supplemental FWCA report only addresses the work specific to raising the associated facilities of
Folsom Dam by 3.5 feet and the modification of the main spillway and emergency spillway gates.

DRAFT-SUBJECT TO CHANGE

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Folsom Dam Raise Project includes increasing the height of Dikes 1 through 8, the left and right
wing au.wary dams, and MI.AD by

3.5 feet by means of an earthen embankment raise or a
3.5 feet would provide an

reinforced concrete flood wall. Raising the associated facilities by

increased surcharge storage capacity which would require modification of the main spillway and
emergency spillway gates. Modification of the gates include adding top seal bulk heads to the tainter
gates, raising the hoist motors and gate lifting mechanisms, and reinforcing the support struts on the
gates.
Dikes 1 through 8 and MI.AD would be raised using an engineered fill material similar to the existing
composition of the earthen dikes that would allow the proper amount of seepage and pore pressure
to be maintained through the interface between the old and new material. The slopes and crest
widths would conform to Corps standards while maintaining Reclamations requirements for security
and maintenance.
The Corps would also construct a reinforced concrete flood wall on the left and right wing dams
that would tie into the main dam, the new control structure, and the existing terrain. Construction
of the flood wall would involve excavating a small portion of the top of each earthen structure to
receive the base for the wall, constructing forms to receive cement, pouring the cement, removing
the forms for the next construction length, and replacing the embankment fill along with a drainage

element to control pore pressures (Figure

1 in Appendi'C A).

The haul routes for the project predominantly use existing service routes along the immediate toes
of the existing embankments and/ or are in-reservoir (Figures 2-6 in Appendix A). The identified
routes avoid sutveyed cultural resource sites, incorporate public safety measures, and provide
temporary alternate public access detours at major recreation area access points. Staging at:eas for all
eight dikes, both wing dams, and MlAD are identified on Figures 2-6 in Appendix A.
The purpose of the project is the reduction of flood risk. The 3.5 foot raise increases the flood risk
reduction capability of Folsom Dam and Lake by allowing better use of the existing surcharge
storage capacity. The addition of the top seal bulkheads over the service and emergency gates would
allow Reclamation to pass the probable ma.'Ci.mum flood event without over-topping the gates while
utilizing the additional surcharge storage space.

Vegetation

S111ro1111 di11g Folsom Luke a11d Upstream

The area surrounding Folsom Lake supports a mL"\: of habitat types, dominated by blue oak-grey

pine woodland. The lower foothill area near Folsom Dam contains large areas of oak woodland,

with scattered blue and interior live oaks. Small areas of chaparral extend to the reservoir's upper
edge, particularly along the south fork of the American River. Annual grassland areas are
interspersed throughout the area, and human-disturbed habitats occur around recreation facilities.
Relatively small areas of riparian habitats can be found along tributaries to the reservoir and within
seep areas. Willow stands and individual trees have become established within some areas of the
reservoir pool.
Vegetation at MIAD consists mainly of annual grasses with a small portion of oak woodland and
occasional freshwater marsh wetlands at the base of MIAD along Green Valley Road. MIAD was
constructed to dam water within an historic river channel, creating several perennial wetlands on the
landside, in addition to a wetland preserve (Mormon Island Preserve) that is run by the California
Department of Parks and Recreation. The major \regetation communities identified in this area in
2008 were cattail emergent wetland and cottonwood/willow riparian woodland.
Lower Ametica11 Riller

The lower American River, although highly modified from conditions of 150 years ago, supports a
diverse and highly valuable area for biological resources. The 23-mile-long reach of the American
River Parkway downstream of Folsom Darn encompasses about 4,000 acres, the majot-ity of which
are in a State designated floodway and contains large areas of annual grasslands, riparian forest and
scrub-shrub, oak-wood.lands, bare sand and grave� and surface waters of the river and its associated
sloughs and dredge ponds (Service 2003).

Fo/.rom Lake and Upstream

When full, Folsom Lake encompasses about 10,000 surface acres of water and 75 miles of shoreline,
extending about 1 5 miles up the north fork and 10.5 miles up the south fork of the American River.
It supports a "two stage" fishery; warm water species such as bass Qargemouth, smallmouth,
spotted), sunfish (redear, bluegill) and crappie (white, black) in the upper portion of the water
column, and trout and landlocked salmon (kokanee and Chinook) in deeper portions of the water
column. Various catfish and bullhead species can also be found near the bottotn of the lake in
shallower waters. Fish habitat is present within the inundation zone in the form o f young willow
dominated riparian habitat which grows during extended periods of drought. Both warm and cold
water fisheries tend to benefit from increased peak spring water storage since it results in better cold
water reserves for the salmonids and increased spawning and rearing habitat for warm water fish
(Service 2001). Sport fishing is an economically important and popular recreational activity at
Folsom Lake.
Sediment associated with the Folsom Facility tnay contain mercury from historic mining operations
and metals from historic activities or geology in the American River drainage (Reclamation 2006).
Most of the mercury in water, soil, sediments, or plants and animals is in the form of inorganic
mercury salts and organic forms of mercury (e.g., methylmercury). Mercury cycles in the
environment as a result of natural and human activities and can accumulate most efficiently in the
aquatic food web. Predatory species a t the top of the food web generally have higher mercury
concentrations. Nearly all of the mercury that accumulates in fish tissue is methylmercury (EPA
2006).

Lo111erAmerica11 River

The lower American River supports a diverse and abundant fish community; altogether, at least
41 species of fish are known to inhabit the rivet (Service 1986). In recognition of its "outstanding
and remarkable" fishery resources, the entire lower American River was included in the Wild and
Scenic Rivers System in 1981, which provides some protection for these resources (Service 1991).
Four anadromous species are important from a commercial and recreational perspective. The lower
river supports a large run of fall-run Chinook salmon, a species with both commercial and
recreational values. The salmon run is sustained b)r natural reproduction in the river, and by
hatchery production at the Nimbus Salmon and Steelhead Hatchery, operated by the California
Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). The average annual production of fall-run Chinook
salmon in the American River from 1992-2009 is 1 09,574 (Service 2013).
Steelhead, a popular sport fish, are largely sustained in the river by production from the Nimbus
Hatchery, because summer water temperatures often exceed the tolerances of juvenile steelhead,
which typically spend about 1 year in the river. The anadromous fish trap count for steelhead at the
Nimbus Hatchery was 3,371 adults during the 2012/2013 season (CDFW 2015). American shad
and striped bass enter the river to spawn; these two species, introduced into the Sacramento River
system in the late 1800s, now support popular sport fisheries. In addition to species of econotnic
interest, the lower American River supports many nongame species, including Sacramento
pikeminnow, Sacramento sucker, tule perch, and hardhead (Setvice 1994).
Wildlife
S111ro11JJding Foliom Lake and Upstream

The area surrounding Folsom Lake supports an animal community characteristic of the lower Sierra
Nevada western slope. Although the range of elevation is small, habitats are diverse, in pa.rt because
the reservoir extends about 20 miles into the Sierra Nevada foothills, from gentle hills near the dam
to steep-walled canyons along the forks of the American River. More than 50 species of mammals
live in these areas (Service 1986). Common species include mule deer, striped skunk, black-tailed
jackrabbit, brush rabbit, raccoon, California ground squirrel, and a diverse assemblage of stnall
mammals, including mice, ''oles, and pocket gophers. Less common mammals include river otters,
mountain lions, badgers, and bobcats. Birds typical of oak-dominated habitats include acorn
woodpeckers, scrub jays, ash-throated flycatchers, and California quail. Oaks provide acorns, a
nutrient-rich and important food sow:ce for mule deer, acorn woodpecker, northern flicker, Nuttall's
woodpecker, white-breasted nuthatch, and scrub jay. In addition to a diverse community of small
passerine birds, other birds such as woodpeckers, California quail, introduced wild turkeys, Canada
geese, and various birds of prey are fairly common near the reservoir. The presence of year-round
water pwvides habitat for many water-associated species such as wood duck, common merganser,
mallard, black phoebe, greater yellowlegs, and belted kingfisher. The Mormon Island Preserve also
provides a perennial wetland for many species including pond turtles.
Areas dominated by annual grassland provide foraging habitat and cover for California ground
squirrel, pocket gopher, turkey vulture, coyote, western fence lizard, western rattlesnake, western
kingbird, and western meadowlark. Grassland areas are important to tnany foraging raptors. Red­
tailed hawk, golden eagle, ferruginous hawk, rough-legged hawk, American kestre� and prairie falcon
all spend time in the area for wintering and/ or breeding.

LoiverAmerican River
The lowet American River corridor provides a mosaic of riparian, riverine, grassland, and oak
woodland habitat. These diverse habitats support a corresponding diversity of wildlife.
The lower American River provides feeding, resting, and/ ot nesting habitat for many bird species,
many of which require the aquatic areas o f the river and backwaters, or the riparian vegetation of the
ecosystem. Riparian areas are known to support a species-rich songbird community (Gaines 1977),
and the lower American River also provides habitat for many raptors, including Swainson's hawks,
red-shouldered hawks, Cooper's hawks, and great-horned owls, all of which require ot are closely
associated with riparian vegetation. Bald eagles, which are more common around Folsom Lake,
occasionally use the lower river, which provides roosting and foraging habitat. Waterfowl,
particularly mallards and Canada geese, also use the area extensively.
More than

50 species of mammals have been recorded for the area (Service 1986). Common species

include beaver, black-tailed jackrabbit, striped skunk, Virginia opossum, .i:accoon, California ground
squirrel, gophers, and many small rodents and insectivores including voles, moles, shrews, deer mice,
and pocket gophers. Uncommon species include mule deer, and several carnivores, such as badger,
long-tailed weasel, river otter, gray fox, coyote, bobcat, and mink.
Reptile species of the lower American River include common kingsnake, Gilbert and western skinks,
southern alligator lizard, western fence lizard, gopher snake, and several garter snakes. Common
amphibians include Pacific treefrog, California newt, California slender salamander, western toad,
and the introduced bullfrog.
Relatively little is known about invertebrates of the lower American River, but elderberry plants are
fairl}' common in areas, and provide habitat for the endangered valley elderberry longhorn beetle.

FUTURE CONDITIONS WITHOUT THE PROJECT

Future without-project conditions are those conditions expected to occur over the life of the project
if the project were not implemented.
Under the without-pro)ect condition, the Corps would not implement the

particularly cottonwood and willows, would slowly decline, as continued lateral erosion, net
downstream sediment movement, and incteased amount of higher terrace areas, exposed to less
frequent flooding, develop as a result of increased channel stability. These processes have resulted
from the constrnction of Folsom Dam and channel tnodifications along the lowei: Atnerican River
(Service 1991).
Sediment deposition needed for the establishment of these riparian species would continue to be
limited by upstream impoundments. Forest complexes would be dominated by species adapted to
relati�ely low water needs. Riparian species would gradually matme then die out, giving way to mote
dxought-tolerant plant species such as ash, box elder, and valley and live oaks. Vegetation would
continue to be affected by its location in a major metropolitan area. Associated impacts include
vandalism, burning, and mowing for firebreaks, among the more common human disturbances.
Some younger riparian vegetation that currently exists would continue to develop over time into
mature riparian woodland habitat.

Conditions for fish in the lower American River are likely to change in the future without the
project. However, the way in which conditions change is difficult to predict. With continued
implementation of the Anadxomous Fish Restoration Program of the Central Valley Project
Improvement Act (Service 1995), conditions in the lower American River are expected to improve
for fishery resources.
Other variables would determine the way in which flows are managed on the lower American River;
including meeting the needs of downstream water quality standards, existing and renewed water
contracts, and any additional new water contract quantities.

The types of wildlife species found in the area would likely change somewhat along the lower
American Ri'rer under without-project conditions, due primarily to the changes in vegetation
described above and overall habitat abundance and diversity. Species which would decrease in
number are those that prefer tree species such as cottonwood and willow for perching, foraging,
and/or nesting (Service 1991a), as these plant species would likely decrease over time. Such wildlife
species include birds such as woodpeckers, flickers, wrens, and raptors, and other a'rian species that
use these riparian areas to meet their life requirements. Alternatively, species that prefer more arid
habitat, such as oak woodland, would increase over time.

Impacts to annual grassland would be mini.mi.zed by seeding all impacted areas with native grasses as

soon as construction activities are complete in that specific area. It was anticipated that the work
would be phased, so the annual grassland areas would not all be disturbed at the same time. In
addition, the impacts to other disturbed lands can be minimized by replanting with native annual
grasses, when possible.

Operational Impacts
Folsom Lake
In

2001, the Corps proposed enlargement of the existing Folsom Dam outlets as part of the

authorization under the American River Watershed Investigation Folsom Dam Modification Project,
which directed the Corps to change the variable flood storage space at Folsom Lake from the
current intetitn operation of 400,000 -

670,000 AF to a 400,000 - 600,000 AF permanent variable

flood space operation once the Folsom Dam Modification Project had been itnplemented. This
change would increase the level of flood protection by enabling operators to balance outflows with
inflow early in the storm hydrograph, and attain a maximwn discharge of 1 1 5,000 cubic feet per
second (cfs) through the enlarged outlets for a

10-year or larger event. At that time the Service

analyzed the impact of the revised Folsom Dam Modification Project to the cold water pool, gravel
movement, and seed dispersal. The Service completed a F\'<ICA report for the American River
Watershed Investigation Folsom Dam Modification Project in

2001 (Service 2001).

When the Folsom DS/FDR project is completed, Folsom Dam would have four methods of
discharging flows from the reservoir: three power penstocks, eight flood control outlets,
tainter/radial spillway gates set neat the main spillway crest (five service and three emergency), and
si."X submerged tainter gates in the new auxiliary spillway. To ensure adequate tailwater, the three
emergency spillway gates may not be used unless the total outflow frotn the dam exceeds

240,000

cfs. This restriction makes the emergency gates unusable for normal flood control purposes and
limits the use of the gates to dam safety outflows (Reclamation 2006a).

LowerAme1fra11 Riuer
Implementation of the project would be identical to the without-project condition up to inflows of
around

300,000 cfs, or about the 140 year event. Between the 140 year event (0.7°'o probability of

occurrence) and about the 200 year ev'ent (0.5° o probability of occurrence), the raise would maintain
outflows at not more than

1 15,000 cfs, while the without-project conditions would be uncontrolled,

resulting in very high outflows of 1 80,000-315,000 cfs.

DRAFT-SUBJECT TO CHANGE

The Corps and Reclamation, along with other agencies and water groups, are in the process of
developing an updated water control manual for Folsom Dam that incorporates the flood risk
reduction benefits of the American River Watershed Investigation Common Featw:es Project and
the new auxiliary spillway. The updated water control manual is scheduled to be implemented after
the completion of the new auxiliary spillway and would be updated again to .incorporate the flood
control benefits of the Folsom Dam Raise Project. The development of the updated water control
manual is a collaborative process with the appropriate level of environmental analysis, public, agency
and stakeholder coordination, and appropriate NEPA/CEQA documentation. If an updated water
control manual is not developed, Folsom Dam would be operated under the existing operating
criteria. Under this scenario, the same amount of water would be .released with and without the
project.
Vegetation
Folsom Lake

The enlargement o f Folsom Lake du:ough a raise would allow for additional flood surge storage
capacity, on a temporary basis, and not for increasing the storage capacity of the reservoir. About
813.7 acres would be affected by raising Folsom Dam 3.5 feet. Some of these lands are al.ready
developed or contain otherwise disturbed habitat, that provide little or no value for wildlife species,
and some support vegetation that is tolerant of flooding. Table 2 swnmarizes the acreage of each

cover-type which prmrides Yalue for wildlife that is expected to receive inundation over the life of
the project. Inundation effects around Folsom Lake would occur in large part by the frequency,
timing, and duration o f flooding. Inundation impacts are shown for the 3.5 foot raise operating
under the current water control manual/dam operations.

Studies to date indicate that predicting the effects of inundation on vegetation is not straightforward.
Raising Folsom Dam would have the potential for two significant mpacts
i
on vegetation:
(1) changes in vegetation composition caused by inundation affecting survi,,al and reproduction of
\Tegetation in the zone between current and proposed maximum reservoir levels; and (2) effects of
inundation on soil erosion and slippage, especially on steep slopes as are found along the upper
reservoi.r and the forks of the American River.

DRAFT-SUBJECT TO CHANGE

The vegetation types exposed to flooding are not, in general, highly tolerant of prolonged flooding.
With the exception of riparian and riverine habitats, natural flooding does not occur in the areas
which would be flooded by raising Folsom Dam. Studies of the effects of inundation on blue oaks
(1975 in Service 1 9 80; MWA-JSA 1994) have found that blue oaks can survive some flooding, but
may be sensitive to periods of inundation of as little as 7 days. It is not clear from these studies,
however, at what time of year flooding occurred, and the ability of vegetation to tolerate inundation
depends oo the time of year. For example, deciduous trees, such as oaks, tend to be much more
sensiti\re to flooding during their period of active growth (i.e., in the spring), while winter-dormant
plants appear to be more tolerant of flooding (Senrice 1980). Folsom Lake can be expected to fill

during a spring flood event, when oaks are actively growing. The absence of blue oaks within the

inundation zone of Folsom Lake and other foothill impoundments indicates that blue oaks cannot
tolerate the flooding regime that exists there. Further, evergreen species, including grey pines and
live oaks, occur commonly around the reservoir above current pool elevations, and tend to be more
sensitive to inundation than deciduous trees such as blue oaks (IVIWA-JSA 1994).
The other factor which could affect vegetation is erosion (slippage) of the saturated soil in the new
inundation area during a flood event as the water is drawn down or from wind driven wave wash
during a major storm event. Slopes within the Folsom Lake area are generally between 5 and 25°10
(Cotps 2001). Slopes in the Mooney Ridge area in the northwestern comer of the reservoir and the
shoreline just west of the South Fork of the American River e.xceed 30% (Corps 2001). It is likely
that during a major flood e\'ent some, or all, of the soil on steep slopes would experience some

erosion. The extent of erosion and its effect oo vegetation would be difficult to predict.

Assuming a worst-case scenario that over the life of the project all of the existing vegetation in the
inundation zone would be lost, a mitigation need was developed for each cover-type using the 2007
HEP results. Statistically, there is a relatively small chance of complete inundation coupled with
total loss of vegetation. However, it is reasonable to expect some impacts, especially at the lower
zones due to the potential for more frequent inundation, over the life of the project.
Given the uncertainties on effects of inundation on vegetation and soil erosion, the 2007 HEP Team
decided to recommend that a monitoring and adaptive management program be developed to
monitor vegetation around the reservoir over the life of the project. Existing conditions would be
managed and updated at 10-year, or some other predetermined interval. After major flood events
(those which encroach above the existing maximum flood pool elevation), vegetation would be
surveyed and damages attributable to inundation would be mitigated as deemed appropriate using
best management practices at the time.
LoJVerAmerfrp11 Riuer
Dikes 1-8, MIAD, and both wing dams of Folsom Dam would be raised 3.5 feet with the project,
which would allow for additional space within Folsom Lake to detain flood flows. Meanwhile,
outflows would remain, to the extent possible, with.in the 1 1 5 ,000 cfs objective capacity of the
downstream channel. The additional 3.5 feet of freeboard would reduce peak flows, while
increasing the duration of flows, relative to e.xisting conditions. The project would also modify the
main and emergency spillway gates to allow for improved flow capacity. The moderated flows may
reduce erosive energy compared to existing conditions, and could have a cumulative or indirect
effect on carryover storage.

DISCUSSION
Service Mitigation Policy
The recotnmendations provided herein for che protection of fish and wildlife resources are in
accordance with the Service's Mitigation Policy as published in the Federal Register

(46:15; January 23, 1981).

The ·Mitigation Policy provides Service personnel with guidance In

making recom.tnendations to protect or conserve fish and wildlife resources. The policy helps
ensure consistent and effective Service recommendations, while allowing agencies and developers to
anticipate Service recommendations and plan early for mitigation needs. The intent of the policy is
to ensure protection and conservation of the most important and valuable fish and wildlife
resources, while allowing reasonable and balanced use of the Nation's natural resources.
Under the Mitigation Policy, resources are assigned to one of four distinct Resource Categories, each
having a mitigation planning goal which is consistent with the fish and wildlife values involved. The
Resource Categories cover a range of habitat values from those considered to be unique and
irreplaceable to those believed to be much more comtnon and of relatively lesser value to fish and
wildlife. However, the Mitigation Policy does not apply to threatened and endangered species,

and wildlife resources.
applying the Mitigation Policy during an impact assessment, the Service first identifies each
specific habitat or cover-type that may be impacted by the project. Evaluation species2 which utilize
each habitat or cover-type are then selected for Resource Category analysis. Selection of evaluation
species can be based on several rationale, as follows: (1) species known to be sensitive to specific
land- and water-use actions; (2) species that play a key role in nutrient cycling or energy flow; (3)
species that utilize a common environmental resow:ce; or (4) species that are associated with
Important Resource Problems, such as anadromous fish and migratory birds, as designated by the
Director or Regional Directors of the Fish and Wildlife Service. Based on the relacive importance of
each specific habitat to its selected evaluation species, and the habitat's relative abundance, the
appropriate Resource Category and associated mitigation planning goal are determined.
lo

Mitigation planning goals range from "no loss of existing habitat value" (i.e., Resource Category 1)
to "minimize loss of habitat value" (i.e., Resource Category 4). The planning goal of Resource
Category 2 is "no net loss of in-kind habitat value." To achie\re this goal, any unavoidable losses
would need to be replaced in-kind. "In-kind replacement" means providing or managing substitute
resources to replace the habitat value of the resources lost, where such substitute resources a.re
physically and biologically the same or closely approximate those lost. The planning goal of
Resource Category 3 is "no net loss of habitat while minimizing loss of in-kind value." To achieve
this goal any unavoidable losses would be replaced in-kind or if it is not desirable or possible out-of­
kind mitigation would be allowed. The planning goal of Resource Category 4 is "minimize loss of
habitat value." To achieve this goal the Service would recommend ways to rectify, reduce, or
minimize loss of habitat value.
In addition to mitigation planning goals based on habitat values, Region 8 of the Ser.rice, which
includes California, has a mitigation planning goal of no net loss of acreage and value for wetland
habitat. This goal is applied in all impact analyses.
In recommending mitigation for adverse impacts to fish and wildlife habitat, the Service uses the
same sequential mitigation steps reconunended in the Council on Environmental Quality's
regulations. These mitigation steps (in order of preference) are: avoidance, minimization,
rectification of measures, measures to reduce or eliminate impacts over time, and compensation.
Se\ren fish and/or wildlife habitats were identified in the project area which had potential for
impacts from the project: oak/grey pine woodland, riparian woodland, chaparral, seasonal wetland,
annual grassland, lacustrine, and other. The resource categories, evaluation species, and tnitigation
planning goal for the habitats impacted by the project are summarized in Table 3.
Oak/greypine woodland
Oak/grey pine woodland is usually dominated by a blue oak overstory, with grey pines interspersed
at low density among the oaks. Other trees associated with this habitat type are California buckeye,

species used in a HEP application, if one is conducted.

which occurs as scattered individuals or small dumps, and interior live oak. On more mesic sites,
such as north-facing slopes along the South Fork neat Salmon Falls, live oaks and California. black
oaks replace blue oaks as the dominant oak. Understory shrubs such as manzanita, toyon, and
shrubby oaks are often present, though typically at low densities, relative to tree cover.
Oak woodland also occurs widely in the project area, particularly along the lower American Rivet,
and at lower foothill elevations, near Folsom Dam. Typical oak woodland is characterized by a fairly
open canopy layer with 20-70% covet of blue and live oaks, and a grassy ground cover. A wood}'
understot1' may be present, but is typically sparse where present.
The canopy of blue oaks is typically 30 to 50 feet tall, and varies from about 30-80° o canopy closure
(Barbour 1988), with open areas containing shrubs and grasses. The understory is primarily annual
grasses and forbs. Most existing stands of this type are in mature stages, with oaks to heights of up
to 50 feet. Mature grey pines typically rise above the oaks, to heights of up to 75 to 100 feet. The
long-term survival of this habitat type bas been an issue of concern, because oak regeneration has
been minimal for over 100 years (Holland 1976). Many factors have been implicated as causes for
low recruitment of oaks, including browsing of seedlings, consumption of acorn crops by livestock
and native wildlife, changes in fire dynamics, and possibly climatic changes and competition with
introduced annual grasses (Barbour 1988; Verner 1988). Blue oak woodland provides high-quality
wildlife habitat for a rich assemblage of species. In the western Sierra Nevada, 29 species of
amphibians and reptiles, 79 species of birds, and 22 species of mammals find mature stages of this
habitat suitable or optimum for breeding, where other, special habitat requirements are met (Verner
and Boss 1980).
Non-native annual grasses form an understory in most of the study area, and the transition &om
woodland to savanna is not clearly demarcated, but rather part of a continuum from closed canopy
woodland to open, treeless grasslands. As a result, habitat types can grade imperceptibly from one
to another. Where trees are absent, the habitat is designated as annual grassland. Because scattered
oaks provide food, cover, and nesting habitat unavailable in grasslands, we treated oak savanna as a
component of oak woodland.
The evaluation species selected for the oak/grey pine woodland are acorn woodpecker, turkey, and
breeding birds. Acom woodpeckers utilize oak woodlands for nearly all their life requisites;
50-60 percent of the acorn woodpecker's annual diet consists of acorns. Acorn woodpeckers can
also represent impacts to other canopy-dwelling species. Turkeys forage and breed in oak

woodlands and are abundant in the project area. Mule deer also heavily depend on acorns as a
dietary itetn in the fall and spring; the abundance of acorns and other browse influence the seasonal
pattern of habitat use by deer. These latter species represent species which utilize the ground
component of the habitat and both have itnportant consumptive and non-consutnptive human uses
(i.e., hunting and bird watching). Based on the high value of oak woodlands to the evaluation
species, and their declining abundance, the Service has determined oak/grey pine woodlands which
would be affected by the project should be placed in Resource Category 2, with an associated
mitigation planning goal of "no net loss of in-kind habitat ''alue."

Riparian Woodland
Riparian woodlands occur extensively along the lower American Rivet, and in patches along
perennial and intermittent streams and rivets flowing into Folsotn Lake. Two fortns of riparian
habitat occur in the study area: riparian forest, dominated by large trees and riparian scrub-shrub,
consisting mostly of low shrubs. Scrub-shrub habitat occurs in tnore frequently disturbed areas
(e.g., by flood-scouring or human activities), and as a stage in regeneration of riparian forest
following disturbance. The two forms are often interspersed (e.g., a clutnp of cottonwoods in an
area of scrub shrub), and are treated together in this report, as the existing data is inadequate to
separate them. Trees characteristic of this habitat in the study area include cottonwoods,
arborescent willows, and oaks; understory plants include wild grape, blackberries, poison oak,
willows, and elderberry. Scrub-sluub habitat is frequently dominated by willows, and often contains
other shrubby riparian species and immature trees listed above. Small areas of emergent wetlands,
characterized by cattails, occur along the lower American River and may occur in riparian areas
upstream of Folsom Dam.
Riparian forests were formerly widespread in the region, but have been severely reduced by
a gricultura l deYelopment, flood control measures (including channel modifications and vegetation

removal), and decreased stream flows resulting from di,retsions and dams upstream. The riparian
forest along the lower American River is California's largest urban riparian area (County of

DRAFT-SUBJECT TO CHANGE

14

Sacramento 2011) and is managed through the policies set forth in the Parkway Plan (County o f
Sacramento 2008), which has been adopted into the county general plan.
Riparian vegetation provides feeding, nesting, and shelter habitat for many species which use the
riparian zone and surrounding lands. Vegetation which overhangs or protrudes into the water also
provides fish with cover, rearing, and food resources. Riparian habitat supports a species-rich
assemblage of breeding birds and provides food and cover to migratory birds. Because o f its linear
distribution and the extensive edge 'vhich that provides, the value of riparian areas to wildlife
typically far exceeds the value of an equally-sized block of non-riparian woody habitat. Belted
kingfishers, and raptors (including red-shouldered hawk, osprey, and American kestrel) were chosen
to evaluate the riparian woodland because these species are all predators, playing a key role in the

community ecology of the area. In addition, the evaluation species have a non-consumptive human

use (e.g., bird watching) and are migratory birds, for which the Service has management
responsibility under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
Riparian habitat is of generally high value to the e\1aluation species and is scarce in the project area
and general eco-region. Therefore, the Service has detertnined riparian woodlands which would be
affected by the project should be placed ill Resource Category 2, with an associated mitigation
planning goal of "no net loss of in-kind habitat value."
Chaparra l
Chaparral occurs in patches around Folsom Lake, along the south arm of Folsom Lake, and along
the North and South Forks of the American River. Chaparral has a dense overstory of woody
evergreen shrubs, and is usually found on drier sites, e.g., on southwest-facing slopes, and on
shallow soils. Chaparral in the study area is often dominated by chamise, with manzanita, ceanothus,
toyon, and shrubby oaks. Understory growth tends to be sparse and is mostly annual grasses with a
few forbs. Chaparral plants are notable for their high tolerance to drought, ability of seeds and/or
plants to survive fire, and their high value as watershed cover (Service 1991). Chaparral provides
food resources, shelter, and breeding sites to many wildlife species. For example, chaparral on the
western slope o f the Sierra Ne,rada provides suitable or optimal nesting or breeding habitat for
about 90 avian species, 10 amphibians, 1 8 reptiles, and 4 1 mammals (Verner and Boss 1980).
The evaluation species selected for chaparral habitat are breeding birds because they are important
to the overall chaparral ecology as predators, prey, and seed dispersers. In addition, they were
chosen because of the Service's responsibility fot their protection and management under the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act and they provide non-consumptive human use (e.g., bird watching, bird
song). Chaparral habitat is a native habitat of generally high value to the evaluation species and is
moderately scarce in the project area, but fairly abundant in the eco-reg1on. Therefore, the Service
has determined chaparral habitats which would be affected by the project should be placed in
Resource Category 3, with an associated mitigation planning goal of "no net loss of habitat \1alue
while minimizing loss of ill-kind habitat value."
SeasonalWetland
Seasonal wetlands occur in small patches near seeps and springs, and in drainages entering Folsom
Lake. Seasonal wetlands in the project area are characterized by non-woody emergent vegetation,
including cattails, rushes, and sedges. Two marsh-nesting passerine birds, the marsh wren and red­
winged blackbird, as well as the great blue heron, were chosen to evaluate the seasonal wetlands.
The marsh wren and red-winged blackbird are passerine species which nest and feed in emergent

wetlands and could therefore be present in any occurrences of th.is cover type which may be found
in the project area. Great blue herons forage extensively in wetlands on aquatic vertebrates. All
three evaluation species have a non-consumptive human use (e.g., bird watching, bird song) and are
migratory birds for which the Service has management responsibility under the
Treaty Act.

Migratory Bird

In the project vicinity, and in the eco-region in general, seasonal wetlands are relatively scarce and
would be of high value to the evaluation species. Therefore, the Service designates the seasonal
wetland cover-type in the project area as Resource Category 2, with an associated tnitigation
planning goal of "no net loss of in-kind habitat value."
Annual Grassland
Annual grasslands differ from woodland by ladcing dominant tree cover and it appears that much of
the treeless grassland found within the study area is a result of tree loss due

to

human activities.

Perennial grass species once dominated native grasslands, but introduced annual species have largely
displaced native perennial and annual grasses. Typical annual grass species are foxtail, brome, wild
oats, and Italian ryegrass; native perennial grasses include needlegrasses, California onion grass, and
fescue. Grassland areas provide habitat for granivorous birds such as the western meadowlark,
California quail, spatrows, and finches, and for stnall mam1nals such as voles and pocket gophers.
These areas provide important foraging habitat for breeding raptors, including red-tailed hawks,
American kestrels, and great horned owls. It also provides habitat for wintering raptors. Lastly,
waterfowl, notably Canada geese, graze or green vegetation in the grasslands adjacent to Folsom
Lake.
The evaluation species selected for the annual grassland cover-type are the raptor guild and passerine
ground-foraging birds. The raptor guild was chosen because as a predator, raptors play a key role in
the community ecology of the project area. Both evaluation species were selected because of the
Service's responsibility for their protection and management under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act,
and their overall high non-consumpti,Te value to humans (e.g., birdwatching). While the values of
this habitat vary according with season and grazing intensity, much o f the grassland habitat in the
project area provides medium to high value foraging habitat for diverse assemblages of birds of prey
and ground-foraging passerine birds. Furthermore, the value of these habitats is often enhanced by
their continuity with other adjacent habitats, such as wooded areas, cliffs, and ponds which provide
nest and shelter sites. Grassland habitat within the project area is relatively abundant. Therefore,
the Service designates the annual grassland cmrer-type in the project area as Resource Category 3.

Our associated mitigation planning goal for these areas is "no net loss of habitat value while
minimizing loss of in-kind habitat value."
Open Water
The evaluation species chosen for the open water cover-type are freshwater sport fish. The open
water habitat is comprised of Folsom Lake. This evaluation species was chosen because of their
consumptive and recreational value to humans and their importance as a prey item for many species
of raptors and wading birds. This area has been highly impacted by recreational activities and
contains mostly non-native sport fish. Thetefore, the Service designates the open water cover-type
as Resource Category

4.

Our associated tnitigation planning goal for these areas is "m.initnize loss of

in-kind value."

DRAFT-SUBJECT TO CHANGE

t6

Other
Other habitat includes disturbed areas such as parking lots, roads, and boat ramps. Evaluation
species were not chosen for this cover-type because use by wildlife is minitnal. In view of the
extremely low habitat value for most wildlife species prmrided by these a.teas, the Service designates
any highly disturbed habitats meeting the other habitat definition that would be impacted by the
project as Resource Category 4, with a mitigation planning goal of "minimize loss of habitat value."
A habitat assessment using Habitat Evaluation Procedutes (HEP) was completed in February 2007
to develop the compensatory mitigation acreage for the oak/grey pine woodland, riparian woodland,
and seasonal wetland cover-types, and is included in Appendix B. The team evaluating the updated

project proposal determined the 2007 HEP results were still valid as habitat attributes (tree height,
crown cover, percent shrub cover, tree diameter at breast height, tree composition, etc.) have not
changed significantly.

Based on the results of the 2007 HEP, compensation ratios are: 1.2:1 for

oak/grey pine woodland; 1 . 1 : 1 for riparian woodland; and 4: 1 for seasonal wetland. The impact and
compensation acreage for the oak/grey pine woodland, riparian woodland, and seasonal wetland

cover-types for construction of the project axe summarized in Table 4. The impact and
compensation acreage for the oak/grey pine woodland and chaparral cover-types under the worst
c�se scenario of complete inundation and loss of all vegetation within the inundation zone of the

Our recommended mitigation plans are based on the fundamental assumption that in-kind
compensatory mitigation, namely creation or restoration of the desired habitats, will succeed in
replacing the habitat functions, values, and acreage lost with project implementation.
To provide assurance that any implemented compensatory mitigation measures will achie,re their
intended objective of replacing lost habitat values, detailed, long-term mitigation monitoring and
remedial-action plans must be incorporated into the project design. These plans should include
planting design, monitoring methods, specific success criteria, and tetnedial measures in the event of
failure in meeting success criteria. The Service would be willing to participate in monitoring of
construction activities, and development and implementation of the mitigation and monitoring
programs.
The results and recommendations in the discussion that follows ate for compensatory mitigation of
impacts due to implementation of the project. They do not supersede out primary recommendation
for impact avoidance, as discussed prev1ously in this report. The results and mitigation
recommendations are based on the 2007 HEP analyses (Appendix B) which include: field swveys,
review of aerial photographs, data collection, review of the literature, and discussions with plant
ecologists and other experts familiar with the project area and its ecological processes. These plans
were selected based on what the Service views as most appropriate for replacing habitat values that
would be lost with the project. They are conceptual .in nature, with management goals outlines in
each cover-type impact section below. Mitigation site selection should be based on this conceptual
framework, and designed to coincide as much as possible with the construction plans in order to
minimize project costs. Adverse construction impacts at a proposed mitigation site, such as the
removal o f topsoil in borrow areas could, however, reduce or negate the suitability of the site for
revegetation efforts. In addition, numerous site-specific factors could affect a site's suitability for
restoration ot creation. Therefore, any proposed mitigation site selection should be considered
preliminary until such time as complete evaluation of a site is completed (i.e., evaluations of soil
condition, surface hydrology, groundwater depth, and conditions in regard to salinity, alkalinity or
toxins).
The 2007 HEP evaluation o f conceptual mitigation sites is based upon the assumption that woody
vegetation would be allowed to grow to maximum plant and canopy densities. These areas would
not be disced or burned as part of any operation and maintenance plans, so predicted habitat values
would be gained by this management plan. For the 2007 HEP analyses, we assumed that these areas
would be free from human disturbance. If alternative areas would be used for mitigation that have
greater eh."Posure to human disturbance, the 2007 HEP analysis would need to be reviewed,
Construction Impact Mitigation Sites
The following tables (fables 6-9) summarize the actions proposed at ead1 hypothetical mitigation
site used to complete the 2007 HEP analyses. Additional information is contained in the HEP

Since there are uncertainties on the effects inundation on vegetation and soil erosion and relati,rely
small chances for a major flood event, it is recommended that a monitoring and adapti,re
management program be developed to monitor vegetation around the resei.-voir over the life of the
project. Baseline conditions would be established and updated at intervals (10 years). After major
flood events (those that encroach above the current maximum flood pool elevation of 466 feet),
vegetation would be surveyed and damages attributable to inundation would be mitigated as deemed

appropriate using best management practices at the ti.me (replanting on-site would be the first
priority). However, because the tnaxi.mutn pool could be lower than under the existing conditions,
potential impacts to vegetation and wildlife frotn inundation resulting from e.."tretne hydrologic
events may be less with the project than under existing conditions.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The recommendations contained within this section constitute what the Service believes, from a fish
and wildlife resource perspective and consistent with our Mitigation Policy, to be the best present
recommendations for the project. As additional project information is developed these
recommendations may be further refined.
The Service recomtnends that the Corps implement the following:
1.

Avoid impacts to oak/grey pine woodland, riparian woodland, and seasonal wetlands
adjacent to, but outside of, construction areas through use of construction fencing.

2.

Avoid impacts to woody vegetation at all staging areas, borrow sites, and haul routes by

3.

Avoid impacts to water quality at Lake Natoma and Folsom Lake when loading, unloading,

enclosing them with construction fencing.

and transporting materials to be used for the project by taking appropriate measures to
prevent soil, fuel, oil, lubricants, etc. from entering into these waters.
4.

Avoid future impacts to the site by ensuring all fill material is free of contaminants.

5.

Avoid impacts to migratory birds nesting in trees or on the ground along the .access routes
and adjacent to the proposed repair sites. Impacts can be avoided by conducting pre­
construction surveys for active nests along proposed haul roads, staging areas, and
construction sites. This would especially apply if consuuction begins in the spring or early

summer. Work activiry around active nests should be avoided until the young have fledged.
The following protocol from the CDFW for Swainson's hawk would suffice for the pre­
construccion survey for raptors nesting in trees.

Habitat Evaluation Procedures
February 2007

(HEP)

INTRODUCTION

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation)
seek to significantly reduce the risk of flooding along the main stem of the American River in the
Sacramento area while meeting dam safety and public safety objectives. The project i s
authorized by the Corps' American River Watershed Investigation, Folsom Dam Modification
project under section 1 0 1 (a) (6) of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1999 and
the Bureau's Dam Safety Program (static, earthquake, etc) (Reclamation 2006). Modifications to
the existing authorities were made in the Energy and Water Appropriations Act of 2006, which
directed the Secretary of the Anny and the Secretary of the Interior to collaborate on authorized
activities to maximize flood damage reduction improvements and address dam safety needs at
Folsom Dam and Reservoir as one Joint Federal Project.
This application of Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) is intended to provide a quantification
of the impacts on fish and wildlife resources associated with Folsom Dam Safety and Flood
Damage Reduction (Folsom DS/FDR). Any dam raise or spillway construction measure would
be a major modification and would allow Folsom Dam to pass the probable maximum flood
(PMF) volume without failure and meet Reclamation's Dam Safety Program.

PROJECT AREA

The project area is in the American River watershed, and would affect lands around Folsom
Reservoir, and along the North and South Forks of the American River, which are impounded by
Folsom Dam (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The project could also directly affect the Mormon Island
Preserve located just downstream of Mormon Island Auxiliary Dam (MIAO) and the lower
American River--the river's reach downstream of Folsom Dam (Figure 3).
The American River is the second largest tributary to the Sacramento River. The three forks
(north, middle, and south) of the river originate in the Sierra Nevada Mountains at an elevation
of about I 0,400 feet (mean sea Jevel), and generally flow in a southwesterly direction. The
Middle Fork joins the North Fork near the City of Auburn, just upstream of Folsom Reservoir;
the North Fork then joins the South Forkjust upstream of Folsom Dam. All three forks of the
American River above Folsom Reservoir are nationally popular areas for whitewater sports, and
the reach of the South Fork from Coloma to the reservoir is the State's most popular whitewater
rafting run.

Folsom Dam, located near the city of Folsom, is a multi-purpose dam built by the Corps in 1955,
and operated by Reclamation. Tt is· the largest of about 20 dams in the American River watershed
and, except for Nimbus Dam, is the furthest downstream. Five reservoirs in the upper American
River watershed (Loon Lake, Ice House, Union Valley, French Meadows, and Hell Hole)
represent 90% of the existing storage capacity upstream of Folsom Reservoir.
The main dam is a 345-foot high concrete gravity dam across the American River channel.
Associated with Folsom Dam is a series of auxiliary dams and dikes which span topographic
lows; these structures are needed to contain the reservoir. Mormon Island Dam is the largest of
these structures, and is located on the southeast end of the reservoir. Folsom Reservoir blocks
about 20 miles of the North Fork and 10 miles of the South Fork. and has a total storage capacity
of 974,000 acre-feet, which fills the reservoir to an elevation of 466 feet above mean sea level
(msl).
Reclamation operates Folsom Dam as an integrated component of the Central Valley Project.
The dam's primary purposes have been to: provide flood control; provide instream flows;
manage Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta water quality; produce hydropower; provide recreation;
and more recently, protection and restoration of the region's fish and wildlife resources.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Folsom OS/FDR project includes measures to remedy dam safety issues associated with
seismic, static, and hydrologic concerns, and to provide increased flood damage protection.
These measures include several different options to remedy the various issues at the Folsom
facilities. The Folsom Facilities to be addressed by one or more of the engineering options
include the main concrete dam, the right and left wing dams, Mormon Island Auxiliary Dam
(MlAD), and eight dikes ( l through 8). The concrete dam and earthen wing dams serve to
impound water associated with the main stem of the American River. MTAD serves to dam
water within an historic river channel, while the earthen dikes serve to contain water at low spots
in the topography during periods when the reservoir is full or nearly full.
The improvements would be designed so that they could be constructed and operated without
affecting ongoing water conservation and hydropower operations. The plan would maintain the
current Folsom Dam design flood control release of 1 1 5,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) and an
emergency release of 1 60,000 cfs. Four scales of enlargement alternatives were developed using
maximum flood control pool elevations of 468, 486.5, 489.5 and 499.5 feet msl.
Several constraints were imposed on plan formulation for Folsom OS/FDR project1 these are:
o dam raise measures are solely for flood control as stipulated in section 566 of WRDA
1999;
Revised Draft- Subject to Change

49

o
o
o

dam raise measures are to avoid disruptions to the normal operation of Folsom Dam for
water supply, hydropower, and flood control;
no loss of flood protection from existing flood damage reduction projects is permitted;
minimize disturbance of habitat for threatened and endangered species.

The no action alternative serves as the base against which the proposed flood protection and
Dam Safety alternatives will be evaluated to determine effectiveness and to identify effects that
would result from them. Several actions that are currently authorized are expected to be
completed prior to implementation of any Folsom OS/FDR project. Therefore, the effects and
benefits associated with these actions are part of the no-action condition. See the accompanying
Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act report for a complete description of the no action condition.
A complete project description can be seen in the March 2007 Folsom DS/FDR FEJR/EIR.
Alternative 1 - No Dam Raise/Minimal Embankment Raise, Fuseplug Spillway

Under Alternative I , there would be no raise to the concrete structure with minimal
modifications to the existing spillway. A large auxiliary spillway would be constructed adjacent
to the left wing dam to address hydrologic and flood control concerns. Some of the earthen
structures would be raised to address hydrologic concerns, but not to increase the flood storage
capacity of the reservoir since this alternative is a Dam Safety only alternative.
Alternative 2 - 4-foot Dam and Embankment Raise

Alternative 2 incorporates a 4-foot dam raise with a fuseplug auxiliary spillway and gate­
controlled tunnel spillway for better hydro logic control of large flood events. Under this
alternative, there could be a 4-foot raise to the concrete structure with some modifications to the
existing spillway gates. An auxiliary spillway with a chute or a tunnel would be constructed to
address hydro logic and flood control concerns. All of the earthen structures could be raised to
address hydrologic concerns and to provide additional flood storage capacity.
Alternative 3; Preferred Alternative- Joint Auxiliary Spillway, 3.5-foot Parapet Wall Raise

Under the Preferred Alternative a smaller six-submerged tainter gate (six gate) auxiliary spillway
would be constructed to address both Dam Safety and Flood Damage Reduction objectives
including hydrologic and flood control concerns. Construction of the six gate auxiliary spillway
would increase project discharge capacity. The 3.5-foot raise, in conjunction with modification
and/or replacement of the three emergency spillway gates and the six-gate auxiliary spillway,
would only serve as additional freeboard for the Folsom facilities. Once construction is
completed the raise would not exceed the existing take line for a 200-year design event and there
would be an anticipated lower maximum water surface elevation. The 3.5-foot raise,
modification and/or replacement of the three emergency spillway gates and the six-gate auxiliary
spillway, have been identified by the Corps as their Selected Plan within the Corps' Post
Authorization Change report. The remaining elements of Alternative 3 are Dam Safety
Modification as revised above.

Alternative 4 - 7-foot Dam and Embankment Raise

Alternative 4 contains many of the same elements as Alternative 3 with the exception of a 7-foot
raise that could result in i ncreased reservoir flood storage during large flood events. Under this
alternative all Folsom Facilities and earthen structures would be raised 7 feet. A smaller four­
submerged tainter gate (four gate) auxiliary spillway would be constructed to address hydrologic
and flood control concerns.
Altemative 5 - 17-foot Dam and Embankment Raise

Alternative 5 was specifically developed as an alternative that would address both Dam Safety
and Flood Damage Reduction requirements without the construction of an auxiliary spillway ..
Under this alternative all Folsom Facilities could be raised 1 7 feet which would increase
reservoir storage capacity to control large flood events.

METHODOLOGY

HEP is a methodology developed by the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) and other State and
Federal resource and water development agencies which can be used to document the quality and
quantity of available habitat for selected fish and wildlife species. HEP provides information for
two generar types of habitat comparisons: ( I ) the relative value of different areas at the same
point i n time; and (2) the relative value of the same areas at future points in time. By combining
the two types of comparisons, the impacts of proposed or anticipated land-use and water-use
changes on habitat can be quantified. In a similar manner, any mitigation needs (in terms of
acreage) for the project can also be quantified, provided a mitigation plan has been developed for
specific alternative mitigation sites.
A HEP application is based on the assumption that the value of a habitat for selected species or
the value of a community can be described in a model which produces a Habitat Suitability Index
(HSI). This HSI value (from 0.0 to 1 .0) is multiplied by the area of available habitat to obtain
Habitat Units (HUs). The HUs and Average Annual Habitat Units (AAHUs) over the life of the
project are then used in the comparisons described above.
The reliability of a HEP application and the significance ofHUs are directly dependent on the
ability of the user to assign a well-defined and accurate HSI to the selected evaluation elements
or communities. Also, a user must be able to identify and measure the area of each distinct
habitat being utilized by fish and wildlife species within the project area. Both the HSis and the
habitat acreage must also be reasonably estimable at various future points in time. The HEP
team, comprised of Corps, Reclamation and Service staff, determined that these HEP criteria
could be met, or at least reasonably approximated, for the Folsom OS/FRD project. Thus HEP
was considered an appropriate analytical tool to analyze impacts of the proposed project
alternatives 1 • Further the HEP team determined that HSI values for habitats impacted by the
Folsom OS/FRO project would be taken from the American River Watershed Investigation,
Folsom Bridge (Bridge) project, the American River Watershed lnvestigation Long-Term
Evaluation (Long-Term) and the American River Watershed lnvestigation Folsom Dam
Modification (MODS) project. HSI values for oak/grey pine woodland and seasonal wetland
habitats were used from the data collected in Reach 1 and riparian woodland habitat HSI values
were used from data collected in Reach 3 in 2005, from the Bridge project. Chaparral HSI
values were taken from Long-Tenn data, collected in 2000 for the inundation impacts and the
direct impacts for chaparral HSI values were taken from MODS data, collected in 2004, for the
staging, borrow and construction use areas.
GENERAL HEP ASSUMPTIONS

Some general assumptions are necessary to use HEP and Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) Models
in the impact assessment:

and/or wildlife resources.
2.
HEP is a suitable methodology for quantifying project-induced impacts to fish and
wildlife habitats.
3.
Quality and quantity of fish and wildlife habitat can generally be numerically described
using the indices derived from the HSI models and associated habitat units.
4.
The HEP assessment is applicable to the habitat types being evaluated.
Use of HSI Models
5.
HSI models are hypotheses based on available data.
6.
HSl models are conceptual models and may not measure all ecological factors that affect
the quality of a given cover-type for the evaluation species (e.g. vulnerability to
predation). In some cases, assumptions may need to be made by the HEP Team and
incorporated into the analysis to account for loss of those factors not reflected by the
model.
The additional HEP field work for the project was completed by staff from the Service's
Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office, the Corps (Sacramento District) and Reclamation and
occurred during May 2006 and included vegetation mapping around the Folsom Reservoir. Six
cover-types would be permanently impacted by the project including oak woodland, oak
savannah, blue oak/grey pine woodland, riparian woodland, seasonal wetland, annual grassland
and other2 • These cover-types were mapped by the HEP Team on aerial photographs in the field
then digitized into ArcGIS. Using the project footprint supplied by Reclamation and the Corps
acreages were quantified using GIS. The cover-types and acreage affected by the proposed work
is summarized in Table 2 and Table 3.

2. "Other" encompasses those areas which do not fall within the other cover-types such as gravel and paved roads, parkingar�as, building� bare

nesting and foraging. The western fence lizard, yellow warbler, and northern oriole models were
chosen to evaluate the project impacts to the riparian woodland cover-type. These species were
selected because the bird species utilize the riparian tree canopy provided by the cover-type for
nesting and foraging. For analysis purposes these two cover types were treated as one because
the same models were chosen by the HEP Team. The western fence lizard utilizes the ground
component of the cover-type including rocks boulders, and downed wood for shelter and
foraging.
The red-winged blackbird, great egret (feeding) and California vole models were selected for
evaluating impacts to the seasonal wetland cover-type because these species forage, nest, or
inhabit this cover-type.
The bobcat, wrentit and California thrasher models were selected for evaluating impacts to the
chaparral cover-type because these species forage, nest, or inhabit this cover-type.
The annual grassland and '1other" cover-types were not included in the HEP analysis because
they do not currently provide significant habitat for wildlife species or the conditions (habitat
values) after the completion of work are expected to be similar to pre-project conditions.
The cover-type designations and HSI models were also selected in part to be consistent with
previous impact analyses completed for the American River Watershed Investigation Folsom
Dam Modification project which is occurring concurrently with the Folsom Bridge project.
More information on the HEP for those projects can be found in the Service's Fish and Wildlife
Coordination Act Report for those projects.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

This HEP analyzed the potential impacts of the proposed Folsom DS/FDR project. Impact areas
were divided into five components to facilitate possible design changes and subsequent impact
analyses as the planning process proceeds toward selection of a construction alternative. The
components are: ( 1 ) the construction footprint of the spillway alternatives; (2) impacts
associated with Safety of Dams construction at dikes 4 thru 8, both wing dams, and MIAO; (3)
impacts from borrow and stockpile; (4) impacts associated with the Flood Damage Reduction
construction as dikes I thru 3; and (5) the potential impacts to vegetation in the new reservoir
inundation zone.
The HEP does not address potential impacts to aquatic resources at Folsom Reservoir during
construction, nor are potential lower American River fishery impacts addressed for the
construction period or subsequent reservoir operation.

Construction Impacts

The impacts and mitigation recommended for the Preferred Alternative for the Folsom OS/FDR
project is summarized in Table 5. A specific compensation site was not analyzed in this HEP
application. Instead a typical site was developed, and assumptions were made that the site would
be an annual grassland area without existing woody vegetation for a baseline condition. For the
riparian and seasonal wetland cover-types, a critical assumption was made that any site selected
for compensation would require the appropriate hydrology to support these cover-types.
Folsom Reservoir Inundation
Between 8 1 1 .74 and 1 ,323.35 acres could be affected by enlarging Folsom Dam, depending on
which dam raise alternative is selected. Some of these lands are already developed or otherwise
disturbed habitat which provides little or no value for wildlife species, and some support
vegetation that is tolerant of flooding. Table 5 summarizes the acreages of each habitat which
provides value for wildlife and is expected to receive inundation over the life of the project.
Inundation effects around Folsom Reservoir would occur in large part by the frequency, timing,
and duration of flooding. Studies to date indicate that predicting the effects of inundation on
vegetation is not straightforward. The raising of Folsom Dam would have potential for at least
two significant impacts on vegetation: ( 1 ) changes in vegetation composition caused by
inundation affecting survival and reproduction of vegetation within the zone between current and
proposed maximum reservoir levels; and (2) effects of inundation on soil erosion and slippage,
especially on steep slopes as are found along the upper reservoir and the forks of the American
River.
The vegetation types exposed to flooding are not, in general, highly tolerant of flooding. With
the exception of riparian and riverine habitats, natural flooding does not occur in the areas which
would be flooded by raising Folsom Dam. Studies of the effects of inundation on blue oaks
( 1975 in USFWS I 980; MWA�JSA 1 994) have found that blue oaks can survive some flooding,
but may be sensitive to periods of inundation of as little as 7 days. It is not clear from these
studies, however, at what time of year flooding occurred, and the ability of vegetation to tolerate
inundation depends on the time of year. For example, deciduous trees, such as oaks, tend to be
much more sensitive to flooding during their period of active growth (i.e., in the spring), while
winter-dormant plants appear to be more tolerant of flooding (USFWS 1 980). Folsom Reservoir
can reasonably be expected to fill during a major spring flood event, when oaks are actively
growing. The absence of blue oaks within the current inundation zone of Folsom Reservoir and
other foothill impoundments indicate that blue oaks cannot tolerate the flooding regime existing
there. Further, evergreen species, including grey pines and live oaks, occur commonly around
the reservoir, and tend to be more sensitive to inundation than deciduous trees such as blue oaks
(MWA-JSA 1 994).
The other factor which could affect vegetation is erosion of the saturated soil i n the new
inundation area during a flood event from the water being drawn down or wind driven wave
wash during a major storm event. Slopes in the Folsom Reservoir area are generally between 5
and 25% (USACE 200 I). Slopes in the Mooney Ridge area i n the northwestern comer of the

reservoir and the shoreline just west of the South Fork of the American River exceed 30%
(USACE 2001). It is likely that during a major flood event some, or all, of the soil on steep
slopes would experience some erosion. The extent of erosion and its effect on vegetation would
be difficuJt to predict.
Assuming a worst case scenario that over the life of the project all of the existing vegetation
(except riparian and seasonal wetlands) in the inundation zone would be lost, a mitigation need
was developed for each cover-type using the HEP results. Statistically, there is a relatively small
chance of complete inundation coupled with total loss of vegetation. However, it is reasonable
to expect some impacts, especially at the lower zones due to the potential for more frequent
inundation, over the life of the project.
Given the uncertainties on effects of inundation on vegetation and soil erosion, the HEP Team
decided to recommend that a monitoring and adaptive management program be developed to
monitor vegetation around the reservoir over the l ife of the project. Baseline conditions would
be managed and updated at intervals ( l 0 years). After major flood events (those which encroach
above the existing maximum flood pool elevation), vegetation would be surveyed and damages
attributable to inundation would be mitigated as deemed appropriate using the best management
practices at the time (replanting on site would be the first priority).

The diet of the northern oriole is comprised mainly of insects. Fruits, berries, and nectar are also utilized
(Bent 1958; Martin et al. 1961). For purposes of this model, it is assumed that if suitable habitat is
available for nesting and cover, food resources are not limiting.
Minimum habitat area
Minimum habitat area is defined as the minimum amount of contiguous habitat that is required before an
area will be occupied by a species. Based on reported pair densities (Walcheck 1 970; Gaines 1 974;
Pleasant 1979), it is assumed that at least 0.25 acres of suitable habitat must be available for the northern
oriole to occupy an area. If less than this amount is present, the HSI is assumed to be zero.

INTRODUCTION
The western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis) ranges from British Columbia southward through
Washington, Oregon and throughout California and the Great Basin to northwestern Baja California
(Smith, 1948; Stebbins, 1985). It occupies a wide variety of habitats, excluding extreme desert conditions,
from sea level to over 9500 feet in the Sierra Nevada. rn California, four subspecies are present
(Jennings, 1987). Preferring wooded, rocky areas, it frequents talus and rocky outcrops of hillsides,
canyons and along streams. Western fence lizards are attracted to old buildings, woodpiles, fences,
telephone poles, woodrat nests and banks with rodent burrows. rt requires cover and, excep1 for
dispersing females (Jennings, personal communication) is seldom encountered in open fields or extremely
barren areas (Stebbins, 1954). It is frequently a colonizer of disturbed habitats (Lillywhite, et. al., 1 977).
The western fence lizard can be semi-arboreal (Cunningham, 1955; Davis and Verbeek, 1 972). Trees
apparently do not constitute a life requisite as was shown by Sceloporus occidenta/is populations in
chaparral (Lillywhite, Friedman and Ford 1 972) and at high elevations (Grinnell and Storer, 1 924). Trees
may simply act as another type of available cover. This indicates the microhabitat plasticity of this
species (Rose, 1 978).
MODEL APPLICABILITY
This model was designed for use in plant communities found in the Central Valley of California and
surrounding foothills up to an elevation of approximately 1500 feet and applies to the subspecies S. o.
occidentalis and S.o. biseriatus. The model is based on both empirical data provided by expert review
and information obtained from current literature.

cover

Variable 1 . Percent ground cover
Assumes:
Only those objects less than 8 feet above the ground surface are considered. This includes rocks, logs,
branches, tree trunks, fences, wood piles and live vegetation. Western fence lizards exhibit no well­
defined habitat preference, but favor areas with logs, trees or other objects upon which they can climb,
sun and display (Fitch, 1 940). Brush piles and cavities under rocks and logs provide refuge (Marcellini
and Mackey, I 979). An amount of ground cover beyond a particular density results in less than optimal
conditions as it conceals predators and interferes with movement and the ability to defend a territory
(Davis and Ford, 1983). Davis and Verbeek ( 1972) found that western fence lizards avoided dense
grasslands. However, dispersing juveniles will cross dense grasslands and colonize any suitable isolated
habitat found (Jennings, personal communication).
In California, western fence lizards cen.tered their territorial activities about logs, fence posts, stumps and
exposed boulders from which males display (Carpenter, 1 980) and to observe mates or rival males (Fitch,
1 940).

Eggs are placed in damp, friable, well-aerated soil from mid-May to mid-July in pits dug by the female
and covered with loose soil (Stebbins, 1 954) or under rocks and logs (Jennings, personal communication).
In non-riparian conditions, nest sites are probably limited to areas within the shade of large cover objects.
Ground cover ranging from 25 to 70 percent is considered optimum for western fence lizards as it
provides sufficient cover for maximum use of an area while not being so abundant as to interfere with
movement. Western fence lizards undergo hibernation from November to February (Smith, I 946) and
require cover for winter survival (Jennings, personal communication).

Assumes:
Ground cover objects include tree trunks but no other living material. The objects must be sufficiently
large to provide escape cover. Western fence 1 izards have the habit of running to the opposite side of
their perch (rock, log, etc.) when approached (Nussbaum et al., 1983). The objects must also be large
enough to provide cover for hibernation, nest building, shade for summer thermoregulation, and to offer
vantage points for territorial defense and mating display.
An average ground cover object size of 3.0 feet and larger is considered optimum as it is sufficiently large
to provide for escape cover, thermoregulation and reproductive needs.
The average size of ground cover objects greater than 4 inches is diameter are measured in the field using
the line intercept method and is determined by the formula:

Variable 3. Structural
diversity/interspersion

Assumes:
This variable is related to the habitat heterogeneity. The western fence lizard areas have a mixture and
sufficient quantity of cover types (rocks, logs, living vegetation, rodent burrows, cracks and crevices) in a
semi-open environment with lots of habitat edge allowing for sufficient exposure to the sun (Ruth,
personal communication), escape cover and a production base for food organisms (Jennings, personal
communication). These areas usually have a significant vertical component in the form of large boulders,
trees, fence rows, old buildings or log piles (Nussbaum et al, 1983). Davis and Ford ( 1983) found
optimal habitat was provided by large fallen oaks in various stages of decay or by large, standing oaks
from which limbs and branches had fallen to the ground creating massive tangles. Western fence lizards
commonly show low distributions in climax communities due to the homogeneity of the habitat(Ruth,
personal communication).

Low habitat diversity. Ground cover limited to I or 2 types (Le., grassland and bare soil). Site
mostly homogeneous with little edge_ Cover component mostly one dimensional without a
significant vertical element (average less than 1 foot above ground). An exception may be rock
talus which can be good (Ruth, communication).

B

Moderate habitat diversity. Two or more major ground cover types occur (i.e., large rocks, logs and
woodpiles). A moderate amount of edge and interspersion is present between vegetation types
and/or ground cover types. A significant vertical element to the cover component (average I 4 feet
above ground) is present.

-

-

C-

High habitat diversity. Three or more major ground cover types are present (i.e., large rocks, logs
and woodpiles). Heterogeneity is high with logs of edge between evenly dispersed vegetation and
cover types. Overall, habitat has a significant vertical component (average greater than 4 feet above
ground). May include rock talus.

Variable 4. Percent canopy cover
Assumes:
The canopy is defined as standing live vegetation greater than 6 feet above ground. This variable relates
directly to the ability of the habitat to provide sufficient exposure so that western fence lizards can
thermoregu late.
The ability of a western fence lizard to thermoregulate in an area is a major determinant of its habitat
occupancy. The ability of this species to absorb sunlight and warm quickly enables it to inhabit areas
from sea level to over 9000 feet in elevation (Tanner and Hopkin, 1972). Western fence lizards typically
move from areas of sunlight to shade to maintain their desired body temperature. Davis and Verbeek
( 1 972) found this species shifted from rocks to trees and vice versa according to ambient temperature.
Western fence lizards avoid dense, shaded woods (Stebbins, 1 959).
A canopy cover ranging from 0 - 45 percent is considered optimum as it provides sufficient sunlight on
the ground or ground cover surface for thermoregulation by western fence lizards. An area with a canopy
cover greater than 90 percent is considered uninhabitable for western fence lizards due to a lack of
sunlight on the ground surface for thermoregulation.

ASSUMPTIONS

It is assumed that where all necessary habitat components are present, food availability is not a factor
limiting the use of an area by western fence lizards. Low availability of insects may be a limiting factor
on winter recruitment ofjuveniles into the adult population (Jennings, personal communication). In arid
areas, food can be limiting to adults in late summer (Ruth, personal communication).
The western fence lizard is an opportunistic insectivore which feeds on a variety of insects and other
arthropods including leaf hoppers, aphids, beetles, wasps, tennites, ants and spiders (Fitch, 1 940;
Johnson, 1965; Rose, 1 976; Stebbins, 1954).
Rose (I 976) found the three primary groups in the fence lizard diet to be ants (Formicidae), beetles
(Coleoptera) and termites (!sop/era). Johnson ( 1 965) found flies (Diptera), beetles and ants to be
important prey while Clark ( 1973) found grasshoppers (Acrididae) the most common prey item. Otvos
( 1977) found moths or butterflies (Lepi'doplera) the most common prey item in stomachs analyzed.
Western fence lizards commonly bask or loaf in the shade and eat whatever arthropod comes close
enough to attract their attention (Tanner and Hopkin, 1 972). It can therefore be assumed that food
availability is not a limiting factor under normal lizard population levels and habitat conditions.
Reproduction
I t is assumed that, if ground cover of rocks, logs, trees, woodpiles, etc. of sufficient size and quantity are
available for non-reproductive activities, then areas with moist, friable soil necessary for lizard nesting
purposes would be present beneath the cover and should not be a limiting factor. Females may travel
several hundred feed to find appropriate nesting conditions (Ruth, personal communication).
Water reguirements
Considering the wide distribution of this species in all but the most extreme desert regions, it is unlikely
that water availability would be a limiting factor to the western fence lizard though densities are often
highest where water (seeps, ponds, etc.)are nearby (Ruth, personal communication). This assumes that
sufficient ground cover exists for thermoregulation and nesting. This species receives the bulk of its
moisture through metabolic water from its prey (Ruth, personal communication). These lizards may
lower metabolic rates to compensate for higher body temperatures and water stress during warm seasons
(Tsuji, 1985).

PREFACE
This document is part of the Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) Model Series (FWS/OBS-82/10), which
provides habitat information useful for impact assessment and habitat management. Several types of
habitat information are provided. The Habitat Use Information Section is largely constrained to those
data that can be used to derive quantitative relationships between key environmental variables and habitat
suitability. The habitat use information provides the foundation for HSI models that follow. In addition,
this same information may be useful in the development of other models more appropriate to specific
assessment or evaluation needs.
The HSI Model Section documents a habitat model and information pertinent to its application. The
model synthesizes the habitat use information into a framework appropriate for field application and is
scaled to produce an index value between 0.0 (unsuitable habitat) and 1 .0 (optimum habitat). The
application information includes descriptions of the geographfo ranges and seasonal application of the
model, its current verification status, and a listing of model variables with recommended measurement
techniques for each variable.
In essence, the model presented herein is a hypothesis of species-habitat relationships and not a statement
of proven cause and effect relationships. Results of model performance tests, when available, are
referenced. However, models that have demonstrated reliability in specific situations may prove
unreliable in others. For this reason, feedback is encouraged from users of this model concerning
improvements and other suggestions that may increase the utility and effectiveness of this habitat-based
approach to fish and wildlife planning. Please send suggestions to:

YELLOW WARBLER

(De11droica petecltia)

HABITAT USE INFORMATJON

General
The yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia) is a breeding bird throughout the entire United States, with the
exception of parts of the Southeast (Robbins et al. 1966). Preferred habitats are wet areas with abundant
shrubs or small trees (Bent 1953). Yellow warblers inhabit hedgerows, thickets, marshes, swamp edges
(Starling 1 978), aspen (Populus spp.) groves, and willow (Salix spp.) swamps (Salt 1 957), as well as
residential areas (Morse 1 966).
Revised Draft- Subject to Change

1 07

More than 90% of the food ofyellow warblers is insects (Bent 1 953), taken in proportion to 1heir
avai lability (Busby and Sealy 1979). Foraging in Maine occurred primarily on small limbs in deciduous
foliage (Morse 1973).

Dietary water requirements were not mentioned in the literature. Yellow warblers prefer wet habitats
(Bent 1953; Morse 1 966; Stauffer and Best 1980).

Cover needs of the yellow warbler are assumed to be the same as reproduction habitat needs are discussed
in the following section.
Reproduction
Preferred foraging and nesting habitats in the Northeast are wet areas, partiaJly covered by willows and
alders (Alnus spp.), ranging in height from 1 .5 to 4 m (5 to 13.3 ft) (Morse 1966). It is unusual to find
yellow warblers in extensive forests (Hebard 1961) with closed canopies (Morse 1 966). Yellow warblers
in small islands of mixed coniferous-deciduous growth i n Maine utilized deciduous foliage far more
frequently than would be expected by chance alone (Morse 1 973). Coniferous areas were mostly avoided
and areas of low deciduous growth preferred.
Nests are generally placed 0.9 to 2.4 m (3 to 8 ft) above the ground, and nest heights rarely exceed 9. 1 to
12.2 m (30 to 40 ft) (Bent 1953). Plants used for nesting include willows, alders, and other hydrophytic
shrubs and trees (Bent 1 953), including box-elders (Acer negundo) and cottonwoods (Populus spp.)
(Schrantz 1 943). In Iowa, dense thickets were frequently occupied by yellow warblers while open
thickets with widely spaced shrubs rarely contained nests (Kendeigh 1941 ).
Males frequently sing from exposed song perches (Kendeigh 1 9 4 1 ; Ficken and Ficken 1 965), although
yellow warblers will nest in areas without elevated perches (Morse 1 966).

A number of Breeding Bird Census reports (Van Velzen 1 9 8 1 ) were summarized to determine nesting

habitat needs of the yellow warbler, and a clear pattern of habitat preferences emerged. Yellow warblers
nested in less than 5% of census areas comprised of extensive upland forested cover types (deciduous or
coniferous) across the entire country. Approximately two-thirds of all census areas with deciduous shrub­
dominated cover types were utilized, while shrub wetlands types received 1 00% use. Wetlands
dominated by shrubs had the highest average breeding densities of all cover types [2.04 males per ha (2.5
acre)). Approximately two-thirds of the census areas comprised of forested draws and riparian forests of
the western United States were used, but average densities were low [0.5 males per ha (2.5 acre)).
Interspersion
Yellow warblers in Iowa have been reported to prefer edge habitats (Kendeigh 1941); Stauffer and Best
1980). Territory size has been reported as 0.16 ha (0.4 acre) (Kendeigh 1 9 4 1 ) and 0.15 ha (0.37 acre)
(Kammeraad 1964).

Special Considerations
The yellow warbler has been on the Audubon Society's Blue List of declining birds for 9 of the last 1 0
years (Tate 1981).

HABITAT SUITABILITY INDEX (HSI) MODEL
Model Applicability
Geographic area. This model has been developed for application within the breeding range ofthe yellow
warbler.
Season. This model was developed to evaluate the breeding season habitat needs ofthe yellow warbler.
Covertypes. This model was developed to evaluate habitat in the dominant cover types used by the
yellow warbler. Deciduous Shrubland (DS) and Deciduous Scrub/Shrub Wetland (DSW) (terminology
follows that of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1981). Yellow warblers only occasionally utilize forested
babitats and reported populated densities in forests are low. The habitat requirements in forested habitats
are not well documented in the literature. For these reasons, this model does not consider forested cover
types.
Minimum habitat area. Minimum habita1 area is defined as the minimum amount of contiguous that is
required before an area will be occupied by a species. Information on the minimum habitat area for the
yellow warbler was not located in the literature. Based on reported territory sizes, it is assumed that at
least 0.15 ha (0.37 acre) of suitable habitat must be available for the yellow warbler to occupy an area. If
less than this amount is present, the HSl is assumed to be 0.0.
Verification level. Previous drafts of the yellow warbler habitat model were reviewed by Douglass H.
Morse and specific comments were incorporated into the current model (Morse, pers. comm.).
Model Description
Overview. This model considers the quality of lhe reproduction (nesting) habitat needs of the yellow
warbler to determine overall habitat suitability. Food, cover, and water requirements are assumed to be
met by nesting needs.
The relationship between habitat variables, life requisites, cover types, and the HSI for the yellow warbler
is illustrated in Figure 1 .
The following sections provide a written documentation of the logic and assumptions used to interpret the
habitat information for the yellow warbler and to explain and justify and variable and equations that are
used in the HSI model. Specifically, these sections cover the following: (1) identification of variables
that will be used in the model; (2) definition and justification of the suitability levels of each variable; and
(3) description of the assumed relationship between variables.
Reproduction component. Optimal nesting habitat for the yellow warbler is provided in wet areas with
dense, moderately tall stands of hydrophytic deciduous shrubs. Upland shrub habitats on dry sites will
provide only marginal suitability.

Revised Draft- Subject to Change

109

It is assumed that optimal habitats contain I 00% hydrophytic deciduous shrubs and that habitats with no
hydrophytic shrubs will provide marginal suitability. Shrub densities between 60 and 80% crown cover
are assumed to be optimal. As shrub densities approach zero cover, suitability also approaches zero.

Totally closed shrub canopies are assumed to be of only moderate suitability, due to the probable
restrictions on movement of the warblers in those conditions. Shrub heights of2 m (6.6 ft) or greater are
assumed to be optimal, and suitability will decrease as heights decrease to zero.
Each of these habitat variables exert a major influence in determining overall habitat quality for the
yellow warbler. A habitat must contain optimal levels of all variables to have maximum suitability. Low
values of any one variable may be partially offset by higher values of the remaining variables. Habitats
with low values for two or more variables will provide low overall suitability levels.

PREFACE
This document is part of the Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) Model Series [Biological Report 82(1 O)]
which provides habitat information useful for impact assessment and habitat management. Several types
of habitat information are data that can be used to derive quantification relationships between key
environmental variables and habitat suitability. This information provides the foundation for the HSI
model and may be useful in the development of other models more appropriate to specific assessment or
evaluation needs.
The HSI Model Section documents the habitat and includes information pertinent to its application. The
model synthesizes the habitat use information into a framework appropriate for field application and is
scaled to produce an index value between 0.0 (unsuitable habitat) and 1 .0 (optimum habitat). The HSI
Model Section includes information about the geographic range and seasonal application of the model, its
current verification status, and a list of the model variables with recommended measurement techniques
for each variable.
The model is a formalized synthesis of biological and habitat information published in the scientific
literature and may include unpublished information reflecting the opinions of identified experts. Habitat
information about wildlife species frequently is represented by scattered data sets collected during
different seasons and years and from different sites throughout the range of a species. The model presents
this broad data base in a formal, logical, and simplified manner. The assumptions necessary for
organizing and synthesizing the species-habitat information into the model are discussed. The model
should be regarded as a hypothesis of species-habitat relationships and not as a statement of proven cause
and effect relationships. The model may have merit in planning wildlife habitat research studies about
species, as well as in providing an estimate of the relative quality of habitat for that species.

RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD (Age/aius phoeniceus L.)
HABITAT USE INFORMATION
General
The red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus L) nests in fresh-water and brackish herbaceous
wetlands, bushes and small trees along watercourses, and certain upland cover types from (American
Ornithologists' Union 1 983:723):
... ea�t-central, south-coastal and southern Alaska... , southern Yukon west-central and southern
Mackenzie, northwestern and central Saskatchewan, central Manitoba, central Ontario, southern
Quebec..., New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and southwestern Newfoundland
south to northern Baja California, through Mexico... and along both coasts of Central America to
Nicaragua and northern Costa Rica .... and to southern Texas, the Gulf coast and southern Florida.
[This blackbird winters] from southern British Columbia, Idaho, Colorado, Kansas, Iowa, the
southern Great Lakes region, southern Ontario and New England... south throughout the remainder
of the breeding range, with the southwestern and most of Middle American populations being
sedentary.
The red�winged blackbird traditionally was considered to be a wetland nesting bird. I t has adapted,
within the last century, to habitat changes brought about by man; it now commonly nests in hayfields,
along roadsides and ditches, and in other upland sites (Dolbeer 1980).
food
Red-winged blackbirds vary their diet throughout the year, presumably in response to the nutritive
demands of reproduction. The percent of waste grain and seeds in the diet of male blackbirds in one
study in Ontario, Canada, was at least 80 to 87% in March and April, 46% in May. only 10% in July, and
85% in late July to October (McNicol et al. 1 982). Insects amounted to 5 1 to 84% of the diet during May
and July. The diet offemale red-winged blackbirds varied between 67 and 79% insect parts in May and
July but was only 15% insectivorous in late July-October, after fledging had occurred.
Water
References describing the dependency of the red-winged blackbird on surface water for drinking and
bathing were not found in the literature. Nesting occurs in herbaceous wetlands and upland habitat near
surface water and in suitable vegetation distant from free water. Red-winged blackbirds seem to prefer
habitats oear wetlands for foraging. Communal roosting, which occurs after fledging is completed, is
either in herbaceous wetlands or dense communities of young trees with thick canopies growing on moist
sites (Micacchion and Townsend 1 983).
Cover
The red-winged blackbird nests in a variety of habitats. Blackbirds in southern Michigan prefer old and
new hay fields, pastures, old fields, and wetlands with robust vegetation capable of supporting nests and
dense cover that provides protection for nests (Albers 1978). They avoid cut or fallow fields, woodlots,
agricultural croplands, open water, and tilled soil.
Areas with tall, dense, herbaceous vegetation seem to provide preferred nest sites. Blackbirds that nest
early in the breeding season select tall, dense, old-growth herbaceous vegetation while blackbirds that
nest late in the breeding season select tall, dense, new-growth herbaceous vegetation (Albers 1 978).
Upland nest sites of red-winged blackbirds in Ontario were in plant communities commonly dominated
by goldenrod (Solidago spp.), alfalfa (Medicago saliva), fleabane (Erigeron spp.), clover (Trifolium spp.),
various thistles (Cirsiurn spp.), and similar herbaceous weeds (Joyner 1 978). Blackbirds in fresh water

sites selected old- and new-growth of broad-leaved monocots, like cattails (Typha spp.) and broad-leaved
sedges (Carex spp.), and commonly rejected old- and new-growth of narrow-leaved monocots and forbs
(Albers 1 978). Woody species, such as hightide bush (Iva frutescens) and groundselbush (Baccharis
halimifolia), and robust herbaceous plants, like cattails, supported the most nests in tidal herbaceous
wetlands (Meanley and Webb 1963).
The density of preferred plant cover is not adequately described either in the literature or in this model.
The height of preferred plant cover is inferred, below, from descriptions of nest sites.
Red-winged blackbirds frequently use scattered trees and fence posts near their breeding territories as
observation posts. Blackbirds use both herbaceous wetlands and trees for communal roosts after fledging
is completed. Roost trees characteristically are young, occur at high densities, provide thick canopies,
and are adapted to moist sites (Micacchion and Townsend 1983).
Reproduction
Red-winged blackbirds are migratory in the northern portion of their range. Males migrate to or
congregate at future nesting habitats in late winter, and females arrive at the territories in early spring
(Case and Hewitt 1 963). In areas with resident populations, individuals of both sexes may remain near
breeding territories throughout the year, even though the areas are not actively defended or used in winter
except, perhaps, as roosting sites (Orians pers. comm.). Males are polygynous, and up to six females
commonly nest within a male's territory (Holm 1 973). Harem size was larger in herbaceous wetlands
with open stands of cattails than in herbaceous wetlands dominated by bulrushes (Sci1pus spp.) or by
closed stands of cattails (Holm 1 973). Harem size has sometimes been observed to exceed I O to 1 2
females and, in one instance, numbered 32 females (Orians pers. comm.).
Males do not participate in nest building, incubation, or feeding of the incubating female (Orians pers.
comm.). Males may help feed nestlings and are likely to help feed fledglings. The timing of breeding
varies throughout the range of the red-winged blackbird. Nesting frequently begins in March or April and
is completed by mid-July in the more temperate habitats. Most young in North America are fledged by
late July.
Herbaceous wetlands dominated by cattails generally seem to be the most productive habitats for red­
wing blackbirds in terms of nests/ha or number of young fledged/ha (Robertson 1972). Favorable
herbaceous wetland sites produce more suitable food per unit area and have higher nest densities, highly
synchronous nesting, higher nest survival rates. and lower nest predation rates than do upland nest sites.
Nests of red-winged blackbirds are placed on the edges of cattail clumps that border areas of open water
(Wiens 1 965). Herbaceous wetlands that are dominated by cattails and have open, permanent water have
the optimum number of available nest sites. Early nests are placed in the old growth vegetation remaining
from past growing seasons, while late nests may be built on new growth. Nest success in one herbaceous
wetland habitat seemed related to: ( 1 ) increased depth of permanent water (up to 50 cm or more), which
apparently reduced mammalian predation on nests; (2) nest placement close to water (greater nest success
was observed for nests 20 cm above water than nests J 00 cm above water), (3) nest placement in
herbaceous wetland vegetation interspersed with open water, rather than in herbaceous wetland vegetation
where no open water was present; and (4) nest placement in marsh grass and loosestrife (Decadon
verticillatus) rather than in sweet gale (Myrica gale) and sedges (Weatherhead and Robertson 1977).
Other studies have indicated that nests placed at 1.2 m heights were more successful than nests placed at
0.6 tn heights in tidal herbaceous wetlands on Chesapeake Bay (Meanley and Webb 1 963) and that nest
success was higher when permanent water levels were greater than 25 cm (Robertson 1 972).

Nests ofred-winged blackbirds in upland sites typically are wound between and attached to stalks of
herbaceous vegetation (Bent 1 958). Early nests are entwined with old growth stems and late nests with
the sturdiest stems of the new growth. Activities, such as intensive livestock grazing, mowing, and
burning of old growth stubble, make herbaceous uplands unavailable for early nest placement. Mowing
hayfields during the nesting season disrupts nesting success on upland sites (Albers 1 978). Red-winged
blackbirds seem to prefer areas with the densest, tallest herbaceous vegetation for nest placement.
Vegetation that restricted visibility was more important than the number of plant stems and leaves per unit
area. Trees grea1er than 5.0 m in height were in most territories (Albers 1 978). The mean height of nest
placement was 1 5 cm in monotypic stands of reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea) 58 cm high
(Joyner 1978). Nest sites often are close to open water (Joyner 1978), although no specific descriptions
of acceptable distances of upland nest sites from open water were found in the literature.
Interspersion
The red-winged blackbird seems to be closely associated with the presence of standing water (Bent 1 958)
and certain types of dense herbaceous vegetation for nest placement. Herbaceous wetlands or sloughs I
with extensive cattails, bulrushes, sedges, reeds (Phragmites spp.), or tules (Scilpus spp.), historically
have provided important nesting habitat for the blackbird (Bent 1 958). However, blackbirds also nest in
dense herbaceous cover in hayfields, along roadsides and ditches, and in other upland sites (Dolbeer
1 980). Red-winged blackbirds forage for insects in understory, midstory, and overstory canopies
(Snelling 1968) during the nesting season.
The blackbird is primarily a seed eater, except during fledging. The species sometimes forms large
communal flocks in wetland herbaceous habitats or in trees and brushlands and these birds may forage on
agricultural crops or understory seed sources (Mott et al. 1972; Johnson and Caslick 1 982). After the
autumn migration from the northern portion of their range, red-winged blackbirds frequently roost in
herbaceous wetland habitats, trees, or shrubs and feed on seeds within understory vegetation.
Special Consideration
Red-winged blackbirds shift from a dispersed insectivorous feeding behavior during the nesting season to
a communal granivorous feeding habit after fledging has occurred. They frequently move into
agricultural areas at this time. Costs related to their consumption of grain can become high and may
exceed the benefits of insect control related to their foraging habits during fledging (Bendell et al. 1981 ).
Damage to ripening corn (Zea mays) occurs during August and September (Somers et al. 1 98 1 � Stehn and
de Becker 1982), when blackbirds ofte11 congregate at night in herbaceous wetlands or in roosts in young
deciduous trees in great concentrations (perhaps up to 1 million birds) (Stehn and de Becker 1 982). The
distance from these autumn roosts to corn fields and the proximity of corn fields to traditional flightlines
strongly influences the amount of damage inflicted on individual com fields. Bird damage to crops in
Ohio diminished consistently as distances from communal roosts increased from 3.2 to 8 km, and the
level of damage remained constant and low at distances of 8 to 19.2 km (Dolbeer 1 980).

Covertypes. This model was developed to evaluate habitat in herbaceous wetlands (HW) and upland
herbaceous cover types, such as pasture and hay land (P/H), forbland (F), and grassland (0) (terminology
follows that of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service I 981).
Minimum habitat area. Minimum habitat area is defined as the minimum amount of contiguous habitat
that is required before a species will live and reproduce in an area. Specific information on minimum
areas required for red-winged blackbirds was not found in the literature. 11 is assumed, however, that a
wetland area must contain at least 0.10 ha in emergent herbaceous vegetation, like cattails, to be
considered nesting habi1at for the blackbird. Several studies have described the minimum territory for
male red-winged blackbirds as 0.02 ha (Weatherhead and Robertson 1977; Orians I 980). A 0. 10 ha area
of emergent herbaceous vegetation might, therefore, potentially provide territories for up to five male
blackbirds. Territories in upland habitats are much larger than those in wetland habitats. It is assumed
that a block of upland and habitat must be at least 1 .0 ha in area to provide adequate breeding habitat for
red-winged blackbirds.
Verification level. This model was developed from descriptive information about nesting cover and
species-habitat relationships identified in the literature. The HSI derived from the use of this model
describes the potential of an area for providing nesting habitat for the red-winged blackbird. The model is
designed to rank the suitability of nesting habitat as would a biologist with expert knowledge about the
reproductive requirements of the blackbird. The model should not be expected to rank habitats in the
same way as population data because many nonhabitaHelated criteria can significantly impact
populations of wildlife species.
Model Description
Overview. The red-winged blackbird uses a variety of habitat layers throughout the year. Tall, dense,
herbaceous vegetation seems to satisfy nesting, foraging, and cover requirements. The red-winged
blackbird readily uses midstory and overstory layers of habitat at times but does not seem to be dependent
on the presence of these layers.
The red-winged blackbird typically nests in tall (over 0.5 m), dense (undefined) herbaceous vegetation,
although it occasionally nests in shrubs and trees. This nest site requirement is best met in herbaceous
wetland habitats where nest sites are available in sturdy cattails over open, permanent water. Nesting
requirements also can be met by suitable herbaceous vegetation in upland sites. Tall, sturdy, herbaceous
stems or midstory or overstory components are used as display perches or observation posts. Red-winged
blackbirds nesting in herbaceous wetland habitats may feed on insects associated with shrub, tree canopy,
or herbaceous vegetation within the wetland or on insects associated with midstory and overstory
canopies or in the grass understory outside the wetland boundary (Snelling 1968). Birds nesting in upland
sites typically forage for insects in understory vegetation near the nest site.
This model attempts to evaluate the ability of a habitat to meet the food and reproductive needs of the red­
winged blackbird during the nesting season. The logic used in this species-habitat model is described in
Figure I . The following sections document this logic and the assumptions used to translate habitat
information for the red-winged blackbird into the variables selected for the HSI model. These sections
also describe the assumptions inherent in the model, identify the variables used in the model, define and
justify the suitability level of each variable, and describe the assumed relationships between varfables,

FIGURE I

Food and reproductive components (herbaceous wetland cover types). There are three conditions (A, B,
and C) included in Figure 1 . Condition A wetlands, with a minimum of 0.1 0 ha in emergent herbaceous
vegetation, can be very productive nesting habitats for red-winged blackbirds ifwater is present
throughout the year, water chemistry is favorable for photosynthesis, and abundant, persistent, emergent
vegetation suitable for nest placement is present. The qua I ity of such a wetland as nesting habitat for
red-winged blackbirds can be estimated with the following five habitat variables.
Variable I (VI) refers to the type of emergent herbaceous vegetation available in the wetland.
Vl =

1 .0 if emergent herbaceous vegetation is predominantly old or new growth of broad-leaved
monocots, like cattails.

Vl

0 . 1 if emergent herbaceous vegetation is predominantly narrow-leaved monocots or other
herbaceous materials.

=

Variable 2 (V2) considers the water regime of the wetlands. The suitability index of V2 is l .O if the
wetland is permanently flooded or intermittently exposed with water usually present throughout the year.
This is a desirable condition because permanent water is necessary to support persistent populations of
invertebrates that overwinter in various larval instars, maximizing the production of aquatic insects that
emerge throughout the next spring and early summer. These insects seem to be the favored food source
for blackbirds nesting in herbaceous wetlands (Orians 1980). The presence of pennanent water within the
wetland may reduce mammalian predation on nests of red-winged blackbirds (Robertson 1972).

Variable 3 (V3) pertains to the abundance of carp (Cyprinus carpio) within the wetlands. Carp disturb
submergent vegetation within the wetlands, which may destroy habitat for emergent aquatic insects (like
Odonates) and reduce wetland food sources for blackbirds.
V3 = 1.0 if carp are absent from the wetland.
VJ

=-

0.1 ifcarp are present within the wetland.

Variable 4 (V4) in the model measures the abundance of larvae of emergent aquatic insects. The adult
form of these species provides a potentially important food source for red-winged blackbirds nesting in
wetland habitats. The biomass of these benthic invertebrates is variable within a herbaceous wetland at
any one time, as well as between sampling periods (Hynes 1 972). This biomass should not be regarded as
a direct measure of productivity because production, in terms of both numbers and weight, is many times
larger than that present at any one sample periods, and the assessment of numbers or biomass per unit of
area presents formidable, perhaps insurmountable, difficulties (Hynes 1 972). The presence or absence of
suitable benthic invertebrates can be determined by sampling with a sieve net (Needham and Needham
1970) along the edge of clumps of emergent vegetation. Sampling is more likely to be accurate than
inferences about the presence of benthic invertebrates based on measures of water chemistry that may
inadequately consider pollutants that impact aquatic food chains. Inferences about the presence of
benthic invertebrates based on the appearance of aquatic vegetation also are less accurate than sampling
(Orians pers. comm.). Therefore, sampling to determine the presence or absence of important benthic
invertebrates is the preferred assessment technique.
V4 = 1.0 if larvae of damselflies and dragonflies (Order Odonata) are present in the wetland.

Dense stands ofemergent vegetation in wetlands prevent sunlight from penetrating to the water surface,
which reduces aquatic productivity. A mat of vegetation can form a wetland ''floor", which reduces the
availability of arthropods to red-winged blackbirds and may result in increased nest predation. Open
water, interspersed throughout the emergent herbaceous vegetation, supports submergent vegetation
within the wetland boundary that can be used by aquatic insects as food and cover. The openings also
provide an interface between emergent vegetation and open water, which increases the vegetation surface
area available to emerging insects and foraging red-winged blackbirds and may increase the presence of
potential nest sites. Blackbirds frequently nest on the edge of cattail clumps that border open water
(Wiens I 965), They are highly territorial, and the number of territories in a wetland is assumed to be
dependent on the quantity of edge between emergent vegetation and open water that is available for nest
sites. An exact measure of the amount of edge within a wetland can be difficult and unreliable because of
the highly dynamic nature of the herbaceous vegetation, resulting from water level fluctuations, life
cycles of the vegetation, and activities of anjmals like muskrats (Ondatra zibethica). Measures of the
patchiness of emergent herbaceous vegetation and open water within a wetland is represented by variable
5 (VS) in the model.
Blackbirds prefer patchy stands of cattails interspersed with areas of open water over dense homogeneous
stands of cattails (Robertson 1972). Variable 5 is assumed to have a suitability index of 1.0 when the
quantity of open water and emergent vegetation is about even (about 40% to 60%). Robertson ( 1972)
found a nesting density of about 96 nests/ha in herbaceous wetland habitat when patchy vegetation was

about 4 1 % of the total wetland area. Wetlands with large areas of emergent vegetation and small areas of
open water receive relatively low Sis because of the small quantity of suitable nest sites. Case and Hewitt
( 1 963) described the Inlet Valley Marsh in New York as a small, closed herbaceous wetland with upland
trees and shrubs immediately adjacent for nesting and foraging sites. The red-winged blackbird nesting
density in this herbaceous wetland was about 33/ha. Variable S is assigned an SI of 0.3 when a wetland is
completely covered with emergent herbaceous vegetation, as described above.
Conditions where there are small areas of emergent vegetation and large areas of open water also receive
a low SI because of the reduced availability of niche spaces. Moulton (1 980) found red-winged
blackbirds nesting in emergent vegetation along ditch banks that surrounded large areas of open water in
rice (01yza sativa) paddies in northern Minnesota. Nest densities averaged about 2.5 nests/ha of total
wetland habitat, presumably because both nests and emergent vegetation were restricted to long, narrow
strips of edge. The territorial behavior of red-winged blackbirds may have restricted the nest density
along the ditch banks. An SI of 0.1 is assigned to VS for wetland habitats with a limited amount of
emergent herbaceous cover. The Si's for wetlands with different amounts of emergent herbaceous
vegetation are listed below. User's can interpolate between listed values as needed.
VS =
V5

=

1.0 if the wetland area contains about an equal mix of emergent herbaceous vegetation and open
water.
0.3 if the wetland area is covered by a dense stand of emergent herbaceous vegetation.

VS = 0.1 i f the wetland area contains a few patches of emergent herbaceous vegetation and extensive
areas of open water.
Condition B wetlands are wetlands that are likely to be dry sometime during the year or that do not have
an aquatic insect resource. These wetlands may still provide some habitat for nesting red-winged
blackbirds. Blackbirds will tend to use the available emergent vegetation as nest sites and rely on
vegetation surrounding the wetland as a foraging substrate. The distance that red-winged blackbirds will
fly from wetlands to forage on insects in upland habitats is not known. In this model, only foraging siies
within 200 m of wetlands that contain nest sites are assumed to be useful to blackbirds. The quality of a
wetland without permanent water or an aquatic insect resource is assumed to be no better than the quality
of available foraging sites outside the wetland (V6). Wetlands that only have upland habitats with
understory vegetation (such as old fields, pastures, or hay fields) available as foraging substrates are given
an SI of 0.1. Wetlands near uplands that have a deciduous midstory or tree canopy as a foraging substrate
are assumed to have an SI of 0. 4. Red-winged blackbirds nesting in one herbaceous wetland will forage
on insects in other, close-by, herbaceous wetlands (Holm 1 973). Condition B wetlands situated within
200 m of a condition A herbaceous wetland that has an emergent aquatic insect fauna (Odonates) and
undefended foraging areas are given an SI of 0.9.
V6 = 0.1 if the only suitable foraging substrate is an understory layer.
V6 = 0.4 if the suitable foraging substrates include a midstory and/or an overstory layer.
V6 =

0.9 if the suitable foraging area is a condition A wetland.

Food and reproductive components(upland cover types). Upland habitats (Fig. l ; condition C) frequently
are less productive than are wetland habitats. The number of young red-winged blackbirds fledged per
territory may be as large in upland sites as in some wetland habitats (Dolbeer 1976). The number of
young fledged/ha in upland sites, however, frequently is less than 10% ofthe number fledged/ha in good

123

quality wetland habitat. For example, Robertson ( 1972) reported 133 young fledged/ha in one wetland
study area, while only 5 young fledged/ha in nearby upland sites. The nesting density in the wetland
habitat, with patches of emergent, herbaceous vegetation interspersed with patches of open water, was
about l 0 times higher than in upland habitats. Robertson found about 100 red-winged blackbird nests/ha
in suitable wetland habitat, 2 to 1 3 nests/ha in hay fields, and 0.1 nests/ha in a Christmas tree plantation.
Robertson's ( 1972) data on the numbers of nests/ha and young fledged/ha suggest that, if the best wetland
habitats have an HSI of 1.0, the best upland sites may have an HSI of about 0. 1 . Graber and Graber
(1963) determined that summer populations of red-winged blackbirds (number/40 ha) in Illinois from
1958 to 1959 were 301 birds in herbaceous wetlands (whether condition A or B is unknown), 342 birds in
edge shrubs, 204 birds in sweet clover, 158 birds along drainage ditches, 134 birds in mixed hay, 89 birds
in red clover (Trifolium pratense), 65 birds in oat (Avena saliva) fields, 64 birds in ungrazed grasslands,
58 birds in alfalfa, 30 birds in wheat (Triticum aestivum), 27 birds in fallow fields, 24 birds in
pastureland, 23 birds in shrub-grown areas, 5 birds in corn fields, and 3 birds in soybeans (Glycine max).
The observed nest densities would not exceed the values measured by Robertson ( 1972) for upland
habitats even if all of the birds in each of these different habitat types were nesting females.
The type of upland cover available as nest sites for the red-winged blackbird is represented by V7 in the
model. Red-winged blackbirds nest in a wide variety of upland sites. For example, blackbirds nested in
hay fields and old fields, but not in tilled and fallow fields, in southern Michigan (Albers J 978).
Important characteristics of upland nest sites include the presence of dense, tall, herbaceous vegetation,
the availability of fence posts and other structures that serve as display perches for males and as
observation posts for both males and females, and a proximity to open water (Joyner 1978). Specific
information on the preferred proximity of nest sites in upland habitats to open water were not found in the
literature.
Variable 7 (V7) describes the avai!ability of dense, sturdy herbaceous vegetation in forbland, grassland,
and pasture/hayland upland sites. Variable 7 has a habitat suitability index of 0.1 if the herbaceous
vegetation is dense and tall, like sweet clover (Melilotus spp.), mixed hay, alfalfa, and coarse weeds,
which provide suitable nest sites and protective cover. Variable 7 has a suitability index of 0.0 if the
habitat site has some other surface cover, such as cut or fallow fields, agricultural fields, woodlots, or
ti lied soils.

Early nests of red-winged blackbirds in upland sites are more productive than are late nests (Dolbeer
1976). Early nests are placed in robust, dense, old herbaceous growth. Activities that are destructive to
this vegetation, such as mowing, heavy grazing pressure, or burning, reduce habitat suitability for red­
winged blackbirds. The occurrence of disturbances that might impact nesting success in upland cover
types is included as V8 in the model.

HSI determination. Three types of habitat conditions (A, B, and C) are described in Figure 1 . Condition
A represents a wetland that contains the preferred vegetative structure for nest placement, permanent
water that supports a population of emergent aquatic insects that are available as food, the absence of

carp, and the interspersion of open water within emergent herbaceous vegetation. The equat ion
combining the Sls for VI to VS to estimate an HSI for condition A wetlands is:

HSI = (Vl x V2 x V3 x V4 x VS)
Condition B habitats (Fig. 1) are wetlands where the emergent herbaceous vegetation does not have the
preferred structure, there is no permanent water, carp are present, or benthic invertebrates are absent.
Condition B habitats have a basic Sl of 0.1, determined by the 0.1 Sl for the unsuitable conditions of V 1 ,
V2, V3, or V4. The basic SI of 0.1 can be increased i f suitable foraging substrate is available outside the
boundary ofthe wetland. Food sources are considered more l im iti ng if only an understory layer is
avai labl e than if deciduous midstory and/or overstory layers also are available as foraging surfaces. A
condition B habitat may be of highest value to red-winged blackbirds if the birds can readily feed on
emergent aquatic insects in a nearby condition A herbaceous wetland habitat. The equation for estimating
the HSI for condition B habitats is:
HSI

=

(0. I x V6)

I2

Condition C habitats are upland sites, like grass, forb, and pasture/hayland cover types. Their HSl'S,
which will be either 0.1 or 0, are described by the following equation:

HSI

=

(V7 x VS)

I2

The measure of habitat quali ty represented by the HSI actually reflects an estimate of the quantity of
niche space avai lable to the blackbird. Habitats with higher HSls are assumed to contain more niche
space than habitats with lower HSl'S. More niche space in a habitat frequently means that more
i ndividuals will occur in that hab itat
.

Application of the Model

Summarv of model variables. This model can be applied by interpreting a recent, good quality, aerial
photograph of the assessment area and making selected field measurements. The habitat to be evaluated
is outlined on the aerial photograph. Each wetland within the assessment area is identified and a 200 m
zone drawn around its perimeter. The wetlands within the assessment area are evaluated, on a per ha
b asis, with field observations and measurements that determine: ( 1 ) the type of emergent vegetation
present; (2) the probable permanency of the water; (3) the presence or absence of carp; (4) the presence or
absence of larval stages of emergent aquatic insects; (5) the mix of open water and emergent herbaceous
vegetation; and (6) the nature of vegetative cover within 200 m surrounding the wetland (Fig. 2). The
proportion of open water and emergent herbaceous vegetation within the wetland is estimated from a map
made after boating or wading through the wetland. The presence of benthic invertebrates is determined
from field sampling. Upland habitats within the assessment area are evaluated by ground truthing to
determine cover types and land-use practices. Habitat conditions, like the presence of dense, tall
herbaceous cover and the probability that dist urbances such as grazing, burning, mowing, and tilling will
occur during the March to July nesting season, are noted.
Definitions of variables and suggested field measure ment techniques are provided in Figure 3.

Model assumptions.

f have assumed that it is possible to synthesize results from many studies conducted
in different seasons of the year different locations in North America into a model years, and a wide
variety of nest sites throughout North America into a model describing the relative quality of breeding

habitat for the red-winged blackbird. My basic assumptions about habitat criteria important to red­
winged blackbirds are based on descriptive and correlative relationships expressed in the literature. My
descriptors of habitat quality will obviously be in error if authors made incorrect judgements or
measurements or if J have emphasized the wrong data sets or misinterpreted the meaning of published
data.
I have assumed that the quality of some wetland habitats exceeds the quality of best upland habitats. This
assumption was based largely on quality ofthe blackbirds fledged per hectare of wetland and upland
habitats. I compiled and analyzed characteristics of wetland habitats that seemed to distinguish habitats
where varying numbers of red-winged blackbirds were fledged. I assumed that I could meaningfully
bound the size of study areas to be evaluated as nesting habitat as� 0.1 ha for wetland sites and 3 I .0 ha
for suitable upland sites. I arbitrarily selected distances (200 m) that blackbirds might fly from their nests
in wetlands to forage on insects and seeds in surrounding vegetativ.e cover. 1 assumed that the presence of
dense, tall, herbaceous cover reasonably close to water, coupled with a strong probability that the dense
cover would remain relatively undisturbed during the breeding season, would adequately indicate the
value of upland habitats as nest sites for the red-winged blackbird.
The values for Variables 1 through 8 are estima1es. The ecological information available does not seem
sufficient to suggest: ( 1 ) other pertinent variables; (2) more appropriate values for the present variables;
or (3) more definitive interrelationships between the variables. Finally, I have assumed that the
multiplicative relationship described in the model is appropriate summary sta1ement to provide a Habitat
Suitability Index that reflects the relative importance of different habitats as nest sites for the red�winged
blackbird.

SOURCES OF OTHER MODELS

Weatherhead and Robertson (1977) identified and quantified some parameters that affected the nesting
success of red-winged blackbirds in wetland habitats in Ontario, Canada. They determined that nesting
success, as judged by numbers of young fledged per female, was positively correlated with territory
quality scores based on nest placement. Nesting success seemed to be related to four parameters: ( 1 )
water depth within the wetland; (2) height of nest above the herbaceous wetland floor; (3) relative
openness of nesting cover within the wetland; and (4) the identity of the support vegetation holding the
nest. Two of these variables are represented in the present model of habitat suitability for the red-winged
blackbird: ( 1 ) presence or absence of permanent water; and (2) the relative openness of vegetation within
flooded herbaceous wetlands. No other models for use in predicting the quality of nesting habitat for red­
winged blackbirds were found in the literature.

PREFACE
The habitat suitability index (HSI) model for the great egret presented in this report is intended for use in the habitat
evaluation procedures (HEP) developed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ( 1980) for impact assessment and
habitat management. The model was developed from a review and synthesis of existing information and is scaled to
produce an index of habitat suitability between 0 (unsuitable habitat) and 1 .0 (optimally suitable habitat).
Assumptions used to develop the HSI model and guidelines for model appLications, Including methods for
measuring model variables, are described.
This model is a hypothesis of species-habitat relations, not a statement of proven cause and effect. The model has
not been field tested, but it has been applied to three hypothetical data sets that are presented and discussed. The
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service encourages model users to convey comments and suggestions that may help increase
the utility and effectiveness of this habitat-based approach to fish and wildlife management. Please send any
comments or suggestions you may have on the great egret HSI model to the following address.

GREAT EGRET (Casmerodius a/bus)
INTRODUCTION
The great egret, also called common egret or American egret, is a large white heron in the order Ciconiiformes,
family Ardeidae. Great egrets stand 37-41 inches tall and have a wing spread to 55 inches (Terres 1980). The
species is associated with streams, ponds, lakes, mud flats, swamps, and freshwater and salt marshes. The birds feed
in shallow water on fishes, amphibians, feptiles, crustaceans and insects (Terres 1980).
Distribution
The great egret is a common breeding species in all coastal areas south from southern Oregon on the Pacific coast
and from Maine on the Atlantic coast; in riverine, palustrine and estuarine habitats along the coast of the Gulf of
Mexico; and in the Eastern-Central United States (Palmer 1962; Erwin and Korschgen 1979; American
Ornithologists' Union 1983}. The great egret undergoes an extensive postbreeding dispersal that extends the range
of the species to most of the United States exclusive of the arid Southwest (Byrd 1978). Young birds hatched in Gulf
coast colonies tend to move northward for a short period (Byrd 197.8; Ogden 1978). However, with the onset of
colder weather most great egrets and other herons migrate south and many winter along the gulf coast in Texas,
Louisiana, and Florida (Lowery 1974; Oberholser and Kincaid 1974; Byrd 1978). Analysis of banding data
indicates that many birds winter in Cuba, the Bahamas, the Greater and Lesser Antilles, Mexico, and Central
America (Coffey 1948). Lowery ( 1974) suggested that during severe winters, a higher proportion of the population
winters farther south.
Life HistoryOverview
Great egrets nest in mixed-species colonies that number from a few pairs to thousands of individuals. A colony may
include other species of herons, spoonbills, ibises, cormorants, anhingas, and pelicans. Colony and nest-site
selections begin as early as December along the gulf coast, but most great egrets do not initiate nesting activities
until mid-February or early March (Bent 1926; Oberholser and Kincaid 1974; Chaney et al. 1978; Morrison and
Shanley 1978). Eggs have been recorded from March through early August, and young have been observed in nests
from mid-May through late August (Oberholser and Kincaid 1974; Chaney et al. 1978). Clutch size varies from one
to six eggs per nest, but three to four eggs is most common (Bent 1926). Incubation period in a Texas colony ranged
from 23 to 2 7 days (Morrison and Shanley 1978). The first flights of young have been noted about 42 days after
hatching (Terres 1980).
SPECIFIC HABITAT REQUIREMENTS
Food and ForagingHabitat
Fish constitute up to 83% of the great egret's diet (Hoffman 1978). Most fish taken by great egrets are minnow­
sized 3.9 inches, but fish up to 1 4 inches can be captured and swallowed (Willard 1977; Schlorff 1978). Other
major food items include insects, crustaceans, frogs, and snakes, while small mammals, small birds, salamanders,
turtles, snails, and plant seeds are occasionally taken (Baynard 1912; Bent 1926; Hunsaker 1959; Palmer 1962;
Genelly 1964; Kushlan 1978b).
Little specific information exists on the food habits of various age classes of great egrets. An adult great egret
weighing 32.3 ounces (oz) (Palmer 1962) may require approximately 3.9 oz of food per day (estimated by using the
wading bird weight-daily food requirement model proposed by Kushlan l 978b). Daily food requirements are
undoubtedly higher during the nesting season when adults are feeding young (Kushlan 1978b).
Great egrets usually forage in open, calm, shallow water areas near the margins of wetlands. They show no
preference for fresh-, brackish, or saltwater habitat. Custer and Osborn ( I 978a,b) found that feeding habitat
selection in coastal areas ofNorth Carolina varied daily with the tidal cycle. During low tide, great egrets fed in
estuarine seagrass beds. During high tide, freshwater ponds and the margins ofSpartina marshes were used. Inland,
great egrets feed near the banks of rivers or lakes, in drainage ditches, marshlands, rain pools (Bent 1926; Dusi et al.
1971; Kushlan I976b), and occasionally in grassy areas (Weise and Crawford 1974). Feeding sites are generally not
turbid and are fairly open with no vegetative canopy and few emergent shoots (Thompson 1979b),

Great egrets forage singly, in single-species groups, and in mixed-species associations (Kushlan 1978b). Great
egrets generally fly alone to feeding sites (Custer and Osborn l 978a,b) and may use the same feeding site
repeatedly. The density and abundance of fish at a given location in estuarine habitats may vary with season, time
of day, tidal stage, turbidity, and other factors. If feeding success is low, great egrets may move to other areas
(Cypert 1 958; Schlorff 1978) and join other conspecifics in good feeding habitats (Custer and Osborn l 978a,b).
Most instances of group feeding have been observed during specific environmental conditions, such as lowered
water levels, that tend to concentrate prey (Kushlan 1976a,b; Schlorff 1 978).
Meyerriecks ( 1960, 1962) and Kushian { l 976a, l 978a, b) provided detailed information on hunting techniques
employed by great egrets. The "stand-and-wait" and "slow-wade" methods are used most frequently. Because of
their long legs, great egrets can forage in somewhat deeper water than most other herons. In New Jersey, foraging
depths ranged from 0 (standing on the bank while fishing) to 1 1 inches, but depths ranging from 4 to 9 inches were
most commonly used (Willard 1977), In North Carolina, great egrets fed in water with a mean depth of25. I cm (9.8
inches) i n Spartina habitat and of 6.8 inches in non-Spartina habitat (Custer and Osborn I 978b ). Mean water depth
was 7.9 inches for foraging great egrets in California (Hom 1983). In addition to wading, great egrets can feed by
alighting on the surface of deep waters to catch prey, a method rarely employed (Reese 1973; Rodgers 1974, 1975).
Although recent declines ofgreat egret populations in the central coastal region of Texas occurred simultaneously
with declines in coastal marine and estuarine fish populations (Chapman 1980), no causal relationship has been
proven. At present there are no known mahagement practices that provide suitable food alternatives for piscivorous
species; such as the great egret, during periods of fish population decline. Known fish nursery and feeding areas
need protection from destruction or habitat alteration to ensure adequate prey populations for fish-eating birds.
Water
The physiologic water requirement ofgreat egrets is probably met during feeding activities in aquatic habitats (Dusi
et al . 1971 ). Water depth affects the quantity, variety, and distribution of food and cover; great egret food and cover
needs are generally met between the shoreline and water 1.6 feet deep (Willard 1977).
Interspersion
Suitable habitat for the great egret must include ( I ) extensive shallow, open water habitat from 4 to 9 inches deep
(Willard 1977); (2) food species present in sufficient quantity (Custer and Osborn I 977); and (3) adequate nesting or
roosting habitatclose to feeding habitat. Most great egrets at a colony in North Carolina flew less than 2.5 miles
fro m nesting colonies (and presumably, from roosting sites) to feeding areas (Custer and Osborn l 978a), but flight
distances of up to 22.4 miles have been recorded in the floodplain of the Upper Mississippi River (Thompson
1 979b).
Several heronries may be close together. Great egrets from one colony may fly over or near an adjacent colony, but
rarely feed in the same areas as conspecifics from the adjacent colony (Thompson l 979b).
HABITAT SUITABILITY INDEX (HSr) MODELS
Model Applicability
Geographic area. The habitat suitability index (HSI) models in this report were developed for application in coastal
wetland habitats in Texas and Louisiana. Because there are few differences in habitat requirements along the
Atlantic coast, the remainder of the gulf coast, and inland sites in the Southeastern United States, the HSJ models
may also be used to evaluate potential habitat in those areas.
Season. This model will produce an HSI values based upon habitat requirements of great egrets during the breeding
season (February to August). Because there is no apparent seasonal difference in feeding habitat preference and
because winter nocturnal roosts are similar to nesting sites, the HSI models may also be used to evaluate winter
habitat for the great egret.

Covertypes. Great egrets nest on upland islands and in the following cover types of Cowardin et al. (1979):
Estuarine Intertidal Scrub-Shrub wetland (E2SS), Estuarine Intertidal Forested wetland (E2FO), Palustrine Scrub­
Shrub wetland (PSS) (including deciduous and evergreen subclasses), and Palustrine Forested wetland (PFO)
(including deciduous and evergreen subclasses). Great egrets may also feed in these wooded wetlands, but preferred
feeding areas may be any one of a wide variety of wetland cover types.
Minimum habitat area. Minimum habitat area is dei1ned as the minimum amount of contiguous suitable habitat
required before an area can be occupied by a particular species. Specific inform(\tion on minimum areas required by
great egrets was not found in the literature. If local information is available to define the minimum habitat area, and
less than this amount ofarea is available, the HSI for the species will be zero.
Verification level. The output of these HSf models is an index between 0 and 1.0 that is believed to reflect habitat
potential for great egrets. Two biologists reviewed and evaluated the great egret HSI model throughout its
development: Dr. R. Douglas -Slack, Texas A&M University, College Station, and Jochen H. Wiese, Environmental
Science and Engineering Company, Gainesville, Florida. Their recommendations were incorporated into the model­
building effort. The authors, however, are responsible for the final version of the models. The models have not
been field-tested.

Model Descriptions
Feeding HSI model. Great egret feeding habitat suitability is related to prey availability. Habitat suitability is
optimal when two condjtions are met: ( I ) the populations of minnow-sized fish are high; and (2) shallow open
water (necessary for successful prey capture), aquatic vegetation (necessary for prey survival and reproduction), and
deeper water are present in a ratio that maximizes prey density and minimizes hunting interference. Use ofthis
model assumes that deep or permanent water environments are not limiting in coastal habitats and that fish
populations are distributed uniformly. Because great egrets hunt a variety of species in many different habitat types,
a general approach to modeling feeding habitat suitability is presented. Suitability of all wetland cover types for
feeding is determined by integrating two factors: ( l ) the abundance of prey and (2) the accessibility of prey.
The abundance ofprey is determined by the ability ofthe habitat to support the major prey species, especially
minnow-sized fish. It is assumed that the abundance of major prey species is related to the primary and secondary
productivity of the aquatic habitat; however, few field studies have documented this relationship. The model
assumes that prey abundance is not limiting in coastal habitats. Therefore, the accessibility of prey is used as the
indicator of feeding habitat suitability.
The accessibility of prey is determined by water depth and percentage cover of aquatic vegetation. A wetland with
I 00% of its area covered by water 4-9 inches deep is assumed to be optimal for feeding by great egrets (V1 ).
Although an absence of submerged or emergent vegetation would render fish species most vulnerable to capture, it
is unlikely that many prey species would use such an area because it totally lacks cover. The model assumes,
therefore, that optimal conditions for both the occurrence and susceptibility to capture of prey species exist when
40o/o-60% of the wetland substrate is covered by submerged or emergent vegetation (V2). When such vegetation is
lacking, the habitat has a low value for feeding great egrets because small fish may use unvegetated water that is too
shallow for their larger aquatic predators.

This section provides graphic representation of the relationship between habitat variables and habitat suitability for
the great egret in wetland (see Table 2 for abbreviations) and upland (U) cover types. The SI values are read
directly from the graph ( 1.0 = optimal suitability, 0.0 = no suitability) for each variable.
The SI graphs are based on the assumption that the suitability of a particular variable can be represented by a two­
dimensional linear response surface. Although there may be interdependencies and correlations between many
habitat variables, the model assumes that each variable operates independently over the range of other variables
under consideration.

Data representing three hypothetical study areas for great egret were used to calculate sample HSI values The HSI
values obtained are believed to reflect the potential ofthe areas to support feeding or nesting great egrets.
Field Use of Models
The level of detail needed for application ofthese models will depend on time, money, and accuracy constraints.
Detailed field sampling of all variables will provide the most reliable and replicable HSI values. Any or all
variables can be estimated to reduce the amount of time or money required to apply the models. Increased use of the
subjective estimates decreases reliability and replicability. and these estimates should be accompanied by
appropriate documentation to insure that decision makers understand both the method of HSI determination and
quality ofdata used in the model. Techniques for measuring habitat variables included in the great egret HSI
models are suggested in Table 5.
A project area may contain both potential feeding and nesting habitat. To decrease the cost and time necessary to
evaluate the area, assume that food is not limiting and apply only the nesting HSI model. This recommendation is
based upon the following assumptions: ( l) in most coastal areas of Texas and Louisiana, aquatic habitats suitable
for feeding are abundant and are, therefore, less of a limiting factor to great egrets than are suitable nesting sites; and
(2) nesting value is easier and more accurately estimated by using subjective methods than is food value. The
variables used to measure food use of past colony sites, and (2) the enhancement of a site by the presence ofother
herons. These two factors are usually, but not always, interrelated. Great egrets tend to use the same colony site in
successive years until the site is degraded, and the site may include great blue herons. When applying the HST
model , the user should be aware that an area known to be used by great egrets (or great blue herons) is more likely
to be used in future years than an area with an equal HSI value not known to have a history as a colony site.

Plain Titmouse (Parus inornatus)

Habitat Use Information

General
The plain titmouse inhabits oak and pifion-juniper woodlands from Oregon south and west to Texas. I t is a year­
round resident, and maintains a territory throughout the year. The species is generally a secondary cavity nester,
although it may occasionally excavate its own hole.
Food

As a group, titmice take a wide variety of foods, but they are considered insectivorous during the summer, and
consumers of fruit, seeds, and some insects in the winter (Ferrins 1979). Root ( 1 967 - cited by Verner 1 979), found
that a large proportion of their food consisted of plant material and arthropods living on the bark oftrees. Wagner
( 1 9 8 1 ) found the plain titmouse took a great variety ofarthropod taxa.

The titmouse is primarily a bark forager, although it also forages on tree foliage and occasionally on the ground
(Hertz et. al . 1976). Most foraging by this species is done between 0-30 feet (0-9 m) of the ground (Wagner 1 98 1 ;
Hertz et. al. 1976). Hertz et al. found that plain titmice showed a preference for foraging in blue oaks (Quercus
douglasii) over coast live oaks (Q. agrifolia). Hertz et. al. {1976) attr ibuted the avoidance of live oaks to their
smooth bark which is poor habitat for arthropods. Block and Morrison ( 1 986) also found the titmouse to use bl ue
oaks more than valley oaks (Q. lobata), black oak (Q. kelloggii), and canyon live oak (Q. ch1ysolepis) for foraging
at Tejon Ranch, California. The plain titmouse will forage extensively in live oaks however, especially when other
oak species are not present (Dixon l 964).
Reproduction
The plain titmouse is a secondary cavity nester, nesting in natural cavities, old woodpecker holes, or nest boxes, It
prefers natural cavities over excavated cavities (Wi lson, pers. comm.). Bent ( 1946) reported nests from 3-32 feet ( 1 1 0 m ) above the ground. Bent, citing Dawson ( 1 923), reported the titmouse to occasionally excavate its own nest
cavity in blue oaks. The plain titmouse prefers wooded areas with intermediate to high percentage canopy coverage
dominated by blue, live and valley oaks (Verner and Boss 1980).
Cover

Cover is provided by the oak woodlands and riparian areas in which the plain titmouse lives. Roost sites are
provided by natural cavities, old woodpecker holes, or by dense foliage which simulates a cavity (Dixon 1949).
Interspersion
Plain titmice maintain year-round territories. Three territories observed by Hertz et. al. ( 1976) averaged 2.0 acres
(0.8 ha) in California oak woodland. Dixon ( 1 949) found 1 2 territories ranged located primarily in live oak
woodland. These territories ranged in size from 3.3-12.5 acres ( 1.3-5.1 ha) with an average size of 6.3 acres (2.6
ha). According to Dixon { 1956) 2.5 acres ( 1 .0 ha) would probably be close to an absolute minimum size for a
territory.
Water Requirements
In a study by W illiams and Koenig ( 1980), the plain titmouse was classified as an occasional drinker.

Model Applicabil iy
t
This model was developed for use in evaluating habitat suitability ofoak savannah, oak woodland, and riparian
woodland in Merced, Presno, Stanislaus, and San Benito Counties in California from 500 - 2,500 ft in elevation.
The basic assumptions for using the model are that meeting the reproductive needs of the plai n titmouse will take
care of its cover and food needs throughout the year. This assumption seems warranted. Verner ( 1979) believes that
proper management for oaks for breeding birds should also provide the habitat needs for species that use oaks at
other times of the year. I n addition, it is assumed that water is not a limiting factor. I t is assumed that the model is
valid for use in riparian areas as well as the oak woodlands despite the fact that the model was initially developed for
oak woodlands.

Model Description
Little quantitative data were found on the habitat needs of the plain titmouse. The most useful information was the
information on habitat factors related to breeding for the species presented by Ohmann and Mayer ( I 986). Using
data from the California Wildlife Habitat Relationships data base and the Forest Inventory and Analysis Research
Unit inventory, Ohmann and Mayer developed a habitat suitability index model for the plain titmouse from which

Variable I was derived.

Variable 1 . Tree diameter. (A tree is defined as a woody plant species

16 feet high or greater)

Ohmann and Mayer found tree size and percent canopy closure to be the major variables determining suitability ofa
habitat for the plain titmouse. Our mode'! will assume that the diameter of a tree and the size of the canopy are
correlated to the extent that they can be considered a single variable to be represented in this model by diameter at
breast height (DBH). Presumably this variable best represents older trees with more cavities for nesting and greater
bark surface which supports a greater prey base.

Variable 2. Trees per acre,
Plain titmouse abundance was found to increase as the number of trees increased (Wilson, pers. comm.). This may
be particularly important in areas of low to moderate canopy cover. Studies at the Hopland, California field station
found titmouse abundances to peak in areas with

Both Variables I and 2 relate directly to the extent of a stand's canopy closure such that the importance placed on

Variable 3. Percent composition of tree species that are oaks (Quercus).
Verner and Boss ( 1980) stated that the plain titmouse prefers stands dominated by blue, live and valley oaks. We
have been unable to find and studies documenting the presence ofthe plain titmouse in an area without a major
proportion ofoaks. For the sake of this model then, we will consider the presence ofoaks to be a life requisite such
that the optimum titmouse habi.tat is one dominated by oaks.

DBH tree is probably about the smallest tree that could have a cavity of sufficient size for the titmouse,

3.

Ideally, all tree species in the study area should be fully leafed out when applying the modeL Therefore, the
best time for sampling is spring and summer.

Important Information About Your Species List
How We Make Species Lists
We store information about endangered and threatened species lists by U.S. Geological Survey 71/z
minute quads. The United States is divided into these quads, which are about the size of San
Francisco.
The animals on your species list are ones that occur within, or may be

affected by projects within,

the quads covered by the list.
•

Fish and other aquatic species appear on your list if they are in the same watershed as your
quad or i f water use in your quad might affect them.

•

Amphibians will be on the list for a quad or county if pesticides applied in that area may be
carried to their habitat by air currents.

•

Birds are shown regardless of whether they are resident or migratory. Relevant birds on the
county list should be considered regardless of whether they appear on a quad list.

Plants
Any plants on your list are ones that have actually been observed in the area covered by the list. Plants
may exist in an area without ever having been detected there. You can find out what's in the

surrounding quads through the California Native Plant Society's online Inventory of Rare and

Endangered Plants.
Surveying
Some of the species on your list may not be affected by your project. A trained biologist and/ or
botanist, familiar with the habitat requirements of the species on your list, should determine whether
they or habitats sult:able for them may be affected by yout project. We recommend that your surveys
include any proposed and candidate species on yout list.
See our Protocol and Recovery Permits pages.
For plant surveys, we recommend using the Guidelines for Conducting and Reporting Botanical
Inventories. The results of your surveys should be published in any environmental documents
prepared for your project.

Your Responsibilities Under the Endangered Species Act
All animals identified as listed above are fully protected under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as
amended. Section 9 of the Act and its implementing regulations prohibit the take of a federally listed
wildlife species. Take is defined by the Act as "to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap,
capture, or collect" any such animal.
Take may include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures
wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral pattems, including breeding, feeding, or shelter
(SO CFR §17.3).
Take incidental to an otherwise lawful activity may be authorized by one of two procedures:
•

If a Federal agency is involved with the peonitting, funding, or carrying out of a project that
may result in take, then that agency must engage in a formal consultation with the Service.

During formal consultation, the Federal agency, the applicant and the Service work together
to avoid or minimize the impact on listed species and their habitat. Such consultation would
result in a biological opinion by the Service addressing the anticipated effect of the project on
listed and proposed species. The opinion may authorize a limited level of incidental take.
•

If no Federal agency is involved with the project, and federally listed species may be taken as
part of the project, then you, the applicant, should apply for an incidental take permit. The
Service may issue such a penn.it if you submit a satisfactory conservation plan for the species
that would be affected by your project.
Should your survey determine that federally listed or proposed species occur .in the area and
are likely to be affected by the project, we recommend that you work with this office and the
California Department of Fish and Game to develop a plan that minimizes the prnject's direct
and inditect impacts to listed species and compensates for project-related loss of habitat. You
should include the plan in any environmental documents you file.

Critical Habitat
When a species is listed as endangered or threatened, areas of habitat considered essential to its
conseivation tnay be designated as critical habitat. These areas may require special management
considerations ot protection. They provide needed space for growth and normal behavior; food,
water, air, light, other nutritional or physiological requirements; cover or shelter; and sites for

breeding, reproduction, rearing of offsering, germination or seed dispersal.

Although critical habitat may be designated on private or State lands, activities on these lands are not
restricted unless there is Federal involvement in the activities or direct harm to listed wildlife.
If any species has proposed or designated critical habitat within a quad, there will be a separate line for
this on the species list. Boundary descriptions of the critical habitat may be found in the Federal
Register. The infortnacion is also reprinted in the Code of Federal Regulations (SO CFR 17.95). See
ow: Map Room page.
Candidate Species
We recommend that you address impacts to candidate species. We put plants and animals on our
candidate list when we have enough scientific infonnation to eventually propose them for listing as
threatened or endangered. By considering these species eady in your planning process you may be
able to avoid the problems that could develop if one of these candidates was listed before the end of

your project.

Species of Concern
The Sacrattlento Fish & Wildlife Office no longer maintains a list of species of concern. However,
various other agencies and organizations maintain lists of at-risk species. These lists provide essential
information for land management planning and conservation efforts. More info
Wetlands
I f your project will impact wetlands, riparian habitat, or other jurisdictional waters as defined by
section 404 of the Clean Water Act and/ or section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, you will need to

obtain a permit from the U.S. Ar.my Corps of Engineers. Impacts to wetland habitats require site

specific mitigation and monitoring. For questions regarding wetlands, please contact Mark Littlefield
of this office at (916) 41 4-6520.
Updates
Our database is constantly updated as species a.re proposed, listed and delisted. If you address

proposed and candidate species in your planning, this should not be a problem. However, we
recommend that you get an updated list every 90 days. That would be April 29, 2015.

working together with Reclamation, DWR, and tribes on the project and will
convey information when it is appropriate. Responded that an ARPA permit
was not necessary and the inventory report will be provided when it is
completed, a date for which is unknown at this time. Stated that the survey
efforts are being conducted by an archeologist meeting the required
qualifications and the Corps is not able to provided resume or cell phone as this
is private information though the tribe may submit a FOIA request. Asked that
questions or information be provided to Ms. Montag or Ms. Jane Rinck.

In response to Ms. Montag's email on 1/29/15, Mr. Guerrero stated that it is
standard ethical practice to include resumes and qualifications statements in all
survey reports, and that most ethical archeologists do not have a problem
sharing this information. Unsolicited Mr. Guerrero also included his resume and
chart of current projects. Mr. Guerrero further stated that UAIC feels it would be
better to wait for the site visit until after the tribe has reviewed the report,
requested to know when the report would be completed. He also stated that
UAIC considers "these places" (none specifically identified) as significant and
eligible for listing in the NRHP, and that operations of Folsom Lake continue to
adversely effect the integrity of the resources.

could be occurring. Also explained that areas around the right and left wing
dams are considered high security and require an escort. Provided the
information that archeologist who conducted survey for Folsom Dam Raise
won't be back in March as planned but suggested still having site visit on March

due to scheduling conflicts the archeologist who completed the survey will not
be able to be present, Corps and Reclamation archeologists will be. Since the

sites in the project area but is choosing at this time not to participate in the
Corps identification efforts. Stated the inventory report will likely be completed
mid to late April and the Corps will consult with tribes and SHPO on the findings
of the report at that time, and Ms. Montag will be back in touch then to schedule

is a cooperating agency. The Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency is a responsible
agency for both p rojects.
Pursuant to 36 C F R § 800.3(f) (2) , the implementing reg ulations of Section 1 06 of the
N H PA, the Corps has identified you as a Native American tribe that may be interested in
consulting on the Dam Raise and the Manual Update. These forums wil l o n ly be open
to Native American tribes.
Folsom Dam and Lake is a m u ltipurpose project operated by Reclamation as a part
of the Central Valley P roject. The Corps is responsible for p rescribing operations
pertaining to use of the storage allocated for flood risk management. The dam provides
flood risk management benefits to the city of Sacramento and its s u rrounding areas by
reg u lating ru noff from approximately 1 , 860 sq uare miles of d rainage area.
The purpose of the Dam Raise is flood risk management and ecosystem restoratio n .
The D a m Raise is a uthorized for 4 components: 1 ) emergency spillway gate
mod ifications; 2) raising the right and left wings of the main d a m , Mormon Island
Auxiliary Dam (M IAO) , and the reservoir d i kes ( 1 -8) by 3 . 5 feet; 3) temperatu re control
sh utter automation and reconfiguration ; and 4) downstream ecosystem restoration of
Bushy Lake and Wood lake. The cu rrent Dam Raise analysis wil l add ress the flood
damage red uction components, the emergency spillway gate mod ifications and the 3 . 5
foot raise, which are being p rioritized for construction . T h e D a m Raise p roject will
add ress the p roposed structural mod ifications to the Folsom Dam , M IAO , and the d ikes

only. Any changes in operation as a resu lt of the construction of these p rojects,
downstream ecosystem restoration, temperatu re control shutter automation , and
reconfiguration components of the Dam Raise wil l be add ressed in the future . A
preliminary area of potential effects (APE) for the Dam Raise is shown in Enclosure 1 .
The Folsom Dam Joint Federal P roject, currently u nder construction , consists of a
new a uxiliary spillway with a crest elevation 50 feet lower in elevation than the current
gated spillways on the main dam . In order to fu lly realize the benefits of the new
auxiliary spillway, the cu rrent Folsom Dam and Lake Water Control M a n u a l m u st be
updated . The Manual U pdate wil l identify, evaluate, and recommend changes to the
flood management operation ru les of Folsom Dam and Lake to red uce flood risk to the
Sacramento a rea by utilizing the new auxiliary spillway and by incorporating an
improved understand ing of the American River watershed upstream of Folsom Dam .
The find ings of the evaluation wil l be used to help define the Dam's new flood
operations plan, with the intention of meeting flood risk management objectives and
dam safety requirements in a manner that conserves as m u ch water as possible and
maximizes all authorized Folsom Dam project uses to the extent p racticable. The
Manual U pdate will not cover operational activities of Folsom Dam and Lake that
Reclamation is responsible for. A p reliminary APE for the Manual U pdate is shown in
Enclos u re 2

.

I n accordance with Section 1 06 of the N H PA, the Corps is required to take into
account the effects of their undertakings on historic properties. This includes the
identification of historic properties, finding of effect, and the resol ution of adverse effects
through the p rocess identified i n 36 CFR § 800. As part of o u r efforts to identify historic
properties and consider the views of Native American tribes , we a re inviting you to
attend the open forums and consult on the Dam Raise and M an u a l U pd ate p rojects.
You r inp ut on the above topics and any associated items that are important to you will
be used to:
•

Further determ ine the scope of the analysis in the S E I S/SEI R documents and in

the efforts to identify historic p roperties.
•

Provide input on the range of alternatives to be eval uated in the S E I S/SE I R .

•
Obtain local knowledge or information to assist in the environmental analysis and
assessment of adverse effects on historic properties.

P roject team staff wil l be on hand to accept comments and add ress q uestions
regard ing the projects. You wil l be given the opportunity to p rovide written and verbal
comments at the open forums.

Mr. Andrew Franklin, Chairperson

Dear Mr. Franklin:
We are writing with regard to the proposed Folsom Dam Raise Flood Risk
Management (Dam Raise FRM) Project. The U . S . Army Corps of Engineers,
Sacramento D istrict (Corps), in coordination with the U . S . Bureau of Reclamation
(USSR), Central Valley Flood Protection Board, and the Sacramento Area Flood Control
Agency, is i m p lementing the Dam Raise FRM in order to provide flood risk management
benefits while also resolving certain dam safety issues associated with passing the
probable maximum flood. The Dam Raise FRM Project was authorized in the Energy
and Water Development Appropriation Act of 2004 based on recommendations
contained in the November 2002 Chief of Engineers' Report that were based on findings
in the 2002 American River Waters hed Long-Term Study Final Supplemental Plan
Formulation Report Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report.
We would like to i nvite your consu ltation under Section 1 06 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1 966, as amended. The area of potential effects (APE) for the Dam
Raise FRM Project is located at the Folsom Dam Left and Right Wing Dam
embankments, Dikes 1 -8, and Mormon Island Auxil iary Dam (MIAO) around Folsom
Lake in Sacramento, Placer, and El Dorado Counties. The project is located on the
Folsom, Rocklin, and Clarkeville, California, 7.5-minute U . S . G . S . topographic maps. A
preliminary APE for the Dam Raise FRM Project is shown in the enclosure. The APE
includes a 50-foot buffer area around where construction activities may occur at the
wing dams, dikes, and MIAO, as well as areas for staging of equipment during
construction. Access to these locations will be by existing paved roads around Folsom
Lake.
Raising the wing dams, dikes, and M IAO by 3 . 5 feet would allow for holding
discharges longer at 1 60,000 cubic feet per second, the downstream constraint, by
creating additional surcharge space (temporary water storage space utilized during rare
flood events) in the reservoir. The authorized top of flood pool would remain at
reservoir water surface elevation 468.34 feet NAVO 88. The Section 1 06 undertaking
for the current Dam Raise F R M Project addresses the proposed structural modifications
to the wing dams, M IAO, and dikes only. Construction of any of the proposed actions
would not substantially alter current overall operations of Folsom Dam , M IAO, and Dikes

-2-

1 -8. The Dam Raise FRM Project is a construction project that includes emergency
spillway gate mod ification s , and raising the right and left wings of the main dam, MIAO,
and the reservo i r dikes ( 1 -8) by 3 . 5 feet.
We have preliminarily determined that the APE includes those areas highl ighted and
outlined in the enclosure. We have completed a records and literature search at the
North Central I nformation Center at California State U niversity, Sacramento as well as a
search of surveys and sites within USBR's records. The only known cultural resources
within the APE for the Dam Raise FRM P roject are Folsom Dam (CA-SAC-937H), Dikes
1 -8 (CA-SAC- 1 1 03H), MIAO (CA-ELD-2868H), and CA-SAC-659, a large granite
boulder with bedrock mortar cupules. Since the p revious surveys for the J FP were
conducted in 2006 and 2007 we have begun to cond uct updated pedestrian surveys of
the APE.
We are sensitive toward the protection of traditional cultural properties and sacred
sites, and make every effort to avoid them. If you have comments on the APE, our
efforts to identify h istoric properties, or if you have knowledge of locations of
archaeological sites, sacred sites, or areas of traditional cultural value or concern in or
near the Dam Raise FRM Project APE, we request that you contact us.
Correspondence may be sent to Ms. Melissa Montag, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,

TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES:

The Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact
Report (SEIS/EIR) for the Folsom Dam Raise Project, located in the vicinity of the
Folsom facility and appurtenant structures in the city of Folsom, Sacramento County,
California, is now available for review. The Dam Raise Project is a cooperative effort
between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation
(Reclamation), the Central Valley Flood Protection Board, and the Sacramento Area
Flood Control Agency. The Dam Raise Project includes modifying the Tainter gates
and raising the dikes and wing dams by 3.5 feet. Construction was authorized by
Section 101 (a)(6) of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) 1 999 (1111 Stat.
274) and formal authorization for the project was included in Section 3029(b) of WRDA
2007.
As part of the Folsom Dam Raise Project, the Corps and its partners propose to
modify the Tainter gates by increasing the flood storage capacity and/or pool release
mechanisms, thereby adding flood damage reduction benefits while still safely passing
the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF). Raising the dam by 3.5 feet would allow for
holding discharges longer by creating additional surcharge space (temporary water
storage space utilized during rare flooding events) within the reservoir.
a. Spillway Tainter Gate Modification:
Top Seal Bulkhead:

The top seal bulkhead is a hydraulic structure that
would be mounted above the spillway Tainter gates in order to prevent overtopping
during a major flood event.
•

Tainter Gate Retrofit: Additional retrofit elements are necessary to address
some of the loading conditions imposed by PMF design. These include skin plate ribs,
lower girder, and trunnion anchorage.
•

•

Pier Height Extension: A vertical concrete extension to the top of the pier

would provide the necessary elevated platform for the new hoist system. The top seal
bulkheads would mount to and seal against the pier extension.

•

New Hoist System: A new hoist system would be installed to handle

increased hydrostatic PMF loads, as well as slightly heavier gates from additional
retrofit requirements.
b. 3.5-foot Dam Raise:
•

The 3.5-foot dam raise alternative would raise the height of Dikes 1 through 8,

and Morman Island Auxiliary Dam (MIAO), with an earthen embankment raise using
engineered fill material similar to the existing composition of the earthen dikes.
•
In combination with the earthen dam raises on the dikes and MIAO, the Corps
would also construct a reinforced 3.5-foot concrete flood wall on the Left Wing Dam and
Right Wing Dam that would tie into the main dam, the Folsom Joint Federal Project, and
the existing terrain. A reinforced concrete retaining wall (also termed a parapet wall)
with footing embedded in the earthfill of the embankment would be constructed along
the embankment crest.

The Draft SEIS/EIR describes: 1) all the environmental resources in the project area;
2) evaluates the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the No Action
Plan and the Alternative Plan, and 3) recommends avoidance, minimization, and
mitigation measures to reduce potential effects to environmental resources. Analysis
indicates that most of the potential adverse effects that could result from implementation
of the proposed alternative would either be short term, or would be avoided or reduced
to less than significant by using best management practices. However, analysis
indicates significant localized short-term effects on traffic, recreation, noise, vegetation
and wildlife, and special status species, due to construction.
The Draft SEIS/EIR also provides the opportunity for public and agency involvement
and comment. During the 45-day public review period, the Corps will host public
workshops to discuss the proposed project and encourage public questions and
comments on the project.
