This project proposes timber harvest, commercial thinning, precommercial thinning, prescribed fire, reforestation, native grass restoration, and road system improvements to achieve desired age class and species distributions and to improve watershed health. This SEIS modifies Alternative C and provides supplemental information for the following resource areas: . Aquatics, . Economics, . Fuels, . Vegetation . Visuals . Watershed, and . Wildlife The project area comprises 43,731 acres of National Forest System lands within the Clear Creek drainage, located approximately 5 air miles southeast of Kooskia, Idaho. The Clear Creek watershed lies within the Selway–Middle Fork Clearwater Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) area. Purpose and Need for Action As stated in the 2015 FEIS, the purpose of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project (Project) is to manage forest vegetation to restore natural disturbance patterns; improve long-term resistance and resilience at the landscape level; reduce fuels; improve watershed conditions; improve elk habitat effectiveness; improve habitat for early seral species; and maintain habitat structure, function, and diversity. Timber outputs from the proposed action would be used to offset treatment costs, support the economic structure of local communities, and provide for regional and national needs.  Desired conditions for the Project area were identified after careful consideration of the existing condition of the area; applicable Forest Plan management direction, recommendations in the Selway and Middle Fork Clearwater Rivers Subbasin Assessment (USDA Forest Service 2001); and the needs, opportunities, and issues identified by a site-specific interdisciplinary watershed assessment and pre-National Environmental Policy Act (pre-NEPA) analysis conducted in 2011 for the Project area. Completing the Project will move the area toward a Desired Future Condition as defined in the Nez Perce National Forest Plan1 (USDA Forest Service 1987a, pp. II-1 and II-2). 1 Forest Plan direction for this project is found in the Nez Perce National Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987b) since the project area lies within the administrative boundaries of the Nez Perce National Forest. The Nez Perce and Clearwater National Forests were administratively combined in February 2013, but the existing Forest Plans for each Forest will continue to guide management actions until the Forest Plans are revised. Revision of the 1987 Forest Plans is currently ongoing. The Clear Creek Project is part of the larger Selway-Middle Fork Clearwater Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Project. In 2010, the Clearwater Basin Collaborative (CBC) in partnership with the Nez Perce–Clearwater National Forests produced a comprehensive restoration strategy that was submitted for funding through the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP). This science-based proposal was designed to restore and maintain ecological conditions within the 1.4 million-acre Selway Middle Fork ecosystem in Idaho. The Selway Middle Fork Clearwater CFLRP proposal includes the following goals: . Reestablish and perpetuate landscapes that are diverse and resilient . Restore forest structure, function, and ecologic processes that promote aquatic health . Restore forest structure, function, and ecologic processes that promote habitat for big game and other terrestrial species . Contain or eliminate noxious weeds . Promote landscape conditions that allow fire to function as the primary restoration agent . Contribute to the economy and sustainability of rural communities Watershed improvement needs were identified during the pre-NEPA stage of this EIS. To accelerate watershed recovery, some watershed improvement activities were authorized under separate decision documents. The effects of those projects have been incorporated into the existing condition of this EIS or have been addressed in the cumulative effects analysis for this project. Watershed improvement projects associated with the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project include: 10 miles of system road decommissioning, 73 miles of non-system road decommissioning, 4 miles of road reconstruction, 49 culvert replacements, and 22 culvert removals. Most of these projects have already been implemented. The Clear Ridge Non-System Road Decommissioning Project, which proposes decommissioning 65 miles of non-system roads and removing 15 culverts (see Appendix J of 2015 FEIS for a more detailed outline) was signed on January 15, 2015 but has yet to be implemented. The Selway–Middle Fork Clearwater area is identified as a top priority for restoration in national, regional, state, and county plans and in a subbasin assessment. The 43,731 acres of National Forest System lands in the Clear Creek watershed lies within the Selway–Middle Fork Clearwater CFLRP area. The purpose and need for this DSEIS is to further review the project analysis, to correct and update information that was presented in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), to consider information that has become available since the FEIS was published in September 2015, and to modify Alternative C based on technical reviews. Public Involvement A Notice of Intent (NOI) advertising the scoping period was published in the Federal Register on January 6, 2012. A corrected NOI was published on February 9, 2012, updating the contact information that was published in the original notice. A second corrected NOI was published on February 13, 2012, extending the comment due date to March 1, 2012. A third corrected NOI, advertising two proposed site-specific Forest Plan amendments that are included in this Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), was advertised on February 7, 2013. The original FEIS was published in February 2015, and was accompanied by a Draft Record of Decision (ROD) identifying the alternative selected by the Forest Supervisor for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project. The 45-day objection period for the Draft ROD began February 26, 2015. In response to objections received for the Draft ROD, the FEIS was updated and republished in September 2015. The Forest Supervisor issued a Final ROD in December 2015. On July 2, 2016 a complaint was filed with the United States District court for the District of Idaho. The Forest withdrew the decision on August 24, 2016 and published a Notice of Intent to prepare a Supplemental EIS on March 24, 2017. Alternatives Considered in Detail The FEIS (September 2015) analyzed a total of four alternatives, including a No Action Alternative. All alternatives (except for Alternative C) remain the same as in the 2015 FEIS. The alternatives are briefly summarized below. The issues and alternatives are described in greater detail in Chapter 2 of the 2015 FEIS. These activities are common to all action alternatives: 41 acres of grass restoration, 1,371 acres of prescribed fire, 1,887 acres of precommercial thinning, 119.8 miles of system road reconstruction, 48.8 miles of system road reconditioning, 13.2 miles of system road decommissioning, and two site specific Forest Plan amendments adopting the Region 1 soil standard of 15% for detrimentally disturbed soils, and clarifying the definition of old growth found in Appendix N of the Nez Perce Forest Plan. Alternative A (No Action) This alternative provides a baseline for comparing the environmental consequences of the other alternatives. Under the No Action alternative, no project activities would be implemented. Alternative B (Proposed Action, as Modified in Response to Scoping Comments) This alternative was developed in response to the purpose and need for action identified during the pre-NEPA phase of project development. It was presented for public scoping in January 2012. Alternative B would move the project area toward the desired future conditions (DFCs) that were identified for the project during the pre-NEPA phase. In addition to the activities common to all action alternatives, Alternative B proposes 2,609 acres of regeneration harvest, site preparation, and reforestation; 331 acres of improvement harvest; 5,606 acres of commercial thinning; 8.7 miles of temporary road construction on existing templates; and 27.6 miles of new temporary road construction. Alternative C (Maximal Species Conversion) This alternative would address vegetative restoration needs described in the purpose and need for action but to a greater degree than Alternative B. Alternative C would regenerate as many stands as possible while meeting objectives for other resources. In addition to the activities common to all action alternatives, the FEIS (2015) Alternative C included 4,156 acres of regeneration harvest, site preparation, and reforestation; 331 acres of improvement harvest; 4,220 acres of commercial thinning; 8.7 miles of temporary road construction on existing templates; and 27.6 miles of new temporary road construction. Alternative C has been modified from the 2015 FEIS due to technical review and ongoing analysis. The Responsible Official decided to apply the modifications to Alternative C as it proposes the most potential disturbance within the project area. Chapter 2 of this DSEIS more fully outlines the modifications to this Alternative. Briefly, everything remains the same as the 2015 FEIS except: Alternative C Modified would include 3,577 acres (579 acres less than the original Alternative C) of regeneration harvest, site preparation, and reforestation; 288 acres (43 acres less than the original Alternative C) of improvement harvest; 3,937 acres (283 acres less than the original Alternative C) of commercial thinning. The Responsible Official may choose (in whole or in part) to apply the modifications made to Alternative C to any of the other action alternatives in the decision. Alternative D (Minimal Road Construction) Alternative D would address the need for vegetative rehabilitation in the Clear Creek watershed but to a lesser degree than Alternative B. Alternative D would use existing road templates as much as possible while still meeting the need for vegetative restoration. In addition to the activities common to all action alternatives, Alternative D would include 2,178 acres of regeneration harvest, site preparation, and reforestation; 211 acres of improvement harvest; 5,141 acres of commercial thinning; 8.7 miles of temporary road construction on existing templates; and 8.8 miles of new temporary road construction. To help describe the environmental effects of each alternative as they pertain to the identified issues, the interdisciplinary team developed “indicators” that help measure the differences between the alternatives. Document Organization The Forest Service prepared this draft SEIS in compliance with NEPA and other relevant Federal and State laws and regulations. This SEIS discloses and supplements the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects that would result from the Proposed Action and action alternatives for aquatics, economics, watershed, and wildlife resources. For the remaining resources, this draft SEIS incorporates the original FEIS (September 2015) analysis by reference. The document is organized into 7 chapters and 5 appendices. Additional documentation, including more detailed analyses of project area resources, are located in the project planning record located at Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests, 903 3rd Street, Kamiah, Idaho 83536. This draft SEIS includes information necessary for the Forest Supervisor to make a decision based on environmental effects of the Proposed Action or the Alternatives. Federal regulations specify the types of information necessary for decision-makers to make good decisions. In so doing, this document is organized as follows: . Chapter One state the purpose and need for action. The purpose and need is the basis upon which to evaluate any alternatives to the Proposed Action. . Chapter Two describes the alternatives in detail and summarizes the differences between the alternatives. . Chapter Three describes the baseline (existing conditions for each resource area that may be affected by the Alternatives and analyzes the potential environmental effects indirect, indirect, and cumulative as a result of implementing the proposed alternatives. . Chapter Four lists those involved in the preparation and review of the DSEIS, including the IDT and other technical support. It also discloses who this DSEIS was sent to. . Chapter Five is the incorporation by reference of the glossary of the 2015 FEIS. . Chapter Six lists references used in the DSEIS. . Chapter Seven is the index for the DSEIS .

Purpose of and Need for Action Introduction The Forest Service has prepared this draft supplemental environmental impact statement in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other relevant Federal and State laws and regulations. This draft supplemental environmental impact statement discloses the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts that would result from the proposed action and alternatives. Additional documentation, including more detailed analyses of project area resources, may be found in the project planning record located at Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests, 903 3rd Street, Kamiah, Idaho 83536. Background The background of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project remains the same as described in the FEIS (September 2015). The FEIS is incorporated by reference and a full description of the background may be found on pages 1-1 through 1-3 of the FEIS.  The original FEIS was published in February 2015, and was accompanied by a Draft Record of Decision (ROD) identifying the alternative selected by the Forest Supervisor for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project. The 45-day objection period for the Draft ROD began February 26, 2015. In response to objections received for the Draft ROD, the FEIS was updated and republished in September 2015. The Forest Supervisor issued a Final ROD in December 2015. On July 2, 2016 a complaint was filed with the United States District Court for the District of Idaho. The Forest withdrew the decision on August 24, 2016 and published a Notice of Intent to prepare a Supplemental EIS on March 24, 2017. 1.2 Project Area The Clear Creek drainage lies within the Middle Fork Clearwater River drainage near Kooskia, Idaho. The Clear Creek drainage totals 65,000 acres, with 33% (21,269 acres) in private or State ownership and the remaining 67% (43,731 acres) under the management of the Moose Creek Ranger District. The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project area includes all 43,731 acres of NFS lands within the Clear Creek drainage (Figure 1-1). All of the project area lies within the upper two-thirds of the drainage. The project area is located approximately 5 air miles southeast of Kooskia, Idaho, within Townships 30, 31, and 32 N, Ranges 5 and 6 E, Boise Meridian.  Black and white map of northern Idaho that shows the location of the Clearwater National Forest, Nez Perce National Forest, and cities in the area.Figure 1: Vicinity Map 1.3 Purpose and Need for Action The purpose of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project remains the same as described in the FEIS (September 2015). The FEIS is incorporated by reference and a full description of the purpose and need may be found on pages 1-5 through 1-6. Briefly, the purpose of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project is to manage forest vegetation to restore natural disturbance patterns; improve long-term resistance and resilience at the landscape level; reduce fuels; improve watershed conditions; improve elk habitat effectiveness; improve habitat for early seral species; and maintain habitat structure, function, and diversity. Timber outputs from the proposed action would be used to offset treatment costs, support the economic structure of local communities, and provide for regional and national needs. 1.4 Proposed Action The proposed action of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project remains the same as described in the FEIS (September 2015). The FEIS is incorporated by reference and a full description of the proposed action may be found in the FEIS on pages 1-6 through 1-8. Briefly, the proposed action will: . Improve forest health, provide goods and services, reduce fuels, and improve wildlife habitat, . Reduce sediment production and address transportation needs, . Amend the Soils section of the Nez Perce Forest Plan, and . Amend Appendix N of the Nez Perce Forest Plan (1987). 1.5 Decision Framework Given the purpose and need, the deciding official reviews the proposed action, the other alternatives, and the environmental consequences in order to make the following decisions: . Should vegetation restoration in the Project area be completed, and if so, which forested stands should be treated and what silvicultural treatments should be applied? . Should temporary roads be constructed, and if so, how many miles of road should be constructed and where should they be constructed? . What design features, mitigation measures, and/or monitoring should be applied to the Project? 1.6 Public Involvement A Notice of Intent (NOI) advertising the scoping period was published in the Federal Register on January 6, 2012. A corrected NOI was published on February 9, 2012, updating the contact information that was published in the original notice. A second corrected NOI was published on February 13, 2012, extending the comment due date to March 1, 2012. A third corrected NOI, advertising two proposed site-specific Forest Plan amendments that are included in this Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (DSEIS), was advertised on February 7, 2013. The original FEIS was published in February 2015, and was accompanied by a Draft Record of Decision (ROD) identifying the alternative selected by the Forest Supervisor for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project. The 45-day objection period for the Draft ROD began February 26, 2015. In response to objections received for the Draft ROD, the FEIS was updated and republished in September 2015. The Forest Supervisor issued a Final ROD in December 2015. On July 2, 2016 a complaint was filed with the United States District Court for the District of Idaho. The Forest withdrew the decision on August 24, 2016 and published a Notice of Intent to prepare a Supplemental EIS on March 24, 2017. 1.7 Issues Issues are described in the 2015 FEIS (pages 1-10 to 1-15). 1.8 Regulatory Requirements and Required Coordination NEPA at 40 CFR 1502.25(a) directs “to the fullest extent possible, agencies shall prepare draft environmental impact statements concurrently with and integrated with …other environmental review laws and executive orders.” This DSEIS fully complies with the laws, regulations, and requirements relating to federal land management as described in the 2015 FEIS pages 1-15 to 1-21 and incorporates the information in the 2015 FEIS by reference. 1.9 Other Related Efforts Since the original December 2015 decision was withdrawn there have been several developments that the Responsible Official will consider as part of the new decision. Some of these items have driven the modification of Alternative C (see DSEIS, Chapter 2). The Responsible Official will evaluate all of the material that has been generated by these additional efforts and will base the final decision on the body of evidence presented in the 2015 FEIS and the final SEIS when complete. The Responsible Official may choose to apply the modifications made to Alternative C (in whole or in part) to any of the other action alternatives. 1.9.1 Gate Replacements and Effective Road Closures Effective closures on some of the old (non-system) roads in the Clear Creek area have been identified as an issue primarily for elk security. In response to these concerns, we identified roads that could benefit from gate repairs, installation of better earth mounds, or installation of logs or rocks. This work has been analyzed and cleared through a separate NEPA process and is under way (summer, 2018). There are also an additional 7 gates being installed (5 replacement gates and 2 new gates) off of FS 650 in 2018. Information on the exact locations of this work can be found in the project file. The effects are considered in this SEIS. 1.9.2 Clear Creek Aquatic Habitat Condition Assessment and Fish Population Monitoring, 2016 Report (Stillwater Report) The goal of the Aquatic Habitat Condition Assessment and Fish Population monitoring project is to provide an inventory of habitat conditions, and document fish distribution and relative abundance in the Clear Creek Watershed on the Nez- Perce Clearwater National Forests near Kooskia, Idaho. Stillwater Sciences (2015) summarized results of fish population, aquatic habitat, and channel condition surveys conducted in summer 2015, throughout 43 kilometers (27 miles) of high priority reaches in the Clear Creek Watershed at five long term monitoring stations. These stations were selected at lower mainstem Clear Creek at the National Forest boundary (LMCC), middle mainstem Clear Creek immediately upstream of its confluence with Middle Fork Clear Creek (MMCC), West Fork Clear Creek near its confluence with Clear Creek (WFCC), South Fork Clear Creek (SFCC), and Middle Fork Clear Creek (MFCC). Results from the 2015 assessment serve as a baseline for comparison with future surveys to evaluate trends in habitat conditions, water quality parameters, and fish populations over time, which may be affected by resource management in the basin. As required in the Biological Opinion for the project (NMFS 2015), two of the long-term monitoring stations established and surveyed in 2015 (LMCC and WFCC) were re-surveyed in summer 2016. This report presents the results of these surveys and compares them with 2015 surveys. The supplemental Aquatics chapter discusses this report. The entire report can be found in the project file. 1.9.3 Watershed Analysis Using WEPP Technology for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project (RMRS GeoWEPP Analysis) Introduction The USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS) was asked to help estimate the erosion from units treated by timber removal, prescribed fire and part of the road network, and to compare those estimates to earlier estimates using the NezSed model. Sediment delivery rates from treatment units were estimated using GeoWEPP, a GIS interface to the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) watershed version. A new road network erosion analysis tool under development by RMRS and the USDA National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory was combined with the FS WEPP:Road Batch to estimate sediment delivery from part of the road network. Methods The general approach to the analysis was to determine erosion from the current condition for an undisturbed forest, and following a wildfire, assumed to occur about once every 80 years. The wildfire severity was estimated by the FlamMap fire spread model for the current fuel loads in the LANDFIRE database. From these two runs, a background erosion rate was estimated. The sediment delivery from 646 individual treatment units were then analyzed for prescribed fire (broadcast and jackpot) and timber removal (tractor logging or skyline). Following timber removal, the fuel model that serves as input to FlamMap was changed to a recommended model following fuel reduction, and FlamMap rerun for the landscape. The output from this run was used to run GeoWEPP a final time to estimate erosion rates following wildfire on the proposed treatment units. Results, Discussion and Synthesis The Results, Discussion, and Synthesis are found in the body of the analysis which is attached as Appendix M. Conclusions This study estimated the erosion on undisturbed forests, burned forests, forests under restoration, and much of the forest road network. The study confirmed that the erosion estimates made using the NezSed technology are similar to those using the WEPP technology, even though the two technologies use very different methods. The NezSed technology is based on locally observed sediment data, and the WEPP technology uses local conditions in a process-based hydrology and erosion model. The WEPP technology has the advantage of allowing managers to better locate hillslopes and road segments of high erosion risk, and adjust the management of those sites to reduce erosion and/or sediment delivery. The study concluded that increase in erosion associated with the proposed activities will likely be offset by the reduced risk of fire, the reduced severity of a fire should it occur, and the reduction in hillslope sediment delivery following a wildfire.  1.9.4 Statement of Understanding (SOU) with the Nez Perce Tribe The Forest and the Nez Perce Tribe (NPT) have been meeting regularly since the December 2015 Record of Decision was withdrawn by the Responsible Official to discuss the Nez Perce Tribe’s (NPT) concerns with the project. The NPT first raised concerns about the Forest's analysis of the Project's impacts to resources in May of 2013, including potential impacts to elk populations and habitat and the potential for additional sediment impacts to salmon and steelhead spawning habitat and operations downstream at the Kooskia National Fish Hatchery. In December 2017, the Forest entered into a 1-year Statement of Understanding (SOU) with the NPT, which committed each party to identifying mutual needs and concerns and to cooperating during the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA") process. In essence, the SOU outlined a process for the Forest and the NPT to discuss the NPT’s concerns regarding the project and to accomplish further analysis. As a result of the SOU, the Forest held a series of meetings and field trips with Tribal staff and both the Forest and Tribe completed additional analyses. Government to government consultation has also been ongoing. This has led to the following: 1.9.4.1 Multi Parameter Instrument Probes The Forest purchased and has committed to install two multi parameter instrument probes, one at the Forest boundary and the other at the Kooskia Hatchery, which is managed by the Nez Perce Tribe. The Tribe has already installed a USGS monitoring station at the Kooskia Hatchery. The intent is to compare sediment levels leaving the Forest and those levels reaching the Kooskia Hatchery, downstream of National Forest and private lands. The probes are designed to measure temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and conductivity at both sites. 1.9.4.2 Data Sharing and Literature Consideration The Forest and Tribe shared information such as the updated NEZSED sediment model runs, the Stillwater Report, RMRS GeoWEPP Analysis, and all GIS shapefiles as additional, joint analysis was conducted.  The Forest has incorporated and considered the Stillwater and RMRS reports into the project analysis and considered direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of the Project. The Forest has also considered recent literature for evaluating direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of the project on elk habitat security and habitat selection including interactions with livestock and human disturbance (e.g. motorized travel, fuels reduction, other silvicultural prescriptions). 1.9.4.3 Additional Analysis with the Nez Perce Tribe Forest Service and Tribal technical staff, through a series of meeting and phone calls cooperatively reviewed and analyzed additional information focusing on potential impacts to elk populations and habitat and the potential for additional sediment impacts to salmon and steelhead spawning habitat and operations downstream at the Kooskia National Fish Hatchery. This included unit by unit and road by road examinations and consideration of the results of those analyses. 1.9.4.4 Alternative Water Supply for the Kooskia Hatchery Although not associated with the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project, the Forest continues to assist the NPT in identifying potential funding sources for an alternative water supply for the Kooskia Hatchery. 1.9.5 Explanation of Updates to the NEZSED Model (2011 Excel Version) This summarizes new information or changed circumstances in relation to the effects on water quality and quantity that were assessed in the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project. The following is an outline of updates to the NEZSED model (version 2011) spreadsheet to better align with the R1/R4 Guide for Predicting Sediment Yields (USFS 1981) direction, published research papers, and other Forest documentation noted below. Due to recent retirements/transfers of personnel and digital and hard copy documentation relocations, there was a need to evaluate the current MS Excel spreadsheet consistency with R1/R4 Guide for Predicting Sediment Yields (USFS 1981) and compile and synthesize all applicable documentation. History The NEZSED model has been used on the Nez Perce National Forest since the mid-1980s and directly relates to Appendix A of the 1987 Nez Perce Forest Plan. The NEZSED model utilizes information, formulas, and coefficients outlined in the R1/R4 Guide for Predicting Sediment Yields (USFS 1981), but also includes Nez Perce Forest specific coefficients that were validated based on field-collected data. Several documents outlining definitions, user guides, and supporting information have been created on Forest since 1985. The Regional Hydrologist and Forest personnel synthesized all data and documentation to provide a comprehensive history of the NEZSED model use and associated direction on the Nez Perce National Forest. In 2011, the NEZSED model format was transitioned from a FORTRAN /GIS platform to an MS Excel spreadsheet/GIS platform. This new process (GIS and spreadsheets), led by the Forest Hydrologist, eliminated the need to use NEZSED FORTRAN program; eliminated need to develop input files; reduced number of staff needed; reduced analysis time from weeks/months to days; increased flexibility/utility of analytical tool; and made the model more user friendly and trackable. Also at that time, the “The Care & Feeding of Appendix A” document (Gerhardt 1991), which discussed NEZSED, Fish/Water Quality Objectives, and upward trend, was updated and renamed “The implementation guide to Appendix A of the Nez Perce National Forest Plan” (Conroy and Thompson 2011; FLT decision June 27, 2011). An updated user guide on how to use the most recent MS Excel spreadsheet/GIS platform was never developed. Updates to NEZSED Model Spreadsheet 2016 The following items were updated to align to the R1/R4 Guide for Predicting Sediment Yields (USFS 1981) or other Forest documentation. . Existing Road Mitigation Level: Update Existing Roads spreadsheet to apply existing road mitigation level coefficients based on information extracted from the roads corporate database, i.e. INFRA, that are consistent with pages 33-34 of The Implementation Guide to Appendix A of the Nez Perce National Forest Plan (Conroy and Thompson 2011). The current NEZSED model spreadsheet applies Mitigation Coefficients from the variables look up table based on road surfacing, maintenance level, and vegetative buffers, but these coefficients are 10-20% higher than levels identified in Forest documentation (Conroy and Thompson 2011), results from the Horse Creek Studies found in GTR-INT-264 Reduction of Soil Erosion on Forest Roads (Burroughs and King 1989) and Effects of Forest Roads on Watershed Function in Mountainous Areas (Megahan 1987), and EPA’s National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Forestry, EPA-841-B-05-001 (EPA 2005). . Road Mitigation Level Coefficients: Updated coefficients in the Variables Look Up Spreadsheet to align with existing and project mitigation coefficients found on pages 16-17 in R1/R4 Guide for Predicting Sediment Yields (USFS 1981), pages C-16 to C-18 in Appendix C of District Watershed Database Dictionary, and Reduction Of Soil Erosion On Forest Roads (Burroughs and King 1989). Also established the ability to apply project mitigation coefficient that reflects proposed BMPs as a separate and distinct value compared to existing mitigation coefficients. Current NEZSED model spreadsheet uses Mitigation Coefficients (Surfacing and Maintenance Level) from the variables look up table based on road surfacing, maintenance level, and vegetative buffers, but these coefficients are 10-20% higher than levels identified in Forest documentation (Conroy and Thompson 2011), results from the Horse Creek Studies found in GTR-INT-264 Reduction of Soil Erosion on Forest Roads (Burroughs and King 1989) and Effects of Forest Roads on Watershed Function in Mountainous Areas (Megahan 1987), and EPA’s National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Forestry, EPA-841-B-05-001 (EPA 2005). . Disturbed Road Width: Updated all road spreadsheets to estimate the area of road producing erosion based on an estimated the “Disturbed Road Width.” The 2011 model calculates the road area based on the “Travel Way Width” and does not account for cutslopes, fillslopes, or ditches. Disturbed Road Width has been calculated for each 1000-foot long (or less) road segment based on “Travel Way Width” and other information extracted from the roads corporate database, i.e. INFRA, as described on pages C-19 to C-22 in Appendix C of District Watershed Database Dictionary and page 15 of the R1/R4 Guide for Predicting Sediment Yields (USFS 1981):  Identifies how basic erosion rates should be determined in the Idaho Batholithic soils. . Land Slope Coefficient: Updated formulas in Variables Lookup Table to only utilize upper, mid, and lower slope codes and coefficients when calculating hillslope position for harvest and burn units. Ridgetop and streamside coefficients would only be utilized for road specific calculations per the instructions provided on page C-1 in Appendix C of District Watershed Database Dictionary. Hillside processes are discussed on pages 14 (Figure 4) and 18-19 in R1/R4 Guide for Predicting Sediment Yields (USFS 1981). . Logging Systems Coefficient – User Error: Wording had been switched from clearcut to regen in the logging systems table in the variables sheet, resulting in lookup table formula in the Alternatives sheets that did not match to correct coefficient. This resulted in all clearcut units defaulting to selection harvest coefficients. For example, instead of using 1.0 as the coefficient for clearcut units with tractor logging system, the lookup formula defaulted to 0.71 instead. This was corrected.  Logging System Logging System Coefficient Regen Clearcut Selection Tractor 1.00 0.71 Cable 0.62 0.43 Skyline 0.33 0.29 Logging System Coefficients are outlined on page 20 of R1/R4 Guide for Predicting Sediment Yields (USFS 1981) Modeling Temporary Roads in NEZSED Model: Page 16 of R1/R4 Guide for Predicting Sediment Yields (USFS 1981) states “Roads to be considered include all system roads in the watershed and any other major constructed temporary road systems. Non-specified roads and skid trails internal to logging units are considered as part of logging effects…..” For the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project the following were used: o Model temp roads as part of harvest units when: there are no stream crossings; roads are located on stable, upper slopes; and there is little/discontinuous cut and fill (excavation) – this would equate to no engineered design. o Model temp roads as individual segments when: there are stream crossings; roads are located on landslide prone, highly erosive mid-slopes or mass wasting slopes; or roads require continuous excavation where there are deep cuts – this would probably equate to a road that would have some sort of engineered design or oversight. o Temporary roads outside of harvest units modeled as individual segments. . Add Temporary Road Scenario for 1 Year Plus: Updated formulas in Variables Look up Table to include temp4 for temporary roads that would occur on the landscape for more than one year (overwinter). This would correspond to Table 2, page 20 in The Implementation Guide to Appendix A of the Nez Perce National Forest Plan (Conroy and Thompson 2011). . Update Road Reconstruct and Recondition Coefficients: Updated formulas in Variables Look up Table to replace recondition with “minor”, reconstruct with “moderate”, and new construction with “major”. This would correspond to language on pages 19 and 20 in The Implementation Guide to Appendix A of the Nez Perce National Forest Plan (Conroy and Thompson 2011). . Update Summary Tables to Calculate Sediment Yields for “True” Watersheds: Sediment yield guidelines only apply to “true” watersheds. For Forest Plan Prescription watersheds that are designated as not “true” watersheds, routing coefficients were added to summary tables to calculate sediment yields. This would correspond to language on pages 22-23 in The Implementation Guide to Appendix A of the Nez Perce National Forest Plan (Conroy and Thompson 2011). Sediment routing is describe on pages 22-14 in R1/R4 Guide for Predicting Sediment Yields (USFS 1981). Changes to the Predicted Percent Sediment yield Over Base Using the Updated NEZSED Model (2016 Excel Version) The NEZSED model was used to estimate the predicted percent increase in sediment yield over base (natural) conditions to determine if guidelines from Forest Plan Appendix A would be exceeded. The use of the model is a Forest Plan standard and is useful for comparing alternatives to each other. The NEZSED model was derived from the R1/R4 Guide for Predicting Sediment Yields from Forested Watersheds (USDA Forest Service 1981). The methodology for using the NEZSED model and the model’s limitations are described in detail in the Forest’s guidance document, Implementation Guide to Appendix A of the Nez Perce National Forest Plan (Conroy and Thompson 2011). Sediment yield is calculated in tons per year and reported as “percent increase over base” conditions. Sediment yield is calculated for base conditions (without management activities), current conditions (cumulative of past and existing management activities combined with base conditions), and predicted conditions (cumulative of past, existing, and proposed activities combined with base conditions) for each of the proposed project alternatives. Activities included in the modeling include timber harvest, road decommissioning, road reconstruction, temporary road construction and prescribed fire. Modeling was done on a peak year basis in order to meet the assumptions under which Appendix A of the Nez Perce Forest Plan was developed. However, activities proposed would not occur in a single year. The model also reflects short-term changes only and does not reflect long-term benefits in sediment reduction as predicted by NEZSED. The computed increase is then compared to the values in Appendix A of the Forest Plan to determine if the proposed activities are within the established guidelines for each prescription watershed. The model simplifies, for analysis, an extremely complex physical system and is developed from a limited data base and scientific knowledge pool. Although it produces specific quantitative values for sediment yield, the results should be treated as rather broad estimates of how real systems may respond. The validity of the model is best when the results are used to compare alternatives, not for predicting specific quantities of sediment yielded. Values produced by this procedure are probably valid for comparisons only where large differences among alternatives are produced (Conroy and Thompson 2011, page 24). Results As estimated with the NEZSED model version 2016, five of the eight prescription watersheds would remain below the sediment yield guidelines, under all alternatives. Sediment yield percent over base exceeded the Forest Plan Appendix A guidelines for all action alternatives for the Browns Spring Creek prescription watershed and Alternative C for the Clear Creek and Solo Creek prescription watersheds. The highest increases were found in Alternative C, followed by Alternative B, then D. Sediment yields would return to current conditions within seven years, as modeled, and would be approximately 1% less than Alternative A due to road decommissioning activities. An in-depth discussion can be found in the Watershed section of Chapter 2 of this DSEIS. 1.9.6 Road Analysis Summary 1.9.6.1 NFMA Roads Analysis for the CFLRA area 2010 to 2012 An interdisciplinary process was used to complete a roads analysis for the entire CFLRA area. The roads analysis identified risk factors and evaluated maintenance levels, seasonal restrictions, and the need for future administrative use. The IDT made recommendations to either keep the road at current maintenance level, upgrade it to a higher maintenance level, place it into storage, or decommission. In some cases, further review of the road in the field was needed before final recommendations could be made. This roads analysis formed the basis for proposed road actions in several NEPA documents including Lodge Point, Middle Fork Veg, Tinker Bugs, Clear Creek, and miscellaneous stand-alone road projects. In regard to water quality resource concerns, specialists utilized ArcGIS to identify roads on landtypes with high potential for mass wasting, surface erosion, road bed erosion, cutbank sloughing, and sediment delivery. Fisheries specialists used ArcGIS to identify stream adjacent roads and culverts in need of replacement to accommodate Aquatic Organism Passage (AOP). The INFRA database was used to identify road segments with large fills over aging culverts. LIDAR imagery was also used to delineate non-system roads (primarily old jammer roads and skid trails). The analysis process also incorporated the Nez Perce National Forest Roads Analysis completed in 2006. The following roads were identified as having a moderate or high risk for surface erosion or had more than 30% of its length adjacent to streams. Table 1: Nez Perce National Forest Roads Analysis (2006) Risk Ratings Road # Miles Mass Wasting Rating Surface Erosion Rating Aquatic Risk Rating 284 0.49 1 1 2 286 21.73 1 2 2 464 1.53 1 3 2 470 1.32 1 1 2 650 11.56 1 3 3 1129 1.16 1 1 2 1842 2.03 1 1 2 1858 0.02 1 3 2 * Risk rating: High Risk = 3; Moderate Risk = 2; Low Risk = 1 Field Reviews for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration (CCIR) project were conducted during the 2011 and 2012 field seasons. There are 190 miles of Forest system roads within the project area with most occurring along or near ridgetops with mostly small headwater stream crossings. Approximately 147 miles (77%) is graveled and 43 miles (23%) is native surfaced road. IDT members made note of road problems and were documented in the iterative Roads Analysis spreadsheet. The fisheries biologist, hydrologist, and engineers reviewed project area roads and surveyed most culverts on perennial streams and many cross drain culverts. Specialists identified site-specific problems such as road rutting; filled ditches; damaged or filled cross drain culverts; aging, damaged, or undersized stream culverts; road cracking or sloughing, and cutbank raveling. One item noted was aggradation of sediment at the outlets of several perennial stream culverts. Field notes were summarized and added as comments in the Roads Analysis spreadsheet. The Roads Analysis spreadsheet can be found in the CCIR project file. 1.9.6.2 NEPA Analysis 2011 - 2015 Proposed road related actions were identified from the preliminary road recommendations concluded in 2011 and the final recommendations completed in 2012. Originally, all activities in the CCIR project area were to be included in one NEPA EIS document, but it was determined that implementing some of the road activities in separate NEPA decisions and prior to the completion of the EIS would accelerate watershed recovery. As a result, the following projects were completed under separate NEPA decisions: South Fork/West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning Project EA, 2011 Decommissioning of approximately 10 miles of system road and 73 miles of non-system road, includes removal of 21 stream crossings. No fish bearing streams were involved. This included the decommissioning of 2.5 miles of FS Road #250-D, one of the few stream adjacent roads in the project area. Clear Creek Culvert Replacements CE, 2011 Culvert removal/replacement of 11 culverts – 9 culverts on fish bearing streams were replaced with culverts that are at or wider than bankfull width to allow for stream bank development within the structure; 1 culvert on a non-fish bearing stream was replaced to accommodate a minimum 100-year stream flow event; and 1 culvert was removed. This project opened 1 mile of previously inaccessible habitat to native fish species. Browns Spring Culvert Replacement and Road Improvement Project Letter to File, 2012 Road improvement on 1.7 miles of Road 1124 and 1.3 miles of Road 1129. Replacement of two culverts on the 286 road. Road 286N Road Maintenance Project Letter to File, 2013 Reconstruction of 0.6 miles of Road 286N, including one culvert replacement. Road 650 Road Maintenance Project Letter to File, 2013 Approximately 15.5 miles of road improvement, including replacement of 35 non-water cross drain culverts. A total of 10.5 miles was conducted by the Forest Service and 5.0 miles were completed by Idaho County. Clear Ridge Non-System Road Decommissioning Project CE, 2015 This project will decommission approximately 65 miles of non-system road, including removal of 15 stream crossings. The above projects have mostly been implemented as of 2018. A few of the roads or portions of the roads in the South Fork/West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning Project were identified for the need of use to implement the project CCIR project and would be decommissioned following use. The Clear Ridge Non-System Road Decommissioning Project has not been implemented. In April of 2013, the DRAFT CCIR EIS was completed. Due to public comments and discussions with the Nez Perce Tribe and NMFS, further roads analysis was completed. This exercise incorporated the use of the Terrain Works NetMap analysis tools, which include WEPP:Road and GRAIP-Lite modules. As a result, additional or more defined road actions were proposed. The WEPP:Road (Elliot et al. 1999) model was also used during this period to predict the level of erosion and sediment delivery produced and/or reduced from hypothetical “average” temporary road construction and road improvement activities. The values obtained from the hypothetical “average” activities was used to determine the magnitude of difference between activities and incorporated into the upward trend analysis (FEIS Appendix J). Although a sampling of real roads were analyzed using the WEPP:Road model, the exercise was not intended as an overall examination of road generated erosion or sediment for the Clear Creek project and results were only used as rating mechanism in the upward trend analysis. In February of 2015, the Final CCIR EIS was published. The project included a variety of road related activities: decommissioning of 13.2 miles of system road, including the removal of 8 stream crossings and approximately 3 miles of non-system road (estimated amount that would be ancillary of system roads and would be identified during system road decommissioning surveys); road reconditioning along portions of 49 miles of system road; and road reconstruction along segments of 120 miles of system road, including replacement of 69 culverts on live streams with culverts sized for a 100 year flow event. Most of the roads in the CCIR project area were evaluated in the field and road recondition and reconstruction was prescribed as needed. Road improvement activities are proposed to address existing road concerns by identifying the site-specific segments that are delivering the highest amount of sediment to streams, as well as preparing the roads in a manner so that sediment production from log haul is limited Road decommissioning practices vary depending on the road location and the risk of road failure. Roads that have moderate to high risk of failure, that are near fish bearing streams, or are being used by unauthorized vehicles will require full decompaction and natural slope recontour. All roads with stream crossings or other watershed concerns will be recontoured including stream grade channel restoration. Roads identified in this project not meeting the above criteria may be abandoned. Abandoned roads have no stream crossings, are well vegetated, are resistant to surface erosion and are not prone to mass failure. Road reconditioning consists of standard maintenance, such as road blading, brushing, removal of small cutslope failures, applying rock in wet areas and removal of obstructions such as rocks and trees. Reconditioning also includes maintenance of existing culverts. Road reconstruction improves the roadway. This includes replacing and installing new culverts for cross drains and live water culverts, placement of rock surfacing, placement of roadway fill and installation of new signs or gates. Other activities include installation of drainage dips, road blading, brushing and removal of obstructions. Replace of culverts on live water streams are sized to pass 100 year flood event flows. The intent of the road reconstruction activities is to, as much as possible, hydrologically disconnect the road system from the streams. Cross drain culverts would be installed on either side of all perennial streams, unless unnecessary due to only short lengths of road draining towards stream. The Watershed and Aquatic sections of the FEIS describe potential effects from roads and discuss project design measures and BMPs that would be utilized to mitigate effects. Appendix B lists out the proposed road work and Appendix K describes the effectiveness of road related BMPs. Appendix J provides a more in depth discussion of culverts in the project area by prescription watershed. In 2016, a GeoWEPP analysis was completed by the US Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station. The results from the analysis will be incorporated into the 2018 Supplemental EIS. In 2018, the estimated potential erosion produced from roads was evaluated using the NEZSED model. Although the model is usually only applied for the comparison with the Forest Plan Appendix Sediment Yield guidelines, the results were used to look at the erosion potential for each individual road. The NEZSED model estimated 68.3 tons/year of erosion from existing roads. Fifty-two percent of that amount comes from five roads in the CCIR project area. Roads 286, 650, 1106, 1855, and 1114 account for 58 miles of road in the project area and are some of the most traveled roads. These roads will also be used as haul roads for the CCIR project. Road improvement and live-water crossing replacements have already been implemented on these roads through the related Browns Spring Culvert Replacements and Roads 1124 and 1129 Improvement Project, Clear Creek Culvert Replacements, and Road 650 Road Maintenance Project. Table 2: NEZSED Estimated Erosion and Proposed CCIR Project Action Road Length (miles) NEZSED Estimated Potential Erosion (tons/year) Percent Of total 68.3 tons CCIR Project Proposed Action Related CCIR Projects 286 22.24 15.75 23.1% Reconstruction - includes culvert replacement Replaced one 5' cmp with 8' bottomless arch; one 4' cmp with 8' bottomless arch, one 3' cmp with 8' bottomless arch, and one 3' cmp with 5' squash pipe (Clear Creek Culvert Replacements Project and Browns Spring Culvert Replacements and Roads 1124 and 1129 Improvement Project). 650 10.41 7.21 10.6% Reconstruction - includes culvert replacement Replaced one 5' cmp with 10' bottomless arch, replaced one 5' cmp with a 12' bottomless arch (Clear Creek Culvert Replacements).

Alternatives, Including the Proposed Action 2.1 Introduction This chapter briefly describes and compares the alternatives that were considered for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project in the FEIS (September 2015). Alternative C has been modified from the 2015 FEIS due to ongoing analysis and technical review. The modifications are presented below. This section also presents the alternatives in comparative form which has been updated with new information where needed, sharply defining the differences between each alternative and providing a clear basis for choice among options by the decision maker and the public. Some of the information used to compare the alternatives is based upon the design of the alternative (i.e., helicopter logging versus the use of skid trails) and some of the information is based upon the environmental, social and economic effects of implementing each alternative (i.e., the amount of erosion caused by helicopter logging versus skidding). Please refer to the FEIS (September 2015) pages 2-1 through 2-23 for a full description of alternatives. 2.2 Alternatives Considered in Detail The FEIS (2015) analyzed a total of four alternatives, including a No Action Alternative. Alternatives A, B, and D remain the same as in the 2015 FEIS and are summarized below. These alternatives are described in greater detail in Chapter 2 of the 2015 FEIS. Alternative C has been modified from the 2015 FEIS due to technical review and ongoing analysis. The Responsible Official decided to apply the modifications to Alternative C as it proposes the most potential disturbance within the project area. The modifications are presented below. The Responsible Official may choose (in whole or in part) to apply the modifications made to Alternative C to any of the other action alternatives in the decision. These activities remain common to all action alternatives: 41 acres of grass restoration, 1,371 acres of prescribed fire, 1,794 acres of precommercial thinning, 119.8 miles of system road reconstruction, 48.8 miles of system road reconditioning, 13.2 miles of system road decommissioning, and two site specific Forest Plan amendments adopting the Region 1 soil standard of 15% for detrimentally disturbed soils, and clarifying the definition of old growth found in Appendix N of the Nez Perce Forest Plan. 2.2.2 Alternative A (No Action) This alternative provides a baseline for comparing the environmental consequences of the other alternatives. Under the No Action alternative, no project activities would be implemented. 2.2.3 Alternative B (Proposed Action, as Modified in Response to Scoping Comments) This alternative was developed in response to the purpose and need for action identified during the pre-NEPA phase of project development. It was presented for public scoping in January 2012. Alternative B would move the project area toward the desired future conditions (DFCs) that were identified for the project during the pre-NEPA phase. In addition to the activities common to all action alternatives, Alternative B proposes 2,609 acres of regeneration harvest, site preparation, and reforestation; 331 acres of improvement harvest; 5,606 acres of commercial thinning; 8.7 miles of temporary road construction on existing templates; and 27.6 miles of new temporary road construction. 2.2.4 Alternative C MODIFIED (Maximal Species Conversion) This alternative would address vegetative restoration needs described in the purpose and need for action but to a greater degree than Alternative B. Alternative C would regenerate as many stands as possible while meeting objectives for other resources. In addition to the activities common to all action alternatives, Alternative C Modified would include 3,577 acres (579 acres less than the original Alternative C) of regeneration harvest, site preparation, and reforestation; 288 acres (43 acres less than the original Alternative C) of improvement harvest; 3,937 acres (283 acres less than the original Alternative C) of commercial thinning; 8.7 miles of temporary road construction on existing templates; and 27.6 miles of new temporary road construction. As part of the additional analysis, areas of potential concern for elk security were identified and include units: 130, 205, 221, 228, 235, 336, 120, 214, 159, and 310, based on layout, topography, large view sheds and screening cover. The following design criteria is added to this alternative: “Units 130, 205, 221, 228, 235, 336, 120, 214, 159, and 310 will be reviewed by the Biologist and timber team during unit layout. Screening cover will be maintained through use of vegetation and topography in order to limit visibility of big game from year round motorized access points.” In response to technical reviews, ongoing analysis, and timbersale layout (proposed), changes to the following units are as follows for Alternative C Modified: Table 3: Modifications to Alternative C Units HUC Name Unit Original NEPA Acres FS Unit Reduction Acresa Regen (R) or Com.

See 2015 FEIS Appendix E-1 for a summary of Specific Soils Design Criteria applied to each unit. 2.2.5 Alternative D (Minimal Road Construction) Alternative D would address the need for vegetative rehabilitation in the Clear Creek watershed but to a lesser degree than Alternative B. Alternative D would use existing road templates as much as possible while still meeting the need for vegetative restoration. In addition to the activities common to all action alternatives, Alternative D would include 2,178 acres of regeneration harvest, site preparation, and reforestation; 211 acres of improvement harvest; 5,141 acres of commercial thinning; 8.7 miles of temporary road construction on existing templates; and 8.8 miles of new temporary road construction. 2.2.6 Design Criteria The design criteria for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project remains the same as described in the FEIS (September 2015). The FEIS is incorporated by reference and a full description of the design criteria may be found on pages 2-5 through 2-13. Additionally, 2015 FEIS Appendix E-1 provides the summary of Specific Soils Design Criteria applied to each unit. The following design criteria is added to Alternative C Modified: Units 130, 205, 221, 228, 235, 336, 120, 214, 159, and 310 will be reviewed by the Biologist and timber team during unit layout. Screening cover will be maintained through use of vegetation and topography in order to limit visibility of big game from year round motorized access points. 2.3 Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study Federal agencies are required by NEPA to rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives and to briefly discuss the reasons for eliminating any alternatives that were not developed in detail (40 CFR 1502.14). Public comments received in response to the Proposed Action provided suggestions for alternative methods for achieving the purpose and need. Some of these alternatives would have modified the proposed action to the point where the purpose and need for action would not be met, would have been duplicative of the alternatives considered in detail, or were determined to be components that would cause unnecessary environmental harm. Therefore, a number of alternatives were considered, but dismissed from detailed consideration for reasons summarized below. See the “Issues” section in Chapter 1 of the FEIS (September 2015) for a more detailed discussion of the alternative-driving issues that were raised during scoping. Alternatives considered but eliminated from detailed study for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project remain the same as described in the FEIS (September 2015). The FEIS is incorporated by reference and a full description of those alternatives may be found on pages 2-14 through 2-18. Briefly, alternatives considered but eliminated from detailed study include: . Old Growth . Watershed Rehabilitation (Road Decommissioning) Only; No Timber Harvest or Prescribed Burning . Prescribed Burning-Only Alternative . No Prescribed Burning . No Temporary Road Construction/Use Existing Roads Only/Helicopter Logging . Do Not use Vegetation Response Unit Desired Future Conditions Developed for this Project . Analyze an Alternative with Opening Sizes 40 Acres or Less 2.4 Comparison of Alternatives This section provides a summary of the effects of implementing each alternative. The FEIS (September, 2015) includes tables 2-7, 2-8, and 2-9. Information in Table 2-8 is focused on comparison of purpose and need by alternative. This table remains the same and can be reviewed on pages 2-19 through 2-20 of the 2015 FEIS. Table 2-7 compares the alternatives by activity (2015 FEIS pages 2-19 to 2-20). This table has been updated with supplemental information. Changes from the original table in the FEIS are shown in bold italics.

The Responsible Official may choose (in whole or in part) to apply these monitoring alternatives to any action alternative. This section replaces the monitoring section in the 2015 FEIS (pg. 2-24). 2.5.1 PACFISH RHCA Monitoring This is an ongoing monitoring effort to assess whether or not RHCAs are effective at preventing or minimizing sediment delivery to streams from timber harvest activities. The units are monitored one year after harvested units are burned to capture the time when soils are most exposed and have the greatest potential to erode. The monitoring entails walking the unit boundary and observing and measuring any sediment that may leave the harvest unit and enter the RHCA. Distances are measured as to how far sediment is visible into the RHCA and whether or not it reaches a stream. The selected units have relatively large amounts of buffer length and are near steelhead critical habitat. Table 6: PACFISH RHCA Monitoring Units Unit # Harvest Type Timber Sale Name (Year of Sale) Subwatershed 109 Regeneration Solo (2024) Clear Creek 214 Commercial Thin Solo (2024) Middle Fork Clear Cr 103 Regeneration Big Cedar (2021) Clear Creek 160 Regeneration Pine Knob (2023) Pine Knob 155 Regeneration Pine Knob (2023) Brown Springs/ Clear Cr 315 Commercial Thin Pine Knob (2023) Brown Springs 145 Regeneration Kay (2020) Kay Cr 141 Regeneration Clear Corral (2022) South Fork Clear Cr 142 Regeneration Clear Corral (2022) South Fork Clear Cr 218 Regeneration Lost Mule (2019) West Fork Clear/Hoodoo Cr  2.5.2 Cross Drain Monitoring Culvert cross drain culvert monitoring would occur on Forest Roads 650 and 286, the two primary routes used for harvest hauling and access activities. The intent of the monitoring is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the cross drains in directing road related sediment away from live stream crossings. Monitoring would include identification of all cross drains on these two roads, measurement of the width and length of any sediment track leading from the cross drain downhill, and whether or not the sediment track reached a live stream. Where delivery was observed, additional measures would be taken to alleviate the delivery. Initial measurements will be collected in 2018 and 2019 and will be repeated on the segments of road where haul is occurring. Measurements would be taken in late spring/early summer in order to determine if drainage improvements are needed prior to fall season rains. The sites are not shown on the map as there are over 180 cross drains on Road 286 and over 150 on Road 650. 2.5.3 Channel Cross Section, Turbidity and Temperature Monitoring (Forest Boundary) One channel cross section would be monitored at the Forest boundary. Monitoring would be conducted to determine if harvest and/or road improvement activities are contributing enough sediment to the stream to cause changes to channel morphology and or degradation of habitat quality for steelhead trout. Other monitoring data collected at these sites would include Wolman pebble counts (stream bed surface substrates), cobble embeddedness, water temperature, and relative fish densities by species. Wolman pebble counts and cobble embeddedness are used to monitor potential changes in substrate composition, particularly sand-sized or smaller fines which can negatively affect the quality of fish spawning and rearing habitat. Initial cross section measurements were taken in 2015 and again in 2016. The site would be monitored 1, 2, and 5 years after project activities commence. Adjustments could be made to the activities if monitoring shows statistically significant changes in stream channel aggradation/degradation, widening of the channel, or increases in substrate fines. If a large natural flow event were to occur during the monitoring period, or unacceptable channel changes were observed at the monitoring sites, a survey of the streams, logging units and roads would be conducted to determine the location of sediment additions. Adjustments may or may not be required to proposed activities depending on this assessment. Project monitoring will help to ensure that BMPs are sufficient at minimizing adverse effects to ESA-listed species. 2.5.4 Substrate Monitoring Associated with Road Haul This monitoring would tentatively select up to 4 sites where main haul routes cross on or upstream of steelhead designated critical habitat (Table 2). The objective is to measure changes in cobble embeddedness and substrate composition (particularly fines <6mm) that may be associated with log haul activities. If negative changes are occurring, actions would be taken to assess the entry location and address the haul or road design criteria if necessary. All sampling sites occur in designated critical habitat in a response reach ranging from 3% to 4% stream gradient. Likely roads would include Road 286, 650 and 1114 as they are in or upstream of steelhead designated critical habitat. Frequency: Once per year in the early summer when hauling occurs on the road. This would allow time for data analysis and resolution of identified problems prior to the fall rains and next hauling season. 2.5.5 GRAIP Inventory of Selected Road Segments This monitoring would tentatively conduct a detailed inventory of selected road segments that were modeled as potentially producing high amounts of sediment based on WEPP:Road model outputs. The inventory would use the full GRAIP inventory method to assess potential sediment delivery points. These would be compared to proposed road improvement activities to assure the necessary actions are planned to minimize sediment delivery to streams. Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences Introduction Chapter 3 summarizes the physical, biological, social, and economic environments of the project area and the potential changes to those environments as a result of implementing the proposed alternatives. It also presents the scientific and analytical basis for comparison of each alternative. The DSEIS incorporates the original FEIS (September 2015) by reference. The following resources are not being carried forward in this DSEIS as the effects analyses have not changed from the original FEIS: Cultural Resources, Noxious Weeds, Rare Plants, Roadless Areas, Soils, Vegetation, and Visuals. For a complete effects analyses of these resources please see the original FEIS, September 2015. This section also summarizes the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative effects to the Affected Environment as a result of implementing the proposed alternatives. Effects may include ecological, aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, social, or health. The potential effects may be beneficial or detrimental, and may result from actions possessing both beneficial and detrimental effects, even if on balance the effect would be beneficial (40 CFR 1508.8). Direct and Indirect Effects NEPA requires that Federal agencies take a “hard look” at significant environmental effects as a result of implementing a proposed action and any alternatives. The “hard look” requirement has been tempered through the “rule of reason”, which the Supreme Court has characterized as requiring an agency “to furnish only such information as appears to be reasonably necessary under the circumstances for evaluation of the project rather than to be so all-encompassing in scope that the task of preparing it would become either fruitless or well-nigh impossible” [New York Natural Resource Defense Council, Inc. v. Kleppe, 429 U.S. 1307, 1311 (1976), citing Natural Resource Defense Council v. Calloway, 524 F2d 79, 88 (2d Circuit 1975)]. Direct effects are the result of an action and occur at the same time and place. Indirect effects are the result of an action but occur later in time or are further removed in distance, yet are still reasonably foreseeable (40CFR 1508.8). In order for an effect to be considered reasonably foreseeable, it must be “sufficiently likely to occur that a person of ordinary prudence would take it into account in reaching a decision” [Sierra Club v. Marsh, 976 F.2d 763, 767 (1st Circuit 1992)]. Cumulative Effects In accordance with NEPA and the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) guidelines, cumulative effects are to be analyzed as a component of any project undergoing a NEPA analysis. Cumulative effects are incremental effects as a result of implementing an action and consist of any past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions on any lands regardless of the agency or person undertaking the action, to include Federal, State, and private. Cumulative effects can be individually minor but collectively significant over a period of time (40 CFR 1508.7). An individual action when considered alone may not have a significant effect, but when its effects are considered in sum with the effects of other actions, the effects may be significant. The time and spatial area for the analysis of cumulative effects is resource dependent. Cumulative effects were assessed for this project in terms of how the alternatives would add to the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future activities. Existing conditions described under each resource section reflect the cumulative effects of past and present activities that have occurred in this area. Each resource section identifies specific past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions with a discernible effect on a particular resource as reflected in the existing condition. 3.1 Aquatics This report provides a variety of new information not displayed in the 2015 FEIS. New baseline aquatic habitat and species information was collected on anadromous fish streams in 2015 and 2016 and summarized here. This additional data resulted in the determination that South Fork and Hoodoo Creek prescription watersheds do not meet their Forest Plan water quality objectives and therefore require an upward trend analysis. Changes to the effects analyses including FISHSED model updates and upward trend for South Fork and Hoodoo are included. Only updated information is presented below. Additional information is disclosed about geology in the project area and NEZSED modelled cumulative sediment generated by roads. For the DSEIS, NEZSED road sediment data was partitioned by prescription watersheds to see which roads were modeled to produce the most sediment. Those results were used in conjunction with additional WEPP Batch Road analysis. Different than NEZSED, the WEPP Data models specific road segments with multiple attributes to predict which road segments are more likely to produce sediment that could be routed to stream systems. Results of the two models were compared and then investigated in the field in August 2018 to assess model predictions on those segments that were expected to produce the most sediment (Roads 286, 1114, 1855, 1106, and 650). Combined modeled and field review data were used to confirm sediment producing road segments already have treatments planned to ensure that sediment resulting from road use would be minimized. Primarily updated information is presented below. 3.1.1 Analysis Area The project area is about 43,700 acres and encompasses the upper two-thirds of the Clear Creek drainage and all of its tributaries. Clear Creek flows into the Middle Fork Clearwater River. This same area is considered the analysis area and was selected because it includes all Forest Service–managed lands—and all the streams therein—that could be affected by project activities. 3.1.2 Regulatory Framework There are no changes to the regulatory framework from the 2015 FEIS. Please refer to the 2015 FEIS pgs. 3-1 through 3-2 for a discussion of the framework. 3.1.3 Analysis Method 3.1.3.1 Stream and Habitat Surveys The 2015 FEIS (pgs. 3-2 through 3-3) discusses in detail the methodology used to assess existing conditions in the project area. Additional stream channel, habitat and fish density information was collected on 27 miles of Forest Service and 4 miles of private streams by Stillwater Sciences in 2015. These surveys updated the baseline for the mainstem of Clear Creek, and portions of the West, South, and Middle Forks of Clear Creek as well as Lost Mule, Pine Knob and Brown Springs Creek. They also established two monitoring sites on the West Fork of Clear Creek and the lower mainstem of Clear Creek at the Forest boundary. The two sites were revisited in 2016 and a report discussing the changes between years was prepared (Stillwater Sciences, 2016). Both reports are available in the project file. Additional road surveys were conducted along two main haul routes (Road 286 and 650) in 2016 in order to locate cross drain culverts in relation to existing stream crossings. Most of the culverts were replaced or added in 2015. Additional drainage work continues under the 2013 Road 286 and Road 650 Reconstruction projects. 3.1.3.2 FISHSED Modeling The Forest Plan requires the use of the NEZSED and FISHSED models when assessing potential effects to sediment in streams at the Forest Plan prescription watershed level. The 2015 FEIS (p. 3-3) provides an overview and the limitations associated with these models. As disclosed in the model documentation (Stowell 1983), the model outputs are reasonable estimates and not absolute numbers of high statistical precision. Results obtained are to be used in combination with sound biological judgment. The models, therefore, are only useful for comparing alternatives and are not designed to predict actual changes in cobble embeddedness (Conroy and Thompson 2011). Updated FISHSED calculations for the resurveyed streams are summarized in the effects section. 3.1.4 Resource Indicators The resource indicators and the reasons for their use are discussed in detail in the FEIS (pgs. 3-3 through 3-4). They are: . RHCA road density . Number of undersized culverts replaced and cross drains added . FISHSED results for modeled changes in cobble embeddedness 3.1.5 Affected Environment 3.1.5.1 Aquatic Habitats Like many watersheds in central Idaho, the Clear Creek watershed has steep valleys with portions of the watershed underlain by the Idaho batholith. Other portions of the middle and upper watershed consist of older and harder belt metasediments that do not erode as easily as granitics. Finally, the lower watershed is overlain by geologically newer basalt flows, the hardest of the 3 rock types (Geology Map, project file). Stream substrates through the drainage vary from sand in the low gradient channels to boulders, rubble and gravel in the remaining channels. Many low gradient channels have relatively high percentages of fines which may be a combination of batholith geologies (35% of the watershed) and past management activities, mostly roads. Granitic geologies tend to have naturally higher amounts of sand and roads contribute fines through surface erosion. The fine substrates typically settle out in lower gradient stream channels and can embed cobbles and gravels and reduce habitat quality for fish. The majority of fish spawning habitat occurs in low gradient stream reaches. The highest quality and quantity of salmon and steelhead spawning substrate was observed in the South Fork Clear Creek above the barrier that was removed in 1990. Lower quality habitat was noted below the barrier and in the mainstem of Clear Creek. Overhead cover and wood was noted as limited in the South Fork, lower Middle Fork, and mainstems of Clear Creek. We hypothesize wood and sediment conditions in the lower elevation portions of these prescription watersheds are mostly naturally occurring levels and are an outcome of past wildfires and geology. Similar conditions have been noted in stream reaches that have not been influenced by management as well as in stream reaches that have been (Stillwater, 2015). Stream surveys conducted on private lands in lower Clear Creek indicated high levels of sediment and higher-than-preferred stream temperatures (NPT 1987). Sediment levels and temperatures were lower on NFS lands (NPT 1984). Recent surveys (2015) showed lower cobble embeddedness levels on the surveyed private lands compared to NFS lands; however the data between the two surveys is not comparable as the same survey method protocols were not used. Temperatures remain higher on private lands due to the natural warming that occurs from the headwaters toward the mouth of a drainage as well as less canopy cover over the mainstem stream (Stillwater Sciences, 2015). Shallow water depths and lack of pool habitat were noted as issues affecting fish production in the middle and upper reaches of Clear Creek. Surveys conducted in 1993 and 2015 also noted the same sediment, wood, and pool limitations. The low number of pools is directly related to low wood levels. This is because wood is the primary creator of pool habitats in these stream types. Low wood levels are mostly a result of a large wildfire that burned the area in 1931. Stream bank stability was noted as good to excellent throughout the drainage due to the presence of dense streamside vegetation and large substrate (cobble, rubble, boulders) which armor the banks against the erosive power of the streams. Bank stability remained in good to excellent condition based on 2010-2012 field observations and 2015 habitat surveys. Stream Temperatures General information on stream temperature including what processes affect it and the conditions on private lands related to it can be found in the 2015 FEIS, pgs. 3-5 through 3-8. Water temperature is an important factor in the successful reproduction of fish and other aquatic organisms. Some species prefer very cold temperatures and others more moderate temperatures. Streamside riparian vegetation provides the greatest protection against changes in water temperature primarily through shading (Sugden et al 2012; Sridhar et al, 2004; Lee, et al 2004; Ott et al 2005; FEMAT, 1993). Water temperature criteria designed to maintain cooler temperatures is provided through both the state of Idaho as well as federal regulations. Optimal stream temperatures for juvenile chinook salmon and steelhead trout rearing is 14–19 °C (US EPA 2003). Lethal temperatures for juveniles occur if they constantly exceed 21–23 °C for 1 week or longer. Optimal stream temperatures for juvenile bull trout rearing is 9-14°C (IDEQ, 2003; Rieman et al, 2007) which is considerably colder than for other salmonids. Stream temperatures were monitored throughout Clear Creek and its tributaries between 1991 and 2016. The year and number of times monitored varied by stream (Table 7). The warmest years on record varied by stream as a result of local and annual weather patterns. Streams on Forest Service managed lands stayed below or at 19 °C maximum temperatures for all sites in all measured years with the exception of Clear Creek at the Forest boundary in 2015 (Table 7). All streams measured had maximum stream temperatures that were within the optimal range for salmon and steelhead juvenile rearing as noted by EPA. No streams exceeded lethal temperatures for juveniles. Streams rarely met optimal requirements for juvenile bull trout rearing during the summer months. IDEQ (2014) reported no water quality limited streams within the drainage. Table 7: Maximum Stream Temperatures Measured Throughout the Clear Creek Drainage on Forest Service Managed Lands Stream Maximum Temperature Range (°C) Number of Years Monitored Between 1991 and 2016 Warmest Year Recorded Clear Creek at FS Boundary 15–20 1991, 1993, 2006, 2015, 2016 2015 Clear Creek at Pine Knob 15–19 1995, 2011, 2015 2015 Hoodoo Creek 15–17 1991, 1992, 1995-1998- 2001, 2011 1998 WF Clear Creek 15–18 1991, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016 2015 SF Clear Creek at mouth 19 1991 1991 SF Clear Creek above Kay 14–19 1991-1994, 1996-1998, 2001 1992 Kay Creek 15–17 1991, 1992, 1994, 1997-1999 1998 MF Clear Creek above Solo Creek 14–17 1994, 1995, 2011, 2015 1994 Solo Creek 14–17 2011, 2012 2011 Pine Knob Creek 16–17 2011, 2015 2015 Browns Spring Creek 16-17 2011, 2015 2012 Stream temperatures are likely to increase as a result of climate change which in turn may affect native fish distribution. Issak et al (2016). NorWeST temperature data shows historic temperatures in the mainstem of Clear Creek from 14-16 °C above Big Cedar Creek and 12-14°C in lower West, South, and Middle Forks. Climate change modeling to 2040 based on this data shows a 1-2 degree increase from in the mainstem from Big Cedar to just above the South Fork. The same increase is shown in the lower portions of its tributaries. By 2080, the model indicates another two degree rise in all streams. Modeled temperature at the Forest boundary is 17°C in 2080 and all tributaries above it range from 12 to 16°C.The higher the elevation of the stream, the cooler the temperature. While stream temperatures are expected to warm under climate change, modeled temperatures remain within optimum ranges for steelhead and salmon rearing on Forest managed lands in this project area out to 2080. The Clear Creek Watershed will become increasingly important as a refugia for listed steelhead in future decades. Aquatic Species A discussion of the fish species found in the project area, including ESA listed and Region 1 sensitive species, can be found in the 2015 FEIS, pgs. 3-8 through 3-10. Additional surveys were conducted by Stillwater Sciences in 2015 with the resulting information described below. The number of miles of fish bearing streams did not change as a result of the surveys. There are 65 miles of fish bearing and about 185 miles of non-fish bearing streams on Forest managed lands in Clear Creek. The surveys updated the amount of current fish use by prescription watershed. Adult Chinook salmon were found in the mainstem of Clear Creek to just above its confluence with the Middle Fork of Clear Creek. Juveniles were found 1 mile below the confluence. Densities on Forest lands were highest near the boundary (28 fish /100m) and lowest near Middle Fork Clear Creek (11/100m). Both adults and juveniles were found in the lower 1.5 miles of South Fork Clear Creek in low densities (7 and 2 fish /100m, respectively). A few juveniles were observed in the very lowest reaches of West Fork Clear Creek. Overall, the highest densities (185 fish /100m) were found on private lands. This is likely a result of low stream gradient and large stream size, a requirement for this large bodied species. The area was also characterized by large amounts of suitable spawning substrate, low cobble embeddedness, and the presence of side channels which are important for juvenile. Coho salmon juveniles were only observed below the Forest boundary in relatively high densities (range 53 to 250 fish/100m), indicating successful spawning in the mainstem. Steelhead/rainbow trout were the most widely distributed species in Clear Creek and were found in most major tributaries. The highest densities were observed throughout the length of the mainstem of Clear Creek to just above Browns Creek (200 fish/100m). Lower densities were observed in Pine Knob, South Fork Clear, Middle Fork and Brown Springs Creeks (120, 110, 80, and 70 fish/100m, respectively). Densities in Hoodoo and the upper reaches of Clear Creek were lower (40 and 20 fish/100m, respectively) likely as a result of smaller stream size combined with steeper stream gradients. Westslope cutthroat trout were found in the upper reaches of most tributaries and were patchily distributed in very low densities in the Clear Creek mainstem below Brown Springs. They were not found in the mainstem below Middle Fork Clear Creek. This observation is consistent with those in other streams on the Forest where cutthroat rarely overlap with salmon distribution and only have minor overlaps with steelhead. This is because cutthroat are smaller sized fish, require smaller sized spawning substrate and therefore can utilize smaller streams than the larger anadromous species. Densities of cutthroat were highest in Brown Springs and upper Clear Creek (100 and 60 fish/100m, respectively) and lowest in the West Fork (10 fish/100m). None were observed in the South Fork, Pine Knob or on private lands. The Stillwater Report also noted extensive western pearlshell beds on private lands and on Forest lands on the mainstem downstream of South Fork Clear Creek. 3.1.5.2 Water Quality Objectives and the Forest Plan The Forest Plan contains water quality objectives for streams in the project area (USDA Forest Service 1987a, Appendix A). These objectives are assessed using the DFC Analysis developed by Espinosa (1992) and are based on cobble embeddedness levels as directed by the Forest Plan Appendix A Guidance document (USDA 2011). Specifically, the guidance document states the following: “Of the basinwide stream survey data collected over the years, the habitat components that appear to be the most repeatable and most reliably differentiate between reference and managed watersheds are measures or estimates of substrate condition, including cobble embeddedness and percent surface fines. In addition, fish/water quality objectives in Appendix A were originally established based on substrate sediment only (Stowell 1986). …The portion of the DFC analysis that provides objectives for cobble embeddedness and percent fines by depth would be retained. Collection of measured substrate data, combined with existing legacy data and current PIBO data, where available, would be used to describe the existing condition. Substrate data would be the primary determinant in assessing whether Appendix A fish/water quality objectives are met.” Appendix A states that an upward trend (improvement) is required for streams that do not currently meet the water quality objectives. Timber management can occur in watersheds not currently meeting their water quality objectives concurrent with improvement efforts as long as a positive, upward trend in habitat carrying capacity is indicated. The Forest Plan provides no timeframe for when objectives must be met. Cobble embeddedness (CE) is one measurement considered in the upward trend analysis. High cobble embeddedness can smother salmonid eggs and can reduce hiding space for young trout and salmon. Embeddedness can also reduce aquatic insect production which provides food for fish. The long-term trend in embedded cobbles is difficult to ascertain as they are based on weather events large enough to mobilize embedded stream materials, how cobbles interact with the sand that embeds them, and how the streambed interacts with streamflow and stream channel characteristics (Wohl et al, 2015). In addition to challenges predicting when embedded streambeds mobilize and reorganize to more beneficial conditions, the measurement itself has some challenges. Peer reviewed literature since this methodology was created in the 1980’s has identified some limitations. Sylte and Fishenich (2002) reviewed available embeddedness methods and found that not only were there slight differences in descriptions of how to complete data collection, but also that these differences could lead to differences in results. In some instances where embeddedness actually increases over time, one study reported lower values of embeddedness than were actually occurring because substrates accounted for in earlier measurements were completely buried and no longer accounted for. A comprehensive study by McHugh and Budy (2005) also highlights differences in results that correspond to probable methodology inconsistencies and the need for additional quantitative evaluation of methodology. Observer variability can also result in measurement differences (Roper et. al. 2002). Slight changes in location of the measurement could also provide different results, as could stochastic events. While the results can be variable, the embeddedness measures were instrumental in identifying the sediment being generated and deposited in streams by aggressive road building and harvest when they were first used in the 1980s. Considering the requirement to use CE measures and the challenges with using them to predict improving stream conditions, Wolman pebble counts have also been collected to help describe surface bedload conditions. All subwatersheds, with the exception of Middle Fork Clear Creek, had lower percent of fines than the 22% “good” benchmark in Oregon for the Columbia Plateau, Northern Basin Range, and Snake River Plains (Stillwater, 2015). However, at some stream sites, embeddedness conditions are still considered unfavorable for salmon and trout and appear to be recovering slowly or not at all. At the same time, many roads in sediment generating locations have either been obliterated, stored, or reconstructed to reduce the sediment they can produce. Since the late 1990’s, harvest units leave trees and undisturbed ground cover next to all identifiable streams, and roads are not built along stream-courses. These changes are expected to reduce management related sediment and protect riparian and aquatic habitat function over the long term. The 2015 FEIS showed that Brown Springs, Solo, Hoodoo, Kay, and South Fork Clear Creek prescription watersheds met their objectives. More recent data collected by Stillwater Sciences shows that Pine Knob now meets its objective (Table 8). Hoodoo (West Fork) and South Fork now do not meet their objectives. The Hoodoo data is likely a result of different sampling locations in 2012 and 2015/2016. No new data was collected for Solo and Kay therefore they remain the same as shown in the 2015 FEIS (they meet Forest Plan objectives). Table 8: Updated Water Quality Objectives for Prescription Watersheds in the Clear Creek Project Area  Forest Plan Prescription Watershed Forest Plan Water Quality Objective Fishery Habitat Potential 1987 Percent Cobble Embeddedness (year)a Fishery Habitat Potentialb Water Quality Objective Met? Pine Knob Creek 80% 50% 30% (2015) 44% (2012) 82%  Yes Browns Spring Creek 80% 50% 30% (2015) 30% (2012) 82% Yes Clear Creek 90% 50% 67% (2016) 38% (2012) 40% No Middle Fork Clear Creek 90% 50% 32% (2015) 51% (2014) 55% (1993)  81%  No South Fork Clear Creek 80% 50% 47% (2014) 65% No Hoodoo (West Fork) Creek 70% 50% 71% (2016) 37% No A comparison of recent data shows that Pine Knob and Brown Springs are meeting and Middle Fork Clear Creek is close to meeting their objectives. Steelhead trout density data indicates Pine Knob has higher steelhead densities than Brown Springs or Middle Fork but all three streams have lower densities when compared to the mainstem of Clear Creek. The mainstem has the highest densities yet is far from meeting its objective based on embeddedness alone. The difference may be explained by the tributaries’ smaller stream sizes and higher gradients which result in lesser amounts of suitable spawning and rearing habitat when compared with the mainstem. The South Fork and Hoodoo do not meet their objectives based on embeddedness. Steelhead densities in the South Fork are similar to Pine Knob (105 fish/100m) and are lowest in Hoodoo (40/100m), the lowest of all watersheds surveyed. This is likely due in part to small stream size, higher gradients and complete upstream migration barriers in the drainage. In general, cobble embeddedness may only be a partial limiting factor for steelhead trout in project area streams. Stream size, granitic geologies that typically have a higher component of fine particles and erosion rates, habitat availability and access also play a role. Although the four prescription watersheds do not meet their Forest Plan water quality objectives, IDEQ (2014) has determined that they do meet their beneficial uses as discussed in the 2015 FEIS, pg.3-11. It is worth noting that even streams in roadless and wilderness areas often do not meet their DFCs (IDEQ 1999; various stream habitat surveys from the Clearwater NF) due to natural processes and the fact that streams systems are not static. 3.1.5.3 Management Activities Affecting Streams PACFISH was designed to halt degradation and begin recovery of streams where listed fish species occur in the Columbia River drainage. It accomplishes this through streamside RHCA retention and other guidance for management activities within RHCAs. RHCA widths are 300 feet on each side of a fish-bearing stream, 150 feet on perennial non-fish-bearing streams, and 100 feet on intermittent stream channels. A minimum of 10,700 acres (24%) of the analysis area are within PACFISH buffers. Timber Harvest About 22% of Forest lands had regeneration harvest and all but 15 miles (8%) of non-fish bearing and/or intermittent streams adjacent to harvest units were buffered. All fish bearing streams were buffered. As a result of minimal harvest and buffering, fifty-seven percent of forested stands within RHCAs are older than 100 years, 34% are 40-100 years old and the remaining 9% are less than 40 years. (Figure 3-1, FEIS p. 3-13). Successional stage information combined with field reviews of the streams from 2010-2012 indicates that RHCAs are well vegetated and only minimally affected by timber harvest activities. Stream temperature increases as a result of current timber harvest practices on federal lands are not expected. Several studies have shown that stream temperatures are protected by retaining buffers of <150’ (Sweeney and Newbold, 2014; NCASI, 2000; Anderson and Poage, 2014; Ott et al 2005; Lee et al 2004; Sridhar 2004; FEMAT 1993). Buffers have been retained for over 50 years and 94% of streamside areas were not harvested, therefore management activities have not likely influenced stream temperatures. All fish bearing streams were buffered. Several studies also found that buffers of this width are sufficient at minimizing or eliminating sediment delivery to streams from timber harvest (Hatten et al, 2018; Cristan et al, 2016; Sweeney and Newbold, 2014). Roads Roads near streams are the primary land management–related activity that may affect stream conditions in the project area as described in detail in the 2015 FEIS, pgs. 3-12 through 3-15. Roads within riparian zones confine channels which can affect sediment, wood and stream flow movement. Undersized culverts can plug with material and fail during high flow events leading to unwanted sediment pulses in streams. Riparian roads can reduce stream shading and disrupt large woody material recruitment through tree removal. Ditchlines that drain roads can direct flow and road surface sediment into perennial streams at crossings. These can be a chronic (ongoing) source of sediment and can increase water yield in streams. These conditions currently exist on many project area roads. Management and road building in the Clear Creek watershed, especially from the late 1950’s to the 1980’s likely delivered substantial amounts of sediment that may still moving through lower gradient stream reaches to this day (Espinosa, 1997; Stillwater 2015). Shortly before the Espinosa article was published, the PACFISH decision of 1995 halted much of the aggressive harvest and road building on projects that could affect anadromous fish. While some harvest has continued since that time, RHCA’s implemented under that decision stopped harvest next to streams unless it could be proven it was needed to improve riparian function. While it could be considered appropriate in some locations today (Reeves et al, 2016), harvest has not been conducted in project area RHCA’s since PACFISH was implemented. Also since the Espinosa (1997) article was published, the US Forest Service passed a temporary road building moratorium (2000-2001), the Roadless Rule (2001), the Idaho Roadless Rule (2008), and the Access and Travel Management Rule (2005). Combined, these rule makings greatly restricted permanent road building and have led to management that has removed unneeded and potentially harmful road segments. A total of 10 miles of system and 73 miles of non-system roads have been decommissioned in the project area since 2012 and another 65 miles of non-system roads are NEPA cleared for decommissioning. Sediment reduction and maintenance have been the focus of treatments on the remaining roads needed for access. There have been 9 live water culvert replacements and 17.8 miles of road reconstruction including replacement of at least 38 cross drain culvert replacements since 2010. The project has identified additional road segments for treatment that are likely to cause sedimentation. No new information regarding roads has been collected since the 2015 FEIS with the exception of a 2016 cross drain location survey on the project areas’ two main log haul routes. It was conducted in order to assess the Road 650 and Road 286 cross drain culvert projects that were implemented 2014 and 2015. All cross drains were observed and an assessment was conducted to determine if additional cross drains were needed to improve drainage near streams. A total of 152 drains were inventoried on Road 650 and 187 drains on Road 286. A total of only 8 sites were located where additional cross drains are needed on these roads. These would be installed prior to project log haul activities. 3.1.5.4 Upward Trend Determination Appendix A of the Forest Plan states that where streams do not meet their water quality objectives, timber management can occur concurrent with improvement efforts as long as a positive, upward trend in habitat carrying capacity is indicated. The 2015 FEIS, pgs. 3-16 through 3-23 describes the upward trend analysis process and provides the summarized upward trend discussions for the mainstem and Middle Fork Clear Creek prescription watersheds. A more complete upward trend for these streams is provided in Appendix J of the 2015 FEIS. The following provides the summarized upward trend analyses for the South Fork Clear and Hooodoo prescription watersheds. The more complete analyses can be found in Appendix J of this DSEIS. 3.1.5.4.1 South Fork Clear Creek Prescription Watershed The 12,940 acre South Fork Clear Creek Forest Plan prescription watershed does not meet its water quality objective of 80% for fishery habitat potential. Cobble embeddedness was measured at 47% in 2014. When assessed against the DFCs (USDA 1992), the watershed currently is at 65% of habitat potential. It was at 50% of its habitat potential when the Forest Plan was written in 1987. This is considered an upward trend based on fishery habitat potential. There are about 12 miles of fish-bearing and a minimum of 20 miles of non-fish bearing streams in South Fork Clear Creek. Chinook adults and juveniles were found in the lower 1.5 miles (Stillwater Sciences, 2015) in low densities (1.6 and 7 fish /100m, respectively). Steelhead/rainbow were found in the lower 6 miles (220 fish/100m) and cutthroat were not observed; however, they have been documented in past surveys and are likely to occur in the upper half of the drainage. Surveys in 2015 estimated the amount of anadromous and resident fish spawning habitat in the lower 5 miles of South Fork Clear Creek. Anadromous habitat was rated good to fair in quality but limited in quantity compared to the lower mainstem of Clear Creek (75m2/km vs. 580 m2/km). Resident spawning habitat was also rated as good to fair with roughly 25m2/km in the surveyed reaches. Spawning is limited both as a result of dominant substrates that are too large for spawning (>6” diameter) and high cobble embeddedness which may be due in part to batholith geologies. About a third of the watershed is underlain by these more erosive geologies. Although the amount of spawning habitat for both anadromous and resident fish is limited, fish densities indicate the availability of suitable spawning habitat. The larger dominant substrates provide for an abundance of rearing habitat as the surveyed reaches are higher gradient channels where there is less likelihood of sediment filling the interstitial spaces between the rocks. Stream temperatures were measured at the mouth of South Fork Creek in 1991. Daily average temperatures were 13°C, or High (<14°C) for steelhead spawning and Low (>17.8°C) for summer steelhead rearing (18°C) based the NOAA Matrix table. Wildfires in 1870 and 1931 burned 7,085 acres and consumed most of the streamside vegetation which has created RHCAs currently dominated by trees that are about 80 years old. It is possible that they have not yet reached their full stream shading and cooling potential. Stream temperatures were also measured where the South Fork meets Kay Creek for 9 years (1991-1998, 2001). Stream temperature conditions based on 2001 data showed NOAA Matrix ratings as Moderate (14-15.5°C) for steelhead spawning and High (<14°C) for rearing (14.3°C and 12.5°C respectively). They were Moderate )<15°C) for bull trout rearing (12.5°C) and Low (>10°C) for bull trout spawning/incubation (10.1°C). Stream temperatures in South Fork Creek appear to be adequate for chinook, steelhead and cutthroat production and low for bull trout. Riffle and pool habitats made up 70% and 30% of stream habitats in 2015, respectively. Shallow water depths and lack of pool habitat were noted in the surveys. The low numbers are directly related to low wood levels (9 pieces/100m). Wood is the primary creator of pool habitats in this stream type. Low wood levels are naturally occurring as there has been no harvest adjacent to the surveyed streams. All lay within the Clear Creek Roadless Area. The low wood levels are due to the wildfires in 1870 and 1931 which consumed most of the riparian vegetation. Trees have reestablished themselves and are now about 80 years old. Timber harvest in the upper South Fork upstream from the surveyed reaches mostly retained streamside buffers. The presence of forested stands along all streams provides for both short and long term upward trends in water depths and pool habitat. Stream bank stability was noted as good to excellent in both the1988 and 2015 surveys. This is due to the presence of dense streamside vegetation in combination with large substrate (cobble, rubble, boulders) which armors the banks against the erosive power of the stream. This trend has been maintained over time and would continue. Stream substrate composition in South Fork Clear Creek in 2015 was dominated by boulders and rubble (68%), followed by gravel (18%), sand (12%) and bedrock (3%). Surveys in 1988 showed dominance by large rubble, boulders, and bedrock. Cobble embeddedness was 47% in 2016 and 51% in 1988 indicating a likely positive upward trend. Because the same sampling protocols were not used, the data is not directly comparable; however given the low road densities and no evidence of recent landslides, the assumption of an upward trend is reasonable. A review of roads between 2010 and 2012 found no major sediment issues associated with roads that might affect fine sediment levels in the drainage. Regeneration timber harvest activities have occurred on 13% of the watershed between the 1930’s and 1990’s. No regeneration harvest has occurred since then. ECA is currently at 1% as a result of minimal harvest. Streamside buffers of 100’+ were retained on all but 3.3 miles of non-fish bearing or intermittent streams. Forested stands within RHCAs are aged as follows: 5% are < 40 years old, 54% are between 40 and 100 years and the remaining 41% older than 100 years. The RHCAs are considered fully functional given the age classes and minimal disturbance within them. As a result, they are trending in an upward condition and would continue to provide for shade, wood, and bank stability in the South Fork of Clear Creek. There are almost 32 miles of Forest system roads within the watershed with less than 4 miles occurring within RHCAs. The overall watershed road density is 1.6 mi/mi2 and the RHCA road density is 1 mi/mi2. A total of 1.5 miles of the RHCA roads are opened to motorized traffic and the remaining are closed. About 20 miles are gravel surfaced and many of the remainder were topped with grasses/mosses and had small trees growing along their margins. There were no obvious signs of road surface erosion (no rilling or gullying) during culvert inventories from 2010 to 2012. A total of 2 miles of system road and 26 miles of non-system road have been decommissioned since 2012. This is a 6% reduction in system road densities. Road treatments included abandonment near ridgetops to full recontouring on midslope roads or roads with stream crossings. Roads with stream crossings were recountoured and roads without them were either recontoured or abandoned depending on their location. Decommissioning results in short term sediment increases at stream crossing removal sites but removes the risk of future crossing failure. Decommissioning is expected to contribute to the long term reduction of sediment delivery to streams. There are 45 stream crossings within the watershed with none occurring on fish bearing streams. Nineteen of the crossings were identified as needing cross drain additions and 13 need to be replaced as they are undersized. Ditchlines in the drainage were well vegetated which help to filter out sediment to streams. There are no human caused barriers to upstream aquatic organism migration in the watershed. In summary, Forest Plan Appendix A Guidance (USDA, 2011) states that “…In previously degraded watersheds, especially those identified as below objective in 1987, if there have been no entries or natural disturbances over the past 10 to 20 years, it could be assumed that trend is either static or improving.” It also states that “It was assumed in the Forest Plan that implementation of instream restoration and other watershed restoration activities would result in an upward trend in carrying capacity. Where these activities have been implemented, it could be stated that an upward trend in the habitat conditions has been accomplished”. It has been 22 years since any timber harvest has occurred in the drainage. When combined with well vegetated riparian areas, relatively few stream crossings, past road decommissioning projects, mostly closed roads and no obvious sources of sediment, an upward trend in fish habitat capacity is indicated in the South Fork Clear Creek. 3.1.5.4.2 Hoodoo (West Fork Clear) Creek Prescription Watershed The 6,450 acre Hoodoo Creek Forest Plan prescription watershed, which includes West Fork Clear Creek, does not meet its water quality objective of 70% for fishery habitat potential. Cobble embeddedness was measured at 71% in 2016. When assessed against the DFCs (USDA, 1992), the watershed currently is at 37% of habitat potential. Sediment is likely one of the contributing limiting factors for fish production in this prescription watershed. However, as discussed in the Appendix A Guidance and 2015 FEIS, upward trend is not determined by cobble embeddedness alone (USDA, 2011). There are about 5 miles of fish-bearing and 20 miles of non-fish bearing streams in the drainage. Fish densities are low due to steeper gradients and larger than preferred spawning substrate. No Chinook salmon were observed in 2015; however 4 juveniles /100m were observed in 2016. Steelhead/rainbow were the most common species found and numbers observed were low at 40 fish/100m, respectively. Westslope cutthroat trout were observed in low densities in 2015 (17 fish/100m). Surveys in 2015 estimated the amount of anadromous and resident fish spawning habitat in West Fork Clear Creek. Anadromous habitat was rated as fair in quality and low in quantity (25m2/km). Resident spawning habitat was rated as good to fair with only 13m2/km in the surveyed reaches. The amount of spawning habitat for both anadromous and resident fish is likely to remain limited. This is due to steeper stream gradients which limits spawning habitat availability, the dominant substrate size which is too large for spawning, and high cobble embeddedness in the few low gradient reaches. High sediment and embeddedness levels may be due in part to the underlying batholith geology which underlies 69% of the watershed. Stream temperatures were measured in West Fork Clear Creek in various years (1991, 1992, 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2016). Stream temperature conditions based on NOAA matrix ratings were moderate for steelhead spawning and rearing (15°C and 17°C, respectively). Temperatures were low for bull trout spawning and moderate for bull trout rearing (14°C and 15°C, respectively). Summer water temperatures are considered to be warmer than preferred for bull trout. Stream bank stability was noted as good to excellent in both the 2015 and 1988 surveys as well as during field reviews between 2010 and 2012. This is due to the presence of dense streamside vegetation in combination with large substrate (cobble, rubble, boulders) which armors the banks against the erosive power of the stream. Stream substrate composition in West Fork Clear Creek in 2015 was composed of 22% fine material (sand/silt <6mm), 26% gravel and 52% large material (rubble to boulders). Cobble embeddedness, which cannot be directly correlated to the percent of fine substrates, was 71% in 2016 and 33% in 2012 (FEIS, pg. 3-11). The data between the two years, however, is not comparable as 2016 sampling occurred near the mouth of the stream and 2012 sampling occurred 1.8 miles upstream near the confluence of Hoodoo and West Fork Clear Creeks. Instream sediment in the Hoodoo prescription watershed is likely associated with roads. Two road related slides on Road 650 were observed between 2011 and 2017. Repairs were conducted on the slide closest to the Forest boundary in 2012 and repairs are planned for the upper slide in 2018. Both slides delivered unknown quantities of sediment to the stream. While it would be desirable to remove these segments of road from an aquatics perspective, travel management considerations identified the road as essential for providing for management and public access. Overall, sediment levels are very high in the watershed based on limited sampling. However as noted by Sylte and Fischenich (2002), cobble embeddedness exhibits high spatial and temporal variability in both natural and disturbed streams. Sampling must be intensive within streams or stream reaches to detect changes. Intensive sampling has not occurred and surveys were not conducted in the same location between years. Determining a trend for embeddedness is therefore not possible given the lack of available data. Additionally, extensive road decommissioning, has been implemented since 2012 and may also be contributing, in part, to higher levels in the short term. Riffle and pool habitats made up 65% and 35% of stream habitats in 2015, respectively. While the overall percent of pools was somewhat low, the frequency of those pools were the highest noted in the surveyed watersheds. This is due to relatively high frequencies of large wood present in the stream and the well forested stands along its length. Regeneration timber harvest activities have occurred on 34% of the watershed between the 1950s and 1996. No harvest has occurred since then. Streamside buffers of 50’or larger were retained on all but 4 miles (13%) of non-fish bearing or intermittent streams beginning in the 1970s. Harvest retained buffers of 100-400’ on all fish bearing streams. ECA is currently at 4%, or a high condition. Forested stands within RHCAs are aged as follows: 10% are < 40 years old, 50% are between 40 and 100 years and the remaining 40% older than 100 years. The middle age classes are partly a result of a wildfire which occurred in 1931. The fire burned 27% of the drainage and 43% of the RHCAs. The RHCAs would therefore be considered mostly functional given the large percentage of older age classes and minimal human related disturbance within them. As a result, they are trending in an upward condition and would continue to provide for shade, wood, and stable banks in the West Fork Clear Creek drainage. There are 32 miles of Forest system roads within the watershed with 5 miles occurring within RHCAs. A total of 2 miles of the RHCA roads are opened to motorized traffic and the remaining roads are closed. The overall watershed road density is 3.8 mi/mi2. The RHCA and landslide prone road densities are 2.3 mi/mi2 and 0.2 mi/mi2, respectively. A total of 10 miles of system road and 36 miles of non-system road have been decommissioned since 2012. There has been a 20% reduction in system roads since 1995 as a result of the decommissioning. The 36 miles of non-system roads do not contribute to road density calculations but their removal has contributed to the reduction of the potential sediment effects to streams. Improving trends in instream sediment are expected over time as a result. There are 41 stream crossings within the watershed, one of which occurs on fish bearing streams. It was replaced in 2012 and is no longer a barrier to upstream passage. A total of 30 culverts are appropriately sized and the remaining 11 crossings are undersized for the area they drain. All roads cross perpendicular to the stream channels limiting their effects to riparian vegetation; however portions of the ditchlines drain directly into the streams. These 6 sites may be acting as a chronic sediment source of sediment to streams. Ditchlines leading to the 1 fish bearing crossings currently have cross drain pipes installed and are no longer adding sediment to streams at those sites. In summary, it has been 22 years since timber harvest occurred in the Hoodoo (West Fork) Clear Creek prescription watershed. RHCAs are intact and in a state to provide for long term streambank stability, shade and large wood. As a result, they will contribute to long term aquatic habitat maintenance and improvement. Recent road decommissioning, live water culvert replacements, and cross drain culvert replacements have been implemented in order to reduce road related sediment delivery to streams. Also, the majority of roads are closed to motorized use which limits degradation of the road surface and potential sediment delivery to streams. When compared to past watershed conditions, these activities are expected to have initiated an upward trend in fish habitat capacity in this prescription watershed 3.1.5.3 General Long –term Trends in Sediment Long term steelhead spawning gravel monitoring data elsewhere on the Forest suggests overall downward trends in instream sediment. Monitoring was conducted in Pete King and Deadman Creeks, tributaries to the nearby Lochsa River, and was designed to assess the effects of road decommissioning on instream sediment levels. Sediment coring data techniques were used to assess the percent of fine sediment in spawning gravels. Pete King Creek was the study’s treatment area where 55 miles of road decommissioning occurred and Deadman was the control drainage. No decommissioning and relatively few roads occur in Deadman. Past timber harvest occurred in both drainages. Figures 2 and 3 display variable levels of fine sediment with overall decreasing trends in both the treated and untreated systems.  Black line denotes Forest Plan desired conditions (22 – 24%) – the long term average was 35% Comparison of Average Percent Fines (<6.5mm) for Years 1985 to 2006 and 2014 at Permanent Substrate (coring) Monitoring Sites in Pete King Creek within the Lochsa River Drainage.

No data was collected in 2001. The observed sediment decreases are hypothesized to be a result of improved timber harvest practices which include the application of Best Management Practices and PACFISH, the reduction in overall timber harvest and new road construction, and road decommissioning (Jones, 2001). In summary, we believe these practices are at least partially responsible for the observed declining trends in fine sediment. 3.1.6 Environmental Consequences 3.1.3.1 Direct and Indirect Effects The analysis area for the direct and indirect effects of the alternatives is the project area as discussed in the 2015 FEIS, pg. 3-1. Alternative A – No Action No logging or road-related activities designed to reduce sediment to streams would occur under this alternative. Any watershed improvement activities would require additional NEPA analysis prior to implementation. The effects of the No Action are discussed in the 2015 FEIS, pgs. 3-25 and 3-26. In addition, this alternative would increase the risk of wildfire within the Clear Creek drainage which could result in sediment inputs to streams as well as riparian vegetation loss. These effects were observed after recent wildfires in the adjacent Lower Selway River drainage. The 11,300 acre Johnson Bar Fire occurred in 2014, the 10,200 acre Slide and 34,300 acre Wash Fires occurred in 2015. The fires were a result of continued surface fuel buildups due to increased insect and disease activity, weather conditions conducive to fire starts, and past fire suppression. The 4,800 acre Baldy Fire, also in 2015, partially burned into the upper South Fork of Clear Creek leaving 500 acres in headwater areas with 100% tree mortality. Within the Johnson Bar Fire area, a total of five large fire-related landslides occurred, three in Swiftwater Creek in 2017 and two in Goddard Creek in 2018. An estimated 230 tons of material was delivered to Swiftwater Creek. Field reviews showed stream channel downcutting, a reduction in instream wood levels below the slides, loss of pool habitats and an increase in substrate size which reduced the availability of suitable spawning (USDA, 2017). Positive effects included a 5-10% reduction in cobble embeddedness in Swiftwater Creek as a result of fine sediments being flushed out of the system. Gravel suitably sized for spawning was added to the system via the slides. Large amounts of wood were also delivered to the stream; however most currently does not contribute to fish habitat since it deposited on high floodplain areas away from the stream channel. It will likely take decades and many high flow events to move this wood into areas where it can interact with the stream and directly contribute to aquatic habitat. Riparian area tree mortality caused by the fires exceeded 70% in many tributaries to Swiftwater, Goddard and Meadow Creeks. This may lead to stream temperature increases; however, a retrospective fire study in the Boise River basin (Dunham et al 2007) showed that while stream temperatures may remain elevated for at least a decade following wildfire, native aquatic invertebrates (rainbow trout and tailed frogs) were resilient to those increases. Summer temperatures ranged between 11 and 26oC in the study. The upper end of the range is well above measured temperatures in Clear Creek. Clear Creek forests have evolved with fire; however land management has replaced fire as the primary disturbance on the landscape since the 1930s and fire has been excluded in order to protect the timber resource. Dense tree planting after harvest has led to stands with full touching canopies and low hanging branches (i.e. ladder fuels) that provide avenues for crown fires. Older, unharvested stands are succumbing to increased insect and disease activity leading to abundant down wood and subsequent increased surface fuels. The combination of ladder and surface fuels is similar to those found in the Lower Selway area prior to 2014 and 2015. With the right weather conditions, fires will occur in Clear Creek. Under this alternative, no harvest would occur. This would lead to continued increases ladder and surface fuels across the watershed as trees continue to grow, die and fall. The risk of harder to control fires increases with increasing fuels. The resulting effects to streams cannot be estimated, but they would include potential surface erosion from burned slopes as well as landslides. Elliot and Miller (2017) modeled the project area using GeoWEPP. The model showed potential high severity fires along much of the South and Middle Forks of Clear Creek as well as Pine Knob and Brown Springs Creek (Figure 4). Increased erosion was also predicted to be much greater than under the no action alternative. Surface erosion delivered to streams would likely settle out in the lower gradient fish bearing streams potentially reducing the quality and quantity of spawning and rearing habitat. Landslides could result in channel downcutting and both the addition and loss of wood and their associated pools. This could result in both losses and improvements in fish rearing habitat. Gravel deposits from landslides are likely to increase spawning habitat in some areas. Riparian contributions to instream wood levels would increase where riparian areas are burned; however short term stream temperatures may also increase in these areas (Mahlum et al, 2011). Recent observations of fires on the Forest show the areas that are most likely to experience stand replacing fires are near ridgetops and in the headwaters of streams. These headwaters contribute to stream cooling. Their effect on mainstem streams could be reduced in the event of large fires. It is very likely that the 1931 fire resulted in increased stream temperatures in the South Fork Clear Creek due to canopy loss over the mainstem stream. The risk of fires burning along mainstem streams increases with more uncontrollable fire behavior.  Modeled burn severity under current conditions in Clear Creek (Elliot and Miller, 2017).Figure 4: Modeled Burn Severity under Current Conditions in Clear Creek (Elliot and Miller, 2017) In summary, this alternative would inhibit the ability of the Forest to further limit or reduce sediment delivery to streams from roads in order to meet or maintain Forest Plan water quality objectives. Roadside ditches would continue to deliver sediment to streams indefinitely due to inadequate cross drains. The risk of crossing failures would increase as culverts age and their conditions deteriorate. This alternative would also maintain a greater risk of high severity fire with the resulting positive and negative effects to aquatic habitats and riparian areas. The magnitude of those effects, however, cannot be estimated. Alternatives B, C, C Modified, and D The direct, indirect and cumulative effects of action Alternatives B, C, and D are discussed in the 2015 FEIS, pgs. 3-26 through 3-35. The discussion below updates the FISHSED model outputs which were incorrectly calculated and displayed in the 2015 FEIS and analyzes Alternative C Modified. It also includes a brief discussion of why the modeled analyses are considered overestimates through a comparison of the acres analyzed in NEPA versus the acres of harvest after actual on the ground layout occurs as a result of design feature implementation. Outputs from the NEZSED model were used to identify road segments likely to be producing the most sediment. Field reviews occurred and found that the highest producers would have work conducted on them that is designed to minimize sediment. FISHSED Updates The Forest Plan requires the use of the FISHSED model in order to compare modeled changes in cobble embeddedness between action alternatives. It is not design to predict actual changes in embeddedness. It also predicts potential changes in summer and winter rearing habitat capacity as a result of changes in embeddedness. It is most appropriately used to assess the effects of changes in habitat quality when cobble embeddedness changes are greater than 10-20% (Stowell, et al 1983). Additional information on the model can be found in the FEIS, pg. 3-3. Table 3-3 displays the FISHSED outputs by Forest Plan prescription watershed. Brown Springs and Solo exceed a 10% change for cobble embeddedness under all alternatives. Brown Springs, Solo and Hoodoo exceed a 10% change for winter rearing under all alternatives. The changes remain below the 20% identified by Stowell (1983) but above the 10% suggested by the Forest Plan Appendix A Guidance document (Conroy and Thompson, 2011). Table 9: FISHSED Model Outputs by Prescription Watershed Prescription Watershed Percent Change from Existing Condition Alt B Alt C Alt D Pine Knob     Cobble Embeddedness 6 6 6  Summer Rearing 2 2 2  Winter Rearing 9 9 9 Brown Springs     Cobble Embeddedness 15 15 14  Summer Rearing 2 2 2  Winter Rearing 14 14 13 Clear Creek     Cobble Embeddedness 4 4 4  Summer Rearing 3 4 3  Winter Rearing 8 9 8 Solo     Cobble Embeddedness 12 13 12  Summer Rearing 1 2 1  Winter Rearing 12 13 12 Middle Fork Clear     Cobble Embeddedness 4 5 4  Summer Rearing 2 2 2  Winter Rearing 7 8 7 Kay     Cobble Embeddedness 2 2 2  Summer Rearing 1 1 1  Winter Rearing 4 4 3 South Fork Clear     Cobble Embeddedness 3 3 2  Summer Rearing 1 1 1  Winter Rearing 4 4 4 Hoodoo     Cobble Embeddedness 6 7 5  Summer Rearing 6 7 6 Prescription Watershed Percent Change from Existing Condition Alt B Alt C Alt D  Winter Rearing 13 14 12 While modeling indicates potential increases over 10% for some watersheds, local field observations indicate otherwise. Monitoring along 23 miles of RHCAs found no sediment delivery through the buffers (USDA, 2014). In addition, visual observations of post-harvest areas found the same results (K. Smith, personal observations, 2000-2013). This is due to thick ground cover vegetation which filters out sediment that may be moving down slope from harvested areas. The NEZSED model is based on the number of acres of proposed timber harvest, road construction, reconstruction and decommissioning as well as prescribed burning. It also assumes that all activities will occur within one year as opposed to the expected 7 year or more timeframe of project activities. In addition to model assumptions, and as described below, the actual acres of proposed activities are expected to be 20-30% less than the acres analyzed in NEZSED; therefore the FISHSED modeled changes would be less as well. Based on local monitoring results, restricted model assumptions and expected overestimates by the model based on actual harvest acres, no substantial change in cobble embeddedness or winter rearing from proposed activities is expected for Brown Springs, Solo, or Hoodoo prescriptions watersheds where modeled increases are over 10%. Potential Effects – NEPA vs. Actual Layout Acres A comparison between the acres analyzed in the 2015 FEIS and actual unit layout was conducted in 2015. The harvest units are within the Hoodoo Prescription watershed and constitute the proposed Lost Mule sale. The actual unit acreage as a result of field layout was 34% less than the NEPA acres analyzed. The reduction is primarily due to the buffering of unmapped streams and the verification and buffering of landslide prone areas. Similar comparisons have been made for other timber harvest units with all resulting in a 20-35% reduction in harvest acres. The FISHSED model results and actual expected effects previously discussed are therefore considered overestimates. The actual effects would be limited in amount and scope based on fewer acres being harvested. RHCA monitoring has confirmed the limited effects as previously discussed (USDA, 2014). Alternative C Modified The direct and indirect effects of this alternative are the same as those described for Alternatives B, C, and D shown in the FEIS pgs. 3-25 through 3-31 with the exception of the FISHSED model outputs described above. There would be short term increases in sediment as a result of culvert replacements and road decommissioning. The effects to ESA listed steelhead trout are associated with the culvert replacements and would be minimized through design criteria. Minimal to no effects from harvest are expected due to design feature implementation including RHCA retention and on or near ridgetop locations of temporary roads. There are 579 acres less of regeneration, 283 less acres of commercial thinning, and 43 acres less of improvement harvest than Alternative C under this alterative. Units or portions of units were removed from Clear Creek, Pine Knob, Brown Springs, Kay, South Fork and Hoodoo prescription watersheds. Removal of these acres reduces the risk of potential erosion or landslides on the steeper terrain in which they occur. They were not modeled as landslide prone; however they do occur on relatively steep slopes. Others were removed as they are likely to occur within RHCAs. All action alternatives would reduce ladder and surface fuels across the Clear Creek drainage through regeneration, intermediate, and improvement harvest as well as prescribed landscape burning. These activities would help to moderate fire behavior which would also reduce the potential for high severity fire (Elliot and Miller, 2017). The risk for increased stream temperatures as a result of high severity fire would be reduced compared to the No Action alternative. The risk of increased surface erosion and sediment delivery to streams would also be reduced. 3.1.6.2 Cumulative Effects A discussion of the cumulative effects including the analysis area can be found in the 2015 FEIS, pgs. 3-32 through 3-35. The only change in the cumulative effects analysis is the timeframe considered for cumulative effects which is currently 2019 to 2026. There is no change in the cumulative effects analysis for stream crossings from the 2015 FEIS. Other components of the analysis are discussed or reiterated below. Alternative A Activities on private and state lands where harvest or fuel reduction treatments has occurred would reduce the risk for high intensity, less controllable fire on those lands. More intense fire behavior risk would be maintained on National Forest lands due to increased surface and ladder fuel loading. This could to lead to increased risk for landslides and riparian area mortality with the resulting negative and positive effects discussed under the indirect effects of the No Action alternative. There could be a reduction in the quality and quantity of steelhead/chinook habitat downstream on private lands (including the Kooskia fish hatchery) from increased sediment as well as potential increases in stream temperatures. Summer stream temperatures below the Forest boundary are nearing sublethal to lethal levels and are projected to increase as a result of climate change (Isaak, et al, 2016). Minor changes on Forest managed lands could result in slightly higher levels downstream. Instream wood levels would increase as a result of landslides and would be beneficial to aquatic habitats. The potential changes in sediment, temperature, and wood are completely dependent on the size and location of wildfires that might occur. The extent of the potential positive and negative effects cannot be assessed; however based on 2014 and 2015 fires in the adjacent Selway River area, they could have large, localized effects. Alternatives B, C, C Modified, and D No negative cumulative effects to instream sediment are expected because FISHSED-modeled changes are within the Stowell model (1983) guidelines and 5% or less over Forest Plan Appendix A guidelines. Actual harvest acres are expected to be 20-30% less than those analyzed, therefore the described effects would be less than modeled. Modeled sediment yield at the Forest boundary would be 23%, 24%, and 21% for Alternatives B, C, and D, respectively. All alternatives remain below the Forest Plan objective of 30%. Alternative C Modified was not calculated however it would be less than Alternative C because there are 924 acres less of harvest than Alternative C. Sediment yield would drop to below existing levels within 6 years (Watershed Report). There would be no long term sediment yield increase as a result. When combining local monitoring with modeling outputs, no cumulative sediment increases to downstream areas of Clear Creek, including the Kooskia Hatchery, are expected. Culvert replacement, road reconstruction, road reconditioning, and decommissioning activities result in minor short term increases in sediment. They would provide for long term (>50 years) instream sediment reduction by reducing the risk of road failures where crossings are replaced or removed and cross drain culverts are installed. Undersized culverts on private lands would still pose a failure risk and could contribute sediment to Clear Creek. The action alternatives, when combined with harvest or fuel reduction treatments on non-federal lands, would cumulatively reduce the risk for fire and the subsequent effects to aquatic habitats. The amount cannot be estimated; however studies have shown that modification of fuels helps reduce the potential for high intensity fire. Moderated fire behavior is likely to result in less hillslope erosion and riparian tree mortality while allowing for localized sediment and wood delivery from less intense fires. This would help to better maintain streamside shade and provide for long term large wood and streambank stability. 3.1.7 Regulatory Compliance 3.1.7.1 Endangered Species Act The effects determinations for fish species listed under the Endangered Species Act are the same as described in the 2015 FEIS, pgs. 3-35 through 3-29. In summary, the project would have both short term negative and long term beneficial effects to steelhead and their designated critical habitat as well as Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) for salmon from road removal, culvert replacement, and road reconstruction/reconditioning activities. The risk for potential effects to steelhead trout, designated critical habitat or EFH from road-related project activities could occur, therefore the ESA effects determination for the project is may affect, likely to adversely affect steelhead trout, their designated critical habitat, and EFH. An adverse effect constitutes harm or harassing listed fish. Adverse effects to steelhead, their designated critical habitat, or EFH are expected to be minimal due to BMP implementation. The Clear Creek IR Project is consistent with the 1998 Biological Opinion for Salmon and Steelhead in the Upper Columbia and Snake River Basins in that it applies PACFISH direction and does not prevent the attainment of PACFISH RMOs, conducted a watershed analysis that identified needs to improve habitat for listed steelhead in Clear Creek, and conducted project level Section 7 consultation. The project may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect bull trout since they were only sporadically found in the lower drainage below the Forest boundary. Temperature regimes are not within desired ranges for bull trout during the spawning migration period. Temperatures at the mouth of the streams create a thermal deterrent during this time. The proposed activities are not expected to directly or indirectly affect the species because the project would allow for the maintenance of natural temperature ranges through PACFISH buffer retention. Timber harvest would increase modeled sediment yield and cobble embeddedness levels but not to measurable levels. There would be no effect to bull trout designated critical habitat since none exists in the drainage. 3.1.7.1.1 Region One Sensitive Species The effects determinations for fish species listed under the Endangered Species Act are the same as described in the 2015 FEIS, pg. 3-39. 3.1.7.2 PACFISH The project complies with PACFISH and would not retard the attainment of Riparian Management Objectives as described in the 2015 FEIS, pgs. 3-39 through 3-40. 3.1.7.3 Forest Plan All action alternatives comply with the Forest Plan Water Quality Objectives and the upward trend requirement. FISHSED modeling indicates changes over 10% in cobble embeddedness and winter rearing in three prescription watersheds; however these watersheds remain within acceptable model ranges (Stowell, 1983) and are 5% or less above Appendix A guidance. Actual changes are not expected because harvest acres would be less than modeled, and because of sediment reductions associated with road decommissioning and reconditioning/reconstruction activities. Watersheds are expected to continue on an improving trends as a result of these activities when combined with RHCA retention and other design features. Pine Knob, Clear Creek, and Middle Fork Clear Creek prescription watersheds are discussed in the 2015 FEIS (Pgs. 3-40 to 3-42).The following discusses the effects of the actions on upward trend in the Hoodoo and South Fork Clear Creek prescription watersheds which do not currently meet their water quality objectives based on findings of the 2015 Stillwater survey. 3.1.7.3.1 Upward Trend All alternatives propose the same actions related to roads including reconditioning, reconstruction and decommissioning as well as culvert replacements. All alternatives would maintain an upward trend. Alternative C was the only alternative assessed as it proposes the most harvest and temporary road building. Hoodoo (West Fork) Prescription Watershed The Clear Creek Project would continue the existing upward trend by decommissioning an additional 0.8 miles of road, 0.2 miles of which is within RHCAs. This would not change watershed or RHCA road densities from the existing conditions of 3.8 mi/mi2 and 2.3mi/mi2, respectively. The majority of road decommissioning and road improvement were conducted under previous project between 2012 and 2015 (2015 FEIS, Appendix J, pg. J-40). The Clear Creek Project also reconstructs 15.3 miles of system road (40% of the roads in the prescription watershed) which would reduce sediment delivery by diverting road ditchline flow through cross drain culverts and away from streams. A total of 9.9 miles was already completed under the Road 650 Project in 2014. The Clear Creek project would replace the 11 existing undersized culverts with those sized for a 100- year flow event. This would reduce the risk of future failure. All crossings in the watershed would be appropriately sized after project completion. The Project would recondition 7.1 miles of road (19% of the roads). Reconditioning would apply gravel where needed to minimize the amount of erosion from road surfaces during log haul operations. The use of dust abatement during log haul would also minimize road surface erosion and potential input of sediment to streams. All project activities are expected to have a negative effect on aquatic condition in the short term based on sediment yields as modeled in NEZSED. Model results from NEZSED indicate sediment yield increases at the mouth of West Fork Clear Creek to 55% as a result of project activities. This meets the Forest Plan standard of 60%. The FISHSED model was used in conjunction with NEZSED to determine potential changes in fish habitat carrying capacity. The model predicted a 7% increase in cobble embeddedness and decreases in summer/winter juvenile steelhead rearing capacity of 7% and 14%, respectively. Winter rearing capacity exceeds the level of 10% where changes in habitat quality could occur (Stowell et al. 1983); however, local RHCA monitoring found no sediment delivery through the buffers (USDA, 2014). Visual observations of post-harvest areas found the same results elsewhere on the Forest (K. Smith, personal observations, 2000-2013). With no delivery, cobble embeddedness levels are not expected to increase as a result of harvest. FISHSED model documentation states that the effects evaluation should be adjusted if riparian areas are to be treated differently than surrounding land. PACFISH RHCAs retain no harvest buffers that are much wider than those used when FISHSED was developed; therefore the model results are considered overestimates, particularly when combined with fewer actual acres of harvest (NEPA vs. layout acres). Modeled ECAs would increase to 26% under Alternative C, a Moderate condition class rating based on the NOAA matrix (1998). This exceeds the desired threshold of 20%. However, no channel alterations as a result of increased water yield are expected. This is due to the loss of 20-30% of the harvest acres during unit layout, compared to those modeled, as previously discussed. Alternative C Modified would harvest 418 less acres than Alternative C, therefore ECA would be slightly lower than modeled estimates. An upward trend has been established through mostly intact RCHAs, a lack of recent timber harvest, previous road decommissioning, culvert replacement, and road improvement projects. The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project would maintain that trend through additional road improvement when combined with design features, and BMP implementation. Many studies have confirmed the success of the BMPs in reducing sediment delivery to streams and maintaining stream temperatures (Sugden, 2018; Arismendi et al, 2107; Hatten et al 2017; Sugden et al 2012; USDA Forest Service 2009; USDA Forest Service, 2006; Sridhar et al, 2004; Lee, et al 2004; Ott et al 2005). South Fork Clear Creek Prescription Watershed The Clear Creek Project would continue the existing upward trend through road improvement activities including the replacement of 27 stream crossing culverts, 16.5 miles of road reconstruction (51% of the roads in the prescription watershed) and 9.8 miles of reconditioning (30% of the roads in the prescription watershed). All of these are designed to reduce the amount of sediment delivery to streams from roads. Road decommissioning and reconstruction activities were conducted under previous projects between 2012 and 2014 (2015 FEIS, Appendix J, pg. J-37). All project activities are expected to have a negative effect on aquatic condition in the short term based on sediment yields as modeled in NEZSED. Model results from NEZSED indicate sediment yield increases at the mouth of South Fork Clear Creek to 14% as a result of project activities. This meets the Forest Plan standard of 45%. The FISHSED model was used in conjunction with NEZSED to determine potential changes in fish habitat carrying capacity. The model predicted a 3% increase in cobble embeddedness, a 1% decrease in summer rearing and a 4% decrease in winter rearing capacity. These are well below the threshold of 10% where changes in habitat could occur (Stowell et al. 1983). ECAs would increase to 9% under Alternative C, a High (good) condition class rating based on the NOAA matrix (1998). This meets the desired threshold of <20%. No stream channel alterations are expected as a result of minor increases in water yield. Alternative C Modified would harvest 289 less acres than Alternative C, therefore ECA is expected to be slightly lower than modeled estimates. An upward trend in aquatic habitat conditions in South Fork Clear Creek has been established through previous road decommissioning and road improvement projects. The Clear Creek Project would maintain that trend through additional road improvement activities when combined with relatively intact RHCAs, and design feature and BMP implementation. 3.3 Economics This report replaces the one in the FEIS (September 2015). 3.3.1 Analysis Area The project area is located within Idaho County, Idaho. The economic analysis area includes local towns and communities influenced by the timber sale activities. These towns include Grangeville, Elk City, Kamiah, Kooskia, Harpster, Stites, Clearwater, Orofino, Pierce, Weippe, and Lewiston. The timber sale influence on these towns depends on their proximity to the watershed, their economic dependence on it, and their historic use of the watershed dating to settlement more than 100 years ago. The Nez Perce National Forest has provided wood to local mills since the 1930s. The Forest’s output, along with BLM timber outputs, accounted for half the total timber harvested in Idaho County in the mid-1990s. Most of the Forest timber output was processed in mills located in or near the towns mentioned previously. 3.3.2 Regulatory Framework The project complies with Forest Plan direction to develop cost-effective projects, and it complies with the NFMA by emphasizing resource management over timber volume output. The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project is being considered at least partially as a Land Stewardship Project under Section 347 of the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY 1999. This Act allows flexibility in combining traditional service and timber sale contract activities to more effectively accomplish ecosystem restoration through forest management. It also allows more flexibility in funding projects by using the timber stumpage value generated from selling the trees to pay for doing the other resource activities. One drawback to stewardship contracting is that those projects would not contribute any revenue to the Treasury or to the 25% Fund for counties with acreage within the Forest. All the proposed activities other than the actual timber harvesting, such as precommercial thinning, road decommissioning, and grass restoration, would be considered for inclusion as stewardship projects. 3.3.2.1 National Forest Management Act The NFMA requires that a sale “consider the economic stability of communities whose economies are dependent on such national forest materials, or achieve such other objectives as the Secretary deems necessary” (NFMA, Sec. 14e1c). The NFMA also requires that “the harvesting system to be used is not selected primarily because it will give the greatest dollar return or the greatest unit output of timber” (NFMA, Sec. 6, g,3,E,IV). The project meets the requirements of the NFMA by using the IMPLAN model to evaluate how each alternative would affect economic stability in local communities. The project also uses harvest systems that are based on ground-truthed silvicultural practices, not on the highest dollar return, to achieve the desired long-term forest and access needs. 3.3.2.2 Forest Service Manual The FSM directs that economic feasibility be considered in project design during the early planning and NEPA documentation. A sale feasibility analysis was done at Gate 1, which led to consideration of treatments providing cost-reducing economic benefits. One major adjustment was the use of mechanical site preparation versus burning site preparation methods where possible. The mechanical methods provide better leave tree survival and utilize cheaper purchaser-supplied equipment. 3.3.2.3 Forest Plan The Forest Plan requires that the project provide a sustained yield of resource outputs at a level that will help support the economic structure of local communities and provide for regional and national needs (USDA Forest Service 1987a, Goal A.1, p. II-1). Alternative A would not contribute toward the Forest Timber sale program or support the economic timber harvesting structure of the local communities, while Alternatives B, C, and D would. Alternative C would best meet this goal. 3.3.2.4 Executive Order 12898; Environmental Justice EO 12898 requires that each federal agency make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations in the United States and its territories. Idaho County, Clearwater County, Lewis County and Nez Perce County are the counties most directly impacted by this proposal. According to a Headwaters Economics, A Profile of Demographics (Economic Profile System Report - generated August 1, 2018), within this area approximately 8.8% of people are minority populations and below poverty people (low income populations) are approximately 14.3%. The Executive Order requires agencies to work to ensure effective public participation and access to information. The 2015 FEIS and this DSEIS document all of the efforts that have been made to date for public participation. This project was first introduced to the public in 2011 and a project website with applicable information as the project developed has been available since then. Additionally, as described in section 1.9.4 of this DSEIS, the Forest and the Nez Perce Tribe (NPT) have been meeting regularly since the original 2015 Record of Decision was withdrawn to discuss the Nez Perce Tribe’s concerns with the project. The Nez Perce Tribe manages a fish hatchery on Clear Creek, which flows out of the project area. The hatchery relies on water from this drainage to supplement the water needed for the hatchery production. The Clear Creek 2015 FEIS and the DSEIS analysis determined that with pre-defined design features and mitigation measures there would not be an effect to the water quality, including temperature, sediment and water yield that would adversely affect the water going into the hatchery or the hatchery function. Clean water that supports a dynamic fishery is important to the tribe as well as the rest of the local community for subsistence use, sport fishing, and business opportunity. Protection and enhancement of wildlife is a concern to the Tribe and members of the local community. The wildlife analysis indicates that overall there would be no lasting effects to threatened, endangered, or Forest Plan management indicator species. Specifically for elk, a Forest Plan management indicator species and an animal hunted within the project area and widely hunted throughout the affected counties, analysis determines that the combined effects of regeneration and improvement harvest proposed in the action alternatives would result in the temporary reduction of elk hiding cover. Conversely, the proposed harvests would reduce tree canopy cover and allow sunlight, water, and nutrients to become more available for shrubs, forbs, and grasses. This would increase forage production for elk and other ungulates. Alternative A would provide both summer and winter range that continues to decline as forage is shaded out. As far as the project effects on Elk Vulnerability, the open motorized road densities proposed in the action alternatives would be reduced from 1.6 miles/sq. mile in the Project Area to 1.1 miles/sq. mile. Under Alternative A, they would remain static at 1.6 mi/sq. mi. The economic analysis reveals that Alternative A (No Action) would not sustain any timber harvest jobs. Alternative C would sustain the most jobs and revenue, because it generates the most timber volume, followed by Alternatives B and D. Please see Table 10 for an estimation of the timber harvest jobs and income that each alternative would sustain in the local community. Other activities being proposed along with timber management, such as road decommissioning, pre-commercial thinning, broadcast burning, and reforestation, also provide jobs and income to the local economy. In summary, the Clear Creek analysis did not reveal any disproportionately high and adverse impacts to minority populations, or low-income populations. None of the action alternatives are expected to negatively affect minority or low-income populations or any United States citizen. No environmental health hazards or adverse impacts to the fishery or wildlife population are expected to result from implementation of any alternative. This project would not disproportionately affect income levels in the economic analysis area. 3.3.3 Resource Indicators 3.3.3.1 Timber Harvest – Related Jobs and Income Jobs and income generated from the project contribute to community stability. 3.3.3.2 Sale Feasibility Sale feasibility is represented by the Present Net Value (PNV). A project with a positive PNV would be a sellable project. A project with a negative PNV would either not sell or require supplemental funding to make it sellable. The PNV is also an indicator of the amount of timber generated funding that would be available for stewardship projects or returned to the Treasury Analysis Methodology The Nez Perce National Forest Plan Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) (USDA Forest Service 1987b) describes the economic impacts of implementing the Forest Plan. The Forest Plan addresses the economic analysis process and values placed on non-consumptive items such as recreation opportunities, community stability, cultural resources, habitats, and populations. This economic analysis will not revisit the information presented in the Forest Plan and will focus only on those costs and revenues associated with implementing the proposed activities in the project area. The University of Idaho Forest Products Department and the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Montana produce annual Economic Outlook Reports for the forest products industry in Idaho and Montana (Cook et al. 2016). Utilizing economic data from the IMPLAN model and the Forest Industries Data Collection System (FIDACS), these reports provide statistics that articulate the economic value of timber harvest projects to derive the indirect and induced economic effects. In Table 10, the number of forest product industry (FPI) jobs supported; the amount of wages and salaries generated; and the quantity of goods and services sold per million board feet of timber harvested, is displayed. In addition, a publication from the University of Idaho, College of Natural Resources, Economic Contributions of Idaho’s Forest Products Industry 2017, provides a more recent value for jobs provided both directly and through support. Table 10: Economic Results per Million Board Feet of Timber Harvested Forest product Industry Jobs Sustained1 22 jobs per 1.0 MMBF Revenue to Communities Through Wages and Salaries2 $667,000 per 1.0 MMBF Revenue to Communities Through Sales of Goods and Services2 $3,850,000 per 1.0 MMBF 1 Source: University of Idaho, CNR, “Economic Contributions of Idaho’s Forest Products Industry 2017.” 2 Source: Cook, et al. “Idaho’s Forest Products industry Current Conditions and 2016 Forecast” (These numbers were revisited for the DEIS by the timber group and remain valid)  The Region 1 Gate 1 and 2 spreadsheets and the Quicksilver model with Nez Perce– Clearwater National Forests area factors were used to determine sale feasibility and appraised value. The Quicksilver model uses recent transactional evidence based on local timber sales to determine sale value. The timber stand database and extensive field reviews were used to determine timber volume and species composition; these are the two primary factors determining gross value of a timber sale. Net value depends on costs for logging system, haul distance, slash disposal, planting, and mitigation activities. The cost estimates for this sale are based on recent similar sales in the vicinity. 3.3.4 Affected Environment In a report for the Interior Columbia River Basin Ecosystem Management Project (Columbia Basin Assessment), titled “Rural Communities in the Inland Northwest,” (Harris, et al. 2000) communities are characterized in terms of their ability to manage change and adapt to it in positive, constructive ways. The report emphasizes community resiliency, which is a function of community conditions such as economic structure, infrastructure, civic leadership, cohesiveness, and amenities. In a 2000 report for the Interior Columbia River Basin Ecosystem Management Project (Columbia Basin Assessment), titled “Rural Communities in the Inland Northwest,” (Harris, et al. 2000) communities are characterized in terms of their ability to manage change and adapt to it in positive, constructive ways. The report emphasizes community resiliency, which is a function of community conditions such as economic structure, infrastructure, civic leadership, cohesiveness, and amenities. The Integrated Scientific Assessment for Ecosystem Management in the Interior Columbia Basin Assessment resiliency ratings for Lewis County (Kamiah), Idaho County (Kooskia and Grangeville) and Clearwater County (Orofino, Pierce, and Weippe) are low (Thomas, et al. 1996). However, preliminary conclusions from Harris et al. (2000) explains many timber-dependent communities tend to be more resilient and able to tolerate change than is commonly assumed. The resiliency rating for Nez Perce County (Lewiston) is high. The towns of Kamiah, Grangeville, Orofino, Weippe, Pierce, and Lewiston all show high to very high historic employment in the wood products manufacturing industry per Harris et al. Based on reports from the Idaho Department of Labor, as of May 2018, Lewis County had an unemployment rate of 5.1%, Idaho County had a rate of 4.8%, and the rate in Clearwater County was 6.6%. The average unemployment rate in Idaho reported was 2.9%, and the national average is 3.8%. In addition, counties dependent on federal timber receipts to help fund schools and highways find that this source of funding is drying up, so they have relied more heavily on taxes to bolster their income, to the detriment of low-income families and the unemployed who feel that timber harvest should contribute more. Two saw mills in the Clearwater basin, one in Kamiah and the other in Orofino, closed in 2016. Both mills attributed lack of sufficient timber supply as contributing to their closure. Idaho has always been a natural resource–based state, although as natural resource extraction declines, the state has moved toward diversification. Many communities have made impressive strides in achieving Idaho Gem Community status and working to diversify their economies. (The Gem Community program was established by the Idaho Department of Commerce to encourage communities to plan their futures.) As reported by the Idaho Department of Labor, the timber products industry went through hard times in the early 1980s, but the firms that survived were streamlined and modernized with the hope to have a consistent supply of timber from National Forest System lands. 3.3.5 Environmental Consequences 3.3.5.1 Direct and Indirect Effects 3.3.5.1.1 Alternatives A, B, C, and D Table 11 displays the Job and Income effects as a result of implementing the timber harvest alternatives. The table does not reflect additional jobs and income related to implementation of the non-timber harvest stewardship activities, such as precommercial thinning and road decommissioning, which are the same for all the action alternatives. These stewardship activities would generate some additional jobs, but not to a level like timber harvesting and would not point to any alternative as generating more than the other because they would be the same between alternatives, except for the no action alternative. Alternative A (No Action) would not generate any timber harvest jobs. Alternative C would generate the most jobs and revenue, because it generates the most timber volume, followed by Alternatives B and D. The other activities being proposed along with timber management, such as road decommissioning, precommercial thinning, broadcast burning, and reforestation, also provide jobs and income to the local economy. For example, in addition to providing jobs for heavy equipment operators required to decommission the roads, the project will create jobs for laborers performing erosion control and project inspection. Table 11: Timber Harvest Jobs and Income for Each Alternative Alternative VOLUME (MMBF) Jobs Sustained (FTE) Labor Income Goods and Services Value  A 0 0 0 0 B 68.3 1,502 $45,556,100 $262,955,000 C Modified 83.0 1,826 $55,361,000 $319,550,000 D 57.8 1,271 $38,552,600 $222,530,000 Predicted Stumpage and Present Net Value Each alternative produces different benefits and costs associated with the timber harvest, roadwork, fuel treatment, reforestation, mitigation measures (skid trail decompaction), and other related timber harvest activities. This part of the economic analysis compares the differences in benefits and costs by examining the timber’s appraised value and PNV for each alternative. The appraised value is the timber value based on recent bidding; that is, the amount the Nez Perce National Forest anticipates the timber would sell for minus costs for logging, road reconstruction, site preparation/fuel abatement, and mitigation. The PNV is the anticipated selling value minus the costs to implement the sale and reforest the land. An alternative with a positive PNV has stumpage values exceeding costs, whereas an alternative with a negative PNV has costs in excess of stumpage values and may require supplemental funding to complete all activities. The PNV money is an indicator of funding that could be available to fund stewardship projects on sales designated for stewardship contracting. Information provided by the economic models is used as a tool to understand the relative monetary differences between alternatives rather than to predict exact values for each alternative, since the variables may change between now and the time the timber sells. Alternative A (No Action) does not generate any value or accrue any costs associated with the NEPA decision, so its PNV is zero. However, Alternative A would not be able to offset the cost of doing the NEPA analysis. Tree mortality is occurring in many of the areas planned for regeneration. If a large wildfire (100+ acres) were to start as a result of fuel buildup from the anticipated tree mortality, fire suppression costs would likely exceed $300,000 (for comparison, the 350-acre Granite Fire of 2011 cost $2.2 million). Alternatives B, C, and D are all predicted to generate enough stumpage value to cover all of the sale costs, plus reforestation, while also capturing the timber value before it deteriorates from tree mortality. All of these alternatives should generate revenue, with Alternative C being the most economically feasible and generating the highest revenue (Table 11). An item that contributes to these Alternatives’ efficiency is that the harvest units are large in size and focused in a localized area, which reduces mobilization costs. In addition, completing the vegetation treatments in larger areas, such as in Alternative C which regenerates larger patches, allows for areas to be completed, and is then closed for an extended period of time while the new trees grow. This reduces road maintenance costs and the continued costs of multiple entries. All the action alternatives would use a combination of Forest Service burning and/or machine piling for the reforestation site preparation. Site preparation and tree planting are the two largest single-cost activities associated with implementing the different alternatives, but since each action alternative has the same costs per acre, the economic effect is proportional to the amount of acres needing site preparation and planting. To reduce reforestation costs, natural regeneration should be implemented where possible and where it meets the project purpose and need. Table 12 displays the predicted appraised total and PNV for each alternative. As noted in the Table 12, Alternative C produces the most volume, and provides the greatest revenue, because Alternative B requires less site preparation and involves lower planting costs than Alternative C. Alternative B has higher site preparation and planting costs than Alternative D, but Alternative B generates enough commercial thin volume, which doesn’t require reforestation costs, to offset the other costs (Alternative B thus produces a higher overall economic return). The economic impact of using fewer roads in Alternative D with respect to Alternative B and Alternative C equates to a 15% to 30% reduction in volume outputs, a 6% to 12% reduction in acres treated, and a $3.0 million to $1.7 million reduction in PNV. Alternative D would utilize longer skidding distances to bring logs to a landing, which can result in undesirable soil impacts due to logs dragging on the ground for a longer distance verse being carried on a truck. Table 12: Predicted Stumpage and Present Net Value Alt. Volume Appraised Totala Reforestationb Implementationc Present Net Value Stewardship Costsd CCF MBF A 0 0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 B 133,559 68,289 $7,773,000 $1,569,000 $839,000 $5,365,000 $1,258,000 C 162,307 82,988 $9,867,000 $2,364,000 $821,000 $6,682,000 $1,258,000 D 113,018 57,786 $5,529,000 $1,288,000 $528,000 $3,713,000 $1,258,000 a Appraised value bid includes s slash treatment, skid trail decommissioning, and road costs associated with the harvest. b Reforestation costs include planting costs (trees, labor, and pre/post-treatment exams with overhead). c Implementation costs include presale, engineering, and administration costs. NEPA costs, are not included in this cost total. d Stewardship costs include precommercial thinning, road decommissioning, grass restoration, and landscape prescribed burning. 3.3.5.2 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects area includes Clearwater, Idaho, Lewis, and Nez Perce counties in Idaho. The timber volume is scheduled to be sold through 5 different sales over a 5-year period, starting in 2019. Typical sale duration would be 4 years each; the last sale would be completed in 2029 (harvest activities usually do not start on the first year a sale is sold), for a total of about 10 years of harvest activities. Post-harvest reforestation and site preparation work could continue for up to 5 years following harvest on the last sale, creating a potential end date of 2034, for a total of 15 years of harvest plus post-harvest activities. Economic impacts for an activity, such as logging and sawmilling lumber, are shown in the previous section. These are described as direct and indirect effects, but they are also cumulative impacts due to the additional jobs, taxes, and income they provide throughout the Counties. When considering impacts of additional jobs and income created, this sale would contribute towards the Forest’s 5-year timber sale plan, but not beyond the level of current employment. The Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest 5-year timber sale plan is currently projected to be about 60 million board feet (MMBF) per year. Sold or foreseeable local sales affecting the same communities and contributing to the long-term timber flow of these communities include Swede, Preacher Dewey, Lochsa Thin, Lowell WUI and Lolo Insect and Disease. During the spring of 2016, the Blue North mill in Kamiah shut down. This mill employed about 65 people from the market area (Lewiston Tribune, 5/4/16). In October of 2016, the TriPro mill in Orofino, which employed about 50 people, shut down citing a lack of trees being sold for harvest and the Johnson Bar litigation, which removed available logs they had under contract to purchase (Lewiston Tribune 10/6/2015). 3.3.5.2.1 Alternative A – No Action Since this alternative does not propose any timber harvest or other stewardship activities, it would not contribute cumulatively to local community jobs and income. Alternative A would maintain current unmanaged use and related income. It could potentially increase future firefighting costs and locally generated income as trees die and create excessive fuel loadings susceptible to wildfire ignitions. 3.3.5.2.2 Alternatives B, C Modified, and D Added to the Forest’s 5-year timber sale plan, these alternatives would sustain jobs (ranging from 1,071 to 1,454 jobs). However, Alternatives B, C, and D are not expected to generate a large number of jobs or significant amounts of income from timber harvest or roadwork; therefore, these alternatives would not be likely to cumulatively affect local communities beyond the past 3-year employment averages. The mills tend to adjust their annual production to sustain long-term outputs (instead of boom-and-bust cycles) by purchasing private and State timber along with National Forest sales. The loss of the Blue North and TriPro mills could cause a change in timber stumpage values within the Clearwater market area, because of reduced competition. However, the area milling capacity is expected to be absorbed by the remaining mills as they strive to meet their full production potential (personal conversation with G.Danly; Empire Lumber and B.Higgins; IFG 2016). There will not be an excess of timber that no one would purchase due to the mill closures. In fact one reason cited for both mill closures was the lack of continuous timber to support all the mills in the market area (Lewiston Tribune 5/5/2016 and 10/6/2016). There would not be a noticeable change in area jobs due to the mill closure either, because the number of jobs associated with the timber harvest and processing is connected to the amount of volume processed. Since all the loggers and mills are using the same methods and technology to complete the work, more workers may be needed at the remaining mills to as they increase production in response to loss production from the two mill closures. Prescribed burning is planned in association with the previously mentioned timber sale projects. Prescribed burning is mostly handled internally by the Forest Service. Forest Service employees are supported by local community services. The prescribed burning proposed under other projects in the area can be handled with the normal Forest Service workforce and therefore would not have a cumulative effect on the local communities. Additional stewardship items including road decommissioning, precommercial thinning, and grass restoration would also contribute money to the local communities. If additional forestry activities are implemented within the counties by the State or by private industry, additional forestry workers may be needed. 3.4 Fuels The FEIS (September 2015) information for fuels remains valid and is incorporated by reference.  In late summer 2015, the Baldy Fire burned approximately 753 acres within the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project area in the headwaters of the South Fork of Clear Creek, which is a tributary to Clear Creek and the Middle Fork Clearwater River. The Baldy Fire was a mixed severity burn, with high severity (54 acres) occurring near Baldy Mountain along the ridge top due to a crown fire, low severity (384 acres) near the bottoms of the drainages and Road 1855, and moderate severity (315 acres) elsewhere in the burned area. No proposed harvest areas were burned, and a post-fire Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) review did not recommend any treatments in the Clear Creek drainage.  The Forest Supervisor directed project specialists to assess effects of the 2015 wildfires on the project area. Her findings regarding this new information and potentially changed circumstances related to this project are documented in a November 4, 2015 memo that is available in the project file. Based on her review, she found that the wildfire effects do not significantly change the environmental effects of the project, nor do they change the basis or nature of considerations and rationale for reaching a decision on this project. Supplementing the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration FEIS is not necessary. 3.9 Vegetation The FEIS (September 2015) information for Vegetation remains valid and is incorporated by reference. Due to proposed unit refinements, Table 3-27 (FEIS pg. 2-3) is updated as follows: Table 13: Updated 2015 FEIS Table 3-27.

The area of interest is approximately 5 miles from the community of Kooskia, Idaho. Treatment areas are located to the south of Forest Road (FR) 286 and north of FR 284, also known as the Elk City Wagon Road. The Clear Creek project proposes management activities including prescribed fire, commercial and pre-commercial thinning, reforestation and timber harvest to achieve more healthy and resilient vegetation across the landscape. These activities are designed to create a landscape that exhibits more natural disturbance patterns. Also included in the project are road decommissioning, culvert replacement, and road activities designed to improve watershed health. Vegetative diversity improvements will not be limited to coniferous vegetation, approximately 41 acres of bunch grass communities are proposed for restoration through re-vegetation with native grasses and forbs. Planned activities would be visible in foreground, middleground and background views from FR 286 and FR 284 which are identified as visual travel corridors in the Nez Perce National Forest Plan. Also within the area of interest is the Lookout Butte Lookout which is utilized as a recreation rental during the summer season. Corral Hill Lookout and Trails 130, 728, 723, 139, 150, and 151, are designated in the Forest Plan as travel corridors or use areas and have mixed levels of recreation use associated with them. This report analyzes the visual impacts of the proposed management activities and determine whether the activities would meet Forest Plan standards for scenic quality. Visual simulation techniques are used to analyze these visual impacts. Numerous viewpoints have been reviewed to determine the short and long term impacts to scenery within the resource area. 3.10.2 Regulatory Framework 3.10.2.1 Forest Plan The 1987 Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan provide standards and guidelines for scenic quality for the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests within the area of interest. Table 14: Nez Perce National Forest Plan 1987 - Visual Quality Objectives for Clear Creek View Point or Viewing Corridor Sensitivity Level Foreground 0 – . mi. Middleground . mi. – 3 mi. Background 3 mi. – 5+ mi. FR 284 (Pilot Creek to China Pt.) 1  Retention Modification Modification FR 284 (China Pt. to Forest Bound.) 2 Partial Retention Modification M.

Specific visual resource management direction is provided by the 1987 Nez Perce National Forest Plan and is described in terms of Visual Quality Objectives (VQO). Forest Plan VQO standards and guidelines were based on the Visual Management System described in Agriculture Handbook Number 462, National Forest Landscape Management, Volume 2 (PF-Doc. PI-R02). The visual management system was revised in 1995, and is now known as the Scenery Management System. The revised guidelines are provided in Agricultural Handbook 701, Landscape Aesthetics: A Handbook for Scenery Management (USDA Forest Service, 1995; PF Doc. VIS-R01). VQOs provide measurable standards for scenery management in conjunction with demands for goods and services from the forest. Scenic resource management is integral to all management areas and implied in all management goals. The Forest Plan standard relevant to the Clear Creek visual resources are: 1. Meet adopted visual quality objectives (VQO’s). 2. The visual resource has been evaluated based on visual sensitivity levels assigned to travel routes, use areas and water bodies. The analysis considers the character and appearance of the surrounding natural landscape and the VQOs of areas proposed for treatments as assigned under the current Forest Plan. VQOs are a desired level of scenic quality and diversity of natural features based on physiological and sociological characteristics of an area, and refers to the degree of acceptable alterations of the landscape Management activities such as commercial timber harvest, prescribed burning, and road construction can alter the scenic character of the landscape. There is a potential concern that activities proposed under the action alternatives could adversely affect visual resources to the extent that the Visual Quality Objectives (VQOs) established by the current Forest Plan (1987) would not be met. Effects to the visual resource are discussed in general terms; however, the indicator used to measure effects is whether or not VQOs are achieved. Visual Quality Objectives are listed in Table 14 (above) for the Clear Creek Project. Below is a brief description of each objective level. . Preservation: In general, human activities are not detectable to the visitor. . Retention: Human activities are not evident to the casual Forest visitor. . Partial Retention: Human activities may be evident, but must remain subordinate to the character of the landscape. . Modification: Human activities may dominate the characteristic of the landscape but must, at the same time, utilize naturally established form, line, color, and texture. . Maximum Modification: Human activity may dominate the characteristic landscape, but should appear as natural occurrences when viewed as background. Scenic resources are managed using the Visual Management System (VMS) which specifies the Visual Quality Objectives (VQOs) for designated areas. VQOs are based on the area seen from sensitive viewpoints such as travel corridors and other features where there may be a high visual sensitivity level. Table 15: Resource Indicators and Measures for Assessing Effects Resource Element Resource Indicator (Quantify if possible) Measure (Quantify if possible) Used to address: P/N, or key issue? Source (Forest Plan S/G; law or policy, BMPs, etc.)? Scenic Quality Visual Quality Objectives Meet Visual Quality Objectives No Forest Plan 3.10.4 Methodology Although the Visual Management System (PF Doc. VIS-R02) has been replaced by the Scenery Management System (PF Doc. VIS-R01), this analysis uses terminology used in the Forest Plan which was developed and written under the former. A crosswalk between the two systems is found in Agricultural Handbook 701, Appendix A (PF Doc. VIS-R01). A variety of tools were used in the visual resource analysis including analyzing VQO maps and visibility modeling. Treatment units and their associated VQOs were evaluated in relation to visually sensitive viewpoints to determine the extent to which proposed activities would likely be seen, and the likelihood that those activities would adversely affect VQOs. VQO maps prepared under the Forest Plan are very general in nature. Scenic class and sensitivity level can provide a general understanding; however, the maps can’t always illustrate how visible specific treatments would be from locations of concern, or the extent to which treatments are likely to stand out or blend with existing scenic features. Points on VOQ maps with direct line of site to treatment units were identified. Units were observed from these locations, using unit maps. Units are found in the foreground, middleground, and in the backgroundwhen viewed from key viewpoints. To assist in determining unit visibility, the analysis utilized Google Earth (Google Inc. 2012). Treatment units for each alternative were imported into Google Earth and draped over the landscape. Units were then viewed from ground-level or “street view” at a variety of representative sensitive locations, including: Forest Road 286, 284, Lookout Butte Lookout, Corral Hill Lookout, and Trails 723, 728, 130, 150, 151 and 197. This 3-D modeling gives a different perspective on how visible a given area is from a specific geographic location. A limitation of using Google Earth for determining visibility is that near view screening from adjacent trees cannot be taken into consideration; for instance, if you are on a trail or road, the 3-D imaging cannot place you down amongst the trees, where your view might be obscured by trees and other vegetation in the foreground.  Figure 5: Areas of past harvest are intermingled with areas of mature forest This picture shows areas of past harvest mingled with areas of mature forest.After establishing relative sensitivity of affected areas when viewed from key viewpoints, Agricultural Handbooks 462 and 701 were used as references to determine if proposed activities were likely to modify the landscape to the extent that visual quality objectives could not be met. 3.10.5 Affected Environment The Clear Creek Integrated Resources Project is located in the Columbia Rockies Subregion, within the Bitterroot Mountain Range. The existing landscape character is one of rolling hills, deep canyons and mixed conifer vegetation. These features are commonly found throughout the Middle and South Fork of the Clearwater drainages and their tributaries.The vegetation is continuous coniferous cover consisting of mostly late seral, non-fire resistant mixed conifer and lodgepole pine forests. There are some areas of rock outcrops and some natural vegetative openings, but these elements are a minor component of the landscape character. Broad views of the rolling hills are commonly found along FR 286. Much of the vegetative cover shows evidence of aging and disease. Within the viewshed of the FR 286 the rolling hills have numerous man-made openings in various stages of regeneration. There are a number of recreation activities that occur within the Clear Creek drainage including dispersed camping, motorized and non-motorized trail use, driving for pleasure, berry picking and firewood gathering. Lookout Butte Rental Lookout is a popular destination. To the south of the project area is the Elk City Wagon Road and the route of the Southern Nez Perce Trail. Located adjacent to the Elk City Wagon Road is the Corral Hill Lookout. The Elk City Wagon Road route is heavily vegetated, allowing few views north toward the project area. Figure 6: Intermediate harvest visible along FR 286 This picture shows intermediate harvest that is visible along FR 286Figure 7: Lookout Butte Rental Lookout This is a picture of Lookout ButteFigure 8: Close up of coniferous vegetation, dominated in this area by grand fir This picture is a close up of coniferous vegetation, dominated in this area by grand fir Minor trail segments are found throughout the area of interest, but the most popular destinations for trail use are found in the central portion of the Middle Fork of Clear Creek drainage. Bisecting the area west to east are Trails 728, 130 and 151. These trails follow the ridgeline above Clear Creek and have view into the drainage. Trail 723 is found in the canyon of Clear Creek and Trail 150 is found east of the South Fork of Clear Creek.  Figure 9: Looking north into the Clear Creek drainage from FR 1855 This picture looks north into the Clear Creek Drainage from FR 1855 The Clear Creek area is easily accessed by local residents of Kooskia and other small communities along FR 286. Access from the Elk City Clearwater area is more difficult, with travel over FR 284 which is generally only suitable for high clearance all-wheel drive vehicles. Within the central portion of the area of interest is the Clear Creek Roadless Area which has the theme backcountry restoration. 3.10.5.1 Resource Indicator While there is evidence of past harvest activities and manmade improvements, these modifications do not dominate the existing landscape character and therefore meet the existing visual quality objectives of partial retention, modification and maximum modification. Areas of vegetative mortality within the existing vegetation do affect the scenic nature of the canyon area. 3.10.6 Environmental Consequences 3.10.6.1 Desired Condition The desired condition for scenic quality within the area of interest is to retain the existing landscape character and maintain the designated visual quality objectives of partial retention, modification and maximum modification from travel corridors and use areas. The foreground viewing zone of FR 284 and 286 and the trails listed below have the VQO of partial retention (see table below) while several minor trails have VQO of modification in the foreground. 3.10.6.2 Alternative A – No Action With no harvest activity planned to occur under Alternative A (no-action) there would be no direct or short-term affects to the scenic condition of the area. The openings in forest cover that are visible as a result of past forest management would continue to recover tree growth, and overtime would recover unnatural appearing openings. Processes affecting forest dynamics would continue, including continuing insect and disease related mortality. The amount of dead and diseased coniferous vegetation would continue to increase. While for some this may have a negative impact on the scenic quality of the area, these are considered natural processes therefore the resource area would continue to meet assigned VQOs 3.10.6.2.1 Cumulative Effects There would be no change in the scenic quality of the area of interest in Alternative A in the short term, but the risk of wildfire would increase with time. The existing openings would continue to regenerate and within 10 - 15 years would no longer appear as openings. The potential for wildfire would remain. Alternative A would not change the landscape character of the geographic area encompassed within the Clear Creek drainage and its tributaries. 3.10.6.2.2 Compliance with Forest Plan and Other Relevant Laws, Regulations, Policies and Plans This area currently meets the Nez Perce National Forest Plan Visual Quality Objectives of Partial Retention in the foreground and Modification/Max. Modification in the middle and background viewing zones from all identified viewpoints and viewing corridors. Although there are currently harvest units that appear as openings they do not dominate the existing landscape character of the area. 3.10.6.3 Effects Common to All Action Alternatives Pre-commercial Thinning – In all action alternatives 1,887 acres are proposed for pre-commercial thinning. The activities outlined for pre-commercial thinning would retain the majority of canopy cover within those harvest units and would there have no long term effect on the scenic quality of the analysis area. Grass Restoration – In all action alternatives 41 acres are proposed for restoration of native grasses and forbs. This proposal would rehabilitate the area and would therefore have a positive long term effect on the scenic quality of that landscape. Fuels Treatment – 1,371 acres of prescribed fire are proposed in all action alternatives. The effect of these activities would appear as a natural occurring event and although the burns would change the appearance of the landscape they would appear as a natural process. These activities would meet the scenic quality objectives for the area of interest. Transportation System – There is no new road construction proposed in this project. There are 119.8 miles of road reconstruction and 13.2 miles of road decommissioning proposed in all action alternatives. There may be some short term effects from ground disturbance related to these activities, but the effect would be limited to the existing road template and its immediate surroundings. The scenic impact of these activities would be minimal and would not affect the scenic quality of the area. 3.10.6.4 Alternative B – Proposed Action Alternative B proposes to modify the existing vegetation through harvesting and burning activities improve forest health, improve wildlife habitat and reduce the fire hazard. Activities would be grouped in “focus areas” where use of “variable retention” techniques would be used to improve patch size, increase the amount of early seral forest and replant with a mix of species that would improve the long-term resilience of these stands. Healthy stands would be commercially thinned, while stands where root disease was detected would be deferred. The project proposes to treat approximately 8546 acres of the area of interest using regeneration harvest (2,609 acres), improvement harvest (331 acres), and commercial thinning (5,606). Approximately 36.3 miles of temporary road would be needed to complete this alternative including 8.7 miles of temporary road on existing templates and 27.6 miles of new construction. 3.10.6.4.1 Project Design Features and Mitigation Measures Design features used to reduce the visual impact of the harvest areas include retention of vertical structure within the harvest units and edge treatment that emulates natural openings. Leave trees, that provide vertical structure within the harvest area, may be both live and dead trees emulating the same structure that would remain after a natural mixed severity wildfire. These leave areas would range from . to 3 acres in size and may include leave areas adjacent to unit boundaries. Unit boundaries for units visible in the foreground would be shaped and feathered to reduce any unnaturally shaped edges and would reduce the hard edges that appear as a man-made features on the landscape. 3.10.6.4.2 Direct and Indirect Effects This analysis is mainly concerned with the landscape that can be observed from viewpoints identified in the Forest Plan. Proposed activities that are blocked from these viewpoints by terrain are considered to be in compliance with VQOs. Proposed management actions that have concern from a scenic resource standpoint are evaluated for how they conform to naturally occurring features that exist or could be created by natural events. Many of the proposed management features would have short term visual effects, but would not have long term effects on the overall landscape character of the area of interest. The management activities proposed for the Clear Creek area are located within the middle-ground and background view sheds of Forest Roads 286 and 284, Lookout Butte Rental Lookout, Corral Hill Lookout, and Trails 130, 150, 151, 723 and 728. Although not included in the Nez Perce National Forest Plan, the area is also visible from several minor trails found throughout the Clear Creek drainage. Most of the proposed units would be visible from one or more of the viewpoints found within and surrounding the area of interest.  Figure 10: Looking southwest from FR 286 where units 108, 109, 122, 126, and 130 are seen in the middle ground view. View from FR 286 - For the most part, views of the area of interest are screened by vegetation and topography for this major access road. There are some viewpoints where there are limited views of the area. Near unit 101 retain vegetative screening to protect views of unit 101 in the foreground in the northwest portion of the area of interest. In the northeastern portion middle-ground views of units 108, 109, 122, 126, and 130 would meet the VQO of Modification from the roadway. These units would remove vegetation that is adjacent to past harvest units reducing some of the straight edges of those existing openings. The new opening would be larger, but would have the appearance of a natural opening created by fire or other natural event. Looking southwest from FR 286 where units 108, 109, 122, 126, and 130 are seen in the middleground view.View from Lookout Butte Lookout Rental – The only harvest activities in the foreground views of the lookout are commercial thinning, which would retain the majority of the canopy cover and would not appear as openings. In the middle-ground view are a number of regeneration harvest units. Units 103, 109 and 114 would be seen along several of the ridgelines, but should be viewed from the side so that the edges are not as apparent. With edge feathering and some retention of vegetative structure these openings should meet the VQO of modification in the middle-ground. Unit 159 to the northwest of the lookout is a large unit that borders past harvest units. The boundary of the unit follows natural breaks where possible, and even though large in size still is within the scale of existing natural openings created by fire events. There are also natural rock outcrops in this unit that would increase the natural appearance of the opening. Thinning in unit 307 can be increased along the boundary with unit 159 also to create a more natural edge. Figure 11: Views from Lookout Butte Lookout Rental View from lookout Butte rental  Views from Trails – The trails with the highest sensitivity level are found to the north and south of the South Fork Clear Creek drainage. They include Trails 728, 130 and 150. VQOs in the foreground from these trails are partial retention and modification/maximum modification in the middle-ground. These trails are found on either side of the drainage and are within the Clear Creek Roadless Area. For the most part these trails are screened with vegetation and topography from the proposed harvest activities, but there are some areas where there are viewpoints. Units adjacent to Trail 155 to the south of Trail 130 can be seen from limited viewpoints in the middle-ground, but there are no proposed harvest activities adjacent to these trails except for the commercial thinning unit 122. Vegetation within the immediate foreground of the trail should be retained, but commercial thinning should not alter the view shed and would therefore meet the VQO of partial retention in the foreground. Design measures of edge feathering and retention of stand structure in units 122 and 130 would meet the criteria for modification in the middle-ground for these trails. Figure 12: Views from Trail 130 looking toward switchback area of Trail 155. Units 122 and 130 are found on either side of Trail 155 Views from Trail 130 looking toward switchback area of trail 155. Units 122 and 130 are found on either side of trail 155. Views from Corral Hill Lookout – A number of the focus areas for vegetative treatment can be seen from Corral Hill Lookout. Units 134 and 135 can be seen in the close middle-ground view shed. Treatment of the edges and retention of some stand structure would be critical to retain the natural appearance of these openings. Units 101 – 103 appear in the far middle-ground view. These units would harvest several ridgelines above clear creek. Edge feathering would be critical to maintain the appearance of natural openings in the far middle-ground view shed. Units 150-154 will appear as one large opening to the northeast of the lookout in the middle-ground view. Units 147 – 149 can be seen in the background view of the lookout. The large improvement cut, 505 would also be visible from this lookout. Commercial thinning units throughout the area of interest are also seen from this viewpoint. The appearance from this viewpoint would be changed from the existing condition, but with design measures, openings would emulate natural processes and would reduce the existing straight edges of past harvest activities. Views north from Corral Hill Lookout. Units 150 - 154 is located on the left. Units 134 and 135 are visible in the central portion of the viewshed.Overall there would be significant changes to the visual appearance of the Clear Creek drainage and its tributaries. Most proposed units are located adjacent to past harvest areas and would be designed to emulate the visual appearance of past fire activity or other natural openings. With design measures to reduce the man-made appearance of proposed openings, these focus areas would be returned to a more resilient vegetative cover with appropriate seral species and age class mix. Figure 13: Views north from Corral Hill Lookout. Units 150-154 are located on the left. Units 134 & 135 are visible in the central portion of the view shed. Temporary Road Building – There are 36.3 miles of temporary road building proposed in Alternative B. Of that total, 8.7 miles of temporary road would be built on existing road templates and should have minor visual impacts. The remaining 27.6 miles would be new construction. There would be some visual affect when these roads are constructed, but all of the new construction would only be evident in the middle-ground view shed and would meet the VQOs of Modification and Maximum Modification for those areas. 3.10.6.4.3 Resource Indicator Past activities are in various stages of re-vegetation, with young timber stands blending in with more mature vegetation. Past activities have utilized harvest methods that left some geometric appearance that emphasizes the man-made opening. Proposed activities would reduce the visual effects of those unnatural openings and openings would be natural appearing in the middle and background view shed so they would not dominate the existing landscape character and therefore meet the Forest Plan Standards for Visual Quality Objectives. 3.10.6.4.4 Cumulative Effects 3.10.6.4.4.1 Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Activities Relevant to Cumulative Effects Analysis Since the 1970s there have been timber harvest activities throughout the drainage. Evidence of these activities is visible, but does not dominate the existing landscape character of rolling hills with continuous coniferous vegetation. Past harvesting is in various stages of regrowth, with many areas no longer having the appearance of an opening. There are a number of openings to the within the Clear Creek area of interest that still appear as opening, but they have young plantations that will continue to mature and will no longer appear as an opening within 10 to 15 years. There is some evidence of past burning activities, but they are minimal and will only have an impact in the short term. Within 5 years these activities will no longer be visible. The proposal would blend existing units with the proposed units, emulating the appearance of areas that have undergone changes through the natural processes of fire and insect and disease. Thinning is proposed for the previously harvested area, designed to blend into the proposed harvest areas so that unnatural geometric openings are not created. Given the aspect and growing history of the area, the openings created by this proposal would no long appear as openings within 25 – 30 years, but should appear as an area that has experienced the natural process of wild fire rather than man-made openings. 3.10.6.5 Alternative C Modified Alternative C Modified also proposes to modify the existing vegetation through harvesting and burning activities to improve forest health, improve wildlife habitat and reduce the fire hazard. This alternative proposes to use regeneration harvest rather than commercial thinning in areas that may be experience disease outbreaks. This alternative proposes to treat approximately 8,707 acres of the area of interest using regeneration harvest (4,156 acres), improvement harvest (331 acres), and commercial thinning (4,220). Temporary road construction of 36.3 miles would be the same as proposed in Alternative B. 3.10.6.5.1 Project Design Features and Mitigation Measures Design features used to reduce the visual impact of the harvest areas would be the same as alternative 2 and would include retention of vertical structure within the harvest units and edge treatment that emulates natural openings. Leave trees, that provide vertical structure within the harvest area, may be both live and dead trees emulating the same structure that would remain after a natural mixed severity wildfire. These leave areas would range from . to 3 acres in size and may include leave areas adjacent to unit boundaries. Unit boundaries for units visible in the foreground would be shaped and feathered to reduce any unnaturally shaped edges and would reduce the hard edges that appear as a man-made features on the landscape. 3.10.6.5.2 Direct and Indirect Effects Harvesting and burning activities in Alternative C would have greater impacts to the visual resource than Alternative B. Twenty-five of the commercial thinning units proposed in Alternative B would be regeneration units in Alternative C. The change is most evident from Corral Hill Lookout, but can also be seen from Lookout Butte Lookout. The close middle-ground views would have larger and more numerous large openings requiring design measures of edge feathering and retention of stand structure to maintain the VQO of modification in the middle-ground. Figure 14: View shed from Corral Hill for Alternative C modified. Units proposed for regeneration harvest instead of commercial thinning can be seen in the central portion of the simulation in the lighter blue color. Viewshed from Corral Hill for Alternative C Modified. Units proposed for regeneration harvest instead of commercial thinning can be seen in the central portion of the simulation in the lighter blue color. The view shed from trail 728 and trail 150 would be affected near units 139 – 141. Commercial thinning units within this focus area would become regeneration units. Unit 221 which is immediately adjacent to trail 150 would now be a regeneration unit. Retention of vegetative screening would be required to maintain the VQO of partial retention in the foreground from this trail. Edge treatment and careful retention of stand structure through the remainder of the units would be needed to maintain the natural appearance of the area in order to meet the VQO of partial retention from these trails. Figure 15: View shed from Trail 728 looking toward Trail 150 Viewshed from trail 728 looking toward trail 150.There would be no temporary road building within the Clear Creek Roadless Area. The total number of miles of road building would be reduced to 5 miles rather than 7. This would reduce the amount of temporary road building that would be visible from FR 233 and from the residences located in the southern portion of the area of interest. It would also eliminate the temporary road building that effected Trail 805. 3.10.6.5.3 Resource Indicator Past activities are in various stages of re-vegetation, with young timber stands blending in with more mature vegetation. Past activities have utilized harvest methods that left little stand structure within the harvest areas and most areas do have geometric appearance that emphasizes the man-made opening. Past activities either no long appears as openings or are small enough that they do not dominate the existing landscape character and therefore meet the Forest Plan Standards for Visual Quality Objectives. The effects of temporary road building would be minimal, since most will not be visible. 3.10.6.5.4 Cumulative Effects 3.10.6.5.4.1 Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Activities Relevant to Cumulative Effects Analysis The cumulative effects in Alternative C would be more visually apparent than alternative B. This would be especially evident from the Corral Hill Lookout and from Trail 150 and 728. 3.10.6.5.4.2 Required Monitoring This project would be monitored according to Forest Plan requirements. 3.10.6.6 Alternative D Alternative D proposes harvest of the existing vegetation through harvesting and burning activities to improve forest health, improve wildlife habitat and reduce the fire hazard, but uses more commercial thinning rather than regeneration harvest proposed in either Alternative A or B. This alternative proposes to treat approximately 7.530 acres of the area of interest using regeneration harvest (2,178 acres), improvement harvest (211 acres), and commercial thinning (5,141). Temporary road construction is proposed to be 17.5 miles to reduce effect on wildlife and water resources. 3.10.6.6.1 Project Design Features and Mitigation Measures Design features used to reduce the visual impact of the harvest areas would be the same as Alternative B and would include retention of vertical structure within the harvest units and edge treatment that emulates natural openings. Leave trees, that provide vertical structure within the harvest area, may be both live and dead trees emulating the same structure that would remain after a natural mixed severity wildfire. These leave areas would range from . to 3 acres in size and may include leave areas adjacent to unit boundaries. Unit boundaries for units visible in the foreground would be shaped and feathered to reduce any unnaturally shaped edges and would reduce the hard edges that appear as a man-made features on the landscape. 3.10.6.6.2 Direct and Indirect Effects Harvesting and burning activities in Alternative D would have the fewer impacts on the scenic quality of the Clear Creek drainage and its associated recreation facilities as Alternative B or C. The number of regeneration harvest units would be reduced by eleven from Alternative B and by 36 from Alternative C. There would also be fewer miles of temporary road building with a reduction from approximately 36 to 17 miles of temporary roads. 3.10.6.6.3 Resource Indicator Past activities are in various stages of re-vegetation, with young timber stands blending in with more mature vegetation. Past activities have utilized harvest methods that left little stand structure within the harvest areas and most areas do have geometric appearance that emphasizes the man-made opening. Past activities either no long appears as openings or are small enough that they do not dominate the existing landscape character and therefore meet the Forest Plan Standards for Visual Quality Objectives. The effects of temporary road building would be minimal, since most will not be visible. 3.10.6.6.4 Cumulative Effects 3.10.6.6.4.1 Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Activities Relevant to Cumulative Effects Analysis The cumulative effects in Alternative D would be the less than either Alternative B or C. Regeneration harvesting would be reduced and temporary road building would be reduced in this alternative. 3.10.6.6.4.2 Compliance with Forest Plan and Other Relevant Laws, Regulations, Policies and Plans All alternatives in this project would meet the Nez Perce National Forest Land Management Plan Visual Quality Objectives. 3.10.6.6.4.3 Required Monitoring This project would be monitored according to Forest Plan requirements. 3.10.6.7 Degree to Which the Alternatives Address the Issues Alternative A, the no action alternative, would not improve the scenic condition in the short term or the long term. The existing mixed conifer and lodgepole stands would continue to be effected by insect and disease. Alternative B, while creating multiple openings and thinning stands extensively throughout the Clear Creek drainage and its tributaries would be developed to improve the resilience and health of the vegetation in the long term which would have a positive effect on the scenic resources in the long term. Design measures would be employed to insure that the harvest activities emulate natural processes in the middle and background viewing zones. Construction of temporary roads in alternative B would have a short term effect, but would not be an impact long term. Alternative C would have a greater effect on the visual resource than Alternative B and Alternative D would have fewer regeneration harvest units and would therefore have fewer effects on the visual resource. Table 16: Alternative Comparison for Visuals Issue Indicator/Measure Alt 1 – No Action Alt B – Proposed Action Alt C Alt D Meeting VQOs Will meet VQO, but the scenic character of the area will continue to be affected by increases in dead and dying vegetation due to insect and disease.

The revisions in this report include an updated Equivalent Clearcut Analysis, which includes private lands, and an updated NEZSED output utilizing an improved version (2016) of the model and an additional 93 miles of non-system road within the project area watersheds. The differences between the 2011 and 2016 versions of the NEZSED model are discussed in Chapter 1, section 1.9.5 Explanation of Updates to the NEZSED Model of this document and further information can be found in the project file. Watershed improvement needs were identified during the pre-NEPA stage of this EIS. To accelerate watershed recovery, some watershed improvement activities were authorized under separate decision documents. The effects of those projects have been incorporated into Upward Trend Analysis (Appendix J of FEIS), the existing condition of this EIS, or have been addressed in the cumulative effects analysis. Watershed improvement projects associated with the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project include: 10 miles of system road decommissioning, 73 miles of non-system road decommissioning, 4 miles of road reconstruction, 49 culvert replacements, and 22 culvert removals. Most of these projects have already been implemented. Future projects include the Clear Ridge Non-System Road Decommissioning Project, which proposes decommissioning 65 miles of nonsystem roads and removing 15 culverts (see Appendix J of FEIS for a more detailed outline). 3.11.1 Analysis Area The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project encompasses 43,730 acres within the greater 58,990 acre Clear Creek watershed (HUC10 #1706030401). Clear Creek is a tributary to the Middle Fork Clearwater River. The direct and indirect effect areas for sediment yield, water yield, ECA, and road density indicators are the ten Forest Plan prescription watersheds located within the project area. Water yield, ECA, and road density were also analyzed for the three HUC12 subwatersheds within the project area: Upper Clear Creek, South Fork Clear Creek, and Lower Clear Creek. The cumulative effects area for most indicators is the Clear Creek watershed (HUC10). The sediment yield cumulative effects area, as modeled by NEZSED, is the FS lands within the Clear Creek watershed (HUC10) and routed to Clear Creek where it crosses the FS boundary. 3.11.2 Regulatory Framework Nez Perce Forest Plan direction and all Federal and State laws and regulations applicable to watershed resources would be applied to the Clear Creek project, including the Clean Water Act, Idaho Water Quality Standards, Idaho Forest Practices Act, Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act, and EOs 11988 and 11990, and Soil and Water Conservation Practices (SWCP) Handbook, FSH 2509.22. The Clear Creek project was designed to comply with these directions and water quality conditions would be improved or maintained following project activities. Streams would continue to support beneficial uses. 3.11.2.1 Nez Perce National Forest Plan Forest standards for water resources are found in the Nez Perce National Forest Plan on pages II-21 through II-22 and Appendix A (USDA Forest Service 1987a) and are shown in Table 14. The Forest Plan was amended in 1995, following a joint decision (commonly called PACFISH) by the U.S. Forest Service and BLM for managing anadromous fish producing watersheds on federal lands (Forest Plan Amendment 20). This amendment also includes direction for restoration opportunities and cooperation with other agencies and individuals. For the Clear Creek project, PACFISH riparian habitat conservation areas (RHCA) are considered no-cut stream buffers and are excluded from harvest activities. PACFISH RHCA widths exceed State stream management zone requirements as defined in the Idaho Forest Practices Act. Forest Plan standards for water quality apply to this project, and compliance would be achieved via field reviews, effects analyses, project design criteria, and BMP implementation. Table 17: Compliance with Nez Perce National Forest Plan Water Standards Standard Numbera Subject Summary Compliance Method Nez Perce Forest Plan Standards 1 Apply Idaho Water Quality Standards and BMPs. Project design features and BMPs listed in Chapter 2 2 Utilize R1/R4 sediment yield and R1 water yield guidelines. Effects analysis 3 Evaluate site-specific water quality effects. Field reviews (conducted in 2011 and 2012).

Included in these standards are provisions for identifying beneficial uses, establishing the status of beneficial uses, setting water quality criteria, and establishing BMPs to control nonpoint sources of pollution. EO 12088 also requires the Forest Service to meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act. Section 313 of the Clean Water Act requires federal agencies to comply with all federal, state, interstate, and local requirements with respect to control and abatement of water pollution, and to cooperate with relevant processes and sanctions and administrative authority. Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act stipulates that states must identify and prioritize water bodies that are water quality limited (i.e., water bodies that do not meet water quality standards). For waters identified on this list, states must develop a total maximum daily load (TMDL) for the pollutants, set at a level to achieve water quality standards. No streams in the project area are listed for pollutants in the EPA-approved 303(d)/305(b) 2012 Integrated Report (IDEQ 2014). Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires permits to dredge or fill within waters of the United States. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers administers these provisions. Culvert removal and replacement activities proposed under the Clear Creek project would require authorization under section 404, through application of either nationwide or site-specific permits. 3.11.2.3 Idaho Water Quality Standards EPA regulations require each state to adopt an anti-degradation policy as one component of its water quality standards. The objective of the Idaho Anti-degradation Policy is, at a minimum, to maintain and protect existing instream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect those uses (IDAPA 16.012501.01). Beneficial uses and water quality criteria and standards are identified in the Idaho Water Quality Standards and Wastewater Treatment Requirements (IDAPA 58.01.02, IDAPA 37.03.02). 3.11.2.4 Idaho Forest Practices This legislation regulates forest practices on all land ownership in Idaho. Forest practices on NFS lands must adhere to the rules pertaining to water quality (IDAPA 20.02.01). These rules are also incorporated as BMPs in the Idaho Water Quality Standards. 3.11.2.5 Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act This legislation regulates stream channel alterations between mean high water marks on perennial streams in Idaho. Instream activities on NFS lands must adhere to the rules pertaining to the Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act (IDAPA 37.03.07). These rules are also incorporated as BMPs in the Idaho Water Quality Standards. 3.11.2.6 Executive Orders 11988 and 11990 These orders provide for protection and management of floodplains and wetlands. 3.11.3 Resource Indicators Water Quality and Quantity: The balance of water yield and sediment yield in a watershed influences the water quality/quantity of a stream system. Water yield refers to stream flow quantity and timing and is a function of water, soil, and vegetation interactions. Changes in amount or distribution of vegetation can affect water yield and ultimately alter stream channel conditions. Although there are no Federal, State of Idaho, or Forest Plan standards governing increases in water yield, there is general guidance on thresholds (NOAA 1998, Gerhardt 2000, USDA Forest Service 1973). Equivalent Clearcut Area (ECA) analysis is a tool used to correlate the relationship between water yield and the extent of forest canopy openings from fire, harvest, and roads. Active erosion of the landscape yields sediment to streams and occurs naturally. When an excess of sediment—that is, over the natural (balanced) amount—is delivered to a stream, the stream’s ability to route the sediment out of the system is diminished, and water quality is reduced. Harvest, temporary road construction, prescribed fire, and road-related activities have the potential to increase erosion production and sediment delivery into streams. Roads influence both water quantity and quality. Roads concentrate surface water and are a source of sediment entering streams. Watershed road densities >3 miles per square mile (mi/mi2) are categorized as low condition (i.e., poor conditions for watershed resources) (NOAA 1998). Resource Indicators: . Percent increase in ECA for HUC10 and HUC12 watersheds (compare to thresholds in NOAA 1998) . Percent increase in ECA for Forest Plan Prescription watersheds (compared to guidance limiting increase in ECA to 20-25%, Gerhardt 2000) . Percent increase in average annual water yield for HUC10 and Forest Plan Prescription watersheds . Percent sediment yield increase over base (natural), as modeled by NEZSED, for Forest Plan Prescription watersheds and measured to Forest Plan Appendix A sediment yield guidelines (USDA Forest Service 1987a) . Percent sediment yield increase over base (natural), as modeled by NEZSED, for Clear Creek at the FS boundary. . Reduction in watershed road miles (HUC10, HUC12, Forest Plan Prescription watersheds) 3.11.4 Analysis Methodology The watershed analysis was completed at different scales based on designation of Strahler stream order. Stream order is a term used to characterize the branching of a drainage system. A first order stream is a perennial, mapable, unbranched tributary. A second order stream is formed when two unbranched first order channels join together, and continues as a second order stream until it meets another second order channel to become a third order channel, or enters a third order or higher channel as a side drainage. The term “headwaters” are often used to refer to first and second order streams. Forest Plan prescription watersheds are generally 3rd to 5th order streams. USGS watersheds are part of the Watershed Boundary Dataset and the different levels are based on the number of digits in their Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC).This analysis will focus on the Clear Creek HUC10 and the three HUC12s Upper Clear Creek, South Fork Clear Creek and Lower Clear Creek. GIS-generated reports and maps, aerial photos, and field reviews were used to analyze effects to water quality and quantity from the Clear Creek proposed activities. Resource condition observations were conducted in the field during 2011 and 2012. Headwater channels, ephemeral swales, and springs/seeps in the proposed treatment units and downstream of them were examined and recorded on a map. Forest stand database (FSVeg) queries were conducted to identify past harvest activities and the time frame during which they occurred (see project file). Information from the Selway and Middle Fork Clearwater Rivers Subbasin Assessment (USDA Forest Service 2001) and from the Clear Creek Watershed NFMA Assessment (2012) was used to develop the existing condition and cumulative effects evaluation. Several analysis tools and models were utilized to calculate resource indicator values in order to compare to threshold levels. Models were used to provide estimates, not absolutes, for comparison of alternatives. Equivalent Clearcut Area (ECA) analysis is a tool used to index the relationship between vegetation condition and water yield from forested watersheds. The ECA model evaluates vegetation removal and the resulting potential changes to stream flow, timing, and water yield. The ECA analysis for this project utilized treatment and recovery coefficients from Ager and Clifton (2005) to determine existing and percent increase in ECA at the HUC10, HUC12, and Forest Plan Prescription watershed scales. Because harvest and burn history were not available for private or state lands, size and date of forest openings were determined using NAIP imagery in ArcGIS and Google Earth software. The ECA model was developed in Region 1 of the Forest Service to analyze the effects of timber harvest and road construction on average annual water yield. The method was developed in the early 1970s by research scientists and several Region 1 Forest Service hydrologists and culminated in the publication Forest Hydrology - Hydrologic Effects of Vegetation Manipulation, Part II (USDA Forest Service 1973). Early guidance for vegetation management recommended that ECA not exceed 20-25% in third to fifth order drainages (Silvey 1973). Stream orders for HUC10, HUC12, and Forest Plan Prescription watersheds are displayed in Table 18 Existing Condition for Clear Creek. When the ECA model was developed and during the time that many paired watershed studies on clearcut harvesting were conducted, general forest practices included clearcutting with no retention trees; larger harvest units; distinct, linear unit edges; harvest right up to stream channels; higher severity slash removal burns (site prep); and different Best Management Practices than are used today. Studies by Belt (1980) and King (1989) have served as field tests of the ECA procedure. Belt concluded that the ECA procedure is a rational tool for evaluation of hydrologic impacts of forest practices on third to fifth order drainages, which are typically similar in size or smaller than current HUC12 subwatersheds. King recommended local calibration of the model and a greater emphasis on conditions in first and second order headwater streams. The Matrix of Pathways and Indicators of Watershed Condition for Chinook, Steelhead, and Bull Trout is an analysis tool adopted by federal agencies to describe the condition and function of many watershed processes (NOAA1998). ECA is one of several indicators used in the matrix. High quality habitat is associated with ECA of less than 15% in a HUC10 watershed and all internal HUC12 subwatersheds, moderate quality is associated with 15-20% ECA in HUC10 watersheds, with one or more internal HUC12 subwatersheds at 15-30% ECA, and low quality is associated with ECA of greater than 20% in a HUC10 watershed, with one or more internal HUC12 watersheds at greater than 30%. Increases in average annual water yield for the HUC10 and Forest Plan prescription watersheds were calculated for Alternative C using formulas and graphs from Forest Hydrology - Hydrologic Effects of Vegetation Manipulation, Part II (USDA FS 1973). A Rosgen classification was determined for each of the evaluated streams and sensitivity to disturbance ratings and associated recovery potential ratings were assigned (Rosgen 1994 and Rosgen and Silvey 1996). The streams were also evaluated using the Stream Reach Inventory and Channel Stability Evaluation Guide (USDA FS 1975, Pfankuch 1975). It was used to determine how resistant streams are to recent flow forces exerted on them and the capacity of streams to adjust and recover from potential changes in flow and/or increases in sediment production. USGS StreamStats was utilized to compute ungagged stream flow information and stream reach information. The Disturbed WEPP erosion model (Elliot et. al. 2000), and WEPP:Road (Elliot et al. 1999) were used to predict the level of erosion and sediment delivery produced from hypothetical “average” ground based harvest, prescribed burning, temporary road construction and road improvement activities. The WEPP model is designed to predict sediment yield resulting from various forest management activities and the probability of sediment delivery, erosion, and runoff. The values obtained from the hypothetical “average” activities was used to determine the magnitude of difference between activities and incorporated into the upward trend analysis (Appendix J). The NEZSED model was used to estimate the predicted percent increase in sediment yield over base (natural) conditions to determine if thresholds from Forest Plan Appendix A would be exceeded. The use of the model is a Forest Plan standard and is useful for comparing alternatives. The NEZSED model was derived from the R1/R4 Guide for Predicting Sediment Yields from Forested Watersheds (USDA Forest Service 1981). The methodology for using the NEZSED model and the model’s limitations are described in detail in the Forest’s guidance document, Implementation Guide to Appendix A of the Nez Perce National Forest Plan (Conroy and Thompson 2011). Sediment yield is calculated in tons per year and reported as “percent increase over base” conditions. Sediment yield is calculated for base conditions (without management activities), current conditions (cumulative of past and existing management activities combined with base conditions), and predicted conditions (cumulative of past, existing, and proposed activities combined with base conditions) for each of the proposed project alternatives. These percentages of sediment yield over base conditions are then compared to the sediment yield guidelines for prescription watersheds listed in Appendix A of the Forest Plan. Disturbance entries or the numbers of large activities in a decade are also calculated to compare with guidelines established in Appendix A of the Forest Plan. Modeling was done on a peak year basis in order to meet the assumptions under which Appendix A of the Nez Perce Forest Plan was developed. It is highly unlikely, however, that all of the activities proposed would occur in a single year. Additional information about the models used in this analysis and limitations can be found in the project file. In 2016, changes were made to the NEZSED model (version 2011) spreadsheet to better align with the R1/R4 Guide for Predicting Sediment Yields (USFS 1981) direction, published research papers, and other Forest documentation. The differences between the 2011 and 2016 versions of the NEZSED model is discussed in Chapter 1, section 1.9.5 Explanation of Updates to the NEZSED Model of this document and further information can be found in the project file. 3.11.1.5 Affected Environment 3.11.5.1 Watershed Descriptions The Clear Creek project area (43,730 acres) is encompassed by the Clear Creek watershed (HUC10), which flows into the Middle Fork Clearwater River. The 58,990-acre Clear Creek watershed contains 3 HUC12 subwatersheds: Upper Clear Creek, South Fork Clear Creek, and Lower Clear Creek. These HUC12 subwatersheds are further divided into 10 Forest Plan prescription watersheds. Leitch Creek and Little Cedar Creek subwatersheds were not considered in the analysis, as they have no Forest Service ownership within them. The existing conditions of the watersheds are shown in Table 18. Watershed boundaries and stream locations are displayed in Figure 16 and Figure 17. No municipal water supplies are within, adjacent to, or downstream of the project area. There are no Source Water Protection areas that extend into the Clear Creek project area, although the Source Water Area for the city of Orofino (PWS# 2180024 - City of Orofino) extends to main stem Clear Creek downstream of the project area (Clear Creek and Big Cedar Creek confluence). The IDEQ Source Water Assessment database was used to identify public water systems in Clearwater and Idaho counties that are located downstream of the Clear Creek project. Other than Orofino, all other public water systems including Kooskia and Kamiah originate from wells. Surface Source Water Protection areas extend 25 miles upstream and 500 feet on each side of stream reaches. Implementation of BMPs, including the Idaho Forest Practices Act and Soil and Water Conservation Practices (FSH 2509.22) are sufficient to maintain water quality at the Orofino surface water intake and meet BMPs listed in EPA Region 10 Source Water Protection Best Management Practices for USFS and BLM (Draft October 12, 2005). A search of water rights applications, permits, decrees, licenses, claims, and transfers was made for the areas located in the Clear Creek project area. Twenty water rights were identified: 19 for the U.S. Forest Service and 1 for the State of Idaho. Uses include minimum stream flow, stock water, and federal reserved use. Further details of each water right are located in the project file. The proposed action alternatives analyzed for this project would not alter any existing water rights claims or decrease the available water relative to these claims. Table 18: Existing Condition Information for Clear Creek Watersheds Drainage Stream Orderc Watershed Acres (100% Forest Service [FS] land unless indicated) Percent of National Forest System Lands with Past Harvest (1956–2005) (%) Road Density (miles/mile2)a Percent Equivalent Clearcut Area (ECA) (%) Clear Creek HUC10 1706030402 5 58,990 (72% FS) 26 2.7 4 Upper Clear Creek HUC12 170603040201 5 19,166 (97% FS) 36 3.1 3 Pine Knob Creek Forest Plan 170603040601 3 2,622 50 4.8 3 Browns Spring Creek FP 170603040610 3 3,057 40 4.1 3 Clear Creekb FP 170603040611 4 7,234 (91% FS) 31 2.3 3 Solo Creek FP 170603040612 3 2,226 51 3.5 3 Middle Fork Clear Creek FP 170603040613 4 4,025 26 2.4 2 South Fork Clear Creek HUC12 170603040202 4 16,478  14 1.8 1 Kay Creek FP 170603040614 3 3,537  13 2.5 2 South Fork Clear Creek FP 170603040615 4 12,941  14 1.6 1 Lower Clear Creek HUC12 170603040203 5 23,346 (33% FS) 40 3.0 6 Hoodoo Creek FP 170603040616 3 6,446 38 3.8 4 Big Cedar Creekb FP 170603040618 3 5,542 (13% FS) 70 4.6 10 a Includes 10 miles of decommissioning under decision of 2011 South Fork/West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning EA. b ECA and road density calculations include privately owned land portions of the watershed. c Stream orders are based on highest extent of streams as identified during field surveys in 2011 and 2012.  Figure 16: Forest Plan Prescription Watershed and Major Streams in the Clear Creek Watershed  Figure 17: Clear Creek Subwatersheds (HUC12) Forested seeps and springs are found throughout the project area and often mark the upper extent of perennial flow. Stream channels range from headwater channels that are relatively steep and confined (Rosgen A) to lower-gradient Rosgen B channels (classifications were based on parameters found in Rosgen and Silvey 1996). Prior to project initiation, the Forest conducted a NFMA analysis (USDA Forest Service 2012) for the Clear Creek Watershed tiered from the Middle Fork Clearwater Rivers Subbasin Assessment (USDA Forest Service 2001). Both the Subbasin and NFMA assessments identified conditions for terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Results were then used to inform and develop the purpose and need for the project. In addition, Nez Perce Forest Plan direction was also reviewed and used to identify prescription watersheds in the project area that did not meet fish/water quality objectives in 1987. Conditions in the Clear Creek project area are a result of both natural processes and human activities. Past human-related activities include recreation, fire suppression, road building and maintenance, and harvest activities (1950s–2000s). Past harvest and associated road construction have had the most impact, with some increases in water yield and sediment yield. Harvest activities from 1950s to 2005 have occurred from 5%–70% of the Forest Service owned portions of the prescription watersheds in the Clear Creek project area. During the summers of 2011 and 2012, resource specialists evaluated conditions of headwater perennial and intermittent channels, ephemeral draws, and springs and seeps within and downstream of the proposed harvest units. Information collected included stream gradient, substrate configuration, bank condition, wetted, bankfull, and floodplain widths, erosion hazards (mass wasting/headcutting), road and culvert conditions at stream intersections, and determining if streams were in equilibrium in regards to cutting and deposition. Headwater channels in this area were found to be generally A3 and B3 channels (Rosgen and Silvey 1996) with well vegetated stream banks and stable substrates. Ephemeral draws showed no evidence of downcutting. In addition, temperature data and instream channel conditions of 3rd to 5th order streams were gathered (see aquatics section). During 2012 field reviews, bank cutting and deposition from 2011 runoff events were noted in Pine Knob and Browns Spring creeks. Comparison of stream conditions in nearby Selway and Middle Fork Clearwater drainages showed similar channel conditions and gage data indicated flows were higher than usual for the area. Channels are primarily stable and not entrenched, and are fully accessible to their floodplains (which are generally less than 30 feet wide). Banks are stable, and channel substrate consists of silts and sands, gravels, cobbles and small boulders. Based on the indicators observed, most stream segments were considered to be in a stable condition, with balanced cutting and deposition (effectively storing and routing sediment). Aggradation (deposition of fine substrate) was noted upstream of several culverts, particularly culverts that were undersized or were at a flatter gradient than the stream channel. Some stream bank damage was noted in isolated locations where livestock crossed streams or at watering locations. Most of the disturbance occurred on closed roads where roads bisected streams. Additionally, road and culvert related concerns were identified in the field and prioritized for repair. Some of these items were addressed under separate NEPA decision documents and were incorporated into the existing condition of the EIS or the cumulative effects analyses as a future project. Although assessed during the same pre-NEPA assessment as this EIS, it was determined that implementing these projects through separate NEPA and prior to the completion of this EIS would accelerate watershed recovery. For example the stream adjacent 650D road complex was included in the South Fork/West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning Project EA (2011) and approximately 2.0 miles of road along Hoodoo Creek was decommissioned (see Appendix J Upward Trend Assessment). A stream stability evaluation was conducted for the 48 stream reaches reviewed in the field to determine how resistant streams were to recent flow forces exerted on them (USDA FS 1975, Pfankuch 1975). The evaluation also helps predict the resistive capacity of streams to detachment of bed and bank materials due to changes in flow and/or increases in sediment production, as well as assessing the ability of channels to adjust and recover from those changes (Phankuch 1975). Fifteen indicators are evaluated and scored a certain value. A final score is achieved by adding the fifteen values. Scores range from 38 to 152. An “Excellent” score is 38 and all 15 indicators have to rate as excellent to obtain this rating. A score of “Good” ranges between 39 to 76, “Fair” ranges between 77 to 114, and a >115 is a “Poor” rating. A stream channel reach that rates “poor” has a combination of attributes that would require more judicious upstream management of forest lands than one rated “excellent”. Rapid changes in the density and aerial extent of vegetation on a watershed can increase stream discharges. Channel systems rated “excellent” can withstand these increases with less damage than systems rated “poor”. Most of the streams inventoried rated as Good and would be able to withstand some level of increased stream flows. One of the indicators for upper banks is landform slope and to achieve an excellent rating, bank slope must be <30%. For most of the “V” shaped first and second order streams associated with this project area, bank slopes are generally greater than 30%, making it difficult to achieve an excellent score. (see project file for individual stream reach ratings, photos, and map). A Rosgen classification was also determined for each of the evaluated streams and sensitivity to disturbance ratings and associated recovery potential ratings were assigned (Rosgen 1994 and Rosgen and Silvey 1996). For the A2 and B3/4 channel types, there is a low to moderate sensitivity to disturbance (includes increases in streamflow magnitude and timing and/or sediment increases) and recovery potential is excellent. The A3/4 channel types are more sensitive to disturbance with a rating of very high to extreme and a very poor recovery potential. These sensitivity parameters were originally designed for livestock grazing management but are still useful in demonstrating that headwater channels in the project area may be more sensitive to disturbance than the larger B channels. Beneficial uses and water quality criteria and standards are identified in the Idaho Water Quality Standards and Wastewater Treatment Requirements (IDAPA 58.01.02). Designated Beneficial Uses (IDAPA 58.01.02, Section 120) for the Middle Fork Clearwater River Subbasin are cold water biota, salmonid spawning, domestic water supply, and primary contact recreation. Designated Beneficial Uses for Pine Knob Creek, Browns Spring Creek, and Clear Creek (mainstem) are cold water biota, secondary contact recreation, and salmonid spawning. The Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ) has determined that the streams are fully supporting those beneficial uses (IDEQ 2012 Integrated Report 2014). For those streams not individually listed (undesignated surface waters), beneficial uses include cold water biota and secondary contact recreation. Solo Creek and Middle Fork Clear Creek were found to be fully supporting these beneficial uses, while Kay Creek, South Fork Clear Creek, Hoodoo Creek, and Big Cedar Creek have not been assessed. The IDEQ direction is to improve or maintain water quality conditions in order to support beneficial uses. No streams within the Clear Creek drainage are listed for impairment by pollutants in the EPA-approved 2012 IDEQ 303(d)/305(b) Integrated Report (IDEQ 2014). Water Yield: Compaction, disturbance, or removal of the ground surface and disturbance or removal of vegetation can alter water yield. Water yield refers to the volume and timing of stream flow at a given point. In the absence of major disturbance, a stream channel is typically dynamically in balance with its flow regime, which is a key determinant of the energy available for erosion, transport, and deposition of sediment within channels. Increased water yields may be associated with increased probability of peak flow events, which could lead to increased channel and bank adjustment through scour, bedload movement, or redistribution of sediment in depositional areas. Water yield can increase after loss of mature trees (e.g. through harvest or wildfire) due to a reduction in transpiration and precipitation interception losses. Removal of forest canopy can also affect snow accumulation and melt processes, often resulting in an increase in snowpack accumulation and melt rates, which can lead to altered timing of peak snowmelt runoff, depending on the size, orientation and total area of clearcuts in a given drainage (Storck et al. 2002, Winkler et al. 2005). The presence of roads and skid trails typically increases overland flow due to soil compaction; these impacts are similar to those of canopy removal from timber harvest. ECA is often used as an indicator of potential changes in water yield and represents the amount of forest canopy openings in the watershed. Existing roads are considered permanent openings in ECA estimates. Lower ECAs generally indicate a higher likelihood that stream channels are in balance with their flow regime. There are no Federal or State of Idaho standards govern changes in peak flow or water yield. The Forest Plan calls for maintaining the stability, equilibrium, and function of all streams on the Forest, but does not specify a threshold for ECA or increase in water yield. The plan does require that water yield not increase beyond acceptable limits. This guidance was subsequently refined to state that water yield analysis should be done where vegetation removal occurred over a high proportion of a watershed area. High proportion was recognized to vary with watershed and climatic characteristics, but was generally considered to occur when ECA exceeded 25-30% (Gerhardt, 1991). Early Forest guidance for vegetation management recommended that ECA not exceed 20-25% in third to fifth order drainages (Silvey 1973). ECA is also used as an indicator in ESA consultation for habitat condition. An ECA of <15% at the HUC10 and HUC12 scales are associated with high quality habitat (NOAA 1998). An ECA analysis was conducted to determine the existing ECA condition. Past harvest, wildfire, and roads were included in the analysis and included roads and forested openings on private and state lands. Existing ECAs at the HUC12 scale range from 1% to 6% (Table 18). Each of the subwatersheds is considered in high (good) condition of <15% ECA (NOAA 1998). Existing ECAs in the Forest Plan prescription watersheds ranged between 1% and 10% (Table 18) and are below the recommended threshold of 20 to 25% for 3rd to 5th order streams (Gerhardt 2000). Sediment Yield: Active erosion of the landscape yields sediment to streams and occurs naturally or as the result of management activities. When an excess of sediment—that is, over the natural (balanced) amount—is delivered to a stream, the stream’s ability to route the sediment out of the system is diminished, and water quality is reduced. Prescription watersheds were assigned fish/water quality objectives in Appendix A of the Forest Plan. These objectives provide management direction in terms of the maximum estimated increase in sediment over baseline conditions that can be approached or equaled for a specific number of years per decade. In 1987, the eight Forest Plan prescription watersheds with assigned objectives did not meet their fish/water quality objectives, and sediment was the primary limiting factor. These same watersheds have an Upward Trend Requirement, which allows timber management to occur, concurrent with improvement efforts, as long as a positive, upward trend in habitat carrying capacity is indicated. Objectives for Big Cedar Creek and Lower Clear Creek Face were not designated, nor were sediment yield guidelines assigned. The sediment yield guidelines (the maximum sediment yield allowable to meet fish/water quality objectives) for each watershed are shown in Table 22. Appendix A of the Forest Plan also assigned entry frequency guidelines for each of the watersheds. Few activities have occurred in any of the watersheds in the past 10 years to qualify as an entry, when considering sediment production. The most recent harvest was the Middle Fork timber sale in the Pine Knob Creek drainage in 2005. Roads are a source of sediment to streams, particularly at culvert inlets where cutslope slumping occurs and on roads in need of more drainage structures. Road densities within the prescription watersheds range from 1.6 to 4.8 mi/mi2. A watershed in high (good) condition generally has a road density of <1 mi/mi2. Watersheds with 1–3 mi/mi2 are rated as moderate, and those with >3 mi/mi2 are rated as low (poor) condition (NOAA 1998). Of the 10 Forest Plan prescription watersheds, 5 are rated as moderate condition, and 5 are rated as low condition. The baseline road miles for this project include the 10 miles of road decommissioning that occurred under the South Fork/West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning 2011 decision. The 65 miles of non-system roads proposed for decommissioning under the Clear Ridge project were included in NEZSED simulations for estimating sedimentation from recently decommissioned roads. 3.11.1.6 Environmental Consequences Due to the scale of resource indicator guidance thresholds, direct and indirect effects areas are the three HUC12 subwatersheds and the 10 Forest Plan prescription watersheds. In addition, headwater streams (first and second order) were also evaluated as these areas represent the lowest level at which effects would be detected. 3.11.6.1.1 Alternative A – No Action Under this alternative, no proposed management actions would occur. Actions occurring on state and private lands would continue. Because no vegetation removal or ground disturbing activities would occur, no direct effects would result from this alternative. Under Alternative A, road density and road-related erosion (indirect effects) would remain unchanged. Benefits from the reconditioning, reconstruction, and decommissioning of roads, proposed as part of the action alternatives, would not be attained. These roads would continue to be a potential source of sediment and would continue to intercept water and reroute it to stream systems. Forested stands would continue to decline due to insect and disease and lack of regenerating disturbance. Maintenance and re-establishment of long-lived, early seral species would not occur. Risk of large scale, stand replacing fire would increase over time, although the timing, size, or severity of such an event cannot be predicted. Increase in ECA for this scenario was not estimated due to unpredictability of extent of mortality from insect and disease or future wildland fires, but ECA could exceed levels estimated from the action alternatives. Alternative A does not propose any new activities that would directly or indirectly affect wetlands or floodplains or increase water temperatures. 3.11.6.1.2 Alternatives B, C, And D – Action Alternatives 3.11.6.2 Regeneration Harvest, Improvement Harvest, and Commercial Thinning The CCIR project proposes a mix of regeneration harvest, improvement harvest, and commercial thinning. Acres of each activity by subwatershed are displayed in Table 19. The vegetation treatments would maintain or reestablish long-lived, early seral species and would create a healthier, more resilient landscape better able to survive natural disturbances. Table 19 displays vegetation removal activities by alternative for the three HUC12 subwatersheds. The most harvest occurs under Alternative C, followed by Alternative B, and then D. Harvest activities were assessed using ECA, increases in percent water yield, and the NEZSED model (sediment yield). Table 19: Vegetation Removal Activities (Acres) for Each Alternative (Alt.), by HUC12 Subwatershed (HUC12) Upper Clear Creek 170603040201 South Fork Clear Creek 170603040202 Lower Clear Creek 170603040203 Alt.

It is assumed that with less harvest acres, the effects would be less than that described in the below analyses. 3.11.6.2.1 Resource Indicator: Water Yield The effects of vegetative manipulation on water yield are complex, highly variable, and depend on many independent factors such as elevation, climate, aspect, and especially precipitation. Removal of vegetation has the potential to increase stream flow in the short term (0–10 years) due to changes in evaporation, precipitation, wind patterns, and soil infiltration and percolation (Fowler et al. 1987; Dunne and Leopold 1978). In studies summarized by Grant et al. (2008), detectable increases in peak flow (10%) generally occur when more than 20% of a watershed (<10 km2 drainages) is harvested. Clearcut harvest prescriptions were the primary focus of those studies. Increase in stream flow is generally not measurable until at least 20 to 30% of a watershed’s forest cover is removed (MacDonald and Stednick 2003). Stednick (1996) suggests that flow changes are not measurable when <25% of the watershed is clearcut. Conclusions from the studies are mostly based on research in small tributary watersheds (approximately 200 acres, but Troendle et al. (2001) found that the hydrologic effects of forest management on a 6.5 mi2 basin were directly comparable to the results from much smaller basins. At Coon Creek in south-central Wyoming there was a detectable change in annual water yield as a result of harvest and road-building on 24% of the watershed (Troendle et al. 2001). The size of the study area was 6.5 mi2 (approximately 4,000 acres) and roughly the equivalent of the Forest Plan prescription watersheds. Changes in runoff measured on small experimental basins can be scaled up to much larger basins (MacDonald and Stednick 2003). A review of paired catchment experiments concluded that at least 15-20% of a forested basin must be treated within a short time period in order to detect a change in runoff (Bosch and Hewlett 1982). Troendle and Leaf (1980) noted that 20-30% of a watershed must be treated to detect a statistically significant change in flow. Recommendation in USDA Forest Service (1970) suggested not clearcutting more than 25 to 30 percent of a 3rd order drainage area to stay below a 8-10% increase in average annual water yield (recommended threshold). As shown in Table 21, regeneration harvest activities would occur on 1% to 22% of the Prescription watersheds (Alt. C). Proposed regeneration harvest accounts for <8% of any of the HUC12 subwatersheds. The effect of thinning overstocked stands on water yield is usually minor, and hydrologic recovery can occur within 5 years (USDA Forest Service 1973). Analysis of water yield is probably not necessary for treatments that remove 20% or less of basal area, because the effects are not likely measurable (Troendle et al. 2009). Effects of thinning, fuel treatments, and partial cuts on water yield are likely to be short-lived and may not even be measurable (Troendle et al. 2009). ECA is used as an indicator of change in water yield resulting from reductions in forest canopy. The ECA analysis takes into account the initial percentage of crown removal and the recovery through vegetative regrowth since the initial disturbance. Existing roads are considered permanent openings in ECA estimates. The analysis takes a simple snapshot in time, with the assumption that all Clear Creek project activities would be implemented in a single year. ECA predictions are used to compare alternatives and are not viewed as absolutes. This water yield indicator serves only as a red flag that suggests a potential for decreased stability due to sustained increased energy in the stream channel. ECA is used in combination with other indicators such as channel stability and channel type to determine hydrologic risk. The ECA method was developed to address concerns regarding water yield increases and potential effects on channel morphology. In the 1970s and 1980s, channel impacts (primarily scouring) were often observed, and these impacts were thought to be caused by water yield increases. During that period, clear-cutting was common, timber harvest levels were substantially higher, and impacts to streams were common. Forest management practices have changed dramatically since that time. Streams now have no harvest buffers of 100–300 feet on both sides of the watercourse, and BMPs are implemented on all projects. These changes have greatly reduced the impacts of forest management on stream channels and aquatic habitat. ECA was calculated at two scales: 1) the HUC12 scale in order to compare to the thresholds in The Matrix of Pathways and Indicators of Watershed Condition for Chinook, Steelhead, and Bull Trout (NOAA 1998) and 2) the Forest Plan prescription watershed scale to compare to guidance limiting ECA to 20 to 25% for 3rd to 5th order streams (Gerhardt 2000). ECA calculations include vegetation alteration from the 2015 Baldy Fire. ECA at HUC12 subwatershed scale: A lower ECA values corresponds to a lower likelihood that undesirable effects of increased water yield (e.g. elevated channel and bank scour) would occur. An ECA value of less than 15 percent is unlikely to result in measurable change in water yield, a condition rated as “high” or healthy by NOAA Fisheries (1998). At the HUC12 scale, ECAs of <15% indicate high (good) condition. ECAs of 15%–30% indicate moderate condition and ECAs of >30% are considered low (poor) condition (NOAA 1998). The estimated percent increase in ECA from harvest activities, temporary road construction, and prescribed burning ranges from 5% to 13%, depending on watershed and alternative (Table 20). When these increases are added to the existing ECAs, they produce ECA estimates that predict what watershed conditions would be like after the Clear Creek project. These ECA estimates range from 9% to 15% for Alternative B, 10% to 15% for Alternative C, and 8% to 14% for Alternative D. The highest increases in ECA occur under Alternative C, followed by Alternative B, then D. For the Upper Clear Creek HUC 12 subwatershed, watershed condition would move from high (good) condition to a moderate condition for Alternatives B and C, but would remain in good condition for Alternative D. South Fork Clear Creek subwatershed would remain in good condition for the ECA indicator for all alternatives. For the Lower Clear Creek subwatershed, watershed condition would move from a good to moderate condition for Alternative C, but would remain good for Alternatives B and D. Although two subwatersheds would change from a good to moderate condition, the percent ECAs are on the low end of values within the moderate category. Table 20: Estimated Percent Increase in Equivalent Clearcut Area (ECA) from Project Activities (HUC12) for Modeled Year 2015, by Alternative (Alt.) HUC12 Subwatershed Existing ECAa Estimated Increase in Percent ECA from Project Activities Final Percent ECA (Existing plus Project) Alt.

Numbers are rounded up or down to the nearest whole number. ECA at Forest Plan prescription watershed scale: As suggested in Belt (1980), ECA calculations were originally proposed for third to fifth order stream drainages. Early guidance suggested ECAs not exceed 20 to 25% in 3rd to 5th order drainages (Gerhardt 2000). Forest Hydrology - Hydrologic Effects of Vegetation Manipulation, Part II (USDA FS 1973) describes that most 3rd through 5th order drainage channels on the Nez Perce National Forest can sustain a 10% increase in average annual runoff as a result of timber harvest before increases are detectable. Using calculations and graphs documented in Forest Hydrology, Part II (USDA FS 1973), it was determined that for an average 5,000 foot elevation (range of 3,500 to 6,000 feet), a limitation of 10% increase in average annual runoff, and a water yield increase factor of 40% (F factor), an allowable ECA for these drainages equate to 25% (ranges between 22% to 29% depending on elevation). Final ECAs for the Forest Plan prescription watersheds range from 3% to 20% for Alternative B, 3% to 26% for Alternative C, and from 2% to 19% for Alternative D. The highest increases in ECA occur under Alternative C, followed by Alternative B, then D (Table 21). Table 21: Estimated Percent Increase in Equivalent Clearcut Area (ECA) from Project Activities in Forest Plan Prescription watershed for Modeled Year 2016, Percent of Regeneration Harvest, and Percent Increase in Average Annual Water Yield by Alternative (Alt.) Forest Plan Prescription Watershed Existing ECAa Final Percent ECA (Existing plus Project) Percent of watershed with proposed Regen Harvest (Alt.

As stated above, these ECA estimates are based on the assumption that all project activities would occur in 1 year. In reality, these activities would be staggered over several years. For example, this project could be broken up into seven different timber sales and harvested over a 7-year period. Units in Browns Spring and Solo Creek areas (Upper Clear Creek) would be split out into two to three timber sales and harvested at different time periods. The same would be done for those units in the Hoodoo and West Fork Clear Creek areas (Lower Clear Creek). Additionally, increases in average annual water yield for each of the Forest Plan prescription watersheds were calculated for Alternative C using formulas and graphs from Forest Hydrology - Hydrologic Effects of Vegetation Manipulation, Part II (USDA FS 1973). Isaacson (1997) concluded that when average annual flows are exceeded by more than 10 percent channel damage could begin to occur. Most 3rd through 5th order drainage channels on the Nez Perce National Forest can sustain a 10% increase in average annual runoff as a result of timber harvest before increases are detectable (USDA Forest Service 1973). Other guidance documents (USDA Forest Service 1970) indicated that when the average annual water yield is increased by 8-10%, stream channel damage (aggradation-degradation) could be initiated. The potential for alteration develops during the spring runoff period. The degree of change or rate at which it occurs is dependent upon the degree of stream channel stability that presently exists and the type of stream channel that would carry the increased yield. Increases in water yield from the proposed activities were estimated to be 10% or less for the Forest Plan prescription watersheds (Table 19), which are predicted to be below detectable limits. Increases over the recommended 10% increase in average annual water yield are generally allowed when stream banks are more than 60% stable. As stated above, most of the streams reviewed in the field were in a stable condition with Phankuch ratings of Good. Morphologic and hydrologic condition on third order or larger streams may minimize their vulnerability to harvest-related flow increases. The morphology of most third order and larger stream bottoms tend to minimize the scour of increased flows (Rainville 1987). Stream channels naturally experience bank full flows about once every two years (Leopold et al. 1964). Flows that exceed the channel capacity flood into the riparian zone. This reduces the erosion potential of peaks because the water flows over a much wider area and flows over energy reducing vegetation and wood. For flood flows to cause significant channel scour, they would have to be large enough to overcome this energy dissipating system. If canopy removal affects only small to moderate sized peaks and generally results in less than a 20% increase in water yield, the increase in flow may be insufficient to overcome the energy absorbing affect (Rainville 1987). Much research has been conducted on harvest activities and the potential for increased water yield. Most of the studies conclude that removal of forest vegetation increases water yield to some extent, but there is much variability in conclusions (summarized in Grant et al. 2008, Bosch and Hewlett, 1982; Stednick, 1996, MacDonald and Stednick 2003). The broad variation in findings suggests that one or more studies can be found to support nearly any point of view. Several of the earlier studies regarding harvest and increased water yields analyzed paired watersheds—one watershed with no harvest as the control and another usually 100% clear cut (summarized in Stednick 1996 and Bosch and Hewlett 1982). Forest practices in these studies included cutting up to the stream channels and hot, broadcast burning of slash. Newer practices include retention of large green trees, snags, and downed wood material, utilization of Riparian Habitat Conservation Area no cut buffers, less ground disturbing logging systems, and less intense slash reduction methods. Many of these studies looked at clearcut activities in areas with openings of >2–5 tree heights distributed over a substantial portion of a watershed (Kendall 1999, Troendle and King 1987, Winkler et al. 2005). The mechanism for altering flows is largely from two sources: reduced evapotranspiration rates following vegetation removal and altered rates and patterns of snow accumulation and melt (Grant et al. 2008). The rate of snowmelt depends upon many factors such as the silvicultural treatment, size of openings, aspect, and climate. Increased exposure of snowpacks to solar radiation and thermal radiation from surrounding trees or stands, melts snow faster and earlier in the spring (Troendle 1983), which can result in increased water yields and peak flows. A substantial portion of a watershed would have to be effectively treated to cause a significant change in the timing and magnitude of snowmelt (Kendall 1999). In general, maximum snow retention occurs in clearings of approximately 5 tree heights in diameter (approximately 500 to 600 feet) (USDA Forest Service 1973). Although studies have shown localized increases in snow accumulation, they found no statistically significant change in mean snow water equivalent over the entire watershed as a result of clear-cut openings (Troendle 1983). The increases in snow water equivalent found in clearings were balanced by losses from adjacent forested areas. Clear-cuts that are small enough to be shaded by nearby forest (1 to 3 tree heights) will melt later and may not contribute to streamflow at all (MacDonald 1989). Proposed variable tree retention levels of 14–28 trees per acre for this project would be left as singles or clumps depending on the locations of the larger legacy trees and species wanted for retention and could look similar to Figure 18. No cut riparian buffers would also provide retention areas within and adjacent to regeneration harvest units. Snow accumulations would occur in the smaller openings between clumps within the regeneration harvest units, but larger accumulations are not expected, due to design criteria limiting openings to 2 acres in size without leave tree retention.  Figure 18: Variable Retention Example from the Nez Perce - Clearwater National Forest The magnitude of any peak flow increase in response to forest management diminishes with increasing basin area for several reasons, including attenuation of flood peaks because of channel resistance, flood-plain storage, and transmission losses, as well as effects of storm size and origin (Archer 1989, Garbrecht 1991, Shaman et al. 2004, Singh 1997, Grant et al. 2008, MacDonald and Stednick 2003) No hydrologic mechanism exists by which peak flow increases, when measured as a percentage change, can combine to yield a higher percentage increase in peak flows in a larger basin. As a consequence, the magnitude of peak flow increases for larger basins will necessarily be equal to or smaller than those reported for small watersheds. (Grant et al. 2008). Some factors affecting timing and amount of runoff include: variability of snow accumulation, timing of snow melt due to aspect and elevation, amount of available water storage in the soil, and underlying parent material. King’s studies (1994) conducted on the Nez Perce National Forest showed that while there was evidence of peak flow increases in the headwater first and second order streams, they were cumulatively not detectable on the main stem (third order). The larger the drainage area, the less likely synchronization of flows will occur due to the greater opportunity for storage (Megahan 1972). Most stream channels experience bank full flows about once every 2 years. Flows which exceed the channel capacity flood into the riparian zone, which reduces the erosion potential of peaks by flowing over a larger area containing vegetation, trees, and other obstructions. Water yield changes resulting from timber harvest in the northern Rockies typically includes an advance in the timing of the rising limb of the snowmelt hydrograph and an increase in the total volume of runoff. Changes were most evident in the first 10 years after harvest (Hicks et al. 1991, Jones 2000. Even where rain-on-snow is an issue, the biggest effect on smaller peak flows is at recurrence interval (RI) less than one year (i .e., lower than the bankfull event) (Harr 1976, Harr 1986, Zeimer 1998). Larger flows tend to be dominated by the rainfall component of the storm, and the snowmelt component has little influence on the flood size. Increases in runoff following forest harvest are substantially greater in wet years than in dry years (MacDonald and Stednick 2003). Early studies, such as Wagon Wheel Gap (1928) and Fools Creek (1969), demonstrated that in areas where the majority of precipitation is in the form of snow, increase in water yield occurred primarily during the snow melt runoff season. Although water yield increases of 16% and 25% were noted in these studies, both reported that no damage to channels occurred nor was sediment increased significantly (USDA Forest Service 1973). Utilizing predictions from Bosch and Hewlett (1982) there would be an approximate 20% increase in water yield if 50% of forest vegetation was removed in small tributary drainages (study areas were about 50-300 acres in size). This calculation is based on a 40 mm increase in water yield per 10% change in cover and a mean annual precipitation for the project area of 1100 mm. Research in the nearby Horse Creek watershed study area (Nez Perce National Forest) demonstrated instantaneous peak flow increases of up to 34 percent and maximum monthly flow increases up to 44 percent, resulting from road construction and timber harvest (patch clearcutting) in small catchments (King, 1989). The East and Main forks of Horse Creek are third order streams with watersheds of approximately 4,000 acres. The Horse Creek study watersheds were first and second order drainages ranging between 60 and 380 acres in size. Although there were increases in stream flows noted at the smaller tributary watersheds, there was no detectable change in any stream flow parameters at the Main Fork Horse Creek gage station (King 1989). For first order drainages, approximately 50 percent (range 40 to 60 percent) of a drainage could be regeneration harvested (utilizing variable tree retention with approximately 20% tree retention, including no-cut buffers) and still fall within the approximately 40% PECA (range 20 to 60%) allowable in first order drainages before increases in water yield exceed 10% (Benoit 1973). This estimate is for first and second order drainages (generally 50 to 300 acres in size) with elevations of 3,500 to 5,500 feet and with stream channels of Good condition. The Probable Equivalent Clearcut Area (PECA) was originally created for the Clearwater National Forest. Additionally, guidance in Forest Hydrology - Hydrologic Effects of Vegetation Manipulation, Part II (USDA Forest Service 1973) recommends a 50% maximum area in clearcut condition for second order streams and 70% for first order streams. There are some first and second order stream drainages within the project area that have 50% or more proposed regeneration harvest treatment within their drainages. These regeneration treatment areas include portions of Units 103 and109 (Clear Creek drainage); 128, 229, and 234 (West Fork Clear Creek drainage); 139, 141, and 226 (South Fork Clear Creek drainage) and 145 (Kay Creek drainage). Generally, a 20% reduction in unit acres occurs due to additional wetlands and streams being located during marking of unit boundaries in the field. These areas receive no-cut harvest buffers. Also any additional landslide prone areas identified during unit boundary layout and marking of trees are dropped and protected with no-cut harvest buffers. Most of the first and second order streams in the within and adjacent to harvest units are greater than 10% gradient, with gravel/cobble substrates, and have small average annual water yields and peak flows. For example a tributary to Clear Creek (located between Units 102 and 103) with a drainage area of 320 acres, has a stream gradient of over 10%, cobble substrate, an average annual flow 0.4 cfs, and a bankfull peak flow of 5.5 cfs. Clear Creek at that point has an annual flow of 20 cfs and bankfull flow (peak1.5) of 130 cfs. Third to fifth order streams downstream of harvest units range between 4 and 10%. As discussed in Grant et al. (2008) peak flow effects on channel morphology are generally limited to stream reaches where channel gradients are less than approximately 2% and in which streambeds are composed of gravel and finer substrate material. There are very few areas in the Clear Creek project area with these characteristics (see stream evaluation field notes in the project file. There are short sections (100-500 feet in length) in the third to fifth order streams that have a <2% gradient, but sections have predominantly cobble sized substrate. Longer sections of <2% gradient occur in main stem Clear Creek (300 to 2500 feet in length) on Forest Service land and downstream of the project area on privately owned lands, but again, substrates are moderate in size (cobbles and some small boulders) and not subject to scour. Peak flow effects on channel morphology are generally not found on high-gradient (>10%) streams and are minor in most step-pool systems (Grant et al. 2008). Stream channels directly downstream of harvest units are Rosgen A and B channels (Rosgen and Silvey 1996). Based on the bank and channel substrate of these streams, they have a low (Rosgen B3) to extreme (Rosgen A4) sensitivity to disturbance rating and a very poor (Rosgen A4) to excellent (Rosgen B3) recovery potential. Field assessments confirmed that streams in the project area are in good condition. Changes in channel conditions are not expected to occur because gradients are mostly >10%, large wood material is present and anchored, steam banks are well armored with vegetation and rock, substrates are primarily cobble size and angular and are unlikely to be displaced by elevated water yield or peak flows. 3.11.6.2.2 Resource Indicator: Sediment Yield Ground-disturbing harvest activities can also increase erosion and sediment loads in the intermittent and small perennial channels within and adjacent to treatment units (0–2 years). Topography, retained woody material, and no-cut PACFISH buffers would capture and store most of the erosion material. As ground cover is reestablished, hillslope erosion would diminish (0–3 years). Headwater streams and wetlands typically trap and retain much of the sediment that washes into them. The faster the water travels, the larger the particles it can carry. Natural obstructions in small streams, such as rocks, downed logs, or even just a bumpy stream bottom, slow water and cause sediment to settle out of the water column (Meyer et al. 2003). Also, as gradient flattens and stream energy diminishes fine sediment is deposited. Deposition often occurs at area where higher gradient tributaries or sections of streams meet lower gradient streams. As noted above in the water yield section, lower gradient areas (<2%) occur in short, dispersed segments in most of the main channels and are the areas where larger amounts of fine materials are located and stored (see field survey information). The NEZSED model was used to estimate the predicted percent increase in sediment yield from the proposed activities under Alternatives B, C, and D. The predicted increases in sediment production by the NEZSED model are for relative comparison to existing conditions and do not reflect actual instream sediment yields expected from the project. Modeling was done on a peak year basis in order to meet the assumptions under which Appendix A of the Nez Perce Forest Plan was developed. It is highly unlikely, however, that all of the activities proposed would occur in a single year. The 2015 Baldy Fire was included in the NEZSED model calculations. The NEZSED model results have their primary utility in comparing differences between each proposed alternative and the no action alternative. Model results are also useful for comparing the proposed alternative to the guidelines in Appendix A of the Forest Plan. The sediment yield guidelines were established to reflect the sediment-carrying capacity of the stream system. A more detailed discussion of the NEZSED model can be found in the Forest Plan Appendix A guidance document (Conroy and Thompson 2011). Table 22 displays the natural (base) erosion rate, the percent increase sediment yield over base, due to project activities, and the sediment yield guidelines delineated in Forest Plan Appendix A (USDA Forest Service 1987a). Five of the eight prescription watersheds would remain below the sediment yield guidelines, under all alternatives. Sediment yield percent over base exceeded the Forest Plan Appendix A guidelines for all action alternatives for the Browns Spring Creek prescription watershed and Alternative C for the Clear Creek and Solo Creek prescription watersheds. The highest increases were found in Alternative C, followed by Alternative B, then D. Sediment yields would return to current conditions within seven years, as modeled, and would be approximately 1% less than Alternative A due to road decommissioning activities. Table 22: NEZSED Estimated Sediment Yield Forest Plan Prescription Watersheda Cumulative (Existing Sediment + Project) Percent over Base (Natural) Alt.

It is acknowledged that additional sediment yield would occur due to traffic increases from logging operations. This would be mitigated through road maintenance, road improvements, rock surfacing, application of dust abatement material, and timber contract provisions. Foltz (1996) found that rock surfacing with good quality aggregate reduced the sediment produced from unpaved forest roads. The addition of cross drain adjacent to perennial streams would further reduce the potential sediment delivery from ditches to streams. At the levels planned, proposed harvest and burning activities would be considered an entry when compared to the Forest Plan standard. This entry is within Forest Plan Appendix A guidelines because no activities qualifying as and entry have occurred in the last decade in nine of the ten Forest Plan prescription watersheds. For Pine Knob Creek, an entry was made in 2005 for the Middle Fork timber sale. This watershed is allowed 2 entries per decade, so it also meets the Forest Plan guideline. Implementation of project design measures, adherence to BMPs, and maintenance of no-cut PACFISH buffers would reduce potential erosion and further limit the risk of sediment reaching streams. Any sediment yield increases would be short-term (0–6 years following project activities), and beneficial uses in Clear Creek and the Middle Fork Clearwater River would be maintained. 3.11.6.2.3 Conclusion: Regeneration Harvest, Improvement Harvest, and Commercial Thinning Activities: The combination of water yield and sediment yield effects from harvest activities are not anticipated to result in changes in channel morphology of sufficient magnitude to alter physical parameters such as width/depth ratio or pool volume in 3rd to 5th order streams. Some changes could occur in limited reaches, especially in small headwater streams, where localized bank cutting or scouring could occur. Forest harvest and fuels treatments should have minimal adverse effects on water quality if they are carefully designed and conducted in accordance with best management practices (MacDonald and Stednick 2003). Proposed harvest activities are currently planned to be separated into seven different timber sales over a 7-year period (see tables and map below). This is only an estimate and is subject to change based on the decision made as a result of this EIS. Proposed timber sales are staggered across the Clear Creek watershed to better distribute harvest activities. For example proposed harvest in the Upper Clear Creek subwatershed is scheduled to be separated into four sales (see figures below for further information). Project specific design measures (see 2015 FEIS Chapter 2 pgs. 2-5 to 2-9) were created to minimize potential increases in sediment and water yields. Best Management Practices and Soil and Water Conservation Practices (FSH 2509.22) are incorporated into the design criteria.  Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project Proposed Timber Sale Year.Figure 19: Proposed Timber Sale Year Map Figure 20: Timeline of Proposed Activities - Upper Clear Creek Subwatershed  Timeline of proposed activities in the Upper Clear creek Watershed.Bar height indicates the relative acreage of activity and width indicates estimated length of activity.

This activity was assessed using ECA and the NEZSED model. The NEZSED results are included in the calculations displayed in Table 22 above. Resulting ECA increases are included in Table 21 above. Burn severity would be low enough to maintain much of the duff layer to help prevent germination of invasive species. Fire would not be ignited within PACFISH buffers (riparian or landslide prone), although fire would be allowed to back into these areas. This design measure would reduce the potential for erosion on sensitive landscapes and areas close to stream channels. There will be some increases to Water Yield where overstory trees are removed through burning, cumulatively the burning with proposed harvest will remain below levels where stream function would be diminished through increases in water yield. Prescribed burning is a moderate contributor to sediment yield and cumulatively the likely increases in sedimentation to streams should be below levels where stream function will be altered as show in the NEZSED results in Table 22. In addition the proposed burning in Units, 42 acres of restoration is proposed in bunchgrass communities. This area would be treated through prescribed burning and revegetated with native grasses and forbs. Burn severity is expected to be low, with no increase in soil erosion to contribute to sediment yield. 3.11.6.2.5 Precommercial Thinning Although precommercial thinning would cause some opening of the canopy, ECA would not increase; therefore, water yield would not increase either. Ground vegetation would be left undisturbed. Thinning would be completed with chainsaws, so no ground-disturbing activities would take place; therefore, neither soil erosion nor sediment input to streams would increase. 3.11.6.2.6 Temporary Road Construction Approximately 36 miles of temporary roads would be constructed to access harvest units for Alternatives B and C, 8.7 miles of which occur on existing templates. Alternative D proposes 17.5 miles of temporary roads, including 8.7 miles located on existing templates. Temporary roads generate the most erosion when they are first constructed, and lesser erosion would occur during the 1–2 years the proposed roads would be open. Erosion would stabilize 2 years after decommissioning occurs. Temporary roads were included in the ECA and NEZSED analyses. Increase in ECA from temporary road construction is <1% for all watersheds and increase in water yield from this activity is unlikely. As outlined in the Implementation Guide to Appendix A (Conroy and Thompson 2011), temporary roads interior to harvest units are not modeled by NEZSED separately, but are incorporated into the computation for the harvest unit. When a temporary road is located on unstable mid-slopes or crosses streams, the road is modeled separately. Roads exterior to harvest units are modeled separately. Temporary roads on existing templates calculated individually are modeled as having an erosion rate increase of 18,000 tons/square mile the year of construction, 5,000 tons/square mile for the years the road is being used and one year after decommissioning, and then goes to zero two years after decommissioning. Newly constructed temporary roads calculated individually are modeled as having an erosion rate increase of 67,500 tons/square mile the year of construction, 18,000 tons/square mile in year two, and 5,000 tons/square mile for the years the road is being used and one year after decommissioning, and then goes to zero two years after decommissioning. The erosion potential from temporary roads for all alternatives would be short-term (5years), since the roads would be built, used, and decommissioned over a period of 1–3 years and located on low-gradient, dry ridges or upper slopes, away from water, with no stream crossings. Project design measures for temporary roads would minimize the erosion produced over the short life of these roads. For example, temporary roads would be closed to public motorized use during project activities, reducing the chance of increased erosion from vehicles driving on wet roads and rutted surfaces. Water bars and placement of roads on the landscape help to reduce the likelihood of channelized flow leaving the road surface and entering riparian areas or system road ditches. Temporary roads would be decompacted and fully recontoured following project activities. Large wood material and organic materials would be positioned over exposed soils to reduce erosion potential and better accelerate recovery. 3.11.6.2.7 Road Reconditioning and Reconstruction Road improvement activities are proposed to address existing road concerns as well as preparing the roads in a manner so that sediment production from log haul is limited. Road reconditioning of system roads is proposed on approximately 48.8 miles. Each of the roads proposed for reconditioning are listed in Appendix B of the 2015 FEIS. Reconditioning is a combination of road ditch clean-out, blading and shaping the road surface to maintain a proper road template and drainage, or surfacing. This treatment is similar to road maintenance. Road reconditioning was calculated as an increase in sediment yield in the NEZSED model. As outlined in Conroy and Thompson (2011), road reconditioning is modeled as moderate reconstruction with an erosion rate increase of 18,000 tons/square mile the year of work. Erosion rates return to the existing 5,000 tons/square mile in year 2. Road reconstruction of system roads is proposed on approximately 119.8 miles. Each of the roads proposed for reconstruction are listed in Appendix B. Reconstruction includes replacing and installing new culverts for cross drains and live water crossings, placement of rock surfacing, placement of roadway fill, and installation of new signs or gates. Road reconstruction was calculated as an increase in sediment yield in the NEZSED model. As outlined in Conroy and Thompson (2011), road reconstruction is modeled as major reconstruction with an erosion rate increase of 67,500 tons/square mile the year of work and 18,000 tons/square mile in year 2 (similar to new permanent road construction). Erosion rates return to the existing 5,000 tons/square mile in year 3. Most of the roads in the Clear Creek project area were evaluated in the field and road recondition and reconstruction was prescribed as needed. These road improvement activities are meant to address the key points that are delivering the highest amount of sediment to streams. For example, a recent study using GRAIP monitoring showed that 7% of all drainage points in the study area delivered 90% of the road related sediment, and 2% delivered 50% of sediment (Black et al. 2013). Adding cross drains to roads in order to drain ditches prior to entering perennial stream channels would reduce sediment delivery dramatically. Road maintenance and improvements are considered a beneficial effect to water quality (Burroughs 1990; Grace and Clinton 2006; Swift and Burns 1999). Surface graveling has been shown to be effective at reducing erosion from road surfaces, especially at road/stream crossings. Studies have found gravel reduces sediment by 70%–79% (Burroughs and King 1989). Increased drainage culverts, especially on either side of stream channels, would further disconnect the road system from the perennial stream network; lessening sediment delivery. Although this activity is designed to reduce sediment input over the long term, a minor increase in sediment is expected to occur at the time of the activity and the year following (2 years). 3.11.6.2.8 Road Decommissioning Road erosion and sediment yield usually decline over time but continue at a chronic level indefinitely (USDA Forest Service 1981). Approximately 13.2 miles of road are proposed for decommissioning with this project. Road removal would reduce road density (Table 20) and provide an improvement in the overall watershed condition. However, even with the proposed road decommissioning, the current (existing) watershed condition ratings would remain the same for each of the watersheds. For Big Cedar Creek, road miles on the Forest Service portion of the watershed were reduced by 20% and road miles on landslide prone areas were reduced by 15%. At the HUC12 level, road density in Upper Clear Creek went from 3.1 mi/mi2 (high/poor condition) to 2.8 mi/mi2 (moderate condition). In Lower Clear Creek, road density went from 3.0 mi/mi2 to 2.9 mi/mi2. South Fork Clear Creek road density remained moderate at 1.8 mi/mi2. Table 23 displays the number of road miles proposed for decommissioning within each of the Forest Plan Prescription watersheds and resulting road densities. Table 23, Column 2, shows road density prior to the South Fork/West Fork Clear Creek road decommissioning project that was completed under a separate Environmental Assessment (USDA Forest Service 2011b) and was incorporated into the existing condition of this project. Although assessed during the same NFMA as this project, it was determined that decommissioning 10 miles of system road prior to the completion of this project would accelerate watershed recovery. Table 23: Estimated Reduction in Road Density from Clear Creek Project Activities Forest Plan Prescription Watershed Road Density Before EAa (2011) Existing Road Densityb (miles/miles2) Proposed Road Decommissioning (miles) Road Density after Clear Creek Activitiesb Pine Knob Creek 4.8 4.8 1.81 4.3 Browns Spring Creek 4.1 4.1 4.52 3.2 Clear Creek 2.3 2.3 0.52 2.3 Solo Creek 3.5 3.5 1.34 3.1 Middle Fork Clear Creek 2.4 2.4 1.29 2.2 Kay Creek 2.6 2.5 0.94 2.4 South Fork Clear Creek 1.6 1.6 0 1.6 Hoodoo Creek 4.6 3.8 0.78 3.8 Big Cedar Creek 4.6 4.6 1.72 4.4 Lower Clear Creek Face 1.8 1.8 0 1.8 a South fork/West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning 2011 decision b Includes private and Forest Service roads Road decommissioning activities would benefit water resources by reducing flow energy on roadbeds and within ditches, while reducing road-related sediment. The proposed road decommissioning projects include the removal of culverts, which would improve stream bank stability, width-to-depth ratio, and floodplain connectivity at localized sites. Road decommissioning was included in the NEZSED model calculations displayed in Table 18. Decommissioning is modeled as having an erosion rate of 18,000 tons/square mile the year of obliteration, 5,000 tons/square mile the year following, and then drops to zero two years after decommissioning. Road decommissioning activities would produce some short-term sediment, both temporally and spatially (Foltz et al. 2007). Some short-term sediment delivery is expected in the smaller tributaries that bisect the decommissioned roads. Sediment would be delivered during project implementation and during the stream channel stabilization period of 2–3 years. Past monitoring of road obliteration showed only minor amounts of sediment delivered to headwater streams, mostly in the form of suspended sediment, as indicated by increases in turbidity. Design criteria and BMPs would be applied to each of these activities to minimize increases of sediment delivery to stream channels. Road decommissioning may produce short-term (0–3 years) and localized sediment increases, but it would produce both immediate and long-term recovery benefits. 3.11.6.2.9 Water Temperature The Clear Creek project is not expected to measurably influence stream water temperatures. This is primarily due to implementation of no-cut PACFISH buffers, where there would be no removal of trees within RHCAs, and thus would have minimal impact on stream shading in the project area. Other stream channel features and processes that support or enhance cold stream temperatures, including variability and duration of floodplain inundation, channel complexity, balanced scour/fill, high pool volume, and downed trees in riparian areas would also be maintained. The aquatics specialist report discusses stream temperature in more detail. 3.11.6.2.10 Floodplains and Wetlands US Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps were initially reviewed for inventoried wetlands. Approximately 1525 acres of wetlands were identified in the project area and 103 acres are located within proposed harvest units. Field reviews by hydrologists, fish biologists, botanists, and soil scientists were conducted within all timber harvest and burn units and on all roads where work would be performed under this project. Stream channels, seeps, springs, wet areas, hydrophilic vegetation, hydric soils, and wetlands were identified and were mapped using field GPS techniques and subsequently digitized into GIS to ensure they were tracked. Within harvest units all wetlands, including seeps, springs, and streams would be protected by no-cut PACFISH RHCAs. There would be no temporary road construction constructed within floodplains or wetlands. Direct and indirect effects could occur on wetland areas and within stream floodplains during installation, replacement and/or removal of culverts. However these effects, both undesirable and beneficial, are expected to be insignificant. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires permits to dredge or fill within waters of the United States. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers administers these provisions. Each year, the Forest consults with appropriate agencies to evaluate permitting needs on all actions that could affect stream channels (including wetlands). Culvert removal and replacement activities proposed under the Clear Creek project would require authorization under section 404, through application of either nationwide or site-specific permits. No proposed project activities are expected to negatively change the functions or values of wetlands and floodplains as they relate to protection of human health, safety, and welfare; preventing the loss of property values, and; maintaining natural systems. The goals of Executive Orders 11988 and 11990 would be met. 3.11.6.3 Cumulative Effects Cumulative effects arise when the incremental impact of an action is added to impacts from past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions. Past harvest activities and associated road construction have had the most impact, with increases in water yield and sediment yield in the Clear Creek drainage and its tributaries. The cumulative effects area is the Clear Creek watershed (HUC10), which encompasses the entire Clear Creek project area and state and private lands. The temporal scope for watershed effects extends from the 1950s to 2037. The beginning date is based on the time frame of the first harvest and road construction activities in the watershed. Evidence from those events is still noticeable on the landscape in the form of old skid trails and landings and the current road system. The scope continues to year 2037, which is approximately 24 years after project implementation, the estimated amount of time required for ECA levels from this project to be no longer perceptible. 3.11.6.3.1 Past, Present and Reasonable Foreseeable Actions Several timber sales have occurred in the Clear Creek watershed (see project file and ECA analysis). Timber sales conducted between the early 1950s and late 1990s involved many miles of new road construction, little to no tree retention in regeneration harvest areas, and dozer piling of slash. These activities resulted in widespread and persistent impacts on the subwatersheds and caused increased sedimentation and increased water yields. The Forest Service manages 72% of the Clear Creek watershed, and past harvest activities have occurred on approximately 28% of that Forest Service land. Forest practices have changed over the last few decades. Project design measures, BMPs, and Forest Plan guidelines have been developed in order to reduce ground-disturbing activities and subsequent sediment delivery. Operating under dry conditions, implementing no-cut PACFISH buffers, retaining trees in regeneration harvest units, and limiting ground-based yarding to slopes <35% have become common practices. Over 30 miles of Forest Service system roads have been decommissioned in the Clear Creek watershed since 1996. This activity produced localized short-term sediment during implementation but created long-term sediment reductions and benefits to overall channel conditions. Present actions include permitted grazing, recreation, fire suppression, road maintenance, and control of noxious weeds using chemical, mechanical, and biological methods. Recreational activities produce little to no impact to water quality or quantity or to floodplain/wetland functions. Most effects from recreation are primarily due to associated road use, especially during wet conditions. Effects from grazing include stream bank instability and reduced water infiltration rates in areas with soil compaction (localized areas). Fire suppression activities are infrequent and limited in size. Road maintenance has minimal short-term effects and long-term benefits (Burroughs and King 1989). Watershed improvement needs were identified during the pre-NEPA stage of this EIS. Some of the concerns were addressed through projects that were completed under separate decision documents and were incorporated into the existing condition of this EIS and were included in the NEZSED analysis. Although assessed during the same pre-NEPA assessment as this EIS, it was determined that implementing these projects through separate NEPA and prior to the completion of this EIS would accelerate watershed recovery. Watershed improvement projects associated with this project and which a majority have been implemented: 10 miles of system road decommissioning, 73 miles non-system road decommissioning, 4 miles road reconstruction, 49 culvert replacements, and 22 culvert removals. (See Appendix J for a more detailed outline.) The following concurrent or foreseeable future actions may occur in the Clear Creek watershed: . Eastside Allotment project: This project includes an adaptive management plan to improve pasture and water quality conditions while keeping livestock numbers the same. . Clear Ridge Road Decommissioning: This project proposes 65 miles of non-system roads for decommissioning, which will improve water infiltration and reduce soil erosion potential. . Harvest of state of Idaho lands: The Bruin Storm project seed tree harvested approximately 160 acres in the Lower Clear Creek subwatershed in 2013. This activity was included in the ECA analysis. . Private land harvest: This project includes undetermined amount and prescription of harvest of private lands in the Crane Hill area (Upper Clear Creek subwatershed) in the next 5 years. Harvest is expected to occur on less than 200 acres. The first two projects are considered watershed improvement projects and will help to improve water quality and quantity. Any increases in erosion and subsequent sediment yield would be short-term and in isolated locations. The last two projects are harvest activities that could increase ECA and soil erosion. The small amount of acreage involved would increase ECA by <1% in the Clear Creek watershed. These projects would follow water and soil quality protection practices regulated through the Idaho Forest Practices Act. Alternative A – No Action Cumulative effects arise when the incremental impact of an action is added to impacts from past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions. Alternative A would create no direct or indirect effects; therefore, no cumulative effects to water yield or sediment yield would occur under this alternative. Alternatives B, C, and D – Action Alternatives 3.11.6.3.2 Water Yield Even though NFS lands comprise 72% of the Clear Creek watershed, they contribute 84% of the average annual flow of Clear Creek. The estimated existing ECA for the Clear Creek watershed is 4% and includes past activities on Forest Service, state, and private lands. Because harvest and burn history were not available for private or state lands, size and date of forest openings were determined using NAIP imagery in ArcGIS and Google Earth software. Estimated increases in ECA from the Clear Creek project are 9% for Alternative C, 8% for Alternative B, and 7% for Alternative D. When these increases are added to the existing ECAs, they produce ECA estimates that predict what watershed conditions will be like after the Clear Creek project. Final ECA estimates are 13% for Alternative C, 12% for Alternative B, and 11% for Alternative D. A lower ECA indicates a higher (better) watershed condition. ECAs of <15% at the HUC10 scale indicate high (good) condition (NOAA 1998). A 6% increase in average annual water yield for Clear Creek was calculated for Alternative C using formulas and graphs from Forest Hydrology - Hydrologic Effects of Vegetation Manipulation, Part II (USDA FS 1973). Most 3rd through 5th order drainage channels on the Nez Perce National Forest can sustain a 10% increase in average annual runoff as a result of timber harvest before increases are detectable (USDA Forest Service 1973). Clear Creek is a 5th order stream starting two miles from within the Forest Boundary (confluence with Middle Fork Clear Creek) to the mouth. ECA estimates predict that watershed conditions would remain high (good) under all three action alternatives and percent increase in annual water yield is below the 10% detectable level. Therefore, no stream channel alteration from increased water yield is expected from the Clear Creek project in main stem Clear Creek. As shown in Figure 23, ECA would decrease to its pre-project level (4%) after 12 years for Alternatives B and D and after 14 years for Alternative C. ECA from Clear Creek activities would no longer be discernible after 22 years.  Graph showing predicted Equivilant Clearcut Area over time.Figure 23: Percent Equivalent Clear Cut Area (ECA) Over Time for Clear Creek Watershed (HUC10) (Note: Includes Forest Service and private lands) As shown in the above discussions, a broad review of available literature discussing harvest activities and water yield/peak flows was conducted. Much of the analysis regarding water yield for this project was based on older literature (1970s) that established general thresholds and guidance for determining ECA, ECA recovery, and increases in water yield. They also created the foundation for Nez Perce Forest Plan (1987) direction. Alternatively, new research indicates that water yield increases (and associated effects on streams) may not be as important as previously thought, especially in the context of contemporary forest management. The primary concern about changes in water yield is how they may directly or indirectly affect stream channels, aquatic habitat, and water quality. Numerous studies have documented the effects of forest canopy removal on water yield, but surprisingly, very few have demonstrated a direct link between water yield changes and channel impacts in a forested environment. For example, Schnakenberg and MacDonald (1998) found no correlation between ECA and stream channel characteristics in forested catchments in Colorado. MacDonald et al. (1995) studied the relationship between WATSED predicted water yield increases and channel characteristics on the Kootenai National Forest. None of the channel types (pool riffle or colluvial step-pool) showed any increase in bankfull width or width-to-depth ratio with more intensive management. However, correlations were found between management indices and sediment characteristics; these correlations suggest that sediment delivery is a more important consideration than water yield. Analysis of reference and managed streams on the Flathead National Forest suggests no relationship between bankfull width and the degree of management (Kendall 2011), a finding that is consistent with the results of MacDonald et al. (1995). Grant et al. (2008) conducted a comprehensive literature review and determined no field studies have made a direct link between peak flow increases and channel impacts. Grant et al. (2008) concluded that the effects of peak flow increases are relatively minor in comparison to other anthropogenic changes to streams and watersheds. In general, channel impacts associated with peak flow increases alone are likely to be much less significant than other impacts associated with forest management activities. Management-induced increases in peak flow generally diminish with the percentage of watershed impacted and increasing recurrence interval. Management effects on peak flow events over a 6-year recurrence interval are highly speculative (Grant et al. 2008). Considering the merits of all viewpoints and the above analysis, increases in water yield or peak flows are not anticipated to be detectable at the HCU10 scale (5th order stream) and negligible stream channel alteration form increased flows are expected from the Clear Creek project. Project design measures including no-cut harvest buffers, green tree retention guidelines, low to moderate severity prescribed burning, and implementation of Best Management Practices would reduce likelihood of increased water yields. 3.11.6.3.3 Sediment Yield As described in direct effects section, the NEZSED model predicted an increase in sediment yield as a result of proposed activities. For a true cumulative effects analysis, sediment yield, as modeled by NEZSED, would have been calculated for the entire HUC10 watershed and routed to the mouth of Clear Creek. Since the downstream half of the watershed does not include FS lands, no landtype information is available, which is a necessary component of the NEZSED model. Instead, sediment yield was routed to Clear Creek at the Forest Service Boundary. There is no Forest Plan Appendix A sediment yield guideline at this scale.  Figure 24 shows the predicted sediment yield percent over base increased at the Forest boundary from Clear Creek project activities for each alternative. Estimated percent increase in sediment yield is highest in Alternative C at 24%, followed by 23% for Alternative B, and then 21% for Alternative D. Estimates included the existing sediment yield over base from past project activities, plus the additional sediment yield generated from the Clear Creek project. Sediment yield percent over base declines below the existing amount in 2025 (as modeled) due to road decommissioning activities. Road density in the Clear Creek watershed was reduced from 2.7 mi/mi2 to 2.6 mi/mi2.  Graph that shows the estimated sediment yield at the Forest Service boundary over time.Figure 24: Sediment Yield Percent over Base (Natural) for Clear Creek at Forest Service Boundary (Note: Includes National Forest System land only) An upward trend analysis following guidance from Conroy and Thompson (2011) was completed for the project (Appendix J). The analysis showed that although there would be short term increase in sediment yield, there would be long term improvement over the existing condition (Appendix J). Implementation of project design measures, adherence to BMPs, and maintenance of no-cut PACFISH buffers would reduce potential erosion and further limit the risk of sediment reaching streams. Any sediment yield increases would be short-term (0–6 years following project activities), and beneficial uses in Clear Creek and the Middle Fork Clearwater River would be maintained. 3.11.6.4 Potential Changes to Conditions from the 2015 Baldy Fire The Baldy Fire started August 10, 2015 and was included in the Elk City Complex incident. A portion of the Baldy Fire extended into the Clear Creek project area, although no proposed treatment units were affected. The fire perimeter encompassed approximately 1381 acres in the Clear Creek project, of which 369 acres resulted with moderate or high soil burn severity. Only the South Fork Clear Creek HUC12 watershed was affected by the fire. This watershed contains the Kay Creek and South Fork Clear Creek Forest plan prescription watersheds. Table 24 displays the acres of unburned area and acres of soil burn severity for the two prescription watersheds. Table 24: Soil Burn Severity for Baldy Fire within the Clear Creek project area Prescription Watershed Fire Perimeter (Acres) Unburned (Acres) Low Burn Severity (Acres) Moderate Burn Severity (Acres) High Burn Severity (Acres) Kay Creek 10 7 2 1 0 South Fork Clear Creek 1,371 620 383 314 54 Definitions of burn severity and vegetation lethality are described in the Table 25. Burn severity does not directly equate to fire intensity. Burn severity is field verified during Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) assessments. Table 25: Soil Burn Severity and Vegetation Lethality (Debano et al. 1998) High High Fire Severity: High soil heating, or deep ground char, occurs, where the duff is completely consumed and the top of the mineral soils is visibly reddish or orange on severely burned sites. Logs can be consumed or deeply charred, and deep ground char can occur under slash concentrations or burned our logs. All shrub stems are consumed and only the charred remains of large stubs may be visible. This generally equates to less than 40 percent of the trees exhibit no visible damage, with the remainder fire-damaged, largely by root-kill; less than 60 percent of the fire-damaged trees survive. Moderate Moderate Fire Severity: Moderate soil heating, or moderate ground char, occurs where the litter on forest sites is consumed and the duff is deeply charred or consumed, but the underlying mineral soil surface is not visibly altered. Light colored ash is present. Woody debris is mostly consumed, except for logs, which are deeply charred. On shrubland or grassland sites, gray or white ash is present and char can be visible in the upper 1 cm of mineral soil, but the soil is not altered. This generally equates to 30 to 70 percent of the trees exhibit no visible damage, with the remainder fire-damaged; 40 to 80 percent of the fire-damaged trees survive. Low Low Fire Severity: Low soil heating, or light ground char, occurs where litter is scorched, charred, or consumed, but the duff is left largely intact, although it can be charred on the surface. Woody debris accumulation are partially consumed or charred. Mineral soil is not changed. Fire severity in forest ecosystems is low if the litter and duff layers are scorched but not altered over the entire depth. The surface is mostly black in a shrubland or grassland ecosystem, although gray ash can be present for a short time. This generally equates to at least 60 percent of the trees exhibit no visible damage, with the remainder fire-damaged by scorched crowns, shoot-kill (top kill but sprouting), or root-kill (top kill and no sprouting); over 80 percent of the fire-damaged trees survive. ECA numbers were updated due to the change in vegetation. Using the information from Table 26, percent of vegetation survival was used to determine the extent of equivalent clearcut acres for low, moderate, and high burn severity acres. For example, on high burn severity acres, it was assumed that only 30% of the trees survived; while on low severity burned acres, it was assumed 80% of the trees survived. Table 26 displays the increase in ECA for each of the watershed size scales used in the FEIS analysis for Alternative C. The final ECA amounts are below the threshold guidance set in the FEIS analysis. Table 26: ECA Summary for Alternative C Modified Watershed Existing ECA Clear Creek Project Percent Increase in ECA (2015 FEIS) Baldy Fire Percent Increase in ECA Total Percent ECA Threshold Guidance ECA Percent Kay Creek Forest Plan Prescription Watershed 2% 1% 0% 3% 20-25% SF Clear Creek Forest Plan Prescription Watershed 1% 8% 2% 11% 20-25% Watershed Existing ECA Clear Creek Project Percent Increase in ECA (2015 FEIS) Baldy Fire Percent Increase in ECA Total Percent ECA Threshold Guidance ECA Percent South Fork Clear Creek HUC12 1% 7% 1% 10% (rounding) 15% Clear Creek HUC10 4% 9% <1% 13% 15% The NEZSED model was also updated to include the Baldy fire (NEZSED version 2016). Low severity acres were modeled as “low” with a coefficient of 0.2, moderate severity acres were modeled with a 0.5 coefficient, and high severity acres were modeled as “wildfire” with a coefficient of 1. Results were an estimated increase of 0.01 tons/year for Kay Creek (<1% over base) due to the Baldy fire and 2.9 tons/year for South Fork Clear Creek ((<1% over base). These amounts were incorporated into the management existing estimates in the 2016 NEZSED model runs. 3.12 Wildlife This incorporates the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project FEIS (September 2015) by reference.

The following discussion summarizes the effects to wildlife in the project area caused by wildfire. Following this discussion are the specific updates to the FEIS (2015) for each species listed above. Wildfire Effects Wildfire occurrence in the past eight years (2010 to 2017) has burned approximately 418,035 acres on the Nez Perce Forest. Of this potential habitat for woodpeckers, only 3,228 acres (less than 0.01%) have been salvaged or reduced by some form of timber harvest. While recent snag habitat created by wildfires in the CCIR Project Area appears low, the Nez Perce Forest offers a large amount of habitat for woodpeckers, especially the black-backed woodpecker. Hutto and Patterson (2016) found an 11-year period of the woodpecker’s presence in a mixed fire event that contained moderate to low-severity burned areas that bordered the more severely burnt areas. Presence of the woodpecker’s occupancy in severely burned forest conditions was noted in many studies that suggested a 4-8 year post-fire window (Saab et al. 2007, Hoyt and Hannon 2002, Murphy and Lehnhausen 1998, and Hutto 1995). Research in Idaho fire events (Dudley et al. 2012, Dudley and Saab 2007, Saab et al. 2007) found that beyond 8 years, food availability decreased and the foraging habitat declined rapidly. Potential wildlife snag habitat in ponderosa pine declined by over 50% in about 8 years after the fire event (Ritchie et al. 2013). The researchers also noted that the increase in downed woody material created a higher fire risk that potentially threatened the existence of the standing snags. Of this potential habitat for woodpeckers, only 3,228 acres have been salvaged or some other form of timber harvest. This is less than 0.01% of woodpecker habitat affected on the NP Forest. Effects of Baldy Wildfire 2015 The Baldy Fire occurred in the summer and fall of 2015. The fire burned 5,121 acres, with about 750 acres located within the project boundary of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project (CCIR). Three proposed regeneration harvest units were affected: 48 acres at low burn severity, 40 acres in 2 of the units were moderate severity. The effects of the wildfire to analyzed species (TES, Sensitive Species and MIS) and their respective wildlife habitats within the CCIR Project Area follows. Threatened Species Canada Lynx A portion of the CCIR encompasses a lynx analysis unit (LAU). The latter unit is used for determining disturbances (natural and man-made) and effects on lynx habitat. The Baldy Fire burned in LAU (Lynx Analysis Unit) 30. The fire burned with mixed severities in 775 acres of lynx habitat (denning and foraging habitats). Low fire severities were considered as unburned or low burn severity. The latter burned light fuels, and left trees, some shrubs, and downed woody material. These low burn severities would not be considered as a factor in changing lynx habitat to a stand initiation phase. Fire severities from moderate to high affected about 238 acres of lynx habitat (denning and foraging habitats). These burn severities would return the affected area to a stand initiation phase (early seral forest succession), which creates a temporary loss of lynx foraging habitat. In 25 to 30 years, the vegetation would be recovered to the stage of providing foraging opportunities to a lynx. Standing snags would fall to the ground in 5-20 years from the effects of decay, wind or snow. Large piles of downed woody material would create potential lynx denning habitat. Cumulative effects of the recent fire, past fires, harvest history, and proposed CCIR harvest present a 20% disturbance of lynx habitat in the LAU. Guidance from the NRLMD (USDA 2007), Standard Veg S1 states no more than 30% of the lynx habitat in an LAU should be in a stand initiation structural stage for additional vegetation management projects to occur. The LAU meets the standard, and provides about 80% of denning and foraging habitat for lynx. All other NRMLD objectives, standards and guidelines for lynx are being met. Wildfire effects to lynx would be displacement to other habitats in the LAU for denning and foraging opportunities. Small mammals would be displaced from the burned areas until forage develops (5-15 years). In 25-30 years, the trees would be tall enough to protrude above the winter snowpack. At this stage, the snowshoe hare (preferred prey for lynx) would have habitat for its survival and expansion. As the prey base moves into the recovering forest, lynx hunting opportunities would return to these areas again. In summary, the wildfire event created a short-term loss (25-30 years) of habitat that will be regenerated into forage and denning habitat in 5-20 years. Discussion with FWS 11-10-2015: Service agrees that a natural event occurred, and no re-initiation of a BA is necessary. Sensitive Species Black-backed Woodpecker About 650 acres of dead or dying trees would count as new habitat for the woodpecker. This habitat would be available for up to 8 years after the fire event. The fire was a positive event for this species: creating foraging and potential nesting habitat. Fisher The fire burned about 380 acres of potential fisher probable habitat. Tree canopy was basically consumed and the affected trees are dead or dying; basically they have become snags. Individuals may be displaced from the burned areas for 20-30 years, until recovering trees offer the canopy cover and tree structure the fisher prefers. During the period of reduced tree canopy, snags would fall to the ground, creating forage habitat for the predator. A fisher may wander from the adjacent unburnt forest edges into the burnt areas to hunt for prey. Flammulated Owl About 1 acre of potential owl habitat was burned by the fire. This would likely create a minimal to no effect on the owl or its habitat. Fringed Myotis About 1 acre of potential bat roosting habitat was burned by the fire. This would likely create a minimal to no effect on the owl or its habitat. Long-legged and Long-eared Myotis About 380 acres, or 2% of bat roosting habitat were affected by the fire. Loss of snags would reduce habitat, while trees burned by low to moderate severities may become snags that offer new habitat for roosting bats. After these snags age and fall to the ground, it may take another 80-90 years for snags to develop in the area that could function as roosting habitat. About 3-10 years postfire, vegetation recovery would create habitat for insects that nectar or feed on plants. These invertebrates would provide foraging opportunities for the bat species. This recovery is beginning to occur, as it has been about 3 years since the wildfire occurred. Summary: short-term loss/gain of snags for roosting habitat, long-term recruitment of next snag cohort, short to midterm (3-40 years) gain of forage for the bat species. Mountain Quail No effects from fire to habitat. North American Wolverine No loss of habitat for critical winter period. Pygmy Nuthatch Less than one acre of habitat affected. Fire would increase habitat potential in any fire-killed ponderosa pine or Douglas-fir. Ring-necked Snake No effects from fire to habitat or animal. Western Toad The western toad has shown an increased occurrence in burned habitats: more so in severely burned habitats than partially burned habitats (Guscio et al. 2008) Fire has increased habitat on southerly aspects for the toad. Approximately 110 acres of new habitat was created for the toad. Management Indicator Species (MIS) American Marten About 593 acres (3%) of marten habitat were burned by the fire. This a loss of habitat that won’t become suitable for 50 to 150 years post fire. Northern Goshawk The fire created a loss of 134 acres (6%) of potential nesting habitat. About 80% of goshawk nesting habitat remains, with future recruitment of more habitat from unburned riparian areas. Goshawks would hunt the burned areas after forage has recovered in 5-15 years. Pileated Woodpecker 11 acres, or less than 1% of woodpecker nesting habitat was burned by the fire. The pileated woodpecker would benefit from any fire-killed tress that become snags. Rocky Mountain Elk Elk would be temporarily displaced from the burned areas for about 3 years. At this date, vegetation is beginning to recover in the areas affected by fire. As grass, herbs and shrubs grow in the burned areas, forage would continue to increase for elk. This forage production would last up to 15-20 years post fire. Shiras Moose The fire did not burn in any MA-21 (designated moose winter range) in the CCIR project area. The fire did burn in other areas that are potential winter moose habitat. Most of these areas were burned at low severity, which would not cause a loss of habitat potential. About 316 acres experienced moderate burns, which would temporarily remove the habitat potential for these affected acres. This would reduce the available potential habitat by 4%. Shrubs will become available as moose forage in 5-15 years. The preferred tree structure for moose habitat would return to the burned landscape in about 90 years. Neo-tropical Migratory Birds The fire would displace all birds preferring unburned forest conditions. Depending on the bird species the displacement may last for up to 2 years in lightly burned areas, while more severely burned areas may not recover a dense tree canopy for up to eighty or more years. Other species that thrive on burned areas or regeneration in such areas would benefit. 3.12.3.1.1 Snags The myotis bats analyzed in the FEIS use tree snags, as well as large live trees, caves, mines, buildings, bridges and crevices in rocks. Snags may offer roosting habitat for the bats during their summer stays on the Forest. Roost-site selection for long-legged myotis in Idaho were found in forested areas that were surrounded by lesser amounts of edge than forests in Oregon and Washington (Lacki et al. 2010). Pileated woodpeckers would use retained snags in units, if a supply of prey is apparent in the dead or dying tree. Large ponderosa pine snags would be retained in units in the design criteria; which is also a recommendation by McClelland and McClelland (1999). Black-backed woodpeckers prefer dead or dying trees infested with beetle outbreaks for up to 8 years. After this period the bird moves on to more recently created habitat by fires and insect or disease infestations. Researchers have found that snags provide resting and denning sites for marten (Buskirk and Ruggiero 1994, Bull and Heater 2000, Bull et al. 2005), as well as fisher (Raley et al 2012, Schwartz et al. 2013). Stumps and cavities in snags can serve as protection from predators, provide thermal insulation, and birth sites for both weasels. Snag retention is discussed in the Design Criteria section of Chapter 2 (p. 2-9) of the FEIS. Forest Plan Amendment #42 (FEIS, Appendix D), would increase the amount of retained snags above the Forest Plan Standard, Appendix N. The latter appendix required 1-2 snags/acre with tree sizes between 12-20” DBH (diameter at breast height). Snag retention would follow Regional guidance (Bollenbacher 2009). Large snags would be retained among live trees in clumps of 7-10 trees or more per acre. Green tree retention in all regeneration and improvement harvests would average 14-28 trees per acre: which would include 9-14 snags/acre. Of this, an average 5 snags of 15" or greater would be retained in areas affected by timber harvest. The snag retention recommended by the Regional guidance is the average number of snags/acre found in untreated forests on the Nez Perce Forest. Thereby, timber harvest prescriptions would be maintaining snag numbers found in the natural state. In the proposed harvest units, snags may be lost or reduced due to safety issues that may endanger personnel involved in timber activities. Post logging activities may reduce snags during site preparation (prescribed burns). Additionally, wind events may knock down snags left in the recently harvested unit. In some cases, the burns may kill live,” retained”, trees; thus creating new snags. The prescribed burning for the Clear Creek Project has potential to create new snag habitat for both bats, woodpeckers, and the pygmy nuthatch. Silvicultural prescriptions would retain all large Ponderosa Pine, as well as plant the tree species in units in drier sites. Though action alternatives would occur in 11-14% of the bird’s potential habitat, the retained (pine) trees would continue to provide nesting and foraging habitat for the nuthatch. American marten and fisher generally avoid open areas, such as those created by timber harvest. However, retained snags near the forested edge of harvest units may offer potential resting or denning habitat for these mammals. As these harvest units transition to young forest (10+ years after the disturbance), both predators are known to use these areas for sources of prey. Non-forest associations are used upon occasion during summer, and martens may hunt in open meadows bordering dense forests if hiding cover is present (Hargis et al. 1999, Buskirk and Powell 1994).The fisher is known to hunt in harvested units that are producing young forest if overhead cover is present (Sauder and Rachlow 2014, Raley et al. 2012, Weir and Harestead 2003, Jones and Garton 1994). The Clear Creek Project would use Forest Plan Amendment #42 (FEIS, Appendix D) to retain or recruit more snags per acre than the Forest Plan Standards. The numbers and diameter at breast height (dbh) for snags would vary according to the habitat type of the unit (see FEIS 2015, Appendix D). 3.12.4 Methodology Table 3-44 of the 2015 FEIS (page 3-191) is updated as follows: Table 27: UPDATED Table 3-44 (2015 FEIS p. 3-191) Habitat Criteria Used to Identify Suitable Wildlife Habitat in Analysis Area Wildlife Species Primary Tree Speciesa Tree Diameter (inches dbh) Tree Canopy Cover (%) Age Class (years) Suitable Habitat (Acres) Canada Lynx (Threatened) Denning Foraging – – – 1,102 1,309 North American Wolverine Modelled areas of persistent snow period - - - 95 American Marten SAF, S, LLP, GF, WRC - >30 >100 19,712 Black-backed Woodpecker All Species; burnt, diseased or insect infested >10 >40 >40 2,971 Fringed Myotis PP, DF >12 <30 >100 276 Long-legged Myotis Long-eared Myotis All Species >15 All >100 16,464 Fisher – Summer – Winter WRC, GF, DF, LPP, SAF, S >13 Sapling/Young >40 >40 >100 - 9,847 13,380 Flammulated Owl PP, DF >15 40-60 - 983 Mountain Quail All Habitats in VRU 3 - - - 187 Northern Goshawk Nesting PP, DF, WL, LPP, GF, WWP >13 >35-70 >50 1,932 Pileated Woodpecker Nesting Dead or dying PP, WL, DF, WWP, GF, WRC >20 25-60% - 3,131 Pygmy Nuthatch PP, DF >15 25-60% - 983 Ringneck Snake VRU 3 – – – 3,030 Western Toad Uplands All species on southerly aspects All <30 – 620 Moose Winter (MA 21) Mapped MA 21 Outside MA 21 – – – 2,700 7,840  a PP- ponderosa pine; DF- Douglas-fir; WL-Western larch; WWP-Western white pine; LPP- Lodgepole pine; GF- grand fir; WRC- Western redcedar; S- Englemann spruce; SAF- Subalpine fir 3.12.5.2 Threatened, Endangered, Candidate or Proposed Species (TES) 3.12.5.2.1 Canada Lynx During the Baldy Fire (2015) 1,824 acres burned at moderate to high severities in lynx habitat, reverting the affected forest to a stand initiation stage. Cumulative effects to the affected Lynx Analysis Unit (LAU) include past disturbances, the Baldy Fire (2015) and the action Alternatives for the CCIR Project. Combined this would create 20% stand initiation stage in the Project Area. This is below the 30% threshold for disturbance as established by the NRLMD (USFS Regional Guidance for lynx management). Foreseeable Projects (Tinker Bugs and Red Moose Project would not occur in the LAU evaluated for the CCIR Project. All other guidelines in the NRMLD are met, and review by the USFWS concurs that the CCIR Project would still meet the May Affect-Not likely to Adversely Affect determination as originally designated in the FEIS. 3.12.5.3 Region 1 Sensitive Species 3.12.5.3.1 Fringed Myotis Habitat loss from the Baldy Fire was 1 acre. The cumulative effects, including the wildfire, did not change the effects determination found in the 2015 FEIS. 3.12.5.3.2 Black-backed Woodpecker This discussion provides supplemental information to the FEIS 2015 (pages 3-205 to 3-209) Discussion The woodpecker does not undergo latitude migrations as other species do, but responds to dramatic changes in forest structure such as fire and insect outbreaks (Dixon and Saab 2000). The authors considered the bird as an “Irruptive” species that forages on beetle larvae found in recently burned habitats or areas of insect outbreaks (Dixon and Saab 2000).  Though mainly associated with burnt habitat, the woodpecker has been observed in various conifer-type forests. However, the species may also respond positively to lower intensity fires such as controlled burns (Russell et al. 2009), and it also occurs to some extent in unburned forests (Dixon and Saab 2000, Tremblay et al. 2009). Hutto and Patterson (2016) found the woodpecker’s presence in a mixed fire event that contained moderate to low-severity burned areas that bordered the more severely burnt areas over an 11-year period. The movements of black-backed woodpeckers to the periphery of the burns suggest that beetle populations may have decreased within the interior of the burns (Rasmussen et al. 1996). Beetle dispersal into adjacent unburned forests could potentially provide critical foraging habitat at 4–5 years post-fire, when black-backed woodpecker nesting densities decline in burned forests (Saab et al. 2007). During periods of infrequent forest fires, green forests adjacent to old burns may play a role in maintaining local populations of black-backed woodpeckers until new forest burns are created. Additionally, unburned areas adjacent to the burns likely provide fledglings with increased hiding cover from avian predators. This might be particularly important when fledglings are <15 days old, a time when fledglings are relatively immobile and adults deliver their food. After the 15-day period, fledglings are more fully developed and better able to fly long distances, up to 2 km between successive relocations (Saab et al. 2007). Presence of the woodpecker’s occupancy in severely burned forest conditions was noted in many studies that suggested a 4-8 year post-fire window (Dudley et al. 2012, Nappi et al. 2010, Saab et al. 2007, Hoyt and Hannon 2002, Murphy and Lehnhausen 1998, and Hutto 1995b). Research in Idaho fire events (Dudley et al. 2012, Dudley and Saab 2007, Saab et al. 2007) found that beyond 8 years, food availability decreased and the foraging habitat declined rapidly. Potential wildlife snag habitat in ponderosa pine declined by over 50% in about 8 years after the fire event (Ritchie et al. 2013). The researchers also noted that the increase in downed woody material created a higher fire risk that potentially threatened the existence of the standing snags. Dudley and Saab (2007) examined home range size of Black-backed Woodpeckers in forests of southwestern Idaho during 2000 and 2002 (6 and 8 years following fire). Black-backed Woodpeckers are closely associated with disturbed habitats where beetle populations may readily colonize (e.g., especially early post-fire habitats; Hutto 1995). One male had a home range 2–3 times larger than other males; and was often located at distances of >1.4 km into adjacent unburned forest, where he foraged in patches with scattered dead and dying trees. Mixed fire severities may create conditions that promote a steady supply of dying trees, diverse prey resources, and habitat longevity extending beyond the first few years post-fire (Nappi et al. 2010). Updated Habitat The 2008 fire mentioned in the FEIS (FEIS, p. 3-206) is currently not likely providing habitat for the black-backed woodpecker. The event is past the time period for offering the best forage. Habitat likely remains available from the 2011 moth outbreak that affected about 2,321 acres. The burned area from 2015 Baldy Fire, within the CCIR Project Area, provides about 650 acres of potential habitat. Combined habitat from these disturbances provide about 2,971 acres of current habitat to the woodpecker in the Project Area. The woodpecker would remain in or near the Baldy Fire perimeter until its food source diminishes to the point where forage efforts are not beneficial to the bird. The modelled habitat for the woodpecker (Samson 2006b, Bush and Lundberg 2008) is now outdated. The District Biologist utilizes updated database records on wildfire history on the Nez Perce Forest as the best available science for discussion of potential habitat available for the black-backed woodpecker. Wildfire occurrence in the past eight years (2010 to 2017) has burned approximately 418,035 acres on the Nez Perce Forest. Of this potential habitat for woodpeckers, only 3,228 acres (less than 0.01%) have been salvaged or reduced by some form of timber harvest. While recent snag habitat created by wildfires in the CCIR Project Area appears low, the Nez Perce Forest offers a large amount of habitat for woodpeckers, especially the black-backed woodpecker. It is important to reference the larger scale of habitat, since this species is known to respond and relocate to such disturbances as fire and insect outbreaks (Dixon and Saab 2000). These more recent fires would host new generations of bark and tree-boring beetles that would provide a large pulse of forage for the BBWP and other woodpeckers, over a period of less than a decade. Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A – No Action No changes from the 2015 FEIS (page 3-207) Alternatives B, C, and D Updates to 2015 FEIS (pages 3-207, 3-208) Acres of habitat affected by the action alternatives would not change, however, percentages are adjusted to change in potential habitat of 2,971 acres. So potential habitat affected by Alternative B is 17%, Alternative C (17%), and Alternative D (15.5%). Project activities may disturb (noise, movement by man or machine) an individual black-backed woodpecker located in an area undergoing timber harvest activities. Cumulative Effects Updates to 2015 FEIS (pages 3-207, 3-208) The Baldy Fire (2015) created an additional 650 acres of potential black-backed woodpecker habitat. The roadside salvage project in 2016 reduced about 27 acres of burnt trees adjacent to roads that are located outside of the CCIR Project Area. This did not affect the 2,971 acres evaluated as habitat for the woodpecker in the project area. On the Forest scale, about 415,000 acres are available as potential habitat for the woodpecker. Snag standards would meet Forest Plan standards and proposed landscape burning (Action Alternatives) on 1,370 acres would create more potential woodpecker habitat. The Action Alternatives would create more potential habitat for the bird than the No Action Alternative. Two other projects are proposed for areas adjacent to the CCIR Project area. The Tinker Bugs and Red Moose Projects are proposing timber harvest of dead or dying trees as an activity for both projects. At this point, the scale of harvest and/or other activities have not been proposed for analysis: so potential affects to the woodpecker and/or its habitat are unknown. 3.12.5.3.3 Fisher This information supplements 2015 FEIS (pages 3-209 to 3-213)). A more recent study (Schwartz et al. 2013) of fisher habitat corroborated the findings of Jones 1991: fishers appeared to avoid stands of ponderosa or lodgepole pine. The 2013 study also found that fishers selected mature and old growth forests during the summer in Idaho: similar results as Jones and Garton (1994). Cumulative Effects Alternatives B, C, D (2015 FEIS, page 3-212) Cumulative effects changes include two projects proposed for areas adjacent to the CCIR Project area. The Tinker Bugs and Red Moose Projects are proposing timber harvest of dead or dying trees as an activity for both projects. At this point, the scale of harvest and/or other activities have not been proposed for analysis: so potential affects to the fisher and/or its habitat are unknown. 3.12.5.3.4 Flammulated Owl This discussion provides supplemental information to the FEIS 2015 (pages 3-213 to 3-216). The last regional update of flammulated owl habitat showed 39,579 acres of potential habitat on the Nez Perce Forest (Bush and Lundberg 2008). Some public comments questioned the analysis of habitats for the pygmy nuthatch and flammulated owl. The comments indicated that the amount of habitat for both species would be the same. Both species are associated with dry forest habitats that host ponderosa pine. Upon review of the comment the Biologist found that the differences in habitat between the two birds cannot be analyzed due to the VMap model ranges for canopy cover. Therefore, the same habitat was delineated for both birds. Tree ages do not necessarily capture the size of the tree for this analysis. Therefore, the age factors in Table 3-44 of the 2015 FEIS (page 3-191) are dropped, and changed to 0. Potential habitat was calculated at 983 acres for both species, as reflected in the DSEIS (Table 27). Changes in DSEIS compared to the FEIS In the 2015 FEIS analysis of the flammulated owl (FEIS pp. 3-213 to 3-216), an age factor of 100+ years was used as a factor for determining potential habitat. In discussions with the silviculturist, tree growth on the NPCNF could attain a 15” dbh in 50 to 60 years , and trees aged between 60 to 100 years could attain a dbh of 15-20” dbh. Therefore, the tree age factor of 100 years used in the FEIS did not capture all the potential habitat (trees > 15 dbh) available to the flammulated owl as shown in Table 3-44 in the FEIS (page 3-191). Therefore, this update for the SEIS drops the 100-year age factor to capture the full potential of habitat for the owl, and effects from the Baldy Fire, resulting in 983 acres of available nesting habitat for the raptor. Direct and Indirect Effects – Alternatives B, C, and D Correction of 1,371 acres proposed for landscape burning. All action alternatives propose the same amount of acres to be burned. This treatment would occur in 138 acres of owl habitat (habitat found through use of V-Map model, which was not available for 2015 FEIS). The treatment would improve affected owl habitat by decreasing the density of smaller trees by low severity burns, and maintaining the large trees and overstory. More openings would result: providing a plant understory that would support increased insect populations as forage for the bird. The 1,100 acres proposed for burning that is outside of present owl habitat would likely increase owl foraging habitat by hundreds of acres in areas that burn at low to moderate severities. PCT would occur in owl habitat, and would increase foraging habitat, as it occurs in younger, dense stands that are not presently providing habitat. The treatment would open up the canopy, reducing competition among trees and creating small openings that may attract flying insects and bugs for the owl. All action alternatives would affect 25 acres (2.5%) with this treatment. PCT is an improvement treatment for maintaining the owl’s forage opportunities in young seral forest. Commercial thinning would occur in owl habitat, and it would improve flammulated owl foraging habitat opportunities: the prescription would reduce tree densities, creating more open forest structure where flying insects would be easier to detect by the raptor. The benefits of more accessible forage would probably last no more than 15 years, as the treatment would encourage natural succession of grand fir or Douglas-fir (species that would shade out open areas and reduce prey for the owl). Nesting habitat would remain the same in these units, as most large ponderosa pine would be retained. Potential nesting habitat may be lost if dead or dying mature pine is removed, as this is the likely structure (dead branches, tree cavities) the owl would prefer for nesting. Forage for the owl would improve under Alt. B in 14 acres, Alt. C (9 acres) and Alt. D (14 acres). No improvement harvests would occur in flammulated owl habitat. Regeneration harvest prescriptions would create openings in the unit, with some individual trees or patches of trees being retained. Large ponderosa pines and other species of legacy trees would be retained. However, this type of harvest unit would be very open with a single tree canopy, and likely not provide nesting structure and limited foraging habitat for the owl. Forage would recover over time, but the sparse retention of ponderosa pine would probably not support habitat for the owl. Proposed regeneration harvest in flammulated owl habitat would reduce habitat by 8 acres in Alt. B, 13 acres in Alt. C, and 8 acres in Alt. D. Tree retention would consist of an average of 14-28 trees per acre with a focus on ponderosa pine, western larch and healthy Douglas-fir. To summarize the treatments in owl habitat, PCT would improve owl habitat by 2.5%, and prescribed fire would improve habitat by 14%. Burns would potentially increase habitat by a few hundred acres. Commercial thinning would improve habitat by approximately 1% in all action alternatives. Regeneration harvest would reduce potential owl habitat by 1% in all alternatives. Prescribed burning, CT and PCT would improve owl habitat by producing more open areas for forage opportunities. Additionally, burning has the potential to increase owl habitat by nearly 1,100 acres. Cumulative Effects (Replacements) Flammulated owl habitat would be reduced about 1% from regeneration harvest. All other treatments would improve owl habitat by approximately 17.5% in all action alternatives. Prescribed burning is likely to increase flammulated owl habitat in the Project Area by a few hundred acres. All proposed activities would have the potential of disturbing or displacing the owl during implementation of the Project. Disturbance factors of noise and movement by man and machine are likely to cause a nearby bird to leave or flee the area of operations. Fire suppression discussion in FEIS still applies in this section. Besides the Clear Ridge Project mentioned in the FEIS, the Johnson Bar Fire Salvage is at or near completion. Two other projects are proposed for areas adjacent to the CCIR Project area. The Tinker Bugs and Red Moose Projects are proposing timber harvest of dead or dying trees as an activity for both projects. At this point, the scale of harvest and/or other activities have not been proposed for analysis: so potential affects to the flammulated owl and/or its habitat are unknown. The rest of the Cumulative Effects Summery still applies as well as the determination of effects (2015 FEIS pp. 3-215, 3-216). In summary, the Action Alternatives would improve and increase flammulated owl habitat. 3.12.5.3.7 Wolverine The mammal’s status changed from a Forest sensitive species to Proposed Threatened in July 2016. The Wolverine model used in the FEIS has been replaced with a more recent model available to the Region. The latter model was based on research published in Inman et al. 2012, and is relevant to this Forest as it provides for the species viable population in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Primary habitat for the dispersal of female wolverine was considered as alpine areas or elevations near tree line that experience persistent snow periods. The Project Area contains about 95 acres of such habitat: spread out among six small polygons that lie partially within CCIR boundary. None of the alternatives propose activities in these potential habitats. Therefore, no primary habitat would be affected by the proposed project, and the project will not jeopardize the continued existence of the Wolverine. This is a change to the FEIS report (FEIS, pp.3-319 to 3-321), and replaces the effects section of the Wolverine report. For more information on the analysis, consult the Programmatic Biological Analyses in the Wildlife (Appendix F). 3.12.5.3.8 Pygmy Nuthatch The following is supplemental information to the 2015 FEIS (page 3-22 to 3-222) As mentioned in the Flammulated Owl section (Section 3.12.5.3.4) of this document, the nuthatch is analyzed with the same habitat attributes as the owl. Research on the nuthatch shows the mean tree dbh (size class) of the nest tree was ≥ 15” dbh (Ghalambor and Dobbs 2006). So the wildlife “habitat criteria table” (Table 3) has been adjusted for tree size, the tree age factor will be removed (similar rationale as explained in the owl section), and canopy cover has been modified to 25-60%. Other changes to the 2015 FEIS section of this species follows: Direct and Indirect Effects – Alternatives B, C, and D Correction of 1,371 acres proposed for landscape burning (FEIS pp. 3-221). All action alternatives would prescribe burning in 138 acres (14%) of nuthatch habitat. This treatment would improve or increase habitat for the nuthatch by decreasing the density of smaller trees by low severity burns, and maintaining the large trees and overstory. More openings would result: providing a plant understory that would support increased insect populations as forage for the bird. 1,100 acres proposed for burning that is outside of present pygmy nuthatch habitat would likely increase foraging habitat by hundreds of acres in areas that burn at low severities. PCT would increase foraging habitat, as it occurs in younger, dense stands that are not presently providing habitat. The treatment would open up the canopy, reducing competition among trees and creating small openings that may attract prey for the nuthatch. It would not impact trees greater than 10” dbh: retaining all large trees in the units. All action alternatives would improve habitat by 25 acres (2.5%) with this treatment. Commercial thinning would occur in the bird’s habitat. The prescription would reduce tree densities and creates a more open forest structure. This structure would enable some species of flying insects to deposit egg masses in the crevices of tree bark where the nuthatch forages (Kingery and Ghalambor 2001). The authors note that the bird also forages on beetles, wasps, ants, caterpillars and true bugs, and during winter the nuthatch consumes pine nuts. Nesting habitat would remain the same in these units, as most large ponderosa pine would be retained. Potential nesting habitat may be lost if dead or dying mature pine is removed, as this is the likely structure (dead branches, tree cavities) the nuthatch would prefer for nesting. Forage for the owl would improve under Alternatives B and C by 14 acres, and by 9 acres in Alternative C. Forage improvement would be about 1% in all action alternatives. No improvement harvests would occur in pygmy nuthatch habitat. Regeneration harvest prescriptions would create openings in the unit, with some individual trees or patches of trees being retained. Large ponderosa pines and other species of legacy trees would be retained, and included in the 14-28 trees/acre on average in the unit. This type of harvest unit would be very open with a single tree canopy. This prescription is the most likely action that would reduce some nesting habitat for the bird. Therefore, regeneration harvest is considered as a harvest that would reduce potential nesting habitat for the bird. Proposed regeneration harvest would reduce nuthatch habitat by about 1%: 8 acres in Alternatives B and D, and 13 acres in Alternative C. Other discussion in FEIS (pp. 3-221, 3-222) is still relevant to this chapter. Cumulative Effects Pygmy nuthatch habitat would be improved by about 17.5 % from prescribed burning and thinning in the action alternatives. Regeneration harvest would reduce nuthatch habitat by about 1% in these alternatives. Burning that occurs outside of the bird’s present habitat has the potential to increase habitat for the bird in the Project Area. All proposed activities would have the potential of disturbing or displacing the nuthatch during implementation of the Project. Disturbance factors of noise and movement by man and machine are likely to cause a nearby bird to leave or flee the area of operations. The rest of the Cumulative Effects Summery still applies. In summary, the Action Alternatives would increase pygmy nuthatch habitat. Cumulative effects changes include two projects proposed for areas adjacent to the CCIR Project area. The Tinker Bugs and Red Moose Projects are proposing timber harvest of dead or dying trees as an activity for both projects. At this point, the scale of harvest and/or other activities have not been proposed for analysis: so potential affects to the nuthatch and/or its habitat are unknown. 3.12.5.3.10 Western Toad The Baldy Fire increased habitat by approximately 110 acres for the Western Toad on southern aspects burnt by the fire. The cumulative effects, including the wildfire, did not change the effects determination found in the FEIS (2015). 3.12.5.4 Management Indicator Species 3.12.5.4.1 American Marten Marten habitat was analyzed at the same canopy cover and tree species as Bush and Lundberg (2008), with the exception of tree dominance groups not represented in the project area: popular, birch, and hemlock. Cumulative Effects The following is supplemental information to the cumulative effects section of the 2015 FEIS (page 3-229) Past harvest history (1930s to present) in marten habitat affected 3,157 acres. The age class for stands of 100 years or older was obtained from TSMRS data (old stand exams). Such data showed the 20,305 acres of such age. Reduction of habitat by the Baldy Fire left 19,712 acres. Additional foreseeable actions include two projects proposed for areas adjacent to the CCIR Project area. The Tinker Bugs and Red Moose Projects are proposing timber harvest of dead or dying trees as an activity for both projects. At this point, the scale of harvest and/or other activities have not been proposed for analysis: so potential affects to the marten and/or its habitat are unknown. 3.12.5.4.2 Northern Goshawk The following is supplemental information to the cumulative effects section of the 2015 FEIS (page 3-230 to 3-232). One study found that timber harvest treatments had no effects on goshawk re-occupancy, nesting success, or number of fledglings between harvested and unharvested nesting areas (Moser and Garton 2009). Cumulative Effects Cumulative effects changes include two projects proposed for areas adjacent to the CCIR Project area. The Tinker Bugs and Red Moose Projects are proposing timber harvest of dead or dying trees as an activity for both projects. At this point, the scale of harvest and/or other activities have not been proposed for analysis: so potential affects to the goshawk and/or its habitat are unknown. 3.12.5.4.3 Pileated Woodpecker The following is supplemental information to the cumulative effects section of the 2015 FEIS (page 3-233 to 3-236). Some comments on the CCIR Project DEIS desired the inclusion of a couple of research articles: Bull et al. 2007 and Bull and Holthausen 1993. Though both references are included in the FEIS (3-233 and 3-234) the Biologist has included a short segment from the research. One group of researchers conducted a study on the density of pileated woodpecker nesting pairs in areas before and after timber harvest activities (Bull et al. 2007). In six of the seven study areas, the density of the nesting pairs were unchanged, or increased or decreased by only one pair. In these sampled areas, the amount of mature and old forests decreased by less than 25%, with consistent pileated woodpecker densities. One area had a nesting decline from five pairs of nesting birds to one pair over the period, after earlier timber harvests. Mature or old-growth stands had been reduced from 50% to 3% in this study area, over a 30-year period. One effect of forest disturbance on the woodpecker was an increase of raptor predation on pileated woodpeckers in the study areas. The decrease in protective cover was considered a factor in the decline of woodpecker presence in the study areas (Bull et al. 2007). Bull and Holthausen (1993) recommended that home range habitat should consist of about 75% in grand fir forest types of mature and older trees with >50% canopy closure and limited harvest activities. This was based on the forest type and research the authors conducted in northeast Oregon. The research was conducted on unharvested green forests before large insect outbreaks occurred across landscapes in northeastern Oregon. Old growth areas in the Project Area would probably be the closest comparison as to the conditions the authors refer to. The Project Area supports 11% verified old growth, and another 4% of unverified old growth. There would be no harvest of old growth in this Project. Both research articles were conducted in different forest habitats than what is present in the CCIR Project. The moister habitat types in the Project Area host a greater variety of disease and rots in tree species, which can make trees more susceptible to insect infestations. The vegetation section of the FEIS mentions that approximately 76% of the PA may be susceptible to insect and disease activity. This process would create more potential for dead and dying trees, and thereby the potential for increased woodpecker habitat. As mentioned in the FEIS (2015), no harvest would occur in old growth forest and snag retention guidelines would leave more tree structure in units than the prescribed standards in the Nez Perce Forest Plan. Direct, indirect and cumulative effects are the same as in the FEIS (page 3-236). Cumulative Effects Cumulative effects changes include two projects proposed for areas adjacent to the CCIR Project area. The Tinker Bugs and Red Moose Projects are proposing timber harvest of dead or dying trees as an activity for both projects. At this point, the scale of harvest and/or other activities have not been proposed for analysis: so potential affects to the pileated woodpecker and/or its habitat are unknown. 3.12.5.4.4 Rocky Mountain Elk This section replaces the elk analysis completed in the FEIS (pp 3-236 to 3-243). Direction from the Forest is to utilize the elk analysis by Servheen et al. 1997, instead of the older elk guidelines referenced in the 1987 NP Forest Plan. The more recent guidelines were developed from multi-agency input: Forest Service, IDFG and the Nez Perce Tribe. Additionally, the Forest has assigned road and trail access designations in a more recent document (pending signature): “Designated Routes and Areas for Motor Vehicle Use, or DRAMVU, for the Nez Perce Forest. The selected alternative for DRAMVU is a science-based approach that identifies risks and benefits of forest system roads as they pertain to safe and efficient travel and the protection, management, and use of the national forest. Relevant literature concerning elk management on the Forest is described in the next few paragraphs. Background: Elk is a MIS for commonly hunted big game species on the Nez Perce National Forest, and a management indicator species for general forest seral species easily affected by management activities. Elk are habitat generalists and use a diversity of forest types and structures that provide forage and hiding cover (Unsworth et al. 1998). They forage in meadows and early seral communities from spring through early summer, use more closed canopies from late summer through fall, and rely upon low elevation, warm aspect, and snow-free or snow-limited areas for foraging in the winter. Adult bulls often winter at much higher elevations than cows and immature elk. Elk also require forest cover for security and thermal regulation (Thomas et al. 1979); although the results of Cook et al. (1998) did not find that such forest cover significantly enhanced the condition of elk in winter or summer. The latter study did not assess effects of topographic or other landscape features that could enhance energy conservation by protecting from wind or enhancing absorption of solar radiation. Nutritional resources are the most important factors associated with elk summer resource selection (Ranglack et al. 2016, Alldredge et al. 2002). Recent nutritional studies have employed models for analyzing seasonal forage to the autumn body condition and pregnancy rates (Cook et al. 2017, 2016), calf recruitment (Middleton et al. 2013), and body-fat-pregnancy relationships (Proffitt et al. 2016, Ranglack et al. 2016). Wildfire, prescribed fire and thinning would create forage for elk, though nutritional quality of the new or recovering forage would vary during the growing seasons (Proffitt et al. 2016, Long et al. 2008b), as well as the type of forest habitat being managed. Selection of such forage would vary among elk bulls and cows (Long et al. 2008a, 2009). Both elk and cattle graze on grasses, while elk are more likely to browse on leguminous plants (Stewart et al. 2003). Elk appear to avoid areas that cattle are using if other foraging habitat is available (Coe et al. 2001, Christensen et al. 1993). Other research showed elk would forage in the same areas/pastures as cows (Yeo et al. 1993). Elk foraged at lower elevations when cattle were absent, but moved to higher elevations and steeper country when cows occurred (Stewart et al. 2002). The latter study surmised that this behavior indicated a shift in niche for elk; or a competitive displacement of elk by cattle. Calving areas can be traditional and preferred sites are generally large meadows, shrub fields and early seral forest openings in close proximity to water. A mosaic of diverse forest, shrub field, and meadow conditions with available water, productive winter range, and adequate security characterizes good elk habitat. Elk and Forest Roads: Roads affect elk security/vulnerability, as they can fragment habitat, create disturbances that shift elk distribution away from roads, and decrease daily movements and size of home ranges of elk (Rowland et al. 2005). Individual animals can be displaced from preferred habitat due to increased disturbance, and the animals are more vulnerable to human-caused mortality (Servheen et al. 1997). Roads built into elk habitat increase hunter access and elk vulnerability to harvest (Unsworth et al.1993, Christensen et al. 1993). The type of road, type of vehicle, traffic volumes, timing of vehicle use, and visibility (topography, vegetative cover, etc.) all play a part in how roads affect elk vulnerability and security across the landscape. During archery season elk may use areas further from (Ranglack 2016, Ranglack 2017), or closer to (Rumble 2005), roads as compared to pre-season. However, elk consistently use areas away from roads during rifle season. Security is the result of a combination of factors that allow elk to remain in a specific area while under stress from hunting (Christensen et al. 1993). "Security area" (the structural constituent of security) is the area that will, during periods of hunting stress, hold elk because of geography, topography, vegetation, or a combination of those features (Lyon and Christensen 1992). A security area is defined as at least 250 contiguous acres that are more than one half mile from open roads (Hillis et al. 1991). The security area would provide hiding cover, which is defined as ". . . vegetation capable of hiding 90% of a standing adult elk from human view at 200'; generally, any vegetation used by elk for security or escape from danger (Thomas etal. 1979).” Reducing the effects of disturbance from roads and hunting has been suggested by expanding vegetation buffers (Ranglack et al. 2017, Frair et al. 2008, Rowland et al. 2005, Rowland et al. 2000), or adjusting the size of elk unit to be analyzed (Rowland et al. 2005, Boyce et al. 2003, Unsworth et al. 1998, Christensen et al. 1993). (Montgomery et al. 2012), discussed the influence of different road types on elk space use across seasons by gender, and other elk habitat considerations. Data was analyzed on how road closures to motorized vehicles during the elk seasons of 1992-1995 on the NPCNF would influence hunter density and success (Gratson and Whitman 2000). The authors concluded that road closures may significantly reduce densities of elk hunters during general elk seasons. However, the study suggests that some hunters benefited from changes in both elk behavior and environmental factors associated with road closures: such roads may have provided quiet access in elk habitat, leading to increased encounter rates between hunters and elk. Closing roads also may have increased elk use of habitat along roads due to the lack of motorized disturbance (Wisdom 2004), as elk can return with-in days to weeks after disturbance (Lyon and Ward 1982). Thus, rates of encounter between hunters and elk may have been greater along closed roads than encounter rates along open roads (Gratson and Whitman 2000). Population Trends: Elk populations in the Analysis Area were relatively insignificant until a series of major fire events occurred in 1919, 1928, and 1934. These wildfires increased forage availability and population levels up to the 1950s. Since then, lower forage levels and increased predator pressure have decreased numbers of elk in the Rocky Mountain areas of central Idaho. In response to declines in elk numbers, IDFG replaced the either-sex hunting regime in 1976 with an antlered-only general hunting season. Elk herds then began rebuilding. (IDFG 2017). Short-term goals are to stabilize the current population and increase control management of predators in this zone. The proposed project lies within the Elk City Zone, which consists of three Game Management Units (GMUs). The zone has experienced historical reductions in elk habitat from agriculture and ranching on the prairie areas, mining along river valleys, and logging and road development in the general forest (IDFG 2017). Besides human factors, natural predation of elk occurs from mountain lion, black bears and wolves. During elk surveys in 2015, the zone’s population was below objectives for cows and bulls. IDFG states the numbers were under-estimated, due to the lack of snow and elk not present on the winter range due to climatic conditions (IDFG 2017). State biologists mention that the survey results were not representative of actual elk numbers. IDFG aerial winter surveys in 2008 estimated over 4,200 cows and 863 bulls (218 of those were adult bulls). The 2008 harvest count was considered as achieving its objective in 2008 (IDFG 2017). The CCIR Project Area is located in the west portion of Game Management Unit 16. Unit data between 2006 and 2008 show cow and bull elk numbers increased and both sexes met population objectives. However, calf recruitment decreased from 27 calves per 100 cows (2006) down to 21 in 2008. The calf:cow ratio is an important indicator of population recruitment and long-term herd viability. A ratio of at least 25 calves to 100 cows is needed to offset natural mortality. Reasons for the decline are unclear but may be related to reductions in forage quality (poor condition of cows and low calf weights), high predation rates, less security area, and greater human disturbance and/or hunting pressure. The IDFG mentions that low calf recruitment is a concern in GMU 16 (IDFG 2017). The table below shows a more current status of the estimated elk population (aerial and other surveys): cows are meeting population objectives and bulls/adult bulls are above objectives for 2008, but not for 2015 as stated earlier. The number of calves was estimated at 154 during 2008, and no information for the 2015 survey flight (IDFG 2017). Table 28: Elk Population Status and Objectives for Management Unit 16 based on the Most Recent Survey Update (IDFG 2010-2015 Average) Mgmt. Unit Survey Year Current Status Population Objectives Cows Bulls Calves Total Cows Bulls Adult Bulls 16 2010-2015 897 275 154 1,326 800-1200 175-200 100-150 16 2015* 127 27 22 176 800-1200 175-200 100-150 * IDFG explains that the winter aerial survey (2015) shows elk numbers were below objectives. The agency warns that the survey should not have been conducted due to lack of snow, as elk were not on winter ranges, and survey results were not representative of actual elk numbers. (IDFG 2017). In the guidelines (Servheen et al. 1997) for elk analysis, the elk vulnerability (EV) model is used to measure hunter and motorized route densities to predict elk mortality rates. The EV model was designed to be applicable during hunting seasons for elk (Servheen et al. 1997), and is still used by the IDFG in their periodic reports. The Forest contacted Mr. Servheen in 2018 and asked about the bull adjustment factor in his vulnerability model. Upon review he replied that it is for standard use across the board and not just specific to the example [project]. (J. Lutes, personal communication, 2018) The Forest obtained data from the IDFG in the past year concerning information that can be utilized for calculating Elk vulnerability. GMU 16 encompasses around 248,350 acres, or about 388 square miles. Of this acreage, open road/trail density is 1.4 miles/square mile in the GMU. Hunter density during 2010-2015 hunting seasons averaged 6 hunter days/ square mile. The IDFG calculated an average annual (hunting or natural caused) mortality rate of 9% for cows and 42% for bulls, during the six year time period. Estimation of mortality rates (2008-2014) resulted in the predicted Bull:100 Cow ratio of 31:100 (IDFG 2015). This ratio appears high to the Biologist, as it is above the population objective for the zone (18-24 bulls:100 cows), and the latest elk report (IDFG 2017) states that “current perceptions are that elk have declined” in GMU 16. Lacking confident data, no current conclusion for elk vulnerability can be assessed from the inconclusive results of the 2015 aerial survey. Summary of EV discussion: The most recent data does not include statistics for 2016 or 2017, and survey data from 2015 was considered an underestimation by IDFG (2017). Comparisons of data from 2006, 2008 and 2010-2014 show elk numbers increasing for bulls and cows. Forest Service road and trail density in GMU 16 is 1.4 miles, with private or other ownerships comprising 0.4 miles. Elk Vulnerability is apparent from natural causes, hunting, predators (ie: mountain lions, wolves, and bears), and habitat (weed displacement of desirable forage, or diminished forage production from tree canopy closure). Elk Winter Range The Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a, p. III-46) designated MA 16 as big game winter range. The goal for MA 16 is to improve the quality of the winter range habitat for deer and elk through timber harvesting, prescribed burning, and other management practices. Winter range is primarily below 4,500 feet in elevation with southern-to-western exposures. The vegetative types included are non-forest grasslands, seral brushfields, and timbered lands. High quality forage is an important component of elk winter range. Elk eat grasses, forbs, shrubs and the tips of twigs from some woody vegetation. Shrub species such as redstem ceanothus, syringa, serviceberry, mountain maple, chokecherry and bitter cherry, provide much of the winter forage available to elk. When grass and forbs are covered in snow, elk mostly utilized shrubs in winter (Hodder et al. 2013). About 60,000 acres are located in winter range within the GMU. The Analysis Area contains about 15,060 acres of MA 16 winter range (34% of the Project Area). Winter range may be in contiguous blocks or occur in isolated parcels surrounded by summer range. In the CCIR Project Area, one block containing a 5,165-acre area is considered strictly winter range. Adjacent to this area is an elk analysis area (EAA) containing another 6,250 acres of winter range. The latter area also contains summer range. The remaining 3,600 acres are spread out in the Project Area: interspersed among six other summer range EAAs. The majority of winter range occurs in part of the Clear Creek Roadless Area or in areas closed to motorized use: providing high levels of secure habitat during the winter months. Most of the wintering elk in Clear Creek watershed are found in the Solo Creek and upper Clear Creek; where low open road densities provide security areas from winter recreation disturbances. Elk Winter Range, Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A – No Action There would be no direct effects to elk winter range under Alternative A as no activities would occur. In the absence of natural disturbances winter range forage quality and quantity would continue to decline as tree canopy cover increases and shades out understory forage. Insect and disease impacts may create openings for shrubs, forbs, and grasses, although not to the scale of wildfires. Fire suppression may reduce potential forage recruitment or increase the severity of wildfires due to increased fuel loading. Large wildfires would increase the amount of available winter forage though space and time. Without further disturbance after a fire event, forage quantity would decline and hiding cover would increase in about 20 years. Regeneration harvests from 1997 to present created 412 acres of forest openings within winter range in the project area. When forest succession ages to about 20 years, tree density and canopy cover has replaced most of the understory plants (grass, herbs, shrubs). Forage habitat is minimal to none, as the habitat becomes hiding cover. Harvests older than 20 years would be functioning as hiding cover for elk. Alternative A does nothing to create early seral habitats that would provide high quantities of forage. Cattle grazing occurs in the Project Area. The animals are mostly seen moving or grazing adjacent or near roads in the Project Area. Their permit for use does not include grazing during the winter months in the Project area; therefore, cattle are not competing with elk for winter forage on the Forest. However, their summer grazing and occasional browsing may reduce some potential elk winter forage in the locations the cows were present during the preceding seasons. Alternatives B, C, and D All alternatives use landscape burning on 536 acres (3.5%) and grass restoration on 41 acres of MA 16. Burning in late summer or early fall would increase growth or recruitment of shrub species and mimic natural fire seasons. Prescribed burns are usually ignited for reducing fine fuels and managed at low severities to avoid the loss of control or large hot fires. The burning of some small trees, shrubs and understory would reduce competition for sunlight and nutrients for the new grass and herbs that would pioneer plant succession the following spring. Long et al. (2008) found that forage cover was higher the following spring after a burn as compared to unburned areas, but the opposite occurred during the summer. About five years after the burn, new shrub growth would become available browse on the winter ranges. Shrubs would increase or persist for ten or more years, until trees overtake them or some other disturbance occurs. Winter elk habitat would be created, restored or maintained from the prescribed burns. The affected acres would likely provide improved forage opportunities for female elk during the following spring seasons (Long et al. 2008a & b, 2009). The authors found that male elk rarely used the newly burnt habitat, however, an overlap of both sexes occurred during summer. As the grasses and forbs senesce from the summer heat in open areas, elk are likely attracted to the forage in shaded areas along edges of the treated areas where forage is less cured. The burns would be spread out to create a mosaic of burned and unburned areas: a preferred situation to provide a long-term forage component on the landscape (Long et al. 2009). Burning may reduce hiding cover depending on the fire severity. The Biologist estimates that treatments at low intensity may affect hiding cover by 5-10% in the affected areas. Regeneration harvests (photo below) would remove hiding cover and leave less than 10% canopy cover in the units. Clumps of live trees and snags would be retained along with about 10-15 trees on average per acre. Alternative C proposes the most (1,800 acres) of this prescription, while Alt. B would affect 1,233 acres and Alt. D would affect the least (992 acres) amount of forest habitat. These areas would be very open, and elk security would be unlikely during daylight periods.  Picture depicting ClearcutFigure 25: Example of Regeneration Harvest Improvement harvests would retain more trees/acre (60-150) than the above timber prescription. Additionally, larger patches of live and dead trees would be retained, compared to the regeneration prescriptions. Upon completion, these units would retain about 40% canopy cover. Alternatives B and C would affect about 270 acres with this prescription, while Alternative D would affect about 158 acres. Upon completion of these harvests, the units would appear somewhat open (see photo below). However if an elk is present in or near one of the clumps, it may be screened from visual detection by the retained trees. Elk security would marginal: near clumps or areas of the unit not visible from roads. Figure 26: Example of Improvement Harvest The combined effects of regeneration and improvement harvest would result in the temporary reduction of elk hiding cover. The largest decrease of such would occur under Alternative C: 2,070 acres or about 14% of winter range in the Project Area. Alternative B would affect 1,503 acres (10%), and Alternative D would affect the least amount of hiding cover: 1,150 acres (less than 8%). Commercial thinning is a prescription for enhancing growth in desired trees. Smaller or less desirable trees would be removed, to allow more available sunlight and nutrients for the desired trees. Tree density would range between 100-200 trees per acre, with reserve clumps of live trees and snags no more than 1/4 acre in size. Harvest prescriptions for this type of thinning would basically consist of even spacing of retained trees and small patches of live and dead trees. Alternative C proposes the most commercial thinning: 953 acres or 6% of winter range in the Project Area. Alternative D would thin 747 acres (5%), and Alternative B would propose the least of the alternatives (513 acres or 3%). Thinning would have short term (<10 years) benefits on elk winter range forage. Thinning retains 40-60% of the canopy cover which allows limited shrub growth. Hiding cover would be reduced under all alternatives; yet the retained tree density and clumps would provide hiding cover for elk in areas of the units that are furthest from an open road. Elk security would be marginal: near retained tree clumps or areas of the unit that are not visible from a road.  Picture of Commercial thinFigure 27: Example of Commercial Thin  All the Alternatives propose precommercial thinning (PCT) in 559 acres (3.7%) of winter range. PCT reduces competition among the growing young trees. Tree densities are reduced in order to supply more space and nutrients for the retained trees to grow faster and develop into older trees. This treatment would have minimal effects on elk winter forage; as much of the upper canopy cover would be retained, while thinning of the smaller trees would encourage growth of grass, herbs and shrubs. After the treatment, tree densities about 100 yards from an open road would be thick enough to provide hiding cover for elk to forage or rest in the units. Human detection of elk along a road in these units is may be difficult.  Before and After Picture of Pre-commercial ThinningFigure 28: Before and After Photos - Precommercial Thinning A summarization of harvest prescriptions by action alternatives is displayed below.

The timeframe is 20 years: the time when tree canopy cover would begin to close and reduce the quality of elk winter forage. During 2014 the Johnson Bar Fire burnt about 4,500 acres of winter range that is adjacent to the proposed CCIR Project. The Johnson Bar Salvage Project proposed to harvest about 1,500 acres that were burned in the fire. During 2015, the Baldy Fire burned about 775 acres in the Project area. The fire was not located in or affected winter range. The combination of fire effects and salvage harvest would contribute to increased forage availability for elk on winter ranges adjacent to or within the CCIR Project Area. The developing forage in the burned areas is available for elk that may be displaced during the implementation of activities for the CCIR Project. Foreseeable projects include two proposed projects. The Red Moose Project is located at higher elevations and probably is not providing winter range. The Tinker Bugs Project is located adjacent to the Middle Fork of the Clearwater River: between the confluences of Clear Creek and the Selway River. Portions of the project lie in elk winter range. Both projects propose timber harvest, but only the Tinker Bugs Project would propose harvest in elk winter range. At this time, both projects are in the planning stages, and effects to elk and their habitat has not been analyzed. Alternative A – No Action The mentioned wildfire events and salvage harvest adjacent to the Project Area have reduced canopy cover and provided openings for elk forage to recover. Within the Project Area, winter range would continue to decline as forage is shaded out by the developing tree canopy. Some elk would likely move to recently burned or harvested areas at lower elevations outside of the Project Area. Forage could increase in the event of a wildfire however it is not possible to predict the amount or location. Alternatives B, C, and D The Action Alternatives would conduct regeneration or improvement harvest and landscape burning on up to 23% of MA 16 winter range. Alternative C would create the most openings and potential forage for elk winter range, followed by Alternative B, then D. In 2-5 years after prescribed burns, the digestibility and percent of nitrogen increased in forbs and grass for elk. By the fifth year these variables exceeded values found in unburned areas (Long et al. 2008)., The most benefit of forage availability would be for cow elk, as they selected for areas burned between 2-5 years post-burn during the spring (Long et al. 2009). The authors noted that male elk appeared to avoid these areas. Not all prescribed burning would occur at once. The treatment would occur over the implementation period of the Project, when conditions for low severity burns are appropriate. These treatments would create early seral habitats that provide high quantities of quality forage for about 20 years. Such treatments would meet the management intent to increase or improve big game winter range. All harvest units would be restocked with tree species that are more resistant to root rots, such as ponderosa and white pine, and western larch. The growth of the planted stock would gradually shade out understory vegetation. The action alternatives would meet Forest Plan standards for MA 16 by implementation of seasonal road closures as per the motorized travel guide, and restricting public access to temporary roads or other roads utilized by harvest activities. Upon completion of the proposed activities and the return of road closures according to DRAMVU direction, elk will use habitat near road networks that are consistently closed to vehicle traffic and receive modest levels of use by humans on foot (Montgomery et al. 2012). Project activities (timber harvest, road work (construction, maintenance, decommissioning), would disturb or create short-term displacement of individual elk. Timber sales would be spread out over a period of years, which would provide non-disturbed or recently created portions of winter range for elk to forage. Road access for motorized vehicles would decrease: creating less traffic disturbance to elk, and more or larger security areas. Road densities would drop from over 3 miles/square mile to 1.1 mile/square mile. The overall change in motorized access would create less elk vulnerability in the Project area. During winter months snowmobile activity would be restricted to roads that are open to motorized access. Such access would be limited to 75 miles. Insects and disease would continue to create openings for the limited growth of shrubs, forbs, and grasses. Fire suppression would continue and fuels would continue to increase in untreated areas. A large fire could significantly increase the amount of winter forage and would decrease hiding cover for elk; however predicting the time and size is not possible. Habitats would be less susceptible to wildfire because proposed treatments (improvement, regeneration, CT), and reduce crown fire potential on 4-6% of the Analysis area. Elk Summer Range The majority of the Analysis Area is considered summer range for elk. Important habitat components for elk include foraging sites, hiding cover, calving areas, rutting, and security areas. Forage availability and abundance has declined throughout the area due to a lack of disturbance (fire, timber harvest) and subsequent increases in tree copy cover. Hiding cover is available in forested stands that are 20 years or older. Elk Security areas are places where wildlife can retreat for safety when affected by disturbance. In general, security areas are over 250 acres in size and ≥0.5 miles from an open road or trail (Hillis et al. 1991). There are no forest plan standards for the amount of security areas to be managed. More recent studies have proposed larger buffer zones than the Forest direction of one half-mile on either side of a road. One study from the Starkey Research Station in north-east Oregon buffered roads up to 1.1 mile from a road (Rowland et al. 2005). Road densities in the study area varied (3.85 to 4.99 miles/sq. mile) depending on the alternative. The CCIR Project sits at 2.72 miles/sq. mile in the existing condition, potentially increases to 3.3 mi./sq. mi., then drops to 1.1 mi./sq. mi. upon completion of the Project. The road densities in the Project Area are much lower than those found in the north-eastern Oregon study area. Another group of researchers (Ranglack et al. 2017) suggest different metrics for hunting seasons in southwestern Montana. The habitat in their study area included conifers, sagebrush and grasses (fescue and wheatgrass). They proposed a mile buffer for motorized routes with a canopy cover >9% during rifle season and a 1.7 mile buffer with >13% canopy cover during archery season. Rationale for the varied recommendations were based on perceived elk vulnerability from disturbance by motorized traffic or potential mortality from hunting. Additional factors in the analyses include habitat type, topography, canopy cover, road densities, and motorized vehicle use (type of vehicle, traffic volumes, and timing of vehicle use). Both articles analyzed areas with different habitats than the Project Area. Road densities remained higher in the Starkey study, compared to any condition found in the Clear Creek IR Project. The lower canopy cover in the Montana study created more open habitats and an increased opportunity to detect elk: thus the greater buffers from roads. Both studies were in drier habitat types that support more open terrain: resulting in less tree canopy cover and sparser hiding cover for elk. All of these factors contributed to the concern for elk vulnerability to motorized access and hunting. The various road buffers mentioned by the researchers reflect their analysis of, and recommendations for consideration of disturbance and elk mortality in their respective study areas. Ranglack et al. (2017) took an additional step to distinguish different buffers according to the season of weapon type for elk hunting. The CCIR Project area is more densely vegetated with moister habitats as compared to the studies conducted in northeastern Oregon and southwestern Montana. Tree species in the Project Area range from ponderosa pine to western red cedar. Elk hiding cover is ubiquitous, with the exceptions being in areas of disturbances that have occurred in the past 5-10 years by fire or timber harvest, managed roads, or habitats that do not support tree growth. Such openings and cover have been analyzed for each alternative in each of the Elk Analysis Areas, using Servheen et al. (1997). This analysis is available for review in the Project file. Forest correspondence with Mr. Ranglack on the applicability of his model to the NPCNF revealed that it may perform poorly when applied to areas that are ecologically different from where the models were created (J. Lutes pers. comm. 2018). These findings allowed the Biologist to consider current literature and its potential application as analysis in the CCIR Project. Primarily due to the differences in habitats and road densities on the Forest compared to the Rowland et al. 2005 and Ranglack et al. 2017 reports, the Biologist’s professional opinion considers studies on the NP-CNF or other areas of similar habitats are the most appropriate to address elk vulnerability and security in this Project. Literature relevant to the NP-CNF included Christensen et al. 1993, and Hillis et al. 1991. Their findings contributed to the guidelines the forest uses for elk analysis. The half mile road buffer is appropriate for the habitat types and terrain located on the Forest. The “Interagency Guidelines for managing elk habitats and populations on U.S. Forest Service lands in Central Idaho” (Servheen et al. 1997) was used to evaluate summer elk range and considers road open road density, livestock grazing, cover-forage ratios, and security areas. Part of the guidelines included an analysis of elk vulnerability, which was discussed under the table in the “Population Trends” section of this elk report. The roads analysis employs the selected Alternative 5 modified of the pending DRAMVU project. Table 30: Elk Analysis Area, Summer Range Acres, and Open Road Densities Elk Analysis Area EAA Acres Summer Range Acres Open Road Density Name Number Total Project Area Total Project Area Existing Post Project (Range) Clear Creek 1 304064022 5059 4772 4733 4733 1.2 0.5 Clear Creek 2 304064021 6370 6184 5928 5830 0.8 0.5 Elk Analysis Area EAA Acres Summer Range Acres Open Road Density Name Number Total Project Area Total Project Area Existing Post Project (Range) Clear Creek 3 304064031 4702 4208 4593 4103 1.6 0.7 Brown Springs 304067152 7214 7103 6060 6060 1.0 1.0 Pine Knob 304067151 5425 2908 3022 1778 1.6 1.1 Solo Creek 304067171 5304 5203 4505 4413 1.5 0.8 S.

There are seven EAAs, and all areas would meet the objective of ≥50% EHE upon completion of the project (see table below). Table 31: Elk Summer Range Habitat Effectiveness by Alternative in the Clear Creek Analysis Area. Elk Analysis Area Summer Elk Habitat Effectiveness (%) Name Number Existing Condition During & Post Alternative B During & Post Alternative C During & Post Alternative D Clear Creek 1 304064022 51 52/69 52/69 52/68 Clear Creek 2 304064021 65 65/75 65/71 65/75 Clear Creek 3 304064031 48 43/64 43/64 43/63 Brown Springs 304067152 54 52/56 52/56 54/56 Pine Knob 304067151 48 48/50 50/55 49/55 Solo Creek 304067171 49 48/60 46/61 46/60 S.

The table above shows that three EAAs in the existing condition are currently below the 50% EHE recommended by the Forest Plan. Table 31 displays the EHE condition during implementation, and upon completion of each proposed alternative. During implementation of the alternatives, EHE may be reduced due to the increase of roads and openings created from harvest operations. In some cases EHE may remain the same or increase due to newly created openings that create forage in EAAs that are deficient in forage. Post project activities, all EAAs would improve. The three EAAs that were below 50% EHE standard would improve under all action alternatives to meet Forest Plan recommendations. If Alternative D was selected as the preferred alternative, EHE would remain the same as the existing condition for two EAAs: Brown Springs and South Fork Clear Creek. Spreadsheets for analysis of the EAAs under the alternatives are available in the Project File. Elk Summer Range, Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A – No Action Livestock are present in the Project Area, but represent a negligible factor to elk. The Project area lies in 2 cattle allotments. About 70 head use about 8 square miles for just the summer. The cattle usually move in small groups along a few road systems in the area, and graze along flats and spurs adjacent to the roads. They are unlikely to graze on steep slopes; leaving their activities and impacts confined to a very small part of the project area. Due to the low numbers, short period of use and use of about ten percent of the Project Area—livestock use did not create a deduction factor on elk use in the CCIR Project area. Weeds are present in the Project Area. They are mainly found along roads, but may also appear in units. Measures are taken to spray/wash down timber or fire equipment before their deployment on the Forest. About 7% of the Project Area is highly susceptible to weeds, and elk potential elk forage is likely affected by non-native vegetation. The Noxious Weed section in the 2015 FEIS goes into more detail about weed species. There would be no direct effects to summer EHE under Alternative A because no activities would occur. The lack of disturbance (natural or man-made) would create denser tree stands, and a reduction of potential forage for elk. Summer range would be more susceptible to wildfire when compared to the Action Alternatives due to increasing fuel loads resulting from fire suppression. A large wildfire would reduce hiding cover in the short-term (10–20 years) but would increase forage. All EAAs are meeting Forest Plan standards of at least 50% EHE. Alternatives B, C, and D All three alternatives propose prescribed burns in about 560 acres of winter range. Selection of new or recovered browse after burns or fire appeals to cow elk more so than bull elk, as mentioned in the winter range section of this report. Though the treatment is for creating or maintaining winter habitat, it would be grazed or browsed from the first spring after the burn, and up to five years at least by cow elk (Long et al. 2009). In other words, the fire treatment would benefit spring and summer forage for elk, as well as provide winter forage. Regeneration and improvement harvests would remove hiding cover and increase summer forage in the Project area. Alternative B treats 1,235 acres (8%), Alternative C (2,223 acres; 15%), and Alternative D (1,037 acres; 7%) of the Project area. Commercial and pre-commercial thinning would open the tree canopy to allow more sunlight and nutrient availability for the retained trees. Both prescriptions would maintain overhead canopy and some hiding cover, as well as create conditions for forage production. PCT would retain hiding cover within the treated units, and therefore is a minor contribution as effecting calculations for elk habitat effectiveness (Leege 1984). Table 32: Summer Range Harvest Treatments - Hiding cover and Forage Increase Action Alt. Regen & Improvement Commercial Thinning Precommercial Thinning Acres Hiding cover Reduction Summer Forage Increase Acres Hiding cover Reduction Summer Forage Increase Acres Hiding Cover Reduction Summer Forage Increase B 1235 4% 4% 4644 15% 15% 1259 1% 1% C 2209 7% 7% 3701 12% 12% 1259 1% 1% D 1034 3% 3% 4383 14% 14% 1259 1% 1% Summer Range in Project Area = 30,796 acres Hiding cover is vegetation capable of hiding 90% of a standing adult elk from human view at 200'; generally, any vegetation used by elk for security or escape from danger (Thomas etal. 1979). The treatments would create a change in vegetation: from closed canopy to more open. With the increase in light and nutrients, the vegetation understory would begin to recover. Grass, herbs and shrubs would become available as potential forage for elk. Invasive weeds may also become apparent in the more disturbed areas of the treated units: landings, roads, temporary roads and trails. Units adjacent to roads may provide forage for cattle that may be present in the Project Area. After the timber harvest units would be restocked with seral tree species that prefer more open canopies: ponderosa and white pine, and western larch. Over time the understory forage would decrease as Elk would take advantage of new forage at any season. During implementation of the proposed activities, road densities would increase due to the use of seasonal or closed roads and construction of temporary roads. None of the alternatives would construct permanent roads or change access restrictions on existing roads or trails. Increased road densities and new openings created by the alternatives from regeneration and improvement harvests would reduce security areas (see SDEIS Appendix F). A security area consists of at least 250 acres of contiguous cover, located at least . mile from an open road (Hillis et al. 1991), or motorized trail. All open roads and those used for project activities are buffered by one-half mile on each side of the road, due to potential disturbance to elk. All temporary roads opened or created for harvest operations would be closed to general public motorized access; though their use during operations would be considered an increase in road densities which would reduce security areas. Upon completion of Project activities, security areas are re-adjusted to accommodate for road closures and recently created openings. All temporary roads would be decommissioned. Road density in the Project Area would drop to 1.1mile/sq. mi (see DEIS Appendix F). Security areas would recover or increase with road/motorized trail closures and as vegetation matures to the point of providing hiding cover: about 10-20 years after treatment and tree planting. That said, Naylor (2009) found that elk avoided or travelled away from roads or trails with any type of activity: hiking, biking, horseback riding and ATV. His study showed that the greatest disturbance to elk or avoidance behavior toward a road or trail were related to ATV activity. Roads proposed for decommissioning are currently closed to the public, or are impassable to motorized vehicles due to fallen trees or thick vegetation. Decommissioning would have minimal effects on current elk security. It would permanently prevent any future motorized access, which would maintain elk security areas indefinitely. The EHE analysis is run as if all roads are open and all proposed units are being treated simultaneously. This exercise overestimates the impacts of project activities to elk. In reality, the harvest contractor would work a cluster of units within close proximity of one another. This reduces transportation costs and focuses the work to complete each unit before moving to the next. During treatment activities, roads used for access to units would remain closed to public motorized access. Direct and indirect effects would be disturbance to elk from activities conducted by machines and presence of man. Elk may be temporarily avoid areas with the above activities during daylight hours. However, during hours of darkness, elk may move into these areas to forage on the downed vegetation. Upon completion of treatments in the units, all temporary roads would be decommissioned and Forest Service system roads would revert to their present travel management restrictions (in most cases, closed to public motorized access by a barrier). So activities in the affected EAAs would occur as pulses of disturbance over time, leaving available areas for elk security that are not affected. Analyses during the implementation of each action alternative generally resulted in temporary reductions in EHE values below the existing condition (due to higher road densities and less security habitat). However, in some EAAs, the EHE level increased due to the expansion or creation of forage openings in Areas that had few to no openings. Upon completion of the action alternatives, all EAAs were meeting Forest Plan standards for EHE: equal to or greater than 50%. The CCIR Project would improve EHE levels in all seven EAAs beyond the existing condition! Upon completion of the proposed action Alternatives, forage quantity would increase for up to 20 years and then decline as tree canopy cover closes. Improvements in the quantity and quality of forage would benefit the condition of cow elk going into winter and ultimately improve calf survival. Elk Summer Range, Cumulative Effects The geographic boundary for assessing cumulative effects on elk summer habitat effectiveness is the combined seven EAAs within the 43,700 acre Project area. The time frame for cumulative effects is 20 years: the time it takes for new trees to provide elk hiding cover in the harvested areas. Alternative A – No Action The Baldy Fire in 2015 burned about 775 acres in the Project area. The fire was not located in or affected winter range. Two summer range EAAs were affected. The wildfire burned about 190 acres at high severity in the Clear Creek 1 EAA, and about 28 acres in the Clear Creek 2 EAA. The consumed trees are dead and will fall to the ground, over time, and create openings. Less severe fire severities caused a 50% tree mortality in 336 acres of Clear Creek 1 and about 200 acres in Clear Creek 2. The latter mortality would create some small openings, and leave pockets of trees and vegetation as hiding cover and forage. In 2016, a roadside salvage project occurred within the fire perimeter, and harvested about 39 acres of burnt trees adjacent to roads. The latter project was adjacent to the CCIR Project, but no harvest occurred in the affected EAAs. The ongoing Johnson Bar Fire Salvage Project is adjacent to the CCIR Project Area, and is salvaging dead trees in EAAs that are adjacent to those in the CCIR Project. This project will be completed in the near future, and before implementation of the currently proposed Project. Direct or indirect effects from the Johnson Bar Salvage Project may be noise (from man and machine) and increased traffic along open roads. Elk may move away from the noise and activity if disturbed. The salvage project will be completed before the CCIR Project begins. The new openings from the salvage Project would be producing forage for elk that may be temporarily displaced during the CCIR Project implementation. Foreseeable projects include two proposed projects: Red Moose and Tinker Bugs. The Red Moose Project is located to the east and northeast of the CCIR Project Area. The Tinker Bugs Project is adjacent to the CCIR Project: south of the Middle Fork of the Clearwater River, along ridges and pockets of dead or dying trees. Both projects propose timber harvest that may occur in elk summer habitat. At this time, both projects are in the planning stages, and effects to elk and their habitat has not been analyzed. Inside the CCIR Project area, Alternative A would not create direct or indirect effects. Therefore no cumulative effects would occur to modeled EHE since fire suppression is not considered in the model. Firewood cutting would continue to occur along roads that are open to public motorized access. Elk would probably avoid these areas until the activities are finished and the humans have departed. Summer forage would remain minimal, unless wildfire activity increases in the Project Area. Alternatives B, C, and D As mentioned, direct effects would be a reduction in hiding cover (7% to 15% depending on the alternative) across most of the EAAs. This reduction would create an increase in forage for the same percentage range. Indirect effects would be improved forage habitat for elk up to approximately 20 years. An increase in forage is desirable; as nutritional limitations are presumed to be a factor in low body fat found in autumn elk samples (Cook et al. 2016). The authors surmise that lower than expected productivity is occurring due to pregnancy rates in the GMU due to low summer nutrition (Cook et al. 2016, 2017). Elk security areas would be temporarily reduced from roads used and openings created during implementation of the action alternatives. Upon completion, most roads would be decommissioned or closed to public motorized access, increasing elk security to levels near the existing or pre-project conditions. Hiding cover would recover in 10-15 years. Elk habitat effectiveness would improve for all action alternatives, except for two EAAs if Alternative D was selected as the preferred Alternative. This Alternative would be the same as the existing condition, and greater than the 50% threshold recommended by the Forest Plan. Past road decommissioning from the South Fork/West Fork EA was already considered in the existing condition. The completed Clear Ridge Road Decommissioning project (2015) reduced roads and improved elk security areas. The ongoing Johnson Bar Salvage Sale (2016) would create additional foraging opportunities for elk. The foreseeable DRAMVU project would eliminate cross-country motor vehicle use on the forest. As mentioned, the foreseeable Tinker Bugs Project and the Red Moose project would conduct some timber harvest and road closures. The potential benefit to elk would be an increase of forage and reduction of roads that potentially affect elk security in the area. Besides the conclusion for the preceding effects, no other cumulative effects are anticipated except for wildfires or fire suppression. Wildfires may create more forage for summer range. Effects are unknown, as timing and size of such events are unpredictable. Fire suppression would strive to contain fires in the affected area(s). Firewood cutting would occur as mentioned under Alternative A. All proposed project activities would maintain EHE above Forest Plan minimal standards. Summary of Summer and Winter Range In summary, the action alternatives are meeting the Forest Plan standards for MA 16 winter range and EHE for summer habitat (all affected EAAs would be ≥50% EHE). Ongoing and foreseeable actions would disturb elk in or adjacent to such activities; however, habitat would not be lost, with the exception of potential private land harvest. The conclusion of the road decommissioning would increase elk security after the vegetation matures to a level of density that offers elk cover. Overall, the Forest Plans standards that this project meets Standards 1,5, 6, 10, Page II-5, and 6 from the 1987 Forest Plan (see 2015 FEIS, Table 3-42 pgs. 3-184 & 3-185). As far as the CCIR Project effects on Elk Vulnerability, the open motorized road densities would be reduced from 1.6 miles/sq. mi. in the CCIR Project Area to 1.1 mi./sq. mi.) During implementation of the proposed Project, the highest road density (1.6) would occur during the action alternatives in the Solo Creek EAA. Post project road densities for the seven EAAs range from 0.4 to 1.2. Road management activities that reduce motorized access can be positively associated with elk survivability (Cole et al. 1997). The openings created by the project would increase potential elk forage by 7-15%. This may increase elk numbers in the area, which may increase predation by hunters or other predators. Upon conclusion of each proposed action alternative, some sections of open roads and one trail (hereafter, referred as motorized routes) would be adjacent to harvested units that reduce elk hiding cover (regeneration, improvement or commercial thinning). These motorized routes adjacent to, or in recently harvested units may increase elk vulnerability during hunting season. Alternative B has the highest amount of roads adjacent to, or in such units (21.26 miles). Alternative C would have 20.38 miles and Alternative D would have 20.31 miles. For all of the action alternatives, the largest treatment prescription along roads is commercial thinning. This treatment retains more trees than the other two prescriptions, and the tree density would likely mask or hide an elk at 400 yards from an open road. Elk vulnerability may increase, but it cannot be quantified. Due to topography, and/or retention of trees and tree clumps, the location of the roads may not provide full view of the unit(s). Elk would likely forage in the affected units during hours of darkness. However, the tendency of bull and cow elk to avoid roaded areas in the fall (Montgomery 2013, Rowland et al. 2000) and open areas during the daytime (Rumble, 2005) would also mitigate some of the risks associated with increased vulnerability. Please see Appendix F for units associated with open roads. The action alternatives would meet Forest Plan standards for MA 16 winter range, and maintain EHE above the 50% threshold for each EAA in the Project Area. There are no Forest Plan standards for elk security. Ongoing and foreseeable actions would disturb elk in or adjacent to such activities. Habitat would not be lost, with the exception being land management on private property. Upon the conclusion of road decommissioning, road densities would decrease and elk security would increase as vegetation recovers in the abandoned and altered road prisms. Overall, the Project would meet Forest Plan Standards for elk: 1, 5, 6, and 10 in the 1987 Forest Plan. 3.13 Short-term Uses and Long-term Productivity NEPA requires consideration of “the relationship between short-term uses of man’s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity” (40 CFR 1502.16). As declared by the Congress, this includes using all practicable means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated to foster and promote the general welfare, to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans (NEPA Section 101). Short-term uses are those that generally occur annually. Long-term productivity refers to the ability of the land to produce a continuous supply of a resource. The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project would result in short-term impacts, but maintain the long-term productivity of the area through the use of specific Nez Perce Forest Plan standards and guidelines, design measures built into the project’s design, and project design criteria. A description of impacts expected by alternative can be found by resource area in the 2015 FEIS and the above supplemental discussions. The project would result in a long-term yield of forest stands by reducing competition and improving growth of individual trees. The project would also result in an economic return from wood products produced and jobs created. 3.14 Unavoidable Adverse Effects No unavoidable adverse effects have been identified. 3.15 Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments of Resources Irreversible commitments of resources are those that cannot be regained, such as the extinction of a species or the removal of mined ore. Irretrievable commitments are those that are lost for a period of time such as the temporary loss of timber productivity in forested areas that are kept clear for use as a power line rights-of-way or road. The action alternatives are not expected to create any impacts that would cause irreversible damage to soil productivity. The development and use of temporary roads and logging facilities is considered an irretrievable loss of soil productivity until their functions have been served and disturbed sites are returned back to a productive capacity.   Chapter 4 – Consultation and Coordination We consulted the following individuals, Federal, State, and local agencies, tribes and other organization and individuals during the development of this draft supplemental environmental impact statement: 4.1.1.1 Interdisciplinary Team Members (DSEIS - 2018) Jennifer Blake Responsible Official’s Representative Zoanne Anderson Team Leader & NEPA Specialist Margaret Kirkeminde GIS Specialist Joe Sullivan Fire / Fuels / Air Quality / Roadless Tam White, Dan Fabbi Economics / Logging Systems TBD Engineering Glen Gill Wildlife Biologist Karen Smith Fisheries / Aquatics Becca Lloyd Hydrologist / Soils John Warofka Rare plants / Non-native Invasive Plants Wes Case Silviculture Kearstin Edwards Recreation Mike Ward CFLR Coordinator / Roadless Cindy Schaecher Archaeologist Diana Jones Visual Quality Jenna Becar Public Affairs Specialist Christine Bradbury Tribal Liaison  4.1.1.2 Federal, State, and Local Agencies National Marine Fisheries Service National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  4.1.1.3 Tribes The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project has been presented at quarterly meetings with the Nez Perce Tribe since April 2012.

Recent actions leading to that decision, included a February 4, 2013 proposed rule to list the Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of North American wolverine in the contiguous United States as a threatened species by the Service under the Endangered Species Act. On August 13, 2014 the Service withdrew this proposed rule. In May of 2014, while the wolverine was initially proposed for listing, U.S. Forest Service Region 1 (Northern Region) developed a Programmatic Biological Assessment (Programmatic) for activities routinely conducted on National Forest Service Lands within the Northern Region, including the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest. This Programmatic relied on analysis presented in the Federal Register for the development of the original 2013 proposed rule and incorporated a category for specific activities regarding Forest management. The Service finding in the 2013 proposed rule was that the following proposed activities (listed below, and included in the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project) were not a threat to the DPS of North American wolverine. On May 23, 2014 the Service agreed with the U.S. Forest Service determination that the actions included in the Programmatic represented no jeopardy to the DPS of the North American wolverine. On June 15, 2016 the Service issued a memo to the Regional Forester confirming that the May 2014 concurrence letter regarding the Programmatic remains valid. Per FSM 1909.15 Section 18.1 the Responsible Official has reviewed this project for compliance with the Programmatic and has determined that the project falls under the Programmatic Biological Assessment for activities which represent no jeopardy to the DPS of North American wolverine. 1.

Most of this habitat (94%) is in Federal ownership, most managed by the U.S. Forest Service (FR at 7874). Year-round habitat for the wolverine is found at high elevations centered near the tree line in conifer forests (below tree line), rocky alpine habitat above tree line, cirque basins, and avalanche chutes that have food sources (FR at 7868). Deep, persistent, and reliable spring (mid-April to mid-May) snow cover is the best overall predictor of wolverine occurrence, possibly due to the species’ need for deep snow during the denning period (FR at 7872). Literature Cited Federal Register. 2013.

Road decommissioning, culvert replacements, and road improvements are proposed to improve watershed health, and the restoration of 41 acres of bunchgrass communities through re-vegetation with native grasses and forbs is proposed to improve vegetative diversity.  List broad categories of project activities separately (i.e., timber harvest; road reconstruction; prescribed burning; etc.) Timber harvest; Mechanical Equipment Use; Roads and Road Maintenance; Silvicultural Activities; Habitat Maintenance and Restoration; Prescribed Fire; Watershed Restoration  (acres of timber harvest; acres burned; miles of trail maintained, etc.)  10,500 acres of timber harvest; 1,371 acres of prescribed fire; 36 miles of temporary road construction (to be obliterated upon project completion); 13.2 miles of road decommissioning All Activity types proposed in this project show a finding in Appendix A of “Not a Threat.”  Therefore, the determination for the Clear Creek Restoration Project is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the DPS of the North American wolverine. Continuation of Column A: The Clear Creek drainage lies within the Middle Fork Clearwater River drainage near Kooskia, Idaho. The Clear Creek drainage totals 65,000 acres, with 33% (21,269 acres) in private or State ownership and the remaining 67% (43,731 acres) under the management of the Moose Creek Ranger District, of the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest. The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project area includes all 43,731 acres of NFS lands within the Clear Creek drainage (See Figure 1. Figure 1. All of the project area lies within the upper two thirds of the drainage. The project area is located approximately 5 air miles southeast of Kooskia, Idaho, within Townships 30, 31, and 32 N, Ranges 5 and 6 E, Boise Meridian. All proposed activities would take place within the boundaries of the Action area. Timing and Duration of project-Activities would begin in 2019 and have an end date around 2032. The action area would be parceled into 5 different timber sales over a 5-year period.  Map showing Flammulated owl and pigmy Nuthatch habitat and Clear Creek Treatment Units.Figure 29: UPDATED Flammulated Owl/Pygmy Nuthatch Habitat and Clear Creek Units Section 3 – Elk Analysis Appendix F, Section 3 of the 2015 FEIS is updated as follows: . Elk Security Map Analysis is added . Open Road Density Map Analysis is added . Open road Density and Unit Adjacency Map Analysis is added  Elk Security The Forest analyzed road buffers mentioned in recent literature (Rowland et al. 2005 and Ranglack et al. 2017) to determine if these studies would apply to the project concerning elk security areas. The Forest also analyzed proposed harvest units outside the suggested buffer to determine where there may be additional security issues. The following maps show a pictorial view of the analysis that has been completed. This map shows roads and trailsthat are currently open tomotorized vehicles during huntingseason. A 1/2 mile security bufferhas been applied as required bythe Forest Plan (Servheen).This map shows roads and trailsthat are currently open to motorizedvehicles during hunting season. A 1.1mile security buffer has been applied assuggested by literature from the StarkeyExperimental Forest.This map shows roads and trailsthat are currently open tomotorized vehicles duringhunting season. Security bufferssuggested by literature from theRanglack Group for rifle seasonhave been applied.This map shows roads and trails thatwould be open to motorized vehiclesunder DRAMVU.

Security bufferssuggested by literature from theRanglack Group for archery seasonhave been applied. It also showsproposed Alternative C harvest unitsthat may lack elk security based onprescription (Regen, Commercial Thin,or Improvement)Analysis reveals that for this project, literature relevant to the Nez Perce – Clearwater Forests included Christensen et al. 1993, and Hillis et al. 1991 whose findings contributed to the guidelines the forest uses for elk analysis. A one half mile road buffer is appropriate for the habitat types and terrain located on the Forest. The following map depicts the roads, trails and units that may lack elk security at the completion of the project under Alternative C. This map shows roads and trailsthat will be open to motorized vehicles duringhunting season under the pending DRAMVUdecision. A 1/2 mile security buffer has beenapplied to roads and trails as required by theForest Plan (Servheen).It also showsproposed harvest units that may lack elksecurity based on harvest prescription(Regen Improvement, or Commercial Thin)Open Road Densities Open road densities may also effect elk security. The Forest analyzed road densities to determine how they would be effected should this project be implemented. The first map in this analysis shows all potential motorized access for roads and trails known in the project area from various data layers: open roads/trails, closed roads/trails, decommissioned roads/trails and unknown linear prisms that appeared as some type of motorized prism with the use of a Lidar layer was calculated at 338 miles, with a road density of 4.95 miles/square mile. The second map examines all known roads in the area during the existing condition. Older decommissioned roads and unknown prisms were not evaluated, as they are not managed or recognized as accessible roads. This analysis showed about 207 miles of road, or a road density of around 3 miles/square mile. The third map displays Alternative C during Project implementation. This alternative proposes the most timber harvest. New temporary roads would be constructed and some previously closed roads would be opened to support access to timber units and haul roads. As expected, road density would increase (228 miles), resulting in an estimate of 3.3 miles/square mile. The final map shows the motorized access upon project completion and the anticipated signing of a new document for motorized use (DRAMVU). Road density in the Project Area would decrease to about 75 miles: road density would become 1.1 miles/square mile. The following maps show a pictorial view of the analysis that has been completed. This map shows past and presentroad templates existing within theproject area.This map shows current ForestService system roads and theiraccess status within theproject area.This map shows road typesthat would be open to motorizedvehicles during implementation ofAlternative C.Open Roads and Unit Adjacency This map shows Forest Servicesystem roads and their accessstatus at project completion underthe pending DRAMVU decision.Upon conclusion of each proposed action alternative, some sections of open roads and one trail (hereafter, referred as motorized routes) would be adjacent to harvested units that reduce elk hiding cover (regeneration, improvement, or commercial thinning). These motorized routes adjacent to, or in recently harvested units may increase elk vulnerability during hunting season. Alternative B has the highest amount of roads adjacent to, or in such units (21.26 miles). Alternative C would have 20.38 miles and Alternative D would have 20.31 miles. The following maps depict road and harvest unit adjacency by alternative. This map shows open roads and adjacent units for Alternative C.This map shows open roads and adjacent units for

Evaluation for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project (Updated June 2018) The analysis of expected trend in aquatic conditions is an important component of the aquatic and watershed assessments. Nez Perce Forest Plan Appendix A addresses trends in below objective watersheds with upward trend direction. Upward trend means that stream conditions determined through analysis to be below the Forest Plan objective will move toward the objective over time. Only streams that do not meet Forest Plan water quality objectives require an upward trend analysis. Cobble embeddedness is the measure used to determine whether an upward trend analysis is required. It is not the only parameter used to assess trend as directed by Forest Plan Appendix A guidance. It was determined that an upward trend analysis is required for: Pine Knob Creek, Middle and South Forks of Clear Creek, Hoodoo Creek, and Clear Creek prescription watersheds. A relative cumulative upward trend analysis, although not required by the Forest Plan, was also completed for all Forest managed lands in the Clear Creek watershed for the purpose of consultation. Additional information regarding restoration projects in the remaining prescription watersheds that do meet their water quality objectives is also included. Forest Plan Direction for Upward Trend The water quality objectives make up only a small part of the upward trend determination. The guidance for implementing Appendix A (Conroy and Thompson 2011) states the following: “Upward trend means that stream conditions that are below the Forest Plan objective will move toward the objective over time. Stream specific determination of existing condition and present or future improving trend should be done through a convergence of evidence using stream surveys, monitoring results, watershed condition inventories, literature reviews, predictive modeling, and professional judgment. It must be demonstrable that an improving trend is either in place and will continue, or that an improving trend will be initiated as a result of past, present and future management activities. The Forest Plan did not specifically intend that the improving trend be in place prior to initiation of new activities. It also did not specify a time factor for achieving fish/water quality objectives in below objective watersheds.” It goes on to say that,  “It was assumed in the Forest Plan that implementation of instream restoration and other watershed restoration activities would result in an upward trend in carrying capacity. Where these activities have been implemented, it could be stated that an upward trend in the habitat conditions has been accomplished. In previously degraded watersheds, especially those identified as below objective in 1987, if there have been no entries or natural disturbances over the past 10 to 20 years, it could be assumed that trend is either static or improving. If any watershed restoration has been implemented, or if a change in management (e.g. grazing and roads management) has resulted in fewer potential adverse effects to streams, an upward trend could be assumed in these cases as well.” Based on the Forest Plan guidance discussed above, and shown in the analysis that follows, upward trends have been initiated in watersheds not meeting their water quality objectives. This is due primarily to watershed restoration activities (road related work) since 2010 and the lack of timber harvest or road building in the last 20 years. Information Included in the Analysis Upward trend guidance is outlined in the “Implementation Guide to Appendix A of the Nez Perce Forest Plan” (Conroy and Thompson 2011). To assess the expected trend in aquatic conditions a variety of information and tools are used to arrive at a professional conclusion. Information used for this analysis includes stream surveys, monitoring results, professional judgment based on field surveys in Clear Creek, and recent literature. Modeling tools used to determine the potential effects of the actions include the NEZSED and FISHSED, and ECA. These models were used to assess potential changes on sediment and water yields. A more detailed effects analyses for all proposed Clear Creek Project activities can be found in the Aquatics and Watershed sections of the 2015 FEIS and this DSEIS. The most recent stream surveys were conducted by Stillwater Sciences on 27 miles of anadromous fish bearing streams. This information was used to update the baseline habitat data for project area streams. Different survey methods were used to collect cobble embeddedness between the 2011/2014 Forest Service data and the 2015 Stillwater data. The data are therefore not directly comparable; however both data sets are useful in assessing general stream conditions. Stillwater also collected embeddedness data in 2016 using FS protocols on the West Fork and mainstem Clear Creek monitoring sites. These data are comparable and were used to determine that neither the Hoodoo or Clear Creek prescription watershed met their Forest Plan water quality objectives. As noted by Sylte and Fischenich (2002) cobble embeddedness exhibits high spatial and temporal variability in both natural and disturbed streams. Sampling must be intensive within streams or stream reaches to detect changes. Intensive sampling has not occurred within Clear Creek or its tributaries so determining a trend for embeddedness based on limited data points is not appropriate. Cobble embeddedness alone is not used to determine upward trend. The presence, absence, or densities of fish species can aid in the determination of overall stream health, however densities can be highly variable and are difficult to tie specifically to land management activities or upward trend. This is especially true for salmon, steelhead, and lamprey which migrate to the ocean then return to spawn in local streams. These species are heavily influenced by factors that occur outside of the Clear Creek watershed (i.e., dams, fishing, and ocean conditions). If adults return in low numbers, then subsequent juvenile densities would also be low and not necessarily associated with watershed conditions in Clear Creek. The following Forest Plan upward trend analyses are associated with habitat conditions and not fish densities. This is in part due to these influencing factors combined with the lack of multiple data points. Trends in fish populations would be useful, if available, but are not required for determining whether or not an upward trend exists (Conroy and Thompson 2011). Stream temperature data is presented, however due to the influence of year to year weather patterns, trends cannot be easily determined. For example, several sites saw their warmest temperatures in 2015, a hot year regionally, but others were highest in 2011. At the Forest boundary, the warmest temperature was 20.1°C in 2015 and 19.6 °C in both 2016 and 1991, and coolest was in 1992 (14.7°C). Watershed Improvement Activities Included in the Analysis The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project proposes a variety of watershed improvement projects to improve watershed health and function and help to achieve upward trend. The project includes: decommissioning of 13.2 miles of system road, including the removal of 8 stream crossings and approximately 3 miles of non-system road (estimated amount that would be ancillary of system roads and would be identified during system road decommissioning surveys); road reconditioning along portions of 49 miles of system road; and road reconstruction along segments of 120 miles of system road, including replacement of 69 culverts on live streams with culverts sized for a 100 year flow event. Watershed improvement needs were identified during the pre-NEPA stage of the 2015 FEIS. Some of the concerns were addressed through projects that were completed under separate decision documents and were incorporated into the existing condition of the 2015 FEIS or the cumulative effects analyses as a future project. Although assessed during the same pre-NEPA assessment as the 2015 FEIS, it was determined that implementing these projects through separate NEPA and prior to the completion of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project would accelerate watershed recovery. The associated projects are described below and cumulatively summarized by project type in Table 35. South Fork/West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning Project EA, 2011 Decommissioning of approximately 10 miles of system road and 73 miles of non-system road, includes removal of 21 stream crossings. No fish bearing streams were involved. Clear Creek Culvert Replacements CE, 2011 Culvert removal/replacement of 11 culverts – 9 culverts on fish bearing streams were replaced with culverts that are at or wider than bankfull width to allow for stream bank development within the structure; 1 culvert on a non-fish bearing stream were replaced to accommodate a minimum 100-year stream flow event; and 1 culvert was removed. This project opened 1 mile of previously inaccessible habitat to native fish species. Browns Spring culvert Replacements and Road improvement Project Letter to File, 2012 Road improvement on 1.7 miles of Road 1124 and 1.3 miles of Road 1129. Replacement of two culverts on the 286 road. Road 286N Road Maintenance Project Letter to File, 2013 Reconstruction of 0.6 miles of Road 286N, including one culvert replacements. Road 650 Road Maintenance Project Letter to File, 2013 Approximately 15.5 miles of road improvement, including replacement of 35 non-water cross drain culverts. A total of 10.5 miles was conducted by the Forest Service and 5.0 miles were completed by Idaho County. Clear Ridge Non-System Road Decommissioning Project CE, 2015 Proposed project to decommission approximately 65 miles of non-system road, including removal of 15 stream crossings. This project has not yet been implemented. Table 35: Summary of Watershed Improvement Projects Proposed and Implemented in the Clear Creek Watershed 2011 - 2015 Activity Quantity Description Road System Decommissioning 23 miles Road decommissioning practices vary depending on the potential of landslides and other erosion conditions associated with the road, the land type the road is on, and its proximity to fish bearing streams. While some roads can be abandoned, most roads require full decompaction and slope recontouring. Generally, abandoned roads have no stream crossings, are well vegetated, are resistant to surface erosion, and are not prone to mass failure. Non-System Road Decommissioning 141 miles Non-system roads are old skid trails, jammer roads, or temporary roads used for past harvest activities. Soil would be decompacted and roads would be fully recontoured. Road Recondition 49 miles Portions of the total length would be treated as needed. Consists of standard maintenance, such as road blading, brushing, cleaning of culverts, removal of small cutslope failures, application of rock in wet spots and removal of obstructions such as trees, rocks, etc. Road Reconstruction 214 miles Portions of the total length would be treated as needed. Includes spot aggregate placement, blading, brushing and removal of obstructions, reshaping of drainage dips and road bed, and replacement or addition of cross drain and live water culverts. Culvert Replacements 113 On fish bearing streams, pipes are replaced with larger culverts that provide for all aquatic organism passage. They are wider than bankfull width and are open bottom arches or circular pipes with substrate added for stream simulation. On non-fish bearing streams, culverts are sized to accommodate a minimum 100-year stream flow event. Culvert Removal 45 Culverts are removed, stream banks are sloped back, and stream channels are restored. Vegetation Management and Temporary Road Construction Activities Included in the Analysis Vegetation management activities and temporary road construction proposed in the Clear Creek Integrated Management Project with the potential to increase erosion/sediment delivery or increase water yield are displayed in the table below. Table 36: Vegetation Management and Temporary Road Construction Activities Included in the Analysis Activity Alt.

Alternative C was used for this assessment as it has the largest NEZSED and FISHSED modeled effects. All other alternatives would have lesser effects than those discussed here. Current Condition Summary The upper two-thirds (43,700 acres) of the Clear Creek watershed is managed by the Forest Service and the lower third by state/private landowners. There are a minimum of 250 miles of streams on Forest Service lands and 17 miles on state/private. Roughly 65 miles are considered fish bearing on Forest Service lands and 15 miles occur on state/private. Streams throughout Clear Creek are important for Chinook salmon, steelhead, and westslope cutthroat trout as well as other non-game aquatic species. There are about 23 miles of suitable chinook habitat (primarily on the mainstem), 45 miles of steelhead habitat, and 80 miles usable by cutthroat trout. Stream temperatures on Forest Service lands are considered within optimal ranges (14–19°C) for juvenile salmon and steelhead, and cutthroat trout rearing for the majority of the year (EPA 2003). Temperatures on the mainstem below the Forest boundary are less than suitable for salmon and trout during the months of July, August, and early September but are suitable for the remainder of the year. The probability of finding bull trout is very low (range 9-14%) due to warmer than preferred stream temperatures throughout the watershed (Isaac, 2014). There is currently no trend data available for fish species in the watershed but based on recent surveys (Stillwater Sciences, 2015) and field observations in 2010 through 2012, fish are well distributed throughout the watershed. Overall fish distribution is consistent with 1988 and 1993/94 surveys as well. Stream substrates throughout the drainage vary from sand in the low gradient channels to boulders, rubble and gravel in the remaining channels. Cobbles and larger substrates dominate the streams. The larger substrates provide good rearing habitat for aquatic species. The most abundant anadromous spawning gravel is located in the mainstem and South Fork of Clear Creek. Resident spawning habitat occurs throughout the remaining streams. The percent of sand/silt ranged from 12 to 24%. Fish embryo survival is highest when the percent of fines is below 20% (Meehan, et al 1991). Cobble embeddedness showed a range of 30 to 37% on Forest lands and 20% in lower Clear Creek on private lands (Stillwater Sciences, 2015). Forest Service data from 2011/2014 ranged from 30% to 51%. The desired level (DFC) for cobble embeddedness is 20% or less (USDA, 1992) therefore existing conditions (regardless of the survey method used) remain above desired conditions. Granitic geologies that typically have a higher component of fine material and higher erosion rates can also contribute to higher embeddedness levels. Sediment levels that exceed desired conditions have likely affected the quality and quantity of habitat available for native fish species; however the extent is not known. Shallow water depths and lack of pool habitat were noted as issues affecting fish production in the middle and upper reaches of Clear Creek (USFS, survey data 1988). The same sediment, wood, and pool limitations were noted by surveys in 1993 (Forest Service) and again in 2015 (Stillwater Sciences). Low wood levels are considered to primarily be a result of large wildlfires that occurred over 45% of the area in the early 1900s. Stream bank stability was noted as good to excellent throughout the drainage from the 1988 through 2015 surveys due to the presence of dense streamside vegetation and large substrate (cobble, rubble, boulders) which armor the banks against the erosive power of the streams. Stable banks are more resistant to stream channel adjustments and bank erosion resulting from high stream flows. Regeneration timber harvest activities have occurred on approximately 22% of Forest Service managed lands since the 1930s with an associated 190 miles of road building. The current ECA associated with management activities both on federal and private/state lands is 4%, or a good condition based on the NOAA Matrix table (1998). An assessment of aerial photos shows that no-harvest buffers in riparian areas were retained since the 1960s on all but about 8% (15 miles) of the intermittent or non-fish bearing streams. Of the remaining 92%, buffers were a minimum of 50 to 100’wide and were retained on all fish bearing streams. Since PACFISH was adopted a total of 440 acres of regeneration harvest has occurred with appropriate sized buffers retained. Streamside buffers protect aquatic habitats by limiting sediment input and providing for shade and future woody material important for aquatic habitat development. A review of vegetative successional stages within PACFISH RHCAs indicates that 9% are early successional (< 40 years old), 34% are mid-seral (41-100 years), 57% older than 100 years. The majority of mid-seral forest is located in the South Fork, lower Hoodoo and lower West Fork Clear Creeks and are a result of the 1931 wildfire. Successional stage information combined with field reviews of the streams from 2010-2012 indicates that RHCAs are well vegetated and only minimally (9%) affected by previous timber harvest activities. No activities have taken place that would affect the RHCAs since the 2010-2012 field reviews with the exception of road decommissioning and culvert replacement projects. There are 190 miles of Forest system roads within the project area with most occurring along or near ridgetops with mostly small headwater stream crossings. There are 147 miles (77%) of graveled and 43 miles (23%) of native surfaced road. Placing gravel on roads has been shown to reduce sediment runoff from the road surface (Meehan 1991). Burroughs and King (1985) also conducted a study on the Nez Perce Forest using simulated rainfall to generate runoff and sediment yield from forest roads, ditchlines, and fill slopes. The reduction in sediment production by graveling the road was 79% with reductions lasting several years depending on the level of road use. They also found that where dense grass cover was present on the fill slopes of the road, sediment yield was reduced by 99%. The cut and fill slopes of roads within the Clear Creek project area are densely vegetated with grasses, shrubs, and trees. The majority of ditchlines also contain grasses, which can trap sediment. These conditions, along with the perpendicular stream/road crossings mentioned previously, help to minimize the risk of roads contributing large amounts of sediment to streams. The US Forest Service, BLM, USFWS, and NOAA (NOAA 1998) have determined that watershed conditions can be rated “good” when streamside road densities are <1 mile per square mile (mi/mi2), “moderate” at 1–2 mi/mi2, or “poor” at >2 mi/mi2. A total of 20 miles of NFS system roads exist within PACFISH buffers, contributing to an overall RHCA road density of 1.2 mi/mi2. RHCA roads are currently in a moderate condition. The majority of Forest roads in Clear Creek have been constructed perpendicular to streams in headwater areas where stream size is relatively small. This design limits the negative effects from roads on streams by minimizing the interaction and connectivity between the two. Some sediment contribution is occurring because roadside ditches have been constructed to drain into live streams however the amount is not known. Roughly 75% of RHCA road miles are graveled which helps to reduce the contribution of sediment to streams from roads. Roads on landslide prone landscapes have the potential to fail and contribute large quantities of sediment to streams. These roads may remain unstable over time and may contribute to chronic sediment erosion if not stabilized. Watersheds are in a high condition when landslide prone road densities are <1 mi/mi2 (NOAA, 1998). Landslide prone road densities are <1 mi/mi2 and in a high (good) condition on federal lands. Only one road-related landslide was observed during the road surveys. The majority of roads in Clear Creek occur on stable ridgetops with minimal risk of failure. The Watershed Condition Framework (USDA 2011) was used to assess watershed condition based on a variety of factors including forest health, soil, water, and roads. Watershed ratings reflect the level of watershed health or integrity. A watershed in good condition is one that is functioning in a manner similar to natural wildland conditions. The South Fork Clear Creek was rated as having high integrity or functionality. The Upper and Lower Clear Creek subwatersheds received moderate ratings and have been targeted for integrated restoration efforts through the road-related projects previously mentioned in combination with the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project. The road projects focused on the most direct long term benefits to water quality and aquatic habitats while the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project focuses on forest health and diversity. The road-related projects were designed to achieve a continued long term upward trend throughout the Clear Creek drainage. Evaluations conducted during the previous Forest Plan Revision efforts in 2006 showed that the South Fork, Upper and Lower Clear Creek subwatersheds were not meeting water quality or fish habitat desired conditions. The subwatersheds were rated as a High Priority for Restoration with the number of roads being the primary limiting factor to improved aquatic habitat conditions. The Clear Creek Project addresses these effects through project activities. Proposed Activity Effects to Streams The trend assessment used a variety of quantitative and qualitative data sources. Project activities and their expected influence on aquatic conditions are summarized in Table 37 and narratives below. The information when considered collectively helps to assess the expected influence of the alternatives on the aquatic conditions in the Clear Creek watershed as a whole. It does not represent an assessment of cumulative effects, or expected trend within specific subwatersheds. Various activities are considered with respect to the variety of aquatic processes that they potentially affect. The contribution to the overall aquatic condition is estimated in terms of positive influence (denoted by “+”) where the activity is expected to contribute to an improvement in condition, and a negative influence (denoted by “-“) where the activity is expected to contribute to degradation in aquatic condition. The amount of influence a specific activity is expected to have on the overall aquatic condition (either positive or negative) is represented by a ranking of high (H), moderate (M), or low (L). Activities rated “High” are those that are expected to have a significant effect at the watershed scale (considering both scope and magnitude). Those rated as “Moderate” are those activities that are expected to have a significant local effect (i.e. at the subwatershed scale), but not result in a significant effect at the watershed scale. Those activities rated “Low” are expected to have only a negligible effect both at the subwatershed and watershed scale. All of the processes potentially affected by an activity are listed in Table 30. No ranking, or areas left blank, represent no expected influence on this process or resulting aquatic conditions from this project. The expected contribution of a specific activity on aquatic condition is considered both in terms of short-term and long-term. Short-term influence is judged to be the immediate results of implementing the activity, generally expected to be around a 5-year timeframe. Long-term influence is judged to be the influence the activity will have on aquatic condition as a result of changes in processes and resource conditions that will over time result in changes in aquatic habitat condition. The timeframe for this influence is greater than 5 years. Each of the processes and indicators in the trend analysis table functions in different time frames. For example, the effectiveness of culverts replacements at improving accessibility or fish habitat is almost immediate. At the other extreme is the effectiveness of stream side road decommissioning at providing shade and bank stability, which can take decades to achieve full potential. Between these two poles are processes such as sediment yield increases or decreases, the effects of which can range from immediate to many years, depending on the specific pathway affected. Similarly, the effects to substrate sediment can be relatively fast in terms of deposition, but can range widely in subsequent entrainment and transport. Table 37: Upward Trend Indicators and Ratings for Clear Creek Activity Process Affected Characteristic Indicator Alt A Long Term Alt B Short Term Alt B Long Term Alt C1 Short Term Alt C1 Long Term Alt D Short Term Alt D Long Term Vegetation Treatments Surface erosion Pulse & Chronic Sediment  -M  -M  -M  Mass failure risk Pulse sediment        Infiltration, runoff Hydrologic process  -M -L -M -L -M -L Solar heating Riparian shade                  Temporary Road Construction Surface erosion Pulse & Chronic Sediment  -L  -L  -L  Mass failure risk Pulse sediment        Infiltration, runoff Hydrologic process  -L  -L  -L  Riparian shade Riparian condition                  Road Improvement Surface erosion Pulse & Chronic Sediment -M -L  -L  -L  Mass failure risk Pulse sediment        Infiltration, runoff Hydrologic process -M +L  +L  +L  Fish Passage Habitat availability                  Road Decommissioning (includes RHCA roads and non-system roads) Surface erosion Pulse & Chronic Sediment -L -L +L -L +L -L +L Mass failure risk Pulse sediment        Infiltration, runoff Hydrologic process -L +L +L +L +L +L +L Riparian Shade Riparian condition -L  +L  +L  +L           Stream Crossing Improvement Surface erosion Pulse & Chronic Sediment -L -M +L -M +L -M +L Activity Process Affected Characteristic Indicator Alt A Long Term Alt B Short Term Alt B Long Term Alt C1 Short Term Alt C1 Long Term Alt D Short Term Alt D Long Term Mass failure risk Pulse sediment -M +L +M +L +M +L +M Infiltration, runoff Hydrologic process        Fish Passage Habitat availability -L +L +L +L +L +L +L 1 Alt C Modified has less acres than Alt C and will therefore have less impact and greater benefit than depicted in Alt.

C. The above table of indicators of aquatic trend is a tool that is used in reaching a conclusion about what the expected trends from this project are expected to be in the Clear Creek watershed. This table illustrates the general relationships between project activities and expected consequences in aquatic conditions. At the watershed scale, the three action alternatives would essentially produce the same Upward Trend conclusions. The expected short-term consequences of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project on aquatic condition in the Clear Creek watershed is principally related to the surface erosion process and sediment conditions. The other short-term negative consequences of the project on aquatic conditions were related to the hydrologic processes of runoff and infiltration from temporary road construction and harvest. All of the activities are expected to have a negative effect on aquatic condition in the short term based on sediment yields as modeled in NEZSED. The Nez Perce Forest Plan requires the use of the NEZSED model in order to compare the difference between action alternatives. Results from NEZSED indicate sediment yield increases at the Forest boundary of 24% (Alt. C) as a result of project activities. The Forest Plan objective is 30% Results from NEZSED are entered into the FISHSED model to determine potential changes in fish habitat carrying capacity based on modeled changes to cobble embeddedness. The model results are only used to compare alternatives and do not represent actual changes in conditions (Stowell, 1983). FISHSED predicted a 2–15% change in cobble embeddedness, 1-8% for summer rearing capacity, and 2 to 15% for winter rearing capacity depending on the action alternative. FISHSED is used to assess the effects of changes in habitat quality when cobble embeddedness changes are greater than 10% (Stowell et al. 1983). Cobble embeddedness and winter rearing capacity exceeds the level of 10% where changes in habitat quality could occur (Stowell et al. 1983) under Alternatives B, C and C Modified. However, local RHCA monitoring found no sediment delivery through the buffers (USDA, 2014). Visual observations of post-harvest areas found the same results elsewhere on the Forest (K. Smith, personal observations, 2000-2013). With no delivery, cobble embeddedness levels are not expected to increase as a result of harvest. FISHSED model documentation states that the effects evaluation should be adjusted if riparian areas are to be treated differently than surrounding land. PACFISH RHCAs retain no-harvest buffers that are much wider than those used when FISHSED was developed. Typically there is a reduction of 20-30% in the NEPA analyzed acres after on-the-ground harvest unit layout occurs, primarily due to RHCA identification and buffering; therefore the model results are considered overestimates. ECAs in Clear Creek would range from 3% to 26% depending on the alternative. All alternatives remain in the good to moderate Matrix categories (<20%) with the exception of Hoodoo Creek under Alternative C (26%). Increased stream flows are not expected to result in stream channel alterations in Hoodoo prescription watershed. Actual harvest acres would be reduced by 20-35% during layout based on recent comparisons of NEPA versus layout units, as described in Alternative C Modified. Additional acreages were identified through further analysis and coordination with the Nez Perce Tribe. Portions of the acreages identified by the Tribe are reflected in the deductions in Alternative C Modified. The Responsible Official has the option of applying all or part of the modifications to any action alternative as part of the decision. As noted previously, Alternative C was chosen for modification because it proposes the most potential disturbance within the project area. Application of the modifications to any of the other action alternatives would result in even less potential impacts. The reduced acres would result in lower ECAs. All other watersheds remain below the 20% threshold, therefore, no stream channel alteration from increased water yield is expected from the Clear Creek project. The expected short-term positive consequences of the project on aquatic conditions in the Clear Creek watershed are associated with watershed improvement projects where an immediate improvement in condition results from project implementation. The greatest benefit in this category is associated with the increased habitat availability that resulted from culvert replacements designed for fish passage. Road decommissioning, road improvements, and stream crossing improvements will result in some minor immediate enhancements, principally through the lowered risk of stream crossing failure and the subsequent delivery of large amounts of sediment into streams. The expected long-term consequences of the project on aquatic condition in the Clear Creek watershed are all considered positive, with the exception of some continued minor negative effects on the water yield (as measured by ECA) associated with regeneration harvest openings. The watershed improvement projects would also have long term positive consequences on aquatic conditions in the watershed. They are the same as the short-term consequences including improved fish passage, the reduced risk of stream crossing failure, and reducing hydrologic connectivity between roads and streams through the addition of cross drain culverts. The conclusions regarding aquatic trend display the consequence of subtle balances between the short-term impacts and long-term improvements. A relatively modest shift in those balances could result in a different set of conclusions regarding aquatic trends. The trend conclusions must also be tempered with knowledge of the inherently variable conditions within the watershed and the unpredictability of weather and natural disturbance events such as fire and subsequent landslides. Future trends continue to be influenced by future management activities and natural events. Forest Plan Prescription Watershed Upward Trend Assessments The following tables display the vegetation treatment, temporary road construction, and watershed improvement activities by prescription watershed for all actions associated with and including the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project. The associated decision documents through which actions were proposed or decisions made are indicated by the numbers below and are later referred to in the summary tables for each of the prescription watersheds: 1. South Fork/West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning Project EA, 2011 2. Clear Creek Culvert Replacements CE, 2011 3.

Road 650 Road Maintenance Project Letter to File, 2013 6. Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project EIS, 2015 7. Clear Ridge Non-System Road Decommissioning Project CE, 2015. An Upward Trend assessment was conducted for each of the Forest Plan Prescription watersheds. Alternative A (existing condition) was compared to Alternative C (maximum alternative) for the short term (0-5 years) and long term (>5 years). Activities were given a rating based on the indicators shown in Table 39. Number ranges for each of the ratings were based on the relative impact at the Prescription watershed scale. The Upward Trend determination was calculated by assigning a value to the Low, Moderate, and High ranking (L=1, M=2, H=3) and then summarized. Table 39: Rating Indicators Proposed Activity High Moderate Low Vegetation Treatments Total Harvest and Burn >40% of Watershed Acres 15-40% of Watershed Acres <15% of Watershed Acres Regen Harvest >25% of Watershed Acres 10-25% of Watershed Acres <10% of Watershed Acres Proposed Activity High Moderate Low Temporary Road Construction >5% of Watershed Acres 2-5% of Watershed Acres <2% of Watershed Acres Road Improvement Road Reconstruction >75% of Total Roads 50-75% of Total Roads <50% of Total Roads Road Reconditioning >25% of Total Roads 15-25% of Total Roads <15% of Total Roads Road Decommissioning >50% Reduction 25-50% Reduction <25% Reduction RHCA Road Decommissioning >50% Reduction 25-50% Reduction <25% Reduction Non-system Road Decommissioning >40 miles  20-40 miles  <20 miles Riparian Shade >10 miles RHCA 5-10 miles RHCA <5 miles RHCA Stream Crossing Improvements >20 10-20 <10 Fish Passage Culverts >3 2-3 <2 Pine Knob Prescription Watershed The 2,622 acre Pine Knob Forest Plan prescription watershed does not meet its water quality objective of 80% for fishery habitat potential. Cobble embeddedness was less than 30% in 2015 (Stillwater Sciences). When assessed against the DFCs (USDA 1992), the watershed currently is at 82% of habitat potential. Embeddedness was 44% with a 65% habitat potential in 2012 using FS data. It was at 50% of its habitat potential when the Forest Plan was written in 1987. This would be considered an upward trend in cobble embeddedness since 1987 based on limited cobble embeddedness data. Higher levels of embeddedness may also be in part a result of the granitic geology that occurs where substrate was sampled. Granitic geologies typically have a higher component of finer particles than other geologies found in the drainage. There are about 3 miles of fish-bearing and 7 miles of non-fish bearing streams in Pine Knob Creek. The stream is mostly suitable for steelhead trout and westslope cutthroat trout. The lower 0.5 miles may be used by juvenile Chinook salmon for rearing. The substrate is generally too small for Chinook salmon spawning. Surveys in 2015 showed low steelhead densities of 0.9 fish/m2 and no westslope cutthroat trout during snorkel surveys. Cutthroat were visually observed in 2015 and are known to occur in the drainage. Stream temperatures were measured in Pine Knob Creek in the summer of 2015. Stream temperature conditions based on NOAA matrix ratings were high for steelhead spawning in all months except for June and July. The two months rated out as low (16.4°C). Steelhead rearing temperatures were rated as high from December to June and again in September and October, moderate in June, the latter half of July through August and low for two weeks in July (17-18°C). Cool temperatures most of the year are a result of well forest areas adjacent to streams (see RHCA discussion below). Temperatures were moderate for bull trout rearing and low for bull trout spawning/incubation. This is consistent with the Climate Shield model results (Isaac, 2014) which showed a zero probability of bull trout presence based on warmer than preferred temperatures. Shallow water depths and low to moderate numbers of pool habitat were noted in the 2015 surveys. The low number of pools and lack of depth is directly related to low wood levels. Wood is the primary creator of pool habitats in this stream type. Low wood levels appear to be natural as streamside buffers of 100’ to 120+’ were retained during previous timber harvest (see management actions discussion below). FEMAT (1993) showed that the probability that a falling tree will enter the stream is a function of slope distance from the channel in relation to the tree height. The analysis showed that 100% of wood delivered to streams comes from within one site potential tree height of the stream (150’ in Clear Creek). Roughly 95% of the wood subsequently comes from within 120’ therefore wood levels in Pine Knob are considered mostly natural. The low wood levels may be due to the dominance of western red cedar that dominates the riparian areas. Red cedar is a long lived species and remains standing for long periods even when dead. Water depths and pool habitat availability are considered to be trending upward trend since buffers were retained and would provide both the short and long term wood necessary to create pools as trees die and fall into the stream. Previously harvested areas that occur within current RHCAs are forested. Standard RHCAs are expected to be retained during the next harvest rotation which would maintain the necessary wood component over time, thus maintaining the upward trend. Stream bank stability was noted as good to excellent in the 1988, 1993, and 2015 surveys as well as the 2010-2012 field observations. This is due to the presence of dense streamside vegetation in combination with large substrate (cobble, rubble, boulders) which armors the banks against the erosive power of the stream. Excellent bank stability has been maintained in the watershed. Stream substrate composition in Pine Knob in 2015 was composed of 15% fine material (sand/silt), 37% gravel and 48% large material (rubble to boulders). There was a decrease in fines and increase in gravels suitable for spawning when compared to the 1993 surveys. This indicates an improving trend in larger substrate size and decrease in fine substrate. There was one road related failure that was deposited in Pine Knob Creek; however it occurred prior to the 1993 surveys. No other obvious sources of sediment were observed at road crossings or along roads within the watershed during 2010-2012 field reviews nor were any other potential management-related sources. Regeneration timber harvest activities have occurred on 36% of the watershed between the 1960’s and 1988. No regeneration harvest has occurred since then. Commercial thinning occurred on 11% of the area between the 1970’s and 2005. As a result ECA is currently at 3%, or a high condition. Streamside buffers were retained on all but 0.5 miles of stream in the upper portion of the drainage. Where buffers were retained they ranged from 100’ to 150’ from the stream channel. This means that based on FEMAT (1993) 90 to 100% of all wood likely to fall into the stream was retained during timber harvest. Forested stands within PACFISH buffers are aged as follows: 6% are < 40 years old, 19% are between 40 and 100 years and the remaining 75% older than 100 years. No future foreseeable harvest in the RHCAs is expected therefore they would be considered fully functional given the age classes and minimal disturbance within them. As a result, they are trending in an upward condition and would continue to provide for shade, wood, and bank stability in Pine Knob Creek. There are almost 20 miles of Forest system roads within the watershed with less than 2 miles occurring within RHCAs. A total of 0.5 miles of the RHCA roads are graveled and opened to motorized traffic and the remaining are closed. Gravel helps to minimize sediment production from roads (Swift, 1984: Burroughs and King, 1989) as does minimizing motorized use on roads. There were no obvious signs of road surface erosion (no rilling or gullying) during culvert inventories in Pine Knob Creek. Many roads were dominated by a base rock surface topped with grasses/mosses and small trees growing along their margins. The overall watershed road density is 4.8 mi/mi2 and the RHCA road density is 2.2 mi/mi2. This is an 11% reduction from densities in 1995 and is a result of past road decommissioning projects. Prior to 2014, there were 11.5 miles of non-system roads in the prescription watershed. The Clear Ridge project decommissions all but 0.5 miles resulting in an almost elimination of these roads and the conversion of 44 acres (4 acres/mile) of road back into productive forested habitats. There are 9 stream crossings within the watershed with 8 occurring on very small seeps or streams (18-24”). Two of the crossings were identified as needing cross drain additions and 3 need to be replaced as they are undersized or are in poor condition. Roads are expected to be contributing very little sediment to streams due to an overall low number of crossings (0.5 culverts/mile of road), well vegetated/rocked road surfaces that showed very little erosion, the need for cross drains on only 2 small streams, and well vegetated ditchlines which are helping to filter out sediment to streams. There are no human caused barriers to upstream aquatic organism migration in the watershed. Based on the Forest Plan guidance, an upward trend has been initiated in the Pine Knob prescription watershed. This is due primarily to the lack of recent timber harvest combined with few stream crossings, mostly closed roads and only one pre-1993 road failure. The stream has an excellent and fully functioning riparian vegetation component, stable banks, cool stream temperatures, and increasing amounts of gravel which would allow for the continued improvement of fish habitat capacity over time. Proposed Activity Effects to Streams The expected short-term consequences of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project on aquatic conditions in Pine Knob Creek is principally related to the surface erosion and sediment conditions. Other short-term negative consequences are related to the hydrologic processes of runoff and infiltration from temporary road construction and harvest. All of the activities are expected to have a negative effect on aquatic condition in the short term based on sediment yields as modeled in NEZSED. Model results from NEZSED indicate sediment yield increases at the mouth of Pine Knob to 31% as a result of project activities. This meets the Forest Plan standard of 45% or less. The FISHSED model was used in conjunction with NEZSED to determine potential changes in fish habitat carrying capacity as previously discussed. The model predicted a 6% increase in cobble embeddedness and subsequent decrease of 2% for summer and 9% for winter rearing capacity for juvenile steelhead trout rearing for the action alternatives. This is below the 10% where changes in habitat quality could occur (Stowell et al. 1983). No substantial changes in cobble embeddedness and summer/winter habitat rearing capacity are therefore expected based on this modeling and on local effectiveness monitoring (USDA Forest Service 2009 and 2014). ECAs would increase to 14% under all alternatives and would remain within the High (good) condition class based on the NOAA matrix (1998) therefore no channel alterations as a result of increased water yield is expected. The Clear Creek Project would decommission an additional 1.8 miles of road, 0.1 miles of which is within RHCAs. This would reduce watershed road densities to 4.3 mi/mi2 and RHCA densities to 2.0 mi/mi2. The result would be a 9% reduction in overall road miles and a 6% reduction in RHCA road miles. The Clear Creek Project would decommission the remaining 0.5 miles of non-system road resulting in the watershed and would convert 2 acres of road back into a forested condition. The Clear Creek Project would reconstruct 8.5 miles of system road (48% of the roads in the prescription watershed) which would help to reduce sediment delivery by diverting road ditchline flow away from streams through the addition of cross drain culverts. The project would also replace the 2 existing undersized culverts with those sized for a 100- year flow event. Small amounts of sediment delivery would occur as a result of the culvert replacements and would last up to 2 years. In the long run, the replacements would reduce the risk of future failure. All 8 crossings in the watershed would be appropriately sized after project completion. The Project would recondition 5.8 miles of road (69% of the roads). Reconditioning would apply gravel where needed to minimize the amount of erosion from road surfaces during log haul operations. The use of dust abatement during log haul would also minimize road surface erosion and potential input of sediment to streams during harvest operations. Overall Trend Summary for the Pine Knob Prescription Watershed The current upward trend for aquatic habitat conditions and fish habitat capacity is expected to continue in the Pine Knob prescription watershed because of road improvements associated with the project, the relatively intact RHCAs, the expected minimal effects of modeled sediment to streams, water yields that would remain below levels where alterations in streams channels could occur, and the implementation of design features and BMPs which have been shown to be effective at minimizing effects to streams (Sugden, 2018; Arismendi et al, 2017; Hatten et al 2017; Sugden et al 2012; USDA Forest Service, 2009). The Clear Creek Project therefore complies with the Forest Plan upward trend requirement.Pine Knob Creek Prescription Watershed Activities Watershed Area 4.1 Sq.

Cobble embeddedness was less than 30% in 2015 (Stillwater Sciences). When assessed against the DFCs (USDA 1992), the watershed currently is at 82% of habitat potential. Embeddedness was 38% with a 75% habitat potential in 2012 using FS data. It was at 50% of its habitat potential when the Forest Plan was written in 1987. This would be considered an upward trend in cobble embeddedness since 1987 based on limited cobble embeddedness data. Higher levels of embeddedness may also be in part a result of the granitic geology that occurs where substrate was sampled. Granitic geologies typically have a higher component of finer particles than other geologies found in the drainage. There are about 11 miles of fish-bearing and 17 miles of non-fish bearing streams in Clear Creek. The stream is suitable for Chinook salmon, steelhead trout and westslope cutthroat trout. Juvenile Chinook salmon densities were low in 2015 (28 juveniles and 4 adults/100m) while steelhead trout densities were the highest found on Forest lands (210 fish/100). Stream temperatures were measured in Clear Creek near Pine Knob in the summer of 2011, 2012 and 2015. Stream temperature conditions based on NOAA matrix ratings were High for steelhead spawning in 2011 and 2012 (11°C and 13.1°C respectively) and Moderate in 2015 between mid-June and mid-July (17°C). Rearing was High in 2011 and 2012, and Moderate from July through September (15.7°C) with the exception of 10 days July where it was Low (19°C). Cool temperatures most of the year are a result of well forest areas adjacent to streams. Temperatures were moderate for bull trout rearing for most of the year and low for bull trout spawning/incubation. This is consistent with the Climate Shield model results (Isaac, 2014) which showed only a 9% probability of bull trout presence on 1.6 miles of headwater stream in 1980 and a zero percent probability in 2040. Temperatures are warmer than preferred for bull trout. Pools made up only 23% of the stream habitats in 2015. This is due to low wood levels which resulted from the 1931 wildfire. Recent observations showed well vegetated riparian areas with a component of young trees where the fire burned. Buffers were also retained adjacent to past harvest units. Riparian areas, and therefore wood levels, are trending upward. The necessary wood component and pools created by that wood would be provided for over time. Stream bank stability was excellent in the 2015 surveys. This is due to the presence of dense streamside vegetation in combination with large substrate (cobble, rubble, boulders) which armors the banks against the erosive power of the stream. Similar conditions were noted from 2010-2012 field observations. Streambank stability trends are being maintained. Stream substrate composition in Clear Creek in 2015 was composed of 14% sand/silt, 23% gravel and 53% large material (rubble to boulders). No obvious sources of sediment were observed at road crossings or along roads within the watershed during 2010-2012 field reviews. Levels of sand/silt were relatively low and adequate for fish embryo survival (Meehan et al 1991). Regeneration timber harvest activities have occurred on 15% of the watershed between the 1970s and 1990s. No regeneration harvest has occurred since then. Commercial thinning occurred on 11% of the area between the 1980s and 1990s. As a result ECA is currently at 3%, or a high condition. Buffers of 150’+ along the mainstem of Clear Creek, and 50+’ on the smaller tributaries were retained during harvest beginning in the 1970s. Forested stands within what are now PACFISH buffers are aged as follows: 13% are < 40 years old, 20% are between 40 and 100 years and the remaining 67% older than 100 years. The middle age classes are partly a result of a wildfire which occurred in 1931 and burned roughly 23% of the area. The RHCAs therefore would be considered fully functional given the large percentage of older age classes and minimal disturbance within them. As a result, they are trending in an upward condition and would continue to provide for shade, wood, and stable banks in Clear Creek. There are 26 miles of Forest system roads within the watershed with 2 miles occurring within RHCAs. A total of 0.5 miles of the RHCA roads are graveled and opened to motorized traffic and the remaining are closed. The overall watershed road density is 2.3 mi/mi2 which is a 16% reduction in roads since 1995 and is a result of past road decommissioning projects. The RHCA and landslide prone road densities are 0.8 mi/mi2 and 0.04 mi/mi2, respectively. Both are considered to be in a High condition. Prior to 2014, there were 16.5 miles of non-system roads in the prescription watershed. The Clear Ridge project decommissioned all but 0.2 miles resulting in an almost elimination of these roads and the conversion of 65 acres of road back into productive forested habitats. There are 27 stream crossings within the watershed, 3 of which occur on fish bearing streams and are not barriers to aquatic organism passage (replaced in 2012/2013). A total of 17 culverts are appropriately sized and the remaining 10 crossings are undersized for the area they drain. All roads also cross perpendicular to the stream channels which limit their effects to riparian vegetation; however portions of the ditchlines leading to those crossings are draining directly into the streams. These may be acting as a chronic sediment source of sediment to streams. Ditchlines leading to the 3 fish bearing crossings currently have cross drain pipes installed and are no longer adding sediment to streams at those sites. Based on the Forest Plan guidance, an upward trend has been initiated in the Clear Creek prescription watershed. This is due primarily to the lack of recent timber harvest combined with intact RHCAs, low RHCA road densities, no fish passage barriers, and mostly closed roads. The stream has an excellent riparian vegetation component, stable banks, and cool stream temperatures for most of the year. When combined, these factors show that an upward trend in fish habitat capacity has been initiated and would continue over time. Proposed Activity Effects to Streams The expected short-term consequences of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project on aquatic conditions in the Clear Creek prescription watershed is principally related to the surface erosion process and sediment conditions. The other short-term negative consequences of the project on aquatic conditions were related to the hydrologic processes of runoff and infiltration from temporary road construction and harvest. All of the activities are expected to have a negative effect on aquatic condition in the short term based on sediment yields as modeled in NEZSED. Model results indicate sediment yield increases in Clear Creek near the confluence with the South Fork to 31% as a result of project activities. This is just above the Forest Plan standard of 30% (Alt C only). The FISHSED model was used in conjunction with NEZSED to determine potential changes in fish habitat carrying capacity. The model predicted a 4% increase in cobble embeddedness, a 4% decrease in summer rearing capacity and a 9% decrease in winter rearing for juvenile steelhead trout rearing. This is below the 10% where changes in habitat quality could occur (Stowell et al. 1983). No substantial changes in cobble embeddedness and summer/winter habitat rearing capacity are therefore expected based on this modeling and on local effectiveness monitoring (USDA Forest Service 2009 and 2014). ECAs would increase to between 12% and 15% depending on the alternative and would remain within the High condition class based on the NOAA matrix (1998) therefore no channel alterations as a result of increased water yield is expected. The Clear Creek Project would decommission an additional 0.6 miles of road in the prescription watershed. This would not change the existing watershed road density of 2.3 mi/mi2. RHCA densities would remain at 0.8 mi/mi2. The Clear Creek Project would decommission the remaining 0.2 miles of non-system road resulting in the watershed and would convert 1 acre of road back into a forested condition. The Clear Creek Project would reconstruct 2.7 miles of system road (18% of the roads in the prescription watershed) which would help to reduce sediment delivery by diverting road ditchline flow away from streams through cross drain culvert additions. The project would also replace the 10 existing undersized culverts with those sized for a 100- year flow event. This would reduce the risk of future failure. All crossings in the watershed would be appropriately sized after project completion. The Project would recondition 2.7 miles of road (18% of the roads). Reconditioning would apply gravel where needed to minimize the amount of erosion from road surfaces during log haul operations. The use of dust abatement during log haul would also minimize road surface erosion and potential input of sediment to streams. Overall Trend Summary for the Clear Creek Prescription Watershed The current upward trend in aquatic habitat conditions is expected to continue in the Clear Creek prescription watershed because of road improvements associated with the project, mostly intact RHCAs, the expected minimal effects of modeled sediment to streams, water yields that would remain below levels where alterations in streams channels could occur, and the implementation of design features and BMPs which have been shown to be effective at minimizing effects to streams (Sugden, 2018; Arismendi et al, 2017; Hatten et al 2017; Sugden et al 2012; USDA Forest Service, 2009). The Clear Creek Project therefore complies with the Forest Plan upward trend requirement. Clear Creek Prescription Watershed Activities Watershed Area 11.3 Sq.

Cobble embeddedness was less than 30% in 2015 (Stillwater Sciences). When assessed against the DFCs (USDA 1992), the watershed currently is at 82% of habitat potential. Cobble embeddedness was measured at 51% with a 59% habitat potential in 2014 using FS data. It was at 50% of its habitat potential when the Forest Plan was written in 1987. This would be considered an upward trend in fishery habitat potential since 1987 based on limited cobble embeddedness data. There are about 7 miles of fish-bearing and 13 miles of non-fish bearing streams in Middle Fork Clear Creek. The stream is only suitable for steelhead and westslope cutthroat trout. Surveys in 2015 found steelhead densities of 75 fish/100m. No cutthroat were observed; however, they have been observed in previous surveys and are expected to occur in the drainage above the 2015 surveyed reaches. Stream temperatures were measured in Middle Fork Clear Creek in the summer of 2011 and above Solo Creek in 2015. Stream temperature conditions based on NOAA matrix ratings were High for steelhead spawning and rearing in 2011 (10.7°C and 13.6°C respectively) and all but 2 weeks in July where it was Moderate. Cool temperatures are a result of well forest areas adjacent to streams. Temperatures were moderate for bull trout rearing (13.6°C) and low for bull trout spawning/incubation (10.2°C). This is consistent with the Climate Shield model results (Isaac, 2014) which showed only a 14% probability of bull trout presence on 1.4 miles of headwater stream in 1980 and a zero percent probability in 2040. Temperatures are warmer than preferred for bull trout. Pools made up only 25% of the stream habitats in 2015. Wood levels were low (5 key pieces/km). Low wood levels appear to be natural as streamside buffers were retained during previous timber harvest (see management actions discussion below). Water depths and pool habitat availability are considered to be trending upward trend since buffers were retained and would provide both the short and long term wood necessary to create pools as trees die and fall into the stream. Previously harvested areas that occur within RHCAs are forested. Standard RHCAs are expected to be retained during the next harvest rotation which would maintain the necessary wood component over time, thus maintaining the upward trend. Stream bank stability was noted excellent in 2015. This is due to the presence of dense streamside vegetation in combination with large substrate (cobble, rubble, boulders) which armors the banks against the erosive power of the stream. Stream substrate composition in Middle Fork Clear Creek in 2015 was composed of 24% sand/silt, 36% gravel and 40% large material (rubble to boulders). There was an increase, or upward trend, in gravels since 1994. No obvious sources of sediment were observed at road crossings or along roads within the watershed during 2010-2012 field reviews. Regeneration timber harvest activities have occurred on 18% of the watershed between the 1970’s and 1980s. No regeneration harvest has occurred since then. Commercial thinning occurred on 9% of the area between the 1970’s and 1990s. As a result ECA is currently at 2%, or a high condition. About 6% of the RHCAs were affected by past timber harvest. Buffers were retained on all units with the exception 2 small headwater streams. Forested stands within the buffers are aged as follows: 7% are < 40 years old, 54% are between 40 and 100 years and the remaining 39% older than 100 years. The RHCAs therefore would be considered fully functional given the age classes and minimal disturbance within them. As a result, they are trending in an upward condition and would continue to provide for shade, wood and bank stability in Middle Fork Clear Creek. There are almost 15 miles of Forest system roads within the watershed with less than 2 miles occurring within RHCAs. All RHCA roads are graveled and are open to either seasonal or year round motorized traffic. The overall watershed road density is 2.4 mi/mi2 which is a 12% reduction in roads since 1995 and is a result of past road decommissioning projects. RHCA road density is 0.9 mi/mi2 and landslide prone density is 0.08 mi/mi2, both High ratings. Prior to 2014, there were 7.2 miles of non-system roads in the prescription watershed. The Clear Ridge project decommissioned all but 0.3 miles resulting in an almost elimination of these roads and the conversion of 28 acres of road back into productive forested habitats. There are 13 stream crossings within the watershed, 2 of which are on fish bearing streams and are passable to aquatic organisms. Four other crossings have been identified for replacement and these plus an additional 2 require cross drain additions. Roads are expected to be contributing very little sediment to streams due to an overall low number of crossings (<1/mile), low RHCA densities, and the need for the replacement of only 4 crossings. Based on the Forest Plan guidance, an upward trend has been initiated in the Middle Fork Clear Creek prescription watershed. This is due primarily to the lack of recent timber harvest combined with relatively few stream crossings, low RHCA road densities, intact RCHAs, stable banks, and cool temperatures and increasing amounts of gravel which would allow for the continued improvement of fish habitat capacity over time. Proposed Activity Effects to Streams The expected short-term consequences of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project on aquatic conditions in Middle Fork Clear Creek are principally related to the surface erosion process and sediment conditions. The other short-term negative consequences of the project on aquatic conditions were related to the hydrologic processes of runoff and infiltration from temporary road construction and harvest. All of the activities are expected to have a negative effect on aquatic condition in the short term based on sediment yields as modeled in NEZSED. Model results indicate sediment yield increases at the mouth of Middle Fork to 28% as a result of project activities. This is meets the Forest Plan standard of 30% or less. The FISHSED model was used in conjunction with NEZSED to determine potential changes in fish habitat carrying capacity. The model predicted a 5% increase in cobble embeddedness, a 2% decrease in summer and 8% decrease in winter rearing capacity for juvenile steelhead. This is below the 10% where changes in habitat quality could occur (Stowell et al. 1983). No substantial changes in cobble embeddedness and summer/winter habitat rearing capacity are therefore expected based on this modeling and on local effectiveness monitoring (USDA Forest Service 2009a and 2014). ECAs would increase to 9% and would remain within the High condition class based on the NOAA matrix (1998) therefore no channel alterations as a result of increased water yield is expected. The Clear Creek Project would decommission an additional 1.3 miles of road in the prescription watershed, 0.1 of which is in RHCAs. This would reduce watershed road densities to 2.2 mi/mi2 and RHCA densities to 0.9 mi/mi2. The result would be a 9% reduction in overall road density and a 6% reduction in RHCA density. The Clear Creek Project would decommission the remaining 0.3 miles of non-system road resulting in the watershed and would convert 1 acre of road back into a forested condition. The Clear Creek Project would reconstruct 6.9 miles of system road (51% of the roads in the prescription watershed) which would help to reduce sediment delivery by diverting road ditchline flow away from streams through cross drain culvert additions. The project would also replace the 4 existing and remove 1 undersized culverts with those sized for a 100- year flow event. This would reduce the risk of future failure. All crossings in the watershed would be appropriately sized after project completion. The Project would recondition 3.2 miles of road (24% of the roads). Reconditioning would apply gravel where needed to minimize the amount of erosion from road surfaces during log haul operations. The use of dust abatement during log haul would also minimize road surface erosion and potential input of sediment to streams. Overall Trend Summary for the Middle Fork Clear Creek Prescription Watershed The current upward trend for aquatic habitat conditions and fish habitat capacity is expected to continue in the Middle Fork prescription watershed because of road improvements associated with the project, the intact RHCAs, the expected minimal effects of modeled sediment to streams, water yields that would remain below levels where alterations in streams channels could occur, and the implementation of design features and BMPs which have been shown to be effective at minimizing effects to streams (Sugden, 2018; Arismendi et al, 2017; Hatten et al 2017; Sugden et al 2012; USDA Forest Service, 2009).

Cobble embeddedness was measured at 47% in 2014 (Stillwater Sciences). When assessed against the DFCs (USDA 1992), the watershed currently is at 65% of habitat potential. It was at 50% of its habitat potential when the Forest Plan was written in 1987. This would be considered an upward trend in cobble embeddedness since 1987 based on limited cobble embeddedness data There are about 12 miles of fish-bearing and a minimum of 50 miles of non-fish bearing streams in South Fork Clear Creek. Chinook adults and juveniles were found in the lower 1.5 miles (Stillwater Sciences, 2015) in low densities (1.6 and 7 fish/100m, respectively). Steelhead/rainbow were found in the lower 6 miles (110 fish/100m) and cutthroat were not observed; however, they have been documented in past surveys and are likely to occur in the upper half of the drainage. Surveys in 2015 estimated the amount of anadromous and resident fish spawning habitat in South Fork Clear Creek. Anadromous habitat was rated good to fair in quality but limited in quantity compared to the lower mainstem of Clear Creek (75m2/km vs. 580 m2/km). Resident spawning habitat was also rated as good to fair with roughly 25m2/km in the surveyed reaches. Although the amount of spawning habitat for both anadromous and resident fish is limited due to large substrate size (see below), fish densities indicate the availability of suitable spawning habitat. The larger dominant substrates provide for an abundance of rearing habitat as the surveyed reaches are higher gradient channels where there is less likelihood of sediment filling the interstitial spaces between the rocks. Stream temperatures were measured at the mouth of South Fork Creek in 1991. Daily average temperatures were 13°C, or High for steelhead spawning and Low for summer steelhead rearing (18°C) based the NOAA Matrix table. Wildfires in 1870 and 1931 burned 7,085 acres and consumed most of the streamside vegetation which has created RHCAs currently dominated by trees that are about 80 years old. It is possible that they have not yet reached their full stream shading and cooling potential. Stream temperatures were also measured where the South Fork meets Kay Creek for 9 years (1991-1998, 2001). Stream temperature conditions based on 2001 data showed NOAA Matrix ratings as Moderate for steelhead spawning and High for rearing (14.3°C and 12.5°C respectively). They were moderate for bull trout rearing (12.5°C) and Low for bull trout spawning/incubation (10.1°C). Stream temperatures in South Fork Creek appear to be adequate for chinook, steelhead and cutthroat production and low for bull trout. Riffle and pool habitats made up 70% and 30% of stream habitats in 2015, respectively. Shallow water depths and lack of pool habitat were noted in the surveys. Wood is the primary creator of pools in this stream system. The low numbers of pools are considered to be closely related to natural low wood levels (9 pieces/100m) which are likely a result of wildfires in 1870 and again in 1931. No timber harvest has occurred adjacent to the surveyed streams as all lay within the Clear Creek Roadless area. Trees have reestablished themselves and are now about 80 years old. Timber harvest in the upper South Fork upstream from the surveyed reaches mostly retained streamside buffers. The presence of forested stands along all streams provides for both short and long term upward trends in water depths and pool habitat. Stream bank stability was noted as good to excellent in both the1988 and 2015 surveys. This is due to the presence of dense streamside vegetation in combination with large substrate (cobble, rubble, boulders) which armors the banks against the erosive power of the stream. This trend has been maintained over time. Stream substrate composition in South Fork Clear Creek in 2015 was dominated by boulders and rubble (68%), followed by gravel (18%), sand (12%) and bedrock (3%). Surveys in 1988 showed dominance by large rubble, boulders, and bedrock. Cobble embeddedness was 37% in 2015 and 51% in 1988 indicating a likely positive upward trend. Because the same sampling protocols were not used, the data is not directly comparable; however given the low riparian and watershed road densities and no evidence of recent landslides, the assumption of an upward trend is reasonable. A review of roads between 2010 and 2012 found no major sediment issues associated with roads that might affect fine sediment levels in the drainage. Levels of sand/silt were relatively low (<20%) and adequate for fish embryo survival (Meehan et al 1991). Regeneration timber harvest activities have occurred on 13% of the watershed between the 1930’s and 1990’s. No regeneration harvest has occurred since then. ECA is currently at 1% as a result of minimal harvest. Streamside buffers of 100’+ were retained on all but 3.3 miles of non-fish bearing or intermittent streams. Forested stands within RHCAs are aged as follows: 5% are < 40 years old, 54% are between 40 and 100 years and the remaining 41% older than 100 years. The RHCAs are considered fully functional given the age classes and minimal disturbance within them. As a result, they are trending in an upward condition and would continue to provide for shade, wood, and bank stability in the South Fork of Clear Creek. There are almost 32 miles of Forest system roads within the watershed with less than 4 miles occurring within RHCAs. The overall watershed road density is 1.6 mi/mi2 and the RHCA road density is 1 mi/mi2. A total of 1.5 miles of the RHCA roads are opened to motorized traffic and the remaining are closed. About 20 miles are gravel surfaced and many of the remainder were topped with grasses/mosses and had small trees growing along their margins. There were no obvious signs of road surface erosion (no rilling or gullying) during culvert inventories from 2010 to 2012. A total of 2 miles of system road and 26 miles of non-system road have been decommissioned since 2012. This is a 6% reduction from densities in 1995 and is a result of past road decommissioning projects. The 26 miles of non-system roads do not contribute to road density calculations but their decommissioning has contributed to the reduction of sediment to streams. There are 45 stream crossings within the watershed with none occurring on fish bearing streams. Nineteen of the crossings were identified as needing cross drain additions and 13 need to be replaced as they are undersized. Ditchlines in the drainage were well vegetated which help to filter out sediment to streams. There are no human caused barriers to upstream aquatic organism migration in the watershed. Based on the Forest Plan guidance, an upward trend has been initiated in the South Fork Clear Creek prescription watershed. This is due to a lack of recent timber harvest combined with well vegetated riparian areas, relatively few stream crossings, past road decommissioning projects, mostly closed roads and no obvious sources of sediment. The stream has a mostly functioning riparian vegetation component, stable banks, and cool stream temperatures which would allow for the continued improvement of fish habitat capacity over time. Proposed Activity Effects to Streams The Clear Creek Project would continue the existing upward trend through road improvement activities including the replacement of 27 stream crossing culverts, 16.5 miles of road reconstruction (51% of the roads in the prescription watershed) and 9.8 miles of reconditioning (30% of the roads in the prescription watershed). All of these are designed to reduce the amount of sediment delivery to streams from roads. Road decommissioning and reconstruction activities were conducted under previous projects between 2012 and 2014 (FEIS, Appendix J, pg. J-37). All project activities are expected to have a negative effect on aquatic condition in the short term based on sediment yields as modeled in NEZSED. Model results from NEZSED indicate sediment yield increases at the mouth of South Fork Clear Creek to 14% as a result of project activities. This meets the Forest Plan objective of 45%. The FISHSED model was used in conjunction with NEZSED to determine potential changes in fish habitat carrying capacity. The model predicted a 3% increase in cobble embeddedness, a 1% decrease in summer rearing and a 4% decrease in winter rearing capacity. These are well below the threshold of 10% where changes in habitat could occur (Stowell et al. 1983). ECAs would increase to 9% under Alternative C, a High (good) condition class rating based on the NOAA matrix (1998). This meets the desired threshold of <20%. No stream channel alterations are expected as a result of minor increases in water yield. Alternative C Modified harvests 289 less acres therefore ECA is expected to be slightly lower than discussed above. An upward trend in aquatic habitat conditions in South Fork Clear Creek has been established through previous road decommissioning and road improvement projects. The Clear Creek Project would maintain that trend through additional road improvement activities when combined with relatively intact RHCAs, and design feature and BMP implementation South Fork Clear Creek Prescription Watershed Activities  Watershed Area 20.2 Sq.

Cobble embeddedness was measured at 71% in 2016. When assessed against the DFCs (USDA, 1992), the watershed currently is at 37% of habitat potential. It was at 50% of its habitat potential when the Forest Plan was written in 1987. No upward trend in cobble embeddedness has occurred since 1987 based on limited cobble embeddedness data. Sediment is likely a contributing limiting factor for fish production in this prescriptions watershed. However, as discussed in the Appendix A Guidance and FEIS, upward trend is not determined by cobble embeddedness alone (Conroy and Thompson, 2011). There are about 5 miles of fish-bearing and 20 miles of non-fish bearing streams in the drainage. Fish densities are low due to steeper gradients and larger than preferred spawning substrate. No Chinook salmon were observed in 2015; however 4 juveniles /100m were observed in 2016. Steelhead/rainbow were the most common species found and numbers observed were low at 40 fish/100m, respectively. Westslope cutthroat trout were observed in low densities in 2015 (17 fish/100m). Surveys in 2015 estimated the amount of anadromous and resident fish spawning habitat in West Fork Clear Creek. Anadromous habitat was rated as fair in quality and low in availability (25m2/km). Resident spawning habitat was rated as good to fair with only 13m2/km in the surveyed reaches. The amount of spawning habitat for both anadromous and resident fish is likely to remain limited due to steeper stream gradient and the dominant substrate size which is too large for spawning habitat. Stream temperatures were measured in West Fork Clear Creek in various years (1991, 1992, 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2016). Stream temperature conditions based on NOAA matrix ratings were moderate for steelhead spawning and rearing (15°C and 17°C, respectively) but were within optimum ranges for steelhead trout rearing (14 – 19°C, EPA 2003). Temperatures were low for bull trout spawning and moderate for bull trout rearing (14°C and 15°C, respectively). Summer water temperatures are considered to be warmer than preferred for bull trout and they are not expected to utilize this watershed for spawning or rearing. Stream bank stability was noted as good to excellent in both the 2015 and 1988 surveys as well as during field reviews between 2010 and 2012. This is due to the presence of dense streamside vegetation in combination with large substrate (cobble, rubble, boulders) which armors the banks against the erosive power of the stream. The trend for bank stability has been maintained. Stream substrate composition in West Fork Clear Creek in 2015 was composed of 22% sand/silt, 26% gravel and 52% large material (rubble to boulders). Cobble embeddedness, which cannot be directly correlated to the percent of fine substrates, was 71% in 2015 and 33% in 2012 (FEIS, pg. 3-11). The data between the two years, however, is not comparable as 2015 sampling occurred near the mouth of the stream and 2012 sampling occurred 1.8 miles upstream near the confluence of Hoodoo and West Fork Clear Creeks. Instream sediment is likely associated with many roads in the watershed. Two road related slides on Road 650 were observed between 2011 and 2017. Repairs were conducted on the slide closest to the Forest boundary in 2012 and repairs are planned for the upper slide in 2018. Both slides delivered unknown quantities of sediment to the stream. While it would be desirable to remove these segments of road from an aquatics perspective, travel management considerations identified the road as essential for providing for management and public access. Overall, sediment levels are very high in the watershed based on limited sampling. However as noted by Sylte and Fischenich (2002), cobble embeddedness exhibits high spatial and temporal variability in both natural and disturbed streams. Sampling must be intensive within streams or stream reaches to detect changes. Intensive sampling has not occurred and surveys were not conducted in the same location between years. Determining a trend for embeddedness is therefore not possible given the lack of available data. Additionally, extensive road decommissioning, has been implemented since 2012 and may also be contributing, in part, to higher levels in the short term. Riffle and pool habitats made up 65% and 35% of stream habitats in 2015, respectively. While the overall percent of pools was somewhat low, the frequency of those pools were the highest noted in the surveyed watersheds. This is due to relatively high frequencies of large wood present in the stream and the well forested stands along its length. Regeneration timber harvest activities have occurred on 34% of the watershed between the 1950s and 1996. No harvest has occurred since then. Streamside buffers of 50’or larger were retained on all but 4 miles (13%) of non-fish bearing or intermittent streams beginning in the 1970s. Harvest retained buffers of 100-400’ on all fish bearing streams. ECA is currently at 4%, or a high condition. Forested stands within RHCAs are aged as follows: 10% are < 40 years old, 50% are between 40 and 100 years and the remaining 40% older than 100 years. The middle age classes are partly a result of a wildfire which occurred in 1931. The fire burned 27% of the drainage and 43% of the RHCAs. The RHCAs would therefore be considered mostly functional given the large percentage of older age classes and minimal human related disturbance within them. As a result, they are trending in an upward condition and would continue to provide for shade, wood, and stable banks in the West Fork Clear Creek drainage. There are 32 miles of Forest system roads within the watershed with 5 miles occurring within RHCAs. A total of 2 miles of the RHCA roads are opened to motorized traffic and the remaining roads are closed. The overall watershed road density is 3.8 mi/mi2. The RHCA and landslide prone road densities are 2.3 mi/mi2 and 0.2 mi/mi2, respectively. A total of 10 miles of system road and 36 miles of non-system road have been decommissioned since 2012. A minimum of 30 water crossings were removed. There has been a 20% reduction in system roads since 1995 as a result of the decommissioning. Road treatments included abandonment to full recontouring and stream crossing removal. Decommissioning results in short term sediment increases at stream crossing removal sites but removes the risk of future crossing failure. Decommissioning is expected to contribute to a long term reduction in sediment delivery to streams.. Improving trends in instream sediment are expected over time as a result. There are 41 stream crossings within the watershed, one of which occurs on fish bearing streams. It was replaced in 2012 and is no longer a barrier to upstream passage. A total of 30 culverts are appropriately sized and the remaining 11 crossings are undersized for the area they drain. All roads cross perpendicular to the stream channels limiting their effects to riparian vegetation; however portions of the ditchlines drain directly into the streams. These 6 sites may be acting as a chronic sediment source of sediment to streams. Ditchlines leading to the 1 fish bearing crossings currently have cross drain pipes installed and are no longer adding sediment to streams at those sites. In summary, timber harvest has not occurred in the Hoodoo (West Fork) Clear Creek prescription watershed for 22 years. RHCAs are intact and in a state to provide for long term streambank stability, shade and large wood. As a result, they will contribute to long term aquatic habitat maintenance and improvement. Recent road decommissioning, live water culvert replacements, and cross drain culvert replacements have been implemented in order to reduce road related sediment delivery to streams. Also, the majority of roads are closed to motorized use which limits degradation of the road surface and potential sediment delivery to streams. When compared to past watershed conditions, these activities are expected to have initiated an upward trend in fish habitat capacity in this prescription watershed. Proposed Activity Effects to Streams The Clear Creek Project would continue the existing upward trend by decommissioning an additional 0.8 miles of road, 0.2 miles of which is within RHCAs. This would not change watershed or RHCA road densities from the existing conditions of 3.8 mi/mi2 and 2.3 mi/mi2, respectively. The majority of road decommissioning and road improvement were conducted under previous projects between 2012 and 2015. The Clear Creek Project also reconstructs 15.3 miles of system road (40% of the roads in the prescription watershed) which helps reduce sediment delivery by diverting road ditchline flow through cross drain culverts and away from streams. A total of 9.9 miles was already completed under the Road 650 Project in 2014. The Clear Creek project would replace the 11 existing undersized culverts with those sized for a 100- year flow event. This would reduce the risk of future failure. All crossings in the watershed would be appropriately sized after project completion. The Project would recondition 7.1 miles of road (19% of the roads). Reconditioning would apply gravel where needed to minimize the amount of erosion from road surfaces during log haul operations. The use of dust abatement during log haul would also minimize road surface erosion and potential input of sediment to streams. All project activities are expected to have a negative effect on aquatic condition in the short term based on sediment yields as modeled in NEZSED. Model results from NEZSED indicate sediment yield increases at the mouth of West Fork Clear Creek to 55% as a result of project activities. This meets the Forest Plan standard of 60%. The FISHSED model was used in conjunction with NEZSED to determine potential changes in fish habitat carrying capacity. The model predicted a 7% increase in cobble embeddedness and decrease in summer/winter juvenile steelhead rearing capacity of 8% and 15%, respectively. Winter rearing capacity exceeds the level of 10% where changes in habitat quality could occur (Stowell et al. 1983); however, local RHCA monitoring found no sediment delivery through the buffers (USDA, 2014). Visual observations of post-harvest areas found the same results elsewhere on the Forest (K. Smith, personal observations, 2000-2013). With no delivery, cobble embeddedness levels are not expected to increase as a result of harvest. FISHSED model documentation states that the effects evaluation should be adjusted if riparian areas are to be treated differently than surrounding land. RHCAs retain no harvest buffers that are much wider than those used when FISHSED was developed; therefore the model results are considered overestimates, particularly when combined with fewer actual acres of harvest (NEPA vs. layout acres). ECAs would increase to 26% under Alternative C, a Moderate condition class rating based on the NOAA matrix (1998). This exceeds the desired threshold of 20%. However, no channel alterations as a result of increased water yield is expected. This is due to the loss of 20-35% of the harvest acres that will occur during unit layout. The expected loss is based on recent comparisons of NEPA versus layout units (see project file for the Lost Mule Timber Sale). The reduced acres would result in lower ECAs. Overall Trend Summary for the Hoodoo Creek Prescription Watershed In summary, the current upward trend has been established through intact RHCAs, a lack of recent timber harvest, previous road decommissioning, culvert replacement, and road improvement projects. The Clear Creek Project would maintain that trend through additional road improvement activities when combined with design feature and BMP implementation. These have been shown to be effective at minimizing effects to streams (Sugden, 2018; Arismendi et al, 2017; Hatten et al 2017; Sugden et al 2012; USDA Forest Service, 2009). The Clear Creek Project therefore complies with the Forest Plan upward trend requirement. Hoodoo Creek Prescription Watershed Activities  Watershed Area 10.1 Sq.

Big Cedar Creek and Lower Clear Creek Prescription watersheds do not have assigned objectives in the Forest Plan. The upward trends for Clear Creek and its prescription watersheds are primarily a result of riparian areas that are intact with minimal effects from management and a majority of roads that are graveled and positioned to have minimal effects on streams. In addition, the Appendix A Implementation Guide (Conroy and Thompson 2011) states “It was assumed in the Forest Plan that implementation of instream restoration and other watershed restoration activities would result in an upward trend in carrying capacity. Where these activities have been implemented, it could be stated that an upward trend in the habitat conditions has been accomplished.” Watershed restoration activities in the form of road improvement, culvert replacement and road decommissioning have been, and continue to be implemented since 2011. These have contributed to the upward trend in fish habitat carrying capacity throughout the watershed. Although short term impacts to modeled water and sediment yield are expected with the implementation of the Clear Creek project, they are less than those that could occur under Alternative A (No Action). The No Action alternative does not address road-related sediment issues beyond what projects have already been completed. Short term (<5 years) negative impacts with long term beneficial impacts to sediment yield are expected as a result of the Clear Creek IR Project road improvement and road decommissioning activities. Modeled sediment yield using NEZSED shows an increase in all prescription watersheds but all remain below Forest Plan water quality objectives with the exception of Hoodoo under Alternative C which exceeds the objectives by 1%. Modeling in FISHSED shows increases in cobble embeddedness or reductions in fish habitat capacity of 1-15% depending on the alternative. Alternative B exceeds 10% for winter rearing in the Hoodoo watershed. Alternative C exceeds 10% for cobble embeddedness in Brown Springs and Solo and exceeds for winter rearing in Brown Springs, Solo and Hoodoo watersheds. Alternative D exceeds 10% for cobble embeddedness in Brown Springs. Upward trend of aquatic and watershed conditions, particularly related to sediment, would be realized in the long term (>5 years). The short term impacts represent the maximum potential for erosion/sediment delivery and/or increase in water yield. Best Management Practices and project specific design measures would be implemented to minimize these impacts. In summary, the Clear Creek IR Project would have minimal short term negative effects associated with modeled water and sediment yield increases but would have a long term positive effect associated with road improvements. The combined road-related projects are expected to maintain an upward trend through reduced sediment delivery and runoff from roads to streams and aquatic habitats throughout the watershed. Reduced chronic sediment delivery is expected to allow for improved fish habitat carrying capacity and a continued upward trend over time. This is consistent with and follows the direction of the Forest Plan Appendix A Guidance document. The conclusions regarding aquatic trends in the prescription watersheds are the consequence of subtle balances between the short-term impacts and long-term improvements. Trend conclusions must also be tempered with knowledge of the variability of conditions within the watersheds and the unpredictability of weather and natural disturbance events. Future trend will likely be very much influenced by future events –both management activities and natural events, including climate change. Appendix M – RMRS Watershed Analysis Appendix M is a NEW Appendix. Watershed Analysis using WEPP Technology for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project                      William J.

The goal of the project is to restore desired silvicultural distributions and diversity within areas of even aged stands on 3400 ha (8400 acres) within the project area. The proposed activities included commercial harvesting and thinning by skyline or tractor methods, and prescribed burns, either broadcast or jackpot. The Clear Creek watershed is a sensitive area as it is an historic spawning area for Pacific salmon, and is upstream a Tribal fish hatchery that depends on the creek for high quality water. 2 All areas will be rounded off to make for easier reading. 3 https://forest.moscowfsl.wsu.edu/fswepp/ 4 http://landfire.gov/ The USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS) was asked to help estimate the erosion from units treated by timber removal, prescribed fire and part of the road network, and to compare those estimates to earlier estimates using the NezSed model. Sediment delivery rates from treatment units were estimated using GeoWEPP, a GIS interface to the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) watershed version. A new road network erosion analysis tool under development by RMRS and the USDA National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory was combined with the FS WEPP:Road Batch3 to estimate sediment delivery from part of the road network.  Methods The general approach to the analysis was to determine erosion from the current condition for an undisturbed forest, and following a wildfire, assumed to occur about once every 80 years. The wildfire severity was estimated by the FlamMap fire spread model for the current fuel loads in the LANDFIRE database. From these two runs, a background erosion rate was estimated. The sediment delivery from 646 individual treatment units were then analyzed for prescribed fire (broadcast and jackpot) and timber removal (tractor logging or skyline). Following timber removal, the fuel model that serves as input to FlamMap was changed to a recommended model following fuel reduction, and FlamMap rerun for the landscape. The output from this run was used to run GeoWEPP a final time to estimate erosion rates following wildfire on the proposed treatment units. Flammap Intensity and Soil Burn Severity Prediction The FlamMap model considers slope, aspect, available fuel (“fuel model”), canopy cover, stand height, canopy base height and canopy bulk density to estimate wildfire intensity. The FlamMap input variables are incorporated into a landscape (LCP) file that can be downloaded from the LANDFIRE database web site4. The distributed fuel model layer as recommended by the LANDFIRE database was used for the initial run. For the post treatment run, several fuel models as recommended by the ArcFuels user guide for treated conditions were run for the entire landscape (Vaillant et al., 2013). We decided to use the model that resulted in the highest flame lengths, model TU1 (161) “Low Load Dry Climate Timber – Grass-Shrub” (Scott and Burgan, 2005). Weather, wind and fuel moisture data needed to run FlamMap were based on weather records from the Fenn Ranger Station, located about 20 km (12 miles) east of the study area. The weather data were downloaded from the FAMWEB5 web site and into the Fire Family Plus software. Fire Family Plus software provided the tools to format the weather data for use in FlamMap. FlamMap provides a number of outputs. For this analysis, the flame length in each pixel was used as a surrogate for fire energy release or fire intensity. 5 https://fam.nwcg.gov/fam-web/ 6 http://geodjango.mtri.org/geowepp/ An investigation of recent wildfire soil burn severity distributions of the NPC was done to determine the distribution of wild fire soil burn severity. Ten fires from 2015 were analyzed. The results showed a distribution of fire burn severities were: high = 6.4%; moderate = 22.6%; low = 38.5%; and unburned = 32.5%. This distribution was used to classify burn severity from the flame length predicted by the FlamMap model, with the longest flame lengths assumed to result in the highest burn severities (Elliot at al., 2016). The flame length raster output from FlamMap for the current fuel loads was classified as unburned, low, moderate, or high severity so that the fraction of each severity was similar to what had been observed for recent wildfires (Table 1). A second FlamMap flame length raster was generated for the treated condition. The same flame length classification ranges from the initial run were used to estimate burn severity following a second FlamMap run, this time for the treated fuel condition. The maximum predicted flame lengths for the fuel model were about 1.6 m, so the entire landscape was classified as either unburned or low severity. Table 1. Classification of flame lengths into soil burn severity, and assumed ground cover for each severity. Burn Severity Category Percent of landscape Range of Flame Lengths (m) Ground Cover (percent) Repellency Unburned 32.5 < 1.2 100 No Low 38.5 1.2 – 1.8 60 No Moderate 22.6 1.9 – 3.8 40 No High 6.4 > 3.9 30 Yes  The flame length (raster) maps were uploaded into the Burned Area Emergency Response, Spatial WEPP Model Inputs Generator6. This site combines a fire intensity or burn severity map with soil properties from the SSURGO OR STATSGO databases and the Forest Service Disturbed WEPP soil erodibility database to generate soil files formatted specifically for use with the Geo Spatial GIS Wizard for the WEPP Watershed Version (GeoWEPP) (Miller et al., 2016). Management Activities The NPC had proposed numerous treatments to obtain a desired forest condition. Only those activities that would likely result in an increase in sediment delivery were modeled. They were timber harvest with tractor logging and skyline/cable logging, prescribed fire as a broadcast burn, and prescribed fire as a jackpot burn. Each activity affects ground cover and soil properties. To address these impacts within the WEPP technology, the modeler selects an appropriate vegetation category for each treatment and a ground cover amount for each treatment. Table 2 shows the categories and ground covers assumed for these activities. The ground cover values are based on observations on numerous studies that have been carried out in the Interior Pacific Northwest where impacts of skyline and tractor logging, and prescribed fire have been measured. Research studies by the Rocky Mountain Research Station have shown that soil texture has much less influence on soil erodibility than vegetation category. For this study, we assumed that the dominant texture was silt loam, and used that for all vegetation categories (Table 2). WEPP Hillslope Erosion Prediction Two types of modeling conditions were developed: 1) the post wildfire for current and treated vegetation conditions, where soil properties were determined by fire intensity as estimated from FlamMap outputs and the underlying SSURGO/STATSGO soil database; and 2) the treated conditions where a silt loam soil was assumed, and soil properties depended on the proposed management actions. FlamMap burn severity distributions varied across the landscape. For the treated conditions, we assumed a constant condition for each of the proposed activities as shown in Table 2. The depth of soil for all treated conditions was assumed to be the same as the average depth of soils in the SSURGO database, about 1500 mm (60 inches). Table 2.

To achieve this within a large area such as the Clear Creek watershed, the modeled area needs to be subdivided. Dr. Mary Ellen Miller (Michigan Tech Research Institute) developed a GIS addin (Fire ToolBox) specifically designed to break up a large watershed (raster) into smaller, subwatersheds, where the user defines the desired area (Elliot and Miller, 2016). We used the Fire ToolBox to obtain the desired watershed areas (approximately 5 km2) for the GeoWEPP runs. This procedure resulted in 40 subwatersheds that incorporated all of the proposed treatment units. Within each subwatershed, GeoWEPP defined hillslope polygons of approximately 4 ha (10 acres) and estimated the erosion rate for each polygon. Each of the subwatersheds was run for each of the 7 conditions: undisturbed forest, wildfire under current fuel loads, wildfire following fuel treatment, tractor logging, skyline logging, broadcast prescribed fire and jackpot prescribed fire. This resulted in a total of 7 x 40 = 280 separate GeoWEPP runs. When a set of 40 runs for one of the conditions had been complete, we utilized the merge function in ArcMap to reunite the smaller watersheds back into the original larger watershed. The current version of GeoWEPP does not allow the user to specify undisturbed streamside buffers. This means that the estimated upland erosion rate may be over predicted by a small amount, but it would not be advisable to assume sediment detached in the upland areas was all delivered to the streams. The online Disturbed WEPP hillslope interface7 or Great Lakes Watershed interface8 can be used to evaluate buffer effectiveness. This detailed analysis was beyond the scope of this project. 7 https://forest.moscowfsl.wsu.edu/ 8 http://cals-wepponlinegis.ag.uidaho.edu/gl/ 9 http://milford.nserl.purdue.edu/ol/roads/ To complete the analysis, it was necessary to combine the results from the individual GeoWEPP hillslopes with the 646 proposed treatment units. Each treatment unit could intersect one or more GeoWEPP hillslopes. To estimate the erosion within each treatment unit, we used ArcToolbox’s Analysis Tools such as “spatial join” then choosing to “intersect the mean”, defining treatment units on each of the erosion maps. Using this process estimated the area-weighted erosion as a mean within each treatment unit. All of these results are available within the attribute tables in ArcMap and in spreadsheets by treatment units, in either English or metric units. The resulting distributions of erosion were sorted in spreadsheets to determine the average erosion rate for each treatment. WEPP Road Erosion Prediction The GIS Road layers were provided by the NPC. For the road analysis, we dropped all roads that were specified as “nonexistent.” Map 10 shows the network that was modeled in black. We formatted and uploaded the road network layers into an online GIS tool designed to determine road segment length and steepness, and whether the segment intersected a stream, or not9. We developed a cross walk table for the NPC road status and the road designations recognized by the online interface. Table 3 summarizes the crosswalk categories. The online tool is run by sub watershed, where the roads are subdivided into eroding segments based on the underlying topography and user input. We specified a maximum road segment length of 90 m (300 ft). As an output file, the interface specified the road segment length and steepness, whether it was a stream crossing, and the online category (Table 3). Using logic statements in a spread sheet, we defined the WEPP:Road Design, Road Surface, Traffic Level and Width for each road segment as shown in Table 3. Once the characteristics of each road segment were defined in WEPP:Road terms, those values were input into the FSWEPP WEPP:Road Batch program and the road erosion and runoff, and sediment delivery to a channel from each road segment were estimated. For road segments not at a stream crossing, we assumed a very conservative buffer width of 15 m (50 ft). The output amounts for road surface erosion and sediment delivery to a channel for each WEPP:Road segment were recombined in a spreadsheet totaling all original NPC segments to determine the erosion and sediment delivery associated with each of these original NPC road segments.  Results The spatial results of the distribution of fire intensity from the FlamMap runs are presented on Map 1 for wildfire for the current condition and Map 2 if the entire area were treated. The erosion associated with the FlamMap run (Map 1) for current conditions is presented in Map 3, averaging the GeoWEPP polygons within each treatment unit. The total area of the proposed treatments is 3500 ha (8400 acres). Map 4 shows the distribution of erosion for undisturbed upland forest conditions for the treatment polygons. The 45 and 90 m (150 and 300 ft) PACFISH buffers are shown on the treatment map, but were not included in the erosion analysis. Map 5 shows the potential erosion associated with skyline logging for all of the treatment units. There are 1500 ha (3715 acres) schedule for this action (Table 4). Map 6 is the potential erosion from tractor logging. There are 2000 ha (4900 acres) scheduled for tractor logging (Table 4). GIS layers are provided as an addendum to this report should the forest wish to develop a merged map of these two treatments. The erosion estimated where all of the treatment units subjected to jackpot burning is shown in Map 7. Only 200 ha (490 acres) of the 3500 ha (8400 acres) shown on the map are being considered for jackpot burning, about 35 percent of the total area to be burned.

Only 360 ha (885 acres) of broadcast burning are in the restoration plan, about 65 percent of the area proposed to be burned. Map 9 is the predicted erosion rate for all the treatment units should a wildfire occur following treatment. As all units are at risk to wildfire, the predictions on this map apply to all 3500 ha (8400 acres) scheduled to be treated. Map 10 shows the difference in post wildfire resulting from the proposed restoration treatments. The more red the polygon, the greater the benefit from reduced erosion due to the restoration treatments. The spreadsheets that were developed summarizing the erosion from each treatment were sorted, so that only the units scheduled for treatment were considered in summarizing the tabular erosion by treatment. These results are shown in Table 4. Note that the erosion values presented represent not only the effect of the treatment as shown in Table 2, but also the length and steepness of the slope as determined by GeoWEPP from the underlying digital elevation model. The spreadsheets are appended to this report, so that additional analyses of specific treatments can be considered, as well as the erosion risks of the other alternatives, or applying those treatments to areas not currently scheduled for a given treatment. For the prescribed fire, the treatment units were not specific as to which method would be used. We assumed that the 360 ha with the lowest erosion rates would be broadcast burned, whereas the 200 ha with the highest erosion rates would be jackpot burned, as they would likely be prescribed for steep slopes. Because the jackpot burning Table 4 Summary of areas and erosion associated with each treatment. Treatment Proposed Area (ha (acres)) Estimated Erosion Rate (Mg/ha) Wildfire under Current Conditions 3500 (8600) 4.56 Wildfire following fuel treatments 3500 (8600) 0.047 Undisturbed Forest 3500 (8600) 0.22 Precommercial Thin, Tractor 1300 (3200) 0.86 Precommercial Thin, Skyline 400 (1000) 0.44 Regeneration, Tractor Logged 675 (1660) 0.93 Regeneration, Skyline Logged 1000 (2500) 0.49 Improvement, Tractor Logged 25 (60) 0.73 Improvement, Skyline Logged 110 (470) 0.29 Prescribed Fire, Broadcast Burn 360 (900) 1.24 Prescribed Fire, Jackpot Burn 200 (500) 1.89  was attached to the areas with highest erosion, the average value for jackpot burning is greater than for broadcast burning on the more gentle slopes. The road erosion analysis is summarized in Table 5. Roads specified as non-existing were dropped from the analysis, leaving 248 distinct road segments. By specifying a maximum road segment length of 90 m (300 ft), the 248 segments provided by the NPC were disaggregated into nearly 3,000 segments with lengths of 90 m or less by the online watershed interface, and were then formatted for the WEPP:Road analysis. These 3,000 segments were run in lots of about 200 through WEPP Road Batch. The results of the 3,000 segments were then recombined by their NPC designations to determine road erosion and sediment delivery by the original NPC road segment modeled, and can be found in the appended spreadsheets. Table 5 shows that the average annual amount of sediment entering the stream system was 809 tons from a total of 270 km (166 miles) of road, or about 2.8 Mg of sediment per km road (4.9 tons/mile). The average road surface erosion rate was 860 Mg per square kilometer of road surface (2,500 tons/square mile). Discussion The undisturbed forest soil erosion rate (0.22 Mg/ha) can be converted to about 60 tons per square mile. This is similar to the NezSed “Background” rate of 30-40 tons per square mile. The WEPP values are for hillslope erosion, whereas the NezSed values are for the expected sediment to be delivered from sub basins within the study area. Regular monitoring of sub basin sediment delivery was the source of the NezSed values. It is widely accepted that sediment delivery from watersheds is lower than upslope erosion. For a 4 sq km (2 sq mile) watershed, the estimated sediment delivery ratio would be about 0.3 (Huffman et al., 2013), reducing the predicted hillslope erosion rate of 60 tons per square mile to a sediment delivery amount of about 20 tons per square mile. This sediment yield would need to be increased to account for sediment from Table 5.

Thus it is clear that the overall predicted upland erosion and sediment delivery rates are similar when comparing the NezSed estimates to the WEPP estimates. The hillslope erosion rate (0.22 Mg/ha (0.1 ton/acre)) is higher than we have measured in situ on numerous studies. This may be because the WEPP technology is over predicting, or it may be because we have not had any studies in place during years of very high erosion, like 1995-96. On many multi-year studies we have measure no surface erosion. We have measured soil displacement, which has often been due to animal activity. Further work is warranted to determine whether the discrepancy is due to modeling error, or a lack of field data from rare highly erosive years. The results shown in Table 4 can be analyzed to find that the total sediment from the proposed treatments (erosion rate x area) is about 15 percent of the total predicted for the undisturbed forest. This is similar to the NezSed estimates of sediment yield in the EIS that stated that on the average, Alternative C would cause an “increase over base” of 13 percent. If wildfire is assumed to have a fire return interval of about 80 years, and the average erosion from the wildfire added to the “background”, then the increase over base from the values in Table 4 is about 12 percent. Thus the sediment estimates from NezSed, using a completely different approach to modeling, is similar to what has been predicted by this analysis. The main benefit of the WEPP analysis, aside from confirming the validity of the NezSed estimates, is that the GIS layers showing the distribution of erosion by specific treatment unit may assist managers to better target less aggressive treatments to areas of greatest erosion risk. The erosion maps presented in Maps 3-8 are by proposed action. More detailed maps by hillslope polygon are included in the appended files, and we can provide guidance on accessing that information should the NPC want to look more closely at some of the more sensitive treatment areas. The unexpectedly low erosion rate following the wildfire for the treated condition is likely due to the large areas of low severity and unburned patches predicted from the FlamMap run for the fuel model selected. The fact that the value is lower than the treatments is likely because the soil database is not the same. The SSURGO soils are often deeper, this leads to less runoff and erosion when modeled with WEPP rather than the 1500 mm assumed for all of the treatment runs. One of the important results in Table 4 is the major reduction in wildfire erosion that can be expected from the proposed restoration activities. Reducing understory fuel loads and increasing canopy spacing as proposed in the restoration plan will both contribute to reduced fire risk, and reduced fire intensity. This prediction is supported by anecdotal observations within the NPC following recent wildfires. Generally, all of the predicted erosion rates except the post treatment wildfire estimate, are greater than we have measured from undisturbed and treated forests. Most of the erosion we have measured from forest activities, including both timber removal and prescribed fire, is movement on the hillslope, and not from the hillslope. This is due in part to the lack of severe hydrologic events, such as the floods of 1995 and 1996, occurring during our studies that were carried out between 2000 and 2014. The proposed large buffers in the restoration will further reduce the likelihood of sediment delivery. The estimated benefits of a buffer can readily be seen by using the Disturbed WEPP Hillslope10 or Great Lakes Watershed11 online interfaces. 10 https://forest.moscowfsl.wsu.edu/fswepp/ 11 http://cals-wepponlinegis.ag.uidaho.edu/gl/ Another consideration with the restoration plan is that not only will the proposed activities lead to much lower post wildfire erosion risks, but they will reduce the likelihood of a serious fire occurring for ten or more years because of the lack of fuel to carry a fire. When comparing the WEPP:Road results shown in Table 5 to NezSed, the NezSed model had gross surface erosion ranging from 5,000 to 67,500 tons per square mile of road surface, depending on the road condition, compared to 2,453 tons per square mile of surface erosion from the WEPP Road predictions. Most of the NezSed road erosion categories were for 5,000 tons per square mile, and these values were then reduced by a number of factors resulting in surface erosion values similar to the WEPP predictions. The very short buffers assumed for the WEPP:Road analysis resulted in delivery of 75 percent of the eroded sediment, whereas the NezSed model appears to have sediment delivery coefficients averaging 17 percent for road segments. Table 5 shows that if the total road sediment delivery (809 tons) is divided by the area of the Clear Creek Watershed (44,000 acres), the resulted erosion rate is about 12 tons/square mile. This is similar to values predicted by the WEPP Fume online interface, but is greater than the 2.2 tons/square mile predicted by NezSed. Were a sediment delivery ratio of 0.17 applied to the WEPP:Road results, the sediment delivery would be 2.67 tons/square mile, similar to the NezSed results. A more detailed analysis beyond the scope of this study is planned to better determine the buffer lengths for the WEPP:Road analysis. It is anticipated that buffer lengths will increase from the conservative estimate of 50 feet to more than 200 feet for most road segments, significantly reducing the estimated sediment delivery. These results will be provide to the NPC once the analysis is complete. Synthesis Table 6 provides a synthesis of estimated sources of sediment in this watershed. It appears that the estimated sediment from surface erosion in the undisturbed forest and landslides are the greatest source of sediment in this watershed. As previously discussed, the erosion from the forest may be overestimated. As managers can do little about forest erosion or landslides, any desire to reduce sediment must occur in the other categories. Table 6.

This reduction in likely sediment delivery is much less than the predicted increase in sedimentation associated with the restoration activities. The estimated erosion associated with restoration treatments will be less if the proposed Pacfish buffers are incorporated into the analysis. Further analysis can estimate the change in sediment delivery from such buffers. This study has provided erosion by hillslope segment. The spatial results can be studied, and the treatments adjusted to be less severe on the most erodible hillslopes identified by the study. The estimated sediment from the road network will also likely be less if a more detailed analysis that better accounts for forested buffers between the roads and the stream system is carried out. This analysis will be done, but is beyond the scope of this study. The NPC practice of installing cross drains on roads from either side of all stream crossings will also result in reduced sediment delivery from roads, as the majority of road sediment is delivered at stream and channel crossings. The equivalent estimates from the initial NezSed analysis are presented in Table 6 for comparison. NezSed lumps the undisturbed forests and landslide sediment into a single value, which is similar to the sum of the WEPP predictions for the undisturbed forest plus the landslide sediment delivery estimated by McClelland et al. (1997). The original EIS estimated an average increase in sediment delivery due to treatments of 12 percent above background, or about 4.2 tons/square mile. This is in the same range as the 3 tons/square mile predicted from this study. The sediment delivery estimated by NezSed from roads is less than that initially estimated by WEPP in this study, but the WEPP value will likely decrease significantly when an improved estimate for buffers between roads and streams is incorporated into the WEPP analysis. NezSed does not explicitly include erosion from wildfire in its analysis, but sediment delivery measured from streams in the forest that was used for developing NezSed likely included sediment that was delivered to the stream system by a fire in decades preceding the monitoring period. Conclusions This study estimated the erosion on undisturbed forests, burned forests, forests under restoration, and much of the forest road network. The study confirmed that the erosion estimates made using the NezSed technology are similar to those using the WEPP technology, even though the two technologies use very different methods. The NezSed technology is based on locally observed sediment data, and the WEPP technology uses local conditions in a process-based hydrology and erosion model. The WEPP technology has the advantage of allowing managers to better locate hillslopes and road segments of high erosion risk, and adjust the management of those sites to reduce erosion and/or sediment delivery. The increase in erosion associated with the proposed activities will likely be offset by the reduced risk of fire, the reduced severity of a fire should it occur, and the reduction in hillslope sediment delivery following a wildfire. References Elliot, W.J., M.E.

Road decommissioning, culvert replacements, and road improvements are proposed to improve watershed health, and the restoration of 41 acres of bunchgrass communities through revegetation with native grasses and forbs is proposed to improve vegetative diversity. The project area comprises 43,731 acres of National Forest System lands within the Clear Creek drainage, located approximately 5 air miles southeast of Kooskia, Idaho. The purpose of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project (Project) is to manage forest vegetation to restore natural disturbance patterns; improve long-term resistance and resilience at the landscape level; reduce fuels; improve watershed conditions; improve elk habitat effectiveness; improve habitat for early seral species; and maintain habitat structure, function, and diversity. Timber outputs from the proposed action would be used to offset treatment costs, support the economic structure of local communities, and provide for regional and national needs. Desired conditions for the Project area were identified after careful consideration of the existing condition of the area; applicable Forest Plan management direction, recommendations in the Selway and Middle Fork Clearwater Rivers Subbasin Assessment (USDA Forest Service 2001); and the needs, opportunities, and issues identified by a site-specific interdisciplinary watershed assessment and pre-National Environmental Policy Act (pre-NEPA) analysis conducted in 2011 for the Project area. Completing the Project will move the area toward a Desired Future Condition as defined in the Nez Perce National Forest Plan1 (USDA Forest Service 1987b, pp. II-1 and II-2). 1 Forest Plan direction for this project is found in the Nez Perce National Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987) since the project area lies within the administrative boundaries of the Nez Perce National Forest. The Nez Perce and Clearwater National Forests were administratively combined in February 2013, but the existing Forest Plans for each Forest will continue to guide management actions until the Forest Plans are revised. Revision of the 1987 Forest Plans is currently ongoing. The Clear Creek Project is part of the larger Selway-Middle Fork Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Project. In 2010, the Clearwater Basin Collaborative (CBC) in partnership with the Nez Perce–Clearwater National Forests produced a comprehensive restoration strategy that was submitted for funding through the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP). This science-based proposal was designed to restore and maintain ecological conditions within the 1.4-million-acre Selway–Middle Fork ecosystem in Idaho. The Selway-Middle Fork CFLRP proposal includes the following goals: • Protect communities, private lands, and Wild and Scenic River corridors from uncharacteristic wildland fires • Reestablish and perpetuate landscapes that are diverse and resilient • Restore forest structure, function, and ecologic processes that promote aquatic health • Restore forest structure, function, and ecologic processes that promote habitat for big game and other terrestrial species • Contain or eliminate noxious weeds • Promote landscape conditions that allow fire to function as the primary restoration agent • Contribute to the economy and sustainability of rural communities The Selway–Middle Fork area is identified as a top priority for restoration in national, regional, State, and County plans and in a forest subbasin assessment. The 43,731 acres of National Forest System lands in the Clear Creek watershed lies within the Selway–Middle Fork CFLRP area. A Notice of Intent (NOI) advertising the scoping period was published in the Federal Register on January 6, 2012. A corrected NOI was published on February 9, 2012, updating the contact information that was published in the original notice. A second corrected NOI was published on February 13, 2012 extending the comment due date to March 1, 2012. A third corrected NOI, advertising two proposed site-specific Forest Plan amendments that are included in this Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS), was advertised on February 7, 2013. The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project has been presented at quarterly meetings with the Nez Perce Tribe since April 2012. The project was presented for public scoping in January 2012. The following issues related to the project proposal were raised during scoping: • Increasing patch sizes and reducing fragmentation • Improving the distribution of hiding cover relative to foraging habitat • Increasing the amount of early successional stands and wildlife foraging habitats • Improving forest structure • Providing jobs in Idaho County • Reducing planning and implementation costs by managing on a large scale • Reducing total road mileages and densities in the Clear Creek watershed • Reducing sediment input to stream channels • Reducing cumulative impacts of past timber harvest and road building on fisheries habitat, water quality, and soil productivity • Reducing effects of the road network on elk security habitat • Meeting Desired Future Conditions for watersheds, fish, and wildlife habitats These issues led the interdisciplinary team to develop alternatives to the proposed action. This DEIS analyzes a total of 4 alternatives, including a No Action Alternative. The alternatives are briefly summarized below. The issues and alternatives are described in greater detail in Chapter 2. These activities are common to all action alternatives: 41 acres of grass restoration, 1,371 acres of prescribed fire, 1,887 acres of precommercial thinning, 119.8 miles of system road reconstruction, 13.2 miles of system road decommissioning, and two site-specific Forest Plan amendments adopting the Region 1 soil standard of 15% for detrimentally compacted, displaced, or puddled soils, and clarifying the definition of old growth found in Appendix N of the Nez Perce Forest Plan. Alternative A (No Action) This alternative provides a baseline for comparing the environmental consequences of the other alternatives. Under the No Action alternative, no project activities would be implemented. Alternative B (Proposed Action, as Modified in Response to Scoping Comments) This alternative was developed in response to the purpose and need for action identified during the pre-NEPA phase of project development. It was presented for public scoping in January 2012. Alternative B would move the project area toward the desired future conditions (DFCs) that were identified for the project during the pre-NEPA phase. In addition to the activities common to all action alternatives, Alternative B proposes 2,609 acres of regeneration harvest, site preparation, and reforestation; 331 acres of improvement harvest; 5,606 acres of commercial thinning; 8.7 miles of temporary road construction on existing templates; and 27.6 miles of new temporary road construction. Alternative C (Maximal Species Conversion) This alternative would address vegetative restoration needs described in the purpose and need for action but to a greater degree than Alternative B. Alternative C would regenerate as many stands as possible while meeting objectives for other resources. In addition to the activities common to all action alternatives, Alternative C would include 4,156 acres of regeneration harvest, site preparation, and reforestation; 331 acres of improvement harvest; 4,220 acres of commercial thinning; 8.7 miles of temporary road construction on existing templates; and 27.6 miles of new temporary road construction. Alternative D (Minimal Road Construction) Alternative D would address the need for vegetative rehabilitation in the Clear Creek watershed but to a lesser degree than Alternative B. Alternative D would use existing road templates as much as possible while still meeting the need for vegetative restoration. In addition to the activities common to all action alternatives, Alternative D would include 2,178 acres of regeneration harvest, site preparation, and reforestation; 211 acres of improvement harvest; 5,141 acres of commercial thinning; 8.7 miles of temporary road construction on existing templates; and 8.8 miles of new temporary road construction. To help describe the environmental effects of each alternative as they pertain to the identified issues, the interdisciplinary team developed “indicators” that help measure the differences between the alternatives. The effects of the alternatives, as measured by these indicators, are summarized in Table S- 1. Table S- 1 Summary of Environmental Consequences by Issue Indicator Issue Indicator Alternative A (Existing Condition) Alternative B Alternative C Alternative D Aquatics/Fisheries Habitat: Riparian Habitat Conservation Area (RHCA) Road Density 1.2 mi/mi2 1.0 mi/mi2 1.0 mi/mi2 1.0 mi/mi2 Number of undersized culverts replaced and cross drains added 0 77 77 77 FISHSED results for modeled changes in cobble embeddedness  –Hoodoo Creek   – Solo Creek   – Pine Knob Creek   – Clear Creek   – Middle Fork Clear Creek   – Brown Springs Creek   – South Fork Clear Creek   – Kay Creek  33%  31%  44%  38%  55%  30%  11%  18%  34%  32%  45%  39%  56%  32%  11%  18%  34%  32%  45%  38%  56%  32%  11%  18%  34%  32%  45%  38%  56%  32%  11%  18% Economics: Volume Harvested (CCF) 0 141,500 CCF 158,000 CCF 116,400 CCF Volume Harvested (MBF) 0 75,300 85,200 61,800 Jobs Sustained 0 1,910 jobs 2,133 jobs 1,571 jobs Community Harvest Income 0 $54,252,000 $60,578,000 $44,628,000 Federal Income Tax 0 $8,138,000 $9,087,000 $6,694,000 Fuels:     Fire Regime Condition Class (FRCC) FRCC2 FRCC2 FRCC2 FRCC2 Percentage of Crown Fire Susceptible Landscape 51% 44% 44% 44% Soils:     Acres of ground based harvest activity on landtypes with high sub-surface erosion 0 3,080 3,080 2,950 Miles of temp roads on landtypes with high sub-surface erosion 0 30 miles 30 miles 15 miles Number of commercial harvest units requiring specialized design measures 0 77 78 75 Issue Indicator Alternative A (Existing Condition) Alternative B Alternative C Alternative D Watershed: Percent increase in equivalent clearcut area (ECA) —Upper Clear Creek  -South Fork Clear Creek  -Lower Clear Creek  -Clear Creek   0 0 0 0  15% 7% 8% 10%  15% 7% 9% 10%  13% 6% 7% 9% Percent sediment yield increased over base (natural) as modeled by NEZSED  – Pine Knob Creek  – Browns Spring Creek  – Clear Creek  – Solo Creek  – Middle Fork Clear Creek  – Kay Creek  – South Fork Clear Creek  – Hoodoo Creek    1.2% 2.0% 0.8% 1.5% 1.0% 1.5% 0.6% 2.4%    16% 23% 7% 16% 8% 3% 5% 20%    16% 24% 7% 16% 8% 3% 6% 21%    16% 21% 5% 14% 5% 2% 4% 17% Watershed road density(mi/mi2)  – Pine Knob Creek  – Browns Spring Creek  – Clear Creek  – Solo Creek  – Middle Fork Clear Creek  – Kay Creek  – South Fork Clear Creek  – Hoodoo Creek  – Big Cedar Creek  – Lower Clear Creek Face   4.8 4.1 2.3 3.5 2.4 2.6 1.6 4.6 4.6 1.8   4.3 3.2 2.3 3.1 2.2 2.4 1.6 4.4 4.4 1.8   4.3 3.2 2.3 3.1 2.2 2.4 1.6 4.4 4.4 1.8   4.3 3.2 2.3 3.1 2.2 2.4 1.6 4.4 4.4 1.8 Wildlife: Acres of habitat treated – Black-backed Woodpecker 0  649  649  592 Acres of habitat treated– Fisher  Winter habitat  Summer habitat  0 0   3,334 637   2,855 637   2,013 495 Acres of habitat treated– Flammulated Owl 0  327  349  257 Acres of habitat treated– Fringed Myotis 0  146  146  125 Acres of habitat treated – Long-eared Myotis 0  674  674  487 Acres of habitat treated– Long-legged Myotis 0  674  674 4 87 Acres of habitat treated– Mountain Quail 0 35 35 35 Acres of habitat treated– Northern Goshawk Nesting 0  298  298  290 Acres of habitat treated– Pileated Woodpecker Nesting 0  875  875  772 Acres of habitat treated – Pine Marten 0  1,229  1,229  836 Acres of habitat treated – Pygmy Nuthatch 0  347  348  306 Acres of habitat treated– Ringneck Snake 0  493  493  389 Acres of habitat treated– Western Toad Uplands 0  59  55  63 Acres of habitat treated– Moose Winter Range  0   776   776    630 Elk Winter Range – Acres treated 0  4,380  4,502  3,809 Elk Summer Range – analysis areas meeting Forest Plan standards (50%) 7 7 7 7 Lynx Denning Acres Treated 0 105 83 58 Lynx Foraging Acres Treated 0 62 61 57  After considering the potential effects of the alternatives, the Responsible Official will select an action or mix of actions to improve ecological conditions in the project area and best meet the social values associated with this piece of land.

Road decommissioning, culvert replacements, and road improvements are proposed to improve watershed health, and the restoration of 41 acres of bunchgrass communities through revegetation with native grasses and forbs is proposed to improve vegetative diversity and reduce the spread of noxious weeds. 1.1 PROJECT HISTORY Congress established the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) with Title IV of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. In addition to encouraging the collaborative, science-based ecosystem restoration of priority forest landscapes, the CFLRP has the following program goals: • Encourage ecological, economic, and social sustainability • Leverage local resources with national and private resources • Facilitate the reduction of wildfire management costs, including through re-establishing natural fire regimes and reducing the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire • Demonstrate the degree to which various ecological restoration techniques achieve ecological and watershed health objectives • Encourage utilization of forest restoration by-products to offset treatment costs, benefit local rural economies, and improve forest health The CFLRP established a fund to be used for restoration work on priority landscapes. Up to $4 million annually can be requested by selected projects. The CBC, in partnership with the Nez Perce-Clearwater Forests, developed and submitted a comprehensive restoration proposal, the Selway–Middle Fork Clearwater project, in 2010 (CBC and Forest Service 2010). The proposal outlined an ambitious strategy to plan and implement a number of projects, such as aquatic restoration, weed treatments, road decommissioning, fuel reductions, and forest restoration, across the 1.4-million-acre Selway–Middle Fork ecosystem in Idaho. The Selway–Middle Fork area is identified as a top priority for restoration in national, regional, State, and County plans and in a forest subbasin assessment. The Selway–Middle Fork CFLRP proposal included the following goals: • Protect communities, private lands, and Wild and Scenic River corridors from uncharacteristic wildland fires • Reestablish and perpetuate landscapes that are diverse and resilient • Restore forest structure, function, and ecologic processes that promote aquatic health • Restore forest structure, function, and ecologic processes that promote habitat for big game and other terrestrial species • Contain or eliminate noxious weeds • Promote landscape conditions that allow fire to function as the primary restoration agent • Contribute to the economy and sustainability of rural communities Proposals were reviewed in Washington, D.C., by the CFLRP Advisory Committee and 10 recommendations were forwarded to the Secretary of Agriculture for funding. The Selway–Middle Fork Clearwater project was selected for funding by the Secretary of Agriculture in August 2010. At the heart of the proposal was the Clear Creek landscape, selected as a priority for treatment by the Forests and the CBC. In August 2010, Clear Creek was selected for an assessment to determine the types, locations, and amounts of appropriate management actions that would address CFLRP goals and objectives. The Interdisciplinary Team (IDT) prepared this assessment of the Clear Creek watershed in 2011; the assessment summarized Nez Perce Forest Plan direction appropriate to the Clear Creek area, compared existing landscape conditions to desired conditions described in the Forest Plan, and identified projects that would implement the CFLRP intent, while meeting, or progressing toward, desired conditions. Projects recommended through the 2011 assessment would promote forest conditions that are resistant to forest pathogens and invasive species and resilient to wildfire and climate change; reduce wildfire risks on National Forest System (NFS)–managed lands that are adjacent to private property; promote healthy riparian and stream habitats important for fish and wildlife species; promote forest habitats that support productive populations of elk, moose, goshawk, pileated woodpecker, fisher, flammulated owl, and old forest habitats; develop a road system that provides administrative, recreational, and industrial uses while protecting sensitive habitats, minimizing sediment delivery to streams, and minimizing road construction and maintenance costs; and provide social and economic benefits to local communities. Desired conditions for the Clear Creek watershed were developed using Nez Perce National Forest Plan (Forest Plan) (USDA Forest Service 1987b) direction; broad-scale assessments (e.g., Integrated Scientific Assessment for Ecosystem Management in the Interior Columbia Basin [Quigley et al. 1996] and Selway and Middle Fork Clearwater Rivers Subbasin Assessment [USDA Forest Service 2001]); and the best science currently available. The development of desired conditions for the Clear Creek project was periodically reviewed by the CBC for consistency with the CFLRP and to ensure that the project proposal was socially, ecologically, and economically robust. In the spirit of transparency, these same desired conditions were also shared with and input solicited from other routine Forest planning participants (e.g., Friends of the Clearwater and Alliance for the Wild Rockies). During the pre-National Environmental Policy Act (pre-NEPA) phase of Project development, the IDT identified large polygons or patches within the Project area referred to as “Focus Areas.” The Focus Areas were identified based on a need to promote similar age classes by connecting recently regenerated stands (preferably within the last 20 years). The intent was to establish breaks in continuous fuels, favor areas with known or developing forest health issues, and target over-represented mid seral and mature age classes. The IDT also attempted to bound these areas with identifiable features, such as forest type breaks, topographic breaks, and administrative boundaries. The Focus Areas served as the basis for developing the Proposed Action. A new Focus Area, developed after the Proposed Action was presented for scoping, has been added to all of the action alternatives in this Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS). It includes about 420 acres of regeneration harvest and some commercial thin and precommercial thin units lying outside of the original configuration of the Focus Areas. The new Focus Area includes 1.2 miles of temporary roads, some of which would be on existing templates. 1.2 PROJECT AREA The Clear Creek drainage lies within the Middle Fork Clearwater River drainage near Kooskia, Idaho. The Clear Creek drainage totals 65,000 acres, with 33% (21,269 acres) in private or State ownership and the remaining 67% (43,731 acres) under the management of the Moose Creek Ranger District. The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project area includes all 43,731 acres of NFS lands within the Clear Creek drainage (Figure 1-1). All of the project area lies within the upper two-thirds of the drainage. The project area is located approximately 5 air miles southeast of Kooskia, Idaho, within Townships 30, 31, and 32 N, Ranges 5 and 6 E, Boise Meridian. Figure 1-1. Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project Vicinity Map 1.3 PURPOSE AND NEED FOR ACTION The purpose of the project is to manage forest vegetation to restore natural disturbance patterns; improve long-term resistance and resilience at the landscape level; reduce fuels; improve watershed conditions; increase elk forage; improve early seral wildlife habitat; and maintain habitat structure, function, and diversity. These actions are needed to move resource conditions in the project area from existing conditions toward desired conditions. Timber outputs from the proposed action would be used to offset treatment costs, support the economic structure of local communities, and provide for regional and national needs. The following resource management opportunities were identified for the Project area based on the existing condition of the area, applicable Forest Plan management direction; recommendations in the Selway and Middle Fork Clearwater Rivers Subbasin Assessment (USDA Forest Service 2001); and the needs, opportunities, and issues identified by an interdisciplinary watershed assessment and National Forest Management Act (NFMA) analysis conducted in 2011.  Vegetation and Wildlife Habitat Improvement 1.3.11.3.1.1 Existing Condition Historic logging practices and fire suppression have affected the diversity of tree species in the Project area. Ladder fuels have increased, and a shift to more shade-tolerant species has occurred. Currently, a higher percentage of grand fir and Douglas-fir exist than natural long-term disturbances patterns would have created and that would have dominated these habitat types in the absence of historic logging and fire suppression. Grand fir and Douglas-fir are more susceptible to insects and disease and grand fir is less likely to survive intense wildfires than early seral species (e.g., ponderosa pine , western larch , and western white pine ). In addition to affecting species composition, young forest habitat is lacking on this landscape. Patches of young forest that do exist are smaller with edges that are straighter and more even than natural disturbances would have created. 1.3.1.2 Desired Condition The desired condition is a forest structure with a range of age and size classes with species diversity that is resistant and resilient to change agents such as insects, diseases, and wildfires. Early seral species should represent a greater percentage of the species mix. 1.3.1.3 Need for Action Vegetation in this area needs to be managed to create a more diverse and resilient forest structure by creating a range of age and size classes, species diversity, and disturbance patterns that more closely emulate the results of natural disturbance. A need exists to shift tree species composition away from shade-tolerant species toward more resistant and resilient early seral species. A need also exists to increase diversity within previously harvested areas to restore long-term habitat quality for sensitive and old growth-associated species and to manage vegetation to increase young forest habitat.  Goods and Services 1.3.21.3.2.1 Existing Condition Much of the Project area consists of grand fir-dominated stands. Insect and disease infestations are contributing to increased tree mortality, while decreasing timber volume and value. 1.3.2.2 Desired Condition The desired condition is to provide a sustained yield of resource outputs as directed by the Nez Perce Forest Plan. 1.3.2.3 Need for Action Stands that are infested with insects and diseases need to be treated so that the harvested timber can provide materials for local industries.  Watershed Improvement 1.3.31.3.3.1 Existing Condition Gravel and native surface roads could contribute sediment to stream channels, which can affect water quality and fish habitat. The road system in the Clear Creek watershed has already been substantially reduced. The West Fork-South Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning Decision Notice/Finding of No Significant Impact (DN/FONSI) (USDA Forest Service 2011) project decommissioned 85 miles of roads. However, additional road decommissioning opportunities are available in the Clear Creek watershed. 1.3.3.2 Desired Condition The desired condition is to maintain a road system in the Clear Creek watershed that is adequate to provide for the goals and objectives described in the Nez Perce Forest Plan (primarily timber harvest, recreation, fire suppression, and administrative use). 1.3.3.3 Need for Action Improving watershed function and stream conditions by reducing road densities and repairing existing roads and culverts to reduce sediment and improve drainage is needed. Watershed function can also be improved by restoring compacted soils and adding organic material on old skid trails and landings. 1.4 PROPOSED ACTION The action that was proposed by the Forest Service for scoping in January 2012 is briefly described below. The Proposed Action was modified slightly in response to scoping comments that were received; the modified proposed action is described as Alternative B in this DEIS in Chapter 2. Improve forest health, provide goods and services, reduce fuels and improve wildlife habitat: • Conduct “variable retention” regeneration harvest and post-harvest burning activities on up to 2,500 to create early successional plant communities and improve wildlife habitat while reestablishing long-lived early seral tree species. Variable retention harvest would include areas of full retention (clumps) with irregular edges. Snags and legacy trees would be retained to provide structure and a future source of woody debris. Openings would probably exceed 40 acres. • Commercially thin approximately 7,810 acres to reduce stand densities, improve forest health, and reduce the chance of crown fire. • Apply improvement harvest (thin from below) to approximately 311 acres to remove encroachment and ladder fuels from ponderosa pine–dominated stands. • Construct a minimum temporary road system to carry out the proposed action. Roads would be decommissioned after use. • Precommercially thin approximately 1,865 acres to reduce stand densities, improve forest health, and reduce fuels. • Restore approximately 42 acres of bunchgrass communities through prescribed burning and revegetation with native grasses and forbs to improve vegetative diversity and reduce the spread of noxious weeds. • Apply approximately 1,400 acres of low and mixed severity prescribed fire within the Clear Creek Roadless Area to restore natural fire regimes, reduce fuels, improve wildlife habitat, and create mosaic forest conditions. Proposed activities would be consistent with the Idaho Roadless Rule and no timber cutting is proposed within the Clear Creek Roadless area. Reduce sediment production and address transportation needs: • Maintain or improve approximately 100–130 miles of system roads. Maintenance and improvement could include culvert installation or replacement, ditch cleaning, riprap placement for drainage improvement, gravel placement, road grading, or dust abatement. • Conduct additional site-specific maintenance or improvements on up to 20 miles of roads outside of proposed treatment areas to improve watershed conditions • Remove from the system between 2–5 miles of system roads no longer considered necessary for transportation needs by decommissioning. Amend the Soils section of the Nez Perce Forest Plan: A site-specific, nonsignificant Forest Plan amendment adopting Region 1 soils standards would be included. The current Nez Perce Forest Plan standard specifies that there can be no new activities in areas where detrimental soil disturbance (DSD) is over 20%. Currently, Region 1 soil quality standards (USDA Forest Service 1999) specify that at least 85% of an activity area (defined as a land area affected by a management activity) must have soil that is in satisfactory condition. In other words, detrimental impacts (including compaction, displacement, rutting, severe burning, surface erosion, and mass wasting) shall be <15% of an activity area. In areas where >15% detrimental soil conditions exist from prior activities, the cumulative detrimental effects from proposed activities, including restoration, shall not exceed the conditions prior to the proposed activity and should move toward a net improvement in soil quality. The proposed amendment would change Forest Plan Soil Standard #2 and allow activities to occur on areas with >20% DSD, as long as soil improvement activities are implemented. 1.5 DECISION FRAMEWORK The Responsible Official for this project is Forest Supervisor, Rick Brazell. In making his decision, the Responsible Official will review the purpose and need, the Proposed Action and other alternatives, the environmental consequences, and public comment to make the following decisions: • Should vegetation restoration in the Project area be completed, and if so, which forested stands should be treated and what silvicultural treatments should be applied? • Should temporary roads be constructed, and if so, how many miles of road should be constructed and where should they be constructed? • What design features, mitigation measures, and/or monitoring should be applied to the Project? 1.6 PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT A Notice of Intent (NOI) advertising the scoping period was published in the Federal Register on January 6, 2012. A corrected NOI was published on February 9, 2012, updating the contact information that was published in the original notice. A second corrected NOI was published on February 13, 2012 extending the comment due date to March 1, 2012. A third corrected NOI, advertising two proposed site-specific Forest Plan amendments that are included in this DEIS, was advertised on February 7, 2013. As part of the public involvement process, the agency also listed the proposal in the quarterly Schedule of Proposed Actions beginning April 2012. The Project has been presented to the Nez Perce Tribe at quarterly staff-to-staff meetings since April 2012. The CBC has been involved in project development since 2010 when the Clear Creek watershed was selected for assessment to determine the types, locations, and amount of appropriate management actions that would address CFLRP goals and objectives. The Proposed Action was initially developed from preliminary issues, concerns, and existing conditions that were identified by the IDT. The IDT used issues raised by the public, other agencies, and the Nez Perce Tribe to develop the scope of the actions, alternatives, and effects to consider in the DEIS. Many of the issues were addressed through project design criteria and resource protection measures. 1.7 ISSUES The Forest Service separated the issues into two groups: significant and nonsignificant. Significant issues were defined as those directly or indirectly caused by implementing the Proposed Action. Nonsignificant issues were identified as those outside the scope of the proposed action; already decided by law, regulation, Forest Plan, or other higher level decision; irrelevant to the decision to be made; or conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations explain this delineation in Section 1501.7, “…identify and eliminate from detailed study the issues which are not significant or which have been covered by prior environmental review (Sec. 1506.3)…”. A list of nonsignificant issues and reasons regarding their categorization as nonsignificant may be found in the project record.  Issues Used to Develop Alternatives to the Proposed Action 1.7.1Several concerns were raised during scoping that were used to develop alternatives to the Proposed Action. To address these concerns, the Proposed Action was modified slightly and renamed Alternative B. Two additional action alternatives, Alternatives C and D, were also developed to respond to the concerns raised by scoping commenters. 1.7.1.1 Commercial Thinning Stands Where Root Disease is Present Some commenters were concerned that commercially thinning stands with root disease could cause the disease to spread, increasing stand mortality. The IDT created Alternative C to address these concerns. Under Alternative B, treatment would be deferred in stands proposed for commercial thinning that are found to have root disease. Thinning would not be an appropriate treatment in these stands because root disease would be likely to spread. However, without treatment, these stands are unlikely to remain on the landscape as long as desired; the stands available for management could be substantially reduced, and deferring treatment in commercially thinned stands with root disease would not move these stands toward Desired Future Conditions (DFCs). Under Alternative C, commercially thinned stands that are found to have root disease would be regenerated. Regenerating these stands would help create larger patch sizes, while increasing the amount of high-quality, early seral wildlife habitat and moving the area toward DFCs for young and old forest. Issue Indicators: • Percent of the area with forest cover type dominated by long-lived early seral species compared to grand fir and Douglas-fir. • Patch sizes 1.7.1.2 Patch Sizes and Fragmentation Some commenters were concerned that past management has reduced patch sizes and increased fragmentation in the Clear Creek watershed. Since the 1980s, there has been a trend toward small, isolated harvest units that resulted in patch sizes that are smaller than would have been created through natural disturbance. The resulting forest now includes a fragmented landscape, isolated patches of young forest, and dissected large patches of older forest. During the pre-NEPA phase of project development, the IDT identified large polygons or patches within the Project area, referred to as “Focus Areas.” The Focus Areas were identified based on a need to promote similar age classes by connecting recently regenerated stands, or by retaining existing large patches of unfragmented forest. The Focus Areas served as the basis for developing the proposed action. Since Forest managers cannot plan an activity to “create” larger patches of older forest, the IDT chose to focus on reducing landscape fragmentation by treating areas near or adjacent to existing young forest. The resulting large patches of young forest will more closely resemble the disturbance regime and patch size expected from natural disturbances. At the same time, the IDT has not disregarded the importance of patch sizes in older age classes. Retaining existing large patches of unfragmented forest weighed heavily in the development of the Proposed Action. The IDT chose treatment areas that would avoid fragmenting existing patches that currently meet desired patch size conditions according to the DFCs for each Vegetative Response Unit (VRU). At the same time, it was a priority to “reconnect” areas of young forest that have become fragmented due to past management activities. Other objectives the IDT considered during development of the proposed action were to establish breaks in areas with continuous fuels, to favor areas with known or developing forest health issues, and to target over-represented mid seral and mature age classes. The IDT also attempted to bound Focus Areas with identifiable features, such as forest type breaks, topographic breaks, and administrative boundaries. The regeneration harvest proposed for all of the action alternatives would address this issue by increasing patch sizes and reducing fragmentation. Of the three action alternatives, Alternative C would do the most to address this issue because it would regenerate the most stands within the Focus Area configurations. Issue Indicators: • Patch size • Fire Regime Condition Class (FRCC) 1.7.1.3 Early Successional Stands/Young Forest/Wildlife Habitat Some commenters were concerned that the amount of young forest in the Project area should be increased to improve wildlife foraging habitat. The regeneration harvest proposed for all of the action alternatives would address this issue by increasing the amount of young forest across the landscape. Of the three action alternatives, Alternative C would do the most to address this issue because it would regenerate the most stands. Issue Indicators: • Percent of the area with forest cover type dominated by long-lived, early seral species compared to Grand fir and Douglas-fir • Percent of the area in each age class • Vertical structure • Acres treated in potential suitable habitat for sensitive species (SS) • Acres treated in Nez Perce Forest Plan Management Area (MA)16 (Elk Winter Range) • Acres treated in Nez Perce Forest Plan MA 21 (Moose Winter Range) 1.7.1.4 Forest Structure Some commenters were concerned that the Forest Service should do more to move vegetation in the Clear Creek watershed toward the desired conditions identified for this area. The desired condition is a forest structure with a range of age classes, size classes, and species diversity that is resistant and resilient to change agents such as insects, diseases, and wildfires. Early seral species should represent a greater percentage of the species mix. The regeneration harvest proposed for all of the action alternatives would address this issue by increasing the amount of young forest across the landscape, while reducing the amount of mid-seral and mature forest. Of the three action alternatives, Alternative C would do the most to address this issue because it would regenerate more acres. Issue Indicators: • Percent of Project area that could support a crown fire • Percent of the area with forest cover type dominated by long-lived early seral species compared to shade intolerant species • Percent of the area in each age class • Vertical structure 1.7.1.5 Economics Some commenters were concerned that the Project should provide jobs for the local economy. Other commenters suggested that planning and implementation costs should be reduced by managing on a large scale. The IDT considered the entire Clear Creek watershed during the pre-NEPA assessment phase and when developing the Proposed Action. Timber harvested under any of the action alternatives would meet the goals and objectives of the Forest Plan to provide a sustained yield of resource outputs. Timber outputs from the Proposed Action would be used to offset treatment costs and support the economic structure of local communities and would provide for regional and national needs. Many of the stands proposed for treatment are currently losing volume and value due to insects and diseases. Harvesting the timber would provide materials for local industries. Issue Indicators: • Timber harvest–related jobs and income • Sale feasibility 1.7.1.6 Road Densities Some commenters were concerned about the total road mileages and road densities in the Clear Creek watershed. No permanent road construction is proposed under any alternative. Alternative D was developed to address these concerns by minimizing the amount of temporary road construction. New temporary road construction would be minimized by using existing road templates as much as possible. Units would be harvested as described for Alternative B; some units would be dropped if they were not accessible by the more limited road system proposed for Alternative D. Issue Indicators: • Riparian Habitat Conservation Area (RHCA) road densities • Number of undersized culverts replaced and cross drains added • Reduction in watershed road miles 1.7.1.7 Elk Security Habitat Some commenters were concerned about the effects of the road network on elk security habitat. No permanent road construction is proposed under any alternative. Alternative D was developed to address these concerns by minimizing the amount of temporary road construction. The road system in the Clear Creek watershed has already been substantially reduced. The South Fork–West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning DN/FONSI (2011) decommissioned 85 miles of roads. Temporary roads constructed for the Project would be decommissioned and recontoured after use. Issue Indicators: • Percent of each Elk Analysis Area qualifying as secure habitat • Elk Habitat Effectiveness Areas meeting Forest Plan standards using Leege (1984)  Concerns Raised in Response to Scoping 1.7.2The Responsible Official reviewed the concerns below that were raised during the scoping. These concerns are valuable, but they do not raise unresolved conflicts with the Proposed Action and therefore are not treated as issues. Typically, these concerns have been addressed by incorporating additional mitigation or design features. 1.7.2.1 Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Plan Consistency Because the project proposal is based on the CBC’s Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Plan (CFLRP) proposal, some commenters were concerned that the project should be consistent with the requirements of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Act (CFLRA). Project implementation will be consistent with requirements of the CFLRA, as well as all Nez Perce Forest Plan standards and other laws and regulations. The expenditure of CFLRA funds that will be used to implement and monitor this project will be reviewed for consistency by the CFLRP strategy group, composed of Forest Service and CBC members. The EIS will analyze potential effects on old growth. The CFLRA requires that landscape restoration strategies “contribute to the restoration of, the structure and composition of old growth stands according to the pre-fire suppression old growth conditions of the forest type...”, which will be accomplished through project design, unit delineations, silvicultural prescriptions, and marking guidelines. The current, best available science will be used, as required by NEPA and CFLRA. The CFLRA does not allow the construction of permanent roads, thus, permanent road construction is not proposed for this Project. Any new temporary roads constructed will be recontoured after use. 1.7.2.2 Old Growth Some commenters asked that the IDT develop an alternative that would not harvest any old growth meeting Nez Perce Forest Plan or Green et al. (1992, errata corrected 2005, 2007, 2008, 2011) old growth criteria. Other commenters suggested that treatments in old growth stands should be considered if they would improve old growth habitat. No old growth would be harvested under any alternative; although improvement cuts would be conducted in some old growth stands to help keep them on the landscape longer. Appendix D describes a site-specific Forest Plan amendment, clarifying the definition of old growth found in Appendix N of the Nez Perce Forest Plan, that is common to all action alternatives in this DEIS. 1.8 REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND REQUIRED COORDINATION As part of the analysis for this project, the IDT evaluated various alternatives under the laws, regulations, and requirements relating to federal natural resource management. Several of the design features presented in Chapter 2 were developed and incorporated to ensure these requirements would be met. The following sections summarize the results of the analysis for those concerns most often noted. Additional details can be found in Chapters 2, 3, and/or the Project Record. 1.9 FOREST PLAN DIRECTION Although the Clearwater and Nez Perce National Forests were administratively combined in February 2013, management of the lands formerly within the boundary of the Nez Perce National Forest will continue to be guided by direction found in the Nez Perce Forest Plan until the plan is revised. The Nez Perce Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987b, as amended) includes goals, objectives, standards, and guidelines that direct management of forest resources. Forest Plan direction is established at 2 scales: Forest-wide direction is applicable throughout the Forest and management area direction ties specific goals, objectives, and standards to the unique capabilities of given parcels of land. Nez Perce Forest Plan standards apply to NFS lands within the Nez Perce National Forest boundary. They are intended to supplement, not replace, National and Regional policies, standards, and guidelines found in Forest Service Manuals (FSM) and Handbooks and the Northern Regional Guide. The project analysis was guided by the goals, objectives, standards, guidelines, and management area direction within the Nez Perce Forest Plan. This Project would help move the Forest toward desired conditions as described in the Forest Plan and other relevant planning direction. 1.10 CLEAN AIR ACT The Clean Air Act, passed in 1963 and amended numerous times since then, is the primary legal authority governing air quality management. This Act provides the framework for national, State, and local efforts to protect air quality. The Montana/Idaho State Airshed Group was formed to coordinate all prescribed burning activities in order to minimize or prevent impacts from smoke emissions and ensure compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the federal agency charged with enforcing the Clean Air Act. The Forest Service, including the Moose Creek Ranger District, is a member of this Airshed Group. The Project area is in North Idaho Airshed Unit 12A. All post-harvest site preparation and fuel reduction treatments would be conducted according to the requirements of the Montana/North Idaho Smoke Management Unit guidelines. 1.11 CLEAN WATER ACT Section 313 of the Clean Water Act requires federal agencies to comply with all federal, State, interstate, and local requirements; administrative authorities; and process and sanctions with respect to control and abatement of water pollution. Executive Order (EO) 12088 requires the Forest Service to meet the requirements of this Act. Therefore, all State and federal laws and regulations applicable to water quality would be applied, including 36 CFR 219.27; the Clean Water Act; the Nez Perce Forest Plan, including PACFISH Riparian Management Objectives (RMOs) and RHCAs; Idaho State Best Management Practices (BMPs); and Stream Alteration procedures. 1.12 REGION 1 SOIL QUALITY STANDARDS Region 1 soil quality standards (USDA Forest Service 1999) specify that at least 85% of an activity area (defined as a land area affected by a management activity) must have soil that is in satisfactory condition. In other words, detrimental impacts (including compaction, displacement, rutting, severe burning, surface erosion, and mass wasting) shall be less than 15% of an activity area. In areas where more than 15% detrimental soil conditions exist from prior activities, the cumulative detrimental effects from proposed activities, including restoration, shall not exceed the conditions prior to the proposed activity and should move toward a net improvement in soil quality. Project design criteria would ensure that soil quality standards are met. Appendix C describes in detail a site-specific, nonsignificant Forest Plan amendment adopting Region 1 soils standards that would be included in all action alternatives in the DEIS. The following amendment to Nez Perce Forest Plan Soil Quality Standard #2, specific to the Clear Creek project area, is proposed: Where detrimental soil conditions from past activities affect 15 percent or less of the activity area, a cumulative minimum of 85 percent of the activity area shall not be detrimentally compacted, displaced, or puddle upon completion of activities. Where detrimental soil conditions from past activities affect more than 15 percent of the activity area, the cumulative DSD from project implementation and past activities shall not exceed the conditions prior to the planned activity and shall provide a net improvement in soil quality.” 1.13 THE NATIONAL FIRE PLAN AND THE HEALTHY FOREST RESTORATION ACT The National Fire Plan (NFP) was developed in August 2000 following a landmark wildfire season with the intent of actively responding to severe wildland fires and their impacts to communities while ensuring sufficient firefighting capabilities. The NFP addresses 5 key points: firefighting, rehabilitation, hazardous fuels reduction, community assistance, and accountability. With regard to jurisdiction, direction in the NFP allows for the Forest Service to take NFP action on NFS lands, and for States to take and coordinate action on State and private lands. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (HFRA) (P.L. 108-148) contains a variety of provisions to address hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration projects on specific types of federal lands that are at risk of wildland fire and/or insect and disease epidemics. The HFRA helps all landowners and managers restore healthy forest and rangeland conditions on those lands, regardless of ownership. Both the NFP and HFRA provide overarching direction to reduce the threat of wildfire and restore ecosystems. Management actions proposed within the Project area are designed to be consistent with this direction. Particularly, proposed management activities would trend the general landscape condition toward desired fuel profiles and would optimize opportunities to treat hazardous fuels in identified Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) lands and across the project area landscape. 1.14 ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT FSM 2670 directs the Forest Service to conserve endangered and threatened species and to utilize its authorities in furtherance of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and to avoid actions that may cause a species to become threatened or endangered. FSM 2670 also requires the Forest Service to maintain viable populations of all native and desirable non-native wildlife, fish, and plant species in habitats distributed throughout their geographic range on NFS lands. As directed by the ESA, biological assessments and consultation under section 7 of the ESA will be completed for this decision. The action alternatives are not expected to result in a jeopardy biological opinion for any listed species. 1.15 EXECUTIVE ORDERS 11988 AND 11990 These federal Executive Orders (EOs) provide for the protection and management of floodplains and wetlands. Numerous floodplains and wetlands exist within the analysis area. EO 11988 (Floodplain Management) requires federal agencies to evaluate the potential effects of actions it may take in a floodplain to avoid adversely impacting floodplains wherever possible, to ensure that its planning programs and budget requests reflect consideration of flood hazards and floodplain management, including restoring and preserving such land areas as natural undeveloped floodplains, and to prescribe procedures to implement the policies and procedures of this EO. EO 11990 (Protection of Wetlands) requires Federal agencies to take action to avoid adversely impacting wetlands wherever possible, to minimize wetlands destruction and preserve the values of wetlands, and to prescribe procedures to implement the policies and procedures of this EO. Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project activities have been designed to be consistent with the requirements of EO 11988 and EO 11990. 1.16 EXECUTIVE ORDER 12898 EO 12898 (Environmental Justice) directs each federal agency to make environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority and low-income populations. An associated memorandum emphasizes the need to consider these types of effects during NEPA analysis. The Proposed Action and alternatives would not disproportionately adversely affect minority or low-income populations, including American Indian tribal members. 1.17 EXECUTIVE ORDER 13112 EO 13112 (Invasive Species) was issued on February 3, 1999, to enhance federal coordination and response to the complex and accelerating problem of invasive species. EO 13112 directs federal agencies to work together [as stated in the Preamble] to “…prevent the introduction of invasive species and provide for their control and to minimize the economic, ecological, and human health impacts that invasive species cause.” Project activities have been designed to be consistent with the requirements of EO 13112. 1.18 IDAHO FOREST PRACTICES ACT The Idaho Forest Practices Act regulates forest practices on all land ownership in Idaho. Forest practices on NFS lands must adhere to the rules pertaining to water quality (IDAPA 20.02.01). The rules are also incorporated as BMPs in the Idaho Water Quality Standards. Project activities have been designed to be consistent with the Idaho Forest Practices Act. 1.19 IDAHO ROADLESS RULE The Idaho Roadless Rule, promulgated on October 16, 2008 (73 FR 61456), identified a system of lands called “Idaho Roadless Areas” and established 5 management themes. These 5 themes protect roadless areas and their important characteristics by assigning various permissions and prohibitions regarding road building, timber cutting, and discretionary mineral activities. The final Rule also allows the Forest Service to reduce the risk of wildland fires to at-risk communities and municipal water supply systems. The final Rule supersedes the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule for NFS lands in the State of Idaho. Project activities have been designed to be consistent with the Idaho Roadless Rule. The State of Idaho, Idaho Roadless Commission reviewed the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project’s proposed activities on March 14, 2013. 1.20 IDAHO STREAM CHANNEL PROTECTION ACT The Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act regulates stream channel alterations between mean and high water marks on perennial streams in Idaho (IDAPA 37.03.07). Instream activities on NFS lands must adhere to the rules pertaining to the Act. The rules are also incorporated as BMPs in the Idaho Water Quality Standards. Project activities have been designed to be consistent with the Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act. 1.21 NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT, SECTIONS 101 AND 106 The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) was signed into law on January 1, 1970. NEPA establishes national environmental policy and goals for the protection, maintenance, and enhancement of the environment and provides a process for implementing these goals within the federal agencies. NEPA also established the CEQ. Title I of NEPA contains a Declaration of National Environmental Policy that requires the federal government to use all practicable means to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony. Section 102 requires federal agencies to incorporate environmental considerations in their planning and decision-making through a systematic interdisciplinary approach. Specifically, all federal agencies are to prepare detailed statements assessing the environmental impact of and alternatives to major federal actions significantly affecting the environment. These statements are commonly referred to as Environmental Impact Statements (EISs). The public has an important role in the NEPA process, particularly during scoping, to provide input on what issues should be addressed in an EIS and to comment on the findings in an agency's NEPA documents. The public can participate in the NEPA process by attending NEPA-related hearings or public meetings and by submitting comments directly to the lead agency. The lead agency must consider all comments received from the public and other parties on NEPA documents during the comment period. 1.22 NATIONAL FOREST MANAGEMENT ACT The National Forest Management Act (NFMA) (16 U.S.C. 1600–1614, August 1974, as amended 1976, 1978, 1980, 1981, 1983, 1985, and 1990) reorganized, expanded, and otherwise amended the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, which called for the management of renewable resources on NFS lands. NFMA requires the Secretary of Agriculture to assess forest lands; develop a management program based on multiple-use, sustained-yield principles; and implement a resource management plan for each unit of the NFS. It is the primary statute governing the administration of national forests. Project activities have been designed to be consistent with the NFMA. 1.23 NATIONAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ACT Section 101 of the National Environmental Policy Act requires federal agencies to preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage. The legal processes associated with the protection and preservation of these resources is outlined in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA) (36 CFR 800) and subsequent amendments. Passed by Congress two years before NEPA, the NHPA sets forth a framework for determining if a project is an “undertaking” that has the potential to effect cultural resources. The implementing regulations also outline the processes for identifying, evaluating, assessing effects, and protecting such properties. The coordination or linkage between the Section 106 process of the NHPA and the mandate to preserve our national heritage under NEPA is well understood and is formally established in 36 CFR 800.3b and 800.8. The terminology of “…important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage” found in NEPA includes those resources defined as “historic properties” under the NHPA (36 CFR 800.16(l)(1)). It is thus the Section 106 process that agencies utilize to consider, manage, and protect historic properties during the planning and implementing stages of federal projects. The Forest meets its responsibilities under NHPA through compliance with the terms of a Programmatic Agreement (PA) signed between Region 1, the Idaho State Historic Preservation Office, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. 1.24 TRIBAL TREATY RIGHTS American Indian tribes are afforded special rights under various federal statutes: NHPA; NFMA; Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (ARPA) (43 CFR Part 7); Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 (NAGPRA) (43 CFR Part 10); Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (P.L. 103141); and the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 (AIRFA). Federal guidelines direct federal agencies to consult with tribal representatives who may have concerns about federal actions that may affect religious practices, other traditional cultural uses, or cultural resource sites and remains associated with tribal ancestors. Any tribe whose aboriginal territory occurs within a project area is afforded the opportunity to voice concerns for issues governed by NHPA, NAGPRA, or AIRFA. Federal responsibilities to consult with tribes are included in the NFMA; Interior Secretarial Order 3175 of 1993; and EOs 12875, 13007, 12866, and 13084. EO 12875 (Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership) calls for regular consultation with tribal governments. EO 13007 (Indian Sacred Sites) requires consultation with tribes and religious representatives on the access, use, and protection of sacred sites. EO 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) requires that federal agencies seek views of tribal officials before imposing regulatory requirements that might affect them. EO 13084 (Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments) provides direction regarding consultation and coordination with tribes relative to fee waivers. EO 12898 (Environmental Justice) directs federal agencies to focus on the human health and environmental conditions in minority and low-income communities, especially in instances where decisions may adversely impact these populations (see “Executive Order 12898” above). NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1500–1508) invite tribes to participate in forest management projects and activities that may affect them. Portions of the Forest are located within ceded lands of the Nez Perce Tribe. Ceded lands are federal lands on which the federal government recognizes that a tribe has certain inherent rights conferred by treaty. In Article 3 of the Nez Perce Treaty of 1855, the United States of America and the Nez Perce Tribe mutually agreed that the Nez Perce retain the following rights: …taking fish at all usual and accustomed places in common with citizens of the Territory [of Idaho]; and of creating temporary buildings for curing, together with the privilege of hunting, gathering roots and berries, and pasturing horses and cattle… The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project has been presented to the Nez Perce Tribe at quarterly staff-to-staff meetings since April 2012. Chapter 2–Alternatives, Including the Proposed Action 2.1 INTRODUCTION This chapter describes and compares the alternatives considered for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project, including alternatives considered but eliminated from detailed study. Maps of each alternative considered are included in Appendix A. This section also presents the alternatives in comparative form, sharply defining the differences between each alternative and providing a clear basis for options available to the Responsible Official. Some of the information used to compare the alternatives is based on the design of each alternative (such as regenerating versus deferring stands that have root disease), and some of the information is based upon the environmental, social, and economic effects of implementing each alternative (such as building new temporary roads versus deferring treatment in inaccessible stands). 2.2 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED IN DETAIL The Forest Service developed the No Action Alternative (Alternative A), the Proposed Action as modified in response to scoping comments (Alternative B), and two additional action alternatives (Alternatives C and D) in response to issues raised by the public.  Actions Common to All Action Alternatives 2.2.1The following actions would be included in all of the action alternatives. • 1,887 acres of precommercial thinning, 41 acres of grass restoration, and 1,371 acres of prescribed fire • 119.8 miles of system road reconstruction (Appendix B) • 13.2 miles of system road decommissioning (Appendix B) • A site-specific nonsignificant Forest Plan amendment adopting the Region 1 soil standard of 15% for detrimentally compacted, displaced, or puddled soils (Appendix C) • A site-specific, nonsignificant Forest Plan amendment clarifying the Forest’s interpretation of Appendix N of the Nez Perce Forest Plan (Appendix D). • The Design Criteria described later in this chapter  Alternative A: No Action 2.2.2Under the No Action alternative, current management plans would continue to guide management of the project area. No timber harvest, improvement cutting, temporary road construction, prescribed burning, grass restoration, road reconstruction, or road decommissioning would be implemented to accomplish project goals.  Alternative B: Proposed Action (As Modified In Response to 2.2.3Scoping Comments) This alternative was developed in response to comments about the Proposed Action that was presented for public scoping in January 2012 (see Chapter 1 for a detailed description of the Proposed Action that was used for scoping). Alternative B would move the project area toward the desired conditions identified for the project during the pre-NEPA phase. During the pre-NEPA phase of project development, the IDT identified large polygons or patches within the Project area referred to as “Focus Areas.” The Focus Areas were identified based on a need to promote similar age classes by connecting recently regenerated stands (preferably those regenerated within the last 20 years). The intent was to establish breaks in continuous fuels, favor areas with known or developing forest health issues, and target over-represented mid-seral and mature age classes. The IDT also attempted to bound these areas with identifiable features, such as forest type breaks, topographic breaks, and administrative boundaries. The Focus Areas served as the basis for developing the proposed action. A new Focus Area, developed after the Proposed Action was presented for scoping, was added to all of the action alternatives. It includes about 420 acres of regeneration harvest and some commercial and precommercial thin units. This new Focus Area also includes 1.2 miles of temporary roads, some of which would be on existing templates. Within the Focus Areas, stands identified for regeneration would be regenerated to improve patch sizes, increase the amount of early seral forest across the landscape, and allow replanting with a mix of species that would improve the long-term resilience of these stands. Healthy grand fir/Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and other early seral stands would be commercially thinned. If root disease were detected in younger Douglas-fir/grand fir stands proposed for commercial thinning, treatment of these stands would be deferred. Outside of the Focus Areas, healthy grand fir/Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and other early seral stands would be commercially thinned. If root disease were detected in younger Douglas-fir/grand fir stands proposed for commercial thinning, treatment of these stands would be deferred. All prescribed fire treatments would occur within the Clear Creek Roadless Area. Table 2-1 summarizes the activities to be undertaken under Alternative B, and Appendix A contains a map of the proposed activities. Table 2-1. Alternative B Vegetation Treatment and Temporary Road Construction Treatment Amount Precommercial thinning (acres) 1,887 Grass restoration (acres) 41 Prescribed fire (acres) 1,371 Regeneration, Including Site Preparation and Reforestation (acres) 2,609 Improvement (acres) 331 Commercial Thin (acres) 5,606 Road reconstruction (miles) 119.8 Temporary Roads on Existing Templates (miles) 8.7 Temporary Roads, New Construction (miles) 27.6 Road decommissioning (miles) 13.2   Alternative C: Maximal Species Conversion 2.2.4This alternative would address vegetative restoration needs described in the purpose and need for action, but to a greater degree than Alternative B. Desired conditions developed for this project indicate that young forest, particularly the 0–10 year age class, is well below desired conditions. Alternative C would move the project area toward the desired conditions by regenerating as many stands as possible, while still meeting objectives for other resources. This alternative was developed in response to scoping comments about the following resource concerns: • Patch size and fragmentation • Improvement of the distribution of hiding cover relative to foraging habitat • Increase in the amount of early successional stands and wildlife foraging habitats • Forest structure • Economics • Increase in stand mortality, by spreading root disease by commercially thinning stands infected • Increase distribution of early seral species across the landscape Alternative C would include 3,742 acres of commercial thin outside of the original Focus Areas. Within the Focus Areas, stands identified for regeneration would be regenerated to improve patch sizes, increase the amount of early seral forest across the landscape, and allow replanting with a mix of species that would improve the long-term resilience of these stands. Stands proposed for commercial thinning that are not comprised of early seral species would be regenerated. Forest Service Handbook (FSH) 2409.17 allows the Forest Service to regenerate young stands based on specific ecological, resource, and management criteria to meet the purpose and need of a specific project. Outside of the Focus Areas, healthy grand fir/Douglas-fir, pine, and other early seral stands would be commercially thinned. If root disease were detected in younger Douglas-fir/grand fir stands proposed for commercial thinning, treatment of these stands would be deferred. Table 2-2 summarizes the activities to be undertaken under Alternative C, and Appendix A contains a map that displays the proposed activities. Table 2-2.

This alternative would use existing road templates as much as possible. It was developed in response to scoping comments about the following resource concerns: • Road densities/cumulative impacts of past management • Sediment input to stream channels • Cumulative impacts of past timber harvest and road building on fisheries habitat, water quality, and soil productivity • Effects of the road network on elk security habitat • Meeting desired conditions for watersheds, fish, and wildlife habitats A total of 8.7 miles of previously decommissioned roads that have existing templates (were not physically obliterated) would be reopened and 8.8 miles of new temporary roads would be constructed. Existing road templates were identified through photo interpretation, including aerial photos from 1970 and subsequent years, the LIDAR layer, and field reviews. The average length of new temporary road construction would be 375 feet; the average length of the existing template is 820 feet. New temporary construction would be added to the existing templates. Units would be harvested as described for Alternative B, except that some units would be dropped if they were not accessible by the more limited road system proposed for Alternative D. Table 2-3 summarizes the activities to be undertaken under Alternative D, and Appendix A contains a map that displays the proposed activities. Table 2-3.

This would not preclude the use of feller bunchers off skid trails if soil impacts can remain within standards. 3) Approximately 250 acres of landslide prone areas have been mapped and field verified in the harvest units. These landslide prone areas would be further delineated in the field during unit layout and would receive a PACFISH buffer. No harvest activities would occur in these areas. 4) Landslide prone areas in prescribed fire units would receive a PACFISH buffer. No ignition would occur in these areas, although fire would be allowed to back through. 5) For units with high subsurface erosion potential, the amount of excavated skid trails and landings would be limited to the extent possible, and all excavated skid trails and landings on these landtypes would be decommissioned (full recontour) and large woody material would be placed over the slope for soil stabilization. 6) For Units designated in the reuse, trending positive, and Forest Plan amendment design categories (see section 3.6.5): A logging system layout design would be developed to use as many of the existing skid trails and landings as possible and limit the amount of new detrimental disturbance and all skid trails and landings used would be decommissioned after use. Actions would include scarifying/decompacting soils and placement of slash, woody material, and/or duff over exposed soil. Equipment used for machine piling or mastication of activity slash would remain on designated skid trail or would be required to rehabilitate (decompact or recontour) any detrimental disturbance they cause. 7) For Units designated in the special design category (see section 3.6.5), special attention would be needed for these units to remain at or below 15% Detrimental Soil Disturbance (DSD) following project implementation. Methods to ensure this might include locating main skid trails only on existing disturbed areas, with few “one-pass” trails occurring on undisturbed ground; using a cut-to-length forwarder system; requiring equipment used for machine piling or mastication of activity slash to remain on designated skid trails; and developing a logging system layout design that limits the amount of new detrimental disturbance. Portions of the unit could be dropped if the layout plan cannot reach the entire unit while staying under the 15% standard. The estimated amount of acres of new disturbance has been calculated for each unit and can be found in the project file. In addition, all skid trails and landings and temporary roads (see item 10 for temporary road decommissioning) would be decommissioned. 8) For all harvest units, decompaction would be required on skid trails where excavation or ground disturbance has occurred or where successive passes have taken place over the same trail. Decompaction would be conducted to improve soil productivity and meet Regional soil quality standards. Decompaction would span the width of the compacted areas and extend to a depth of 10–18 inches, to effectively loosen the ground to allow water penetration and revegetation and to prevent the rocky sub-surface soils from mixing with the topsoil. The depth of decompaction should be adjusted to avoid turning up large rocks, roots, or stumps. Equipment would not be permitted to operate outside the clearing limits of the skid trail. Decompaction should be done during from June 15 to October 15, unless otherwise approved. No decompaction work should be done during wet weather or when the ground is frozen or otherwise unsuitable. All erosion control barriers and cross ditches removed or otherwise rendered ineffective by the decompaction treatment should be reinstalled as they were prior to the decompaction. 9) In all units, to reduce ground disturbance, no ground based skidding would be allowed on slopes over 35%, unless mitigating measures, such as operating on adequate compacted snow or only over short distances, are approved by the soil specialist. 10) All temporary roads would be scarified and decommissioned (all new construction would be recontoured; existing prisms would be placed in a stable condition through recontouring and/or decompaction). Cut/fill slopes and crossings would be reshaped to natural contours. Available slash would be applied to the recontour surface (slash is considered “available” where the equipment can reach it from the working area where the decommissioning is occurring). 11) Activities would be restricted when soils are wet to prevent resource damage (indicators include excessive rutting, soil displacement, and erosion). 12) For all harvest units, coarse woody material appropriate to the site would be retained for nutrient cycling, maintaining soil moisture, soil stability, and other soil physical and biological properties after all unit activities. Regional guidance for organic matter recommends the following guidelines, such as retaining coarse (> 3 inches diameter) woody material to maintain soil productivity (Graham et al. 1994). Drier habitat types have wood retention requirements of 7–15 tons/acre for Douglas-fir, grand fir, and ponderosa pine types. Moister habitat types require 17–33 tons/acre. Approximately 14–28 standing trees would be retained for future down wood recruitment. Snags or other designated retention trees felled for safety reasons would be left in the unit. 13) Burning of activity generated slash would be designed in the project burn plan to provide a low-severity mosaic burn with little-to-no detrimental disturbance of soil resources (Neary et al. 2008). Slash would be allowed to overwinter prior to burning. This does not include whole tree yarding. 2.2.6.2 Wildlife 1) All temporary roads would be closed to the public and decommissioned following use. 2) All existing access restrictions and a vegetative screen (1 site potential tree height) of shrubs and sapling and pole size trees where they exist would be maintained along open motorized roads to help maintain elk habitat quality and reduce hunting season vulnerability. 3) Verified old growth would be designated MA 20 and all MA 20 would be full retention. 4) Old growth would be treated with improvement harvest. The stands proposed for improvement harvest contain some exceptionally large ponderosa pine and other large old trees in a mosaic of young trees that likely developed from fire exclusion. Fuels in these areas have increased due to encroachment of grand fir forming ladder fuels and fuel accumulation on the ground associated with ongoing mortality from insects and disease and fire suppression. The treatments would be designed to maintain and improve resiliency of specific trees with a combination of commercial and non-commercial activities. Improvement harvest in old growth would not change old-growth status per Green et al (1992 as amended) old growth criteria. This "fully maintains, or contributes toward the restoration of, the structure and composition of old growth stands…" per PL 111-11 Title IV (2009). 5) Using standard contract provisions C2.3 and C6.32, large snags would be retained. Each post-treated area, on average, would comply with mean snag retention values displayed in Table 12 of Estimates of Snag Densities for Northern Idaho Forests in the Northern Region, (Bollenbacher et al. 2009) for low and mid elevation moist habitat types in early seral conditions (at least 3 snags per acre greater than 15 inches diameter at breast height [dbh] and at least 3 snags per acre greater than 21 inches dbh). Preferred species (ponderosa pine, western larch, Douglas-fir) of large, legacy snags would be selected for retention. Alternate tree species would be retained where preferred species do not exist in quantities to meet Regional guidance. Large snags would be retained with green trees in groups of 7–10 trees or larger retention patches. Preference would be given to the largest available snags or damaged trees, generally greater than 21 inches in diameter and greater than 40 feet tall. A combination of clumps (groups of live and dead trees) and lone snags that have little potential to cause safety issues would be retained. Avoid snag retention near log landings and firelines and within 100 feet below and 200 feet above open motorized roads. Snag or live retention trees felled for safety purposes would be left on site or traded with a comparable tree. 6) In treatment areas, all legacy trees (large diameter trees that survived the last stand replacing event) would be retained. In Clear Creek, these trees frequently are over 30 inches dbh. Legacy trees may be unevenly distributed and retained in clumps as well as individual trees. This design measure allows hazardous fuels reduction while “…maximizing the retention of large trees, as appropriate for the forest type…” per PL 111-11 Title IV (2009). 7) Green tree retention in all regeneration and improvement harvest areas would consist of an average of 14–28 of the largest trees per acre (generally over 21 inches dbh) distributed in clumps (7–10+ trees plus snags) and individuals, with no area greater than 2 acres without retained trees. Tree retention would focus on ponderosa pine, western larch, and healthy Douglas-fir, and large tree retention would be maximized, as appropriate for the forest type per PL 111-11 Title IV (2009). 8) Regeneration Harvest Leave Tree Survival: The Clear Creek project would strive for a variable tree survival objective for the project as a whole, with the objective of having almost all legacy trees (large diameter trees that survived the last stand replacing fire) survive the prescribed burns. Fuel reduction measures (limb/top removal or slash reduction around these trees) would be implemented where needed to insure tree survival for the legacy larch, ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir. For the non-legacy trees, the objective would be for a majority (>50%) of the leave trees to survive the prescribed burn. Prescribed fire might be allowed to back into RHCAs and retained clumps; however, no ignitions would be allowed within them. This objective could be accomplished through the use of appropriate ignition patterns, ignition rates, fuel moisture, and burn timing without any extra fuel reduction measures; however, that evaluation would be made following the project layout. These measures allow hazardous fuel reduction while “…maximizing the retention of large trees, as appropriate for the forest type…” per PL 111-11 Title IV (2009). 9) Using standard contract provision C6.24 (Wildlife and Botanical Protection Measures), maintain a minimum 40-acre yearlong no-treatment buffer around occupied goshawk nest trees. No ground disturbing activities would be allowed inside occupied post-fledgling goshawk areas (300–600 acres around the nest stand) from April 15 to August 15 (R1-C6.316). 10) If a den, nest sites, or other important habitat feature of any threatened, endangered, or SS were to be discovered within or in close proximity to any treatment unit, project activities would be coordinated with a wildlife biologist so that appropriate conservation measures could be developed. 11) The spread of noxious weeds and invasive plants would be minimized by chemically treating any noxious weed populations along the existing road systems before and after project implementation (C6.27); monitoring and cleaning any equipment of loose debris prior entering the Project area to prevent “new invader” weed establishment (C6.351/C6.27); and revegetating project-related exposed soils (i.e. landings, skid trails, road sides, etc.) using certified noxious weed free native seed mix and fertilizer (as necessary) upon project completion. All seeding would follow Region 1 guidelines. 12) In moose winter range (MA 21), silvicultural prescriptions that comply with Forest Plan standards would be developed for commercial thin and regeneration harvest areas and incorporated into marking or layout guidelines. The following commercial thin units occur in MA 21: 228, 230, 231, 234, 238, 335, 349–351, and 356–358. The following regeneration harvest units occur in MA 21: 136–139, 145, and 146. 13) Retained large down logs would be evenly distributed in regeneration and improvement units. On average, harvested areas would have 5 pieces per acre 15–20 inches dbh and 30 feet long and 2 pieces per acre >20 inches dbh and 30 feet long. 14) Landscape burning prescriptions, especially in MA 16 (winter range), would be developed to maintain the duff layer to prevent invasive species germination. Burn units 701–715 occur in MA 16. 15) When compatible with established fish/water quality objectives and economics, units at the far end of roads would be cut first (Forest Plan Standard #11 page II-19). 2.2.6.3 Aquatics 1) PACFISH default buffers would be used to define timber sale unit boundaries. No timber harvest would occur within 300 feet of fish-bearing streams, 150 feet of perennial non-fish bearing water, 100 feet of intermittent streams, and 150-foot slope distance from the edge of wetlands larger than one acre. Ignition points for prescribed fire would be located outside of the PACFISH riparian buffers. 2) Prescribed fire would not be ignited in areas requiring 100 percent live canopy retention. The burn objective would be to prevent fire entry into these areas. Low-intensity fire may be allowed to back into the edges of some of these sensitive areas and would result in no less than 90% live-canopy retention for the area. 3) BMSs as found in Rules Pertaining to the Idaho Forest Practices Act Title 38, Chapter 13, Idaho Code, and Soil and Water Conservation Practices (SWCP) Handbook, FSH 2509.22 would be applied to prevent non-channelized sediment delivery from harvest units to streams in the Project area. 4) Standard contract provision B6.341 would be applied throughout project implementation to minimize the risk of an accidental spill of petroleum products, as well as to protect water courses and aquatic biota from adverse effects in the event of a spill. 5) During road decommissioning or culvert replacements, measures to prevent damaging levels of sediment from entering streams would be undertaken, such as: (a) placing removable sediment traps below work areas to trap fines; (b) when working instream, removing all fill around pipes prior to bypass and pipe removal (where this is not possible, use non-eroding diversion); (c) revegetating scarified and disturbed soils with weed-free grasses for short-term erosion protection and with shrubs and trees for long-term soil stability; (d) utilizing erosion control mats on stream channel slopes and slides; (e) mulching with native materials, where available, or using weed-free straw to ensure coverage of exposed soils; (f) dissipating energy in the newly constructed stream channels using log or rock weirs; and (g) armoring channel banks and dissipating energy with large rock whenever possible. 2.2.6.4 Heritage Resources Table 2-4 describes mitigation measures/design criteria that would be implemented to protect Heritage Resources in the project area. Table 2-4.

Public comments received in response to the Proposed Action provided suggestions for alternative methods for achieving the purpose and need. Some of these alternatives would have modified the proposed action to the point where the purpose and need for action would not be met, would have been duplicative of the alternatives considered in detail, or were determined to be components that would cause unnecessary environmental harm. Therefore, a number of alternatives were considered, but dismissed from detailed consideration for reasons summarized below. See the “Issues” section in Chapter 1 for a more detailed discussion of the alternative-driving issues that were raised during scoping. Old Growth: The IDT considered an alternative that would harvest old growth stands, but did not study it in detail, although improvement cuts would be done in some old growth stands to help keep them on the landscape longer. Although the amount of old growth in the project area exceeds the Forest Plan minimum standard, CFLRA goals and objectives require that large diameter trees be retained as much as possible. Appendix D describes a site-specific Forest Plan amendment clarifying how Forest Plan standards for old growth would be interpreted for this project. Watershed Rehabilitation (Road Decommissioning) Only; No Timber Harvest or Prescribed Burning: Some commenters asked that the IDT consider an alternative that would focus only on watershed rehabilitation activities, such as road decommissioning, with no timber harvest or prescribed burning. The IDT analyzed this alternative, but did not study it in detail because it would not meet the purpose and need for this project. Also, in effect, this “alternative” was previously analyzed in the South Fork–West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning Environmental Assessment (USDA Forest Service 2011), which decommissioned 85 miles of roads in the Clear Creek watershed. An additional 13.2 miles of NFS road decommissioning are proposed for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project as actions common to all alternatives. Prescribed Burning-Only Alternative: The IDT analyzed an alternative that would use prescribed burning alone to manage vegetation, but did not study it in detail because it would not meet the purpose and need for this project, and because of economic concerns. Timber outputs from the proposed action would be used to offset treatment costs and support the economic structure of local communities and provide for regional and national needs. Also, burning commercial timber would not be consistent with the Forest Plan. No Prescribed Burning: Some commenters asked that the IDT develop an alternative that would not include any prescribed burning. The IDT analyzed this alternative, but did not study it in detail because prescribed burning is the only viable tool available to manage vegetation within the Clear Creek Roadless Area. Prescribed fire is also an important and effective tool for reducing post activity fuels in treatment units as well as stimulating grass, forb and shrub re-growth. No Temporary Road Construction/Use Existing Roads Only/Helicopter Logging: Some commenters were concerned about existing road densities in the Clear Creek watershed and the effects of the road system on fisheries and wildlife habitat. An alternative that would not build any temporary roads was considered but not analyzed in detail by the IDT because it would reduce the managed area to the point where the purpose and need to manage vegetation would not be met. The road system in the Clear Creek watershed has already been substantially reduced. The South Fork–West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning DN/FONSI (2011) decommissioned 85 miles of roads. Temporary roads constructed for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project would be decommissioned and recontoured after use. Watershed rehabilitation is better achieved by decommissioning old roads in poor locations and building new temporary roads in better locations, then recontouring them after use, than by reconstructing old roads in poor locations. The IDT considered an alternative that would build temporary roads only on existing or former road templates. This alternative was not analyzed in detail because it would not provide enough access or access in the appropriate locations to meet the purpose and need to manage vegetation in the project area. The IDT also considered an alternative that would use helicopter logging instead of building temporary roads. This alternative was not analyzed in detail because a timber sale based on helicopter logging alone would not be economically viable. Also, conducting follow-up management activities, such as site preparation and planting, would be very expensive. Do Not Use Vegetation Response Unit Desired Future Conditions Developed for this Project: Some commenters did not want the DFCs that were developed specifically for this Project to be used and asked that the IDT use Forest Plan goals and objectives alone to guide management activities. The IDT considered this alternative, but did not analyze it in detail because project-specific desired conditions that were developed during the pre-NEPA stage of project were based on Forest Plan direction and refined by the best available science. Site-specific, VRU-based desired conditions that were based on Forest Plan goals, objectives, and standards, were used to develop the alternatives analyzed in detail. 2.4 COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVES This section provides a summary of the effects of implementing each alternative. Information in the Table 2-5 is focused on activities and effects where different levels of effects or outputs can be distinguished quantitatively or qualitatively among alternatives. Table 2-6 compares the alternatives by resource indicators and compares the alternatives by issue and resource indicators.  Table 2-5.

biological, social, and economic environments of the project area and the potential changes to those environments due to implementation of the alternatives. It also presents the scientific and analytical basis for comparison of the alternatives presented in Table 2-5 through Table 2-7. 3.1 AQUATICS This section summarizes the effects of the alternatives on the aquatic resource, which includes water quality and fisheries. The section was summarized from the “Clear Creek Restoration Aquatics Report,” available in the project record.  Analysis Area 3.1.1The project area is about 43,700 acres and encompasses the upper two-thirds of the Clear Creek drainage and all of its tributaries. Clear Creek flows into the Middle Fork Clearwater River. This analysis area was selected because it includes all Forest Service–managed lands—and all the streams therein—that could be affected by project activities.  Regulatory Framework 3.1.2Nez Perce National Forest Plan (Forest Plan) direction and all federal and State laws and regulations applicable to watershed and fisheries resources would be applied to the project, including the Clean Water Act, the ESA, Idaho Water Quality Standards, and the Idaho Forest Practices Act. Nez Perce National Forest Plan—Forest standards for water resources are found within the Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987b, pages II-18 through II-22). The Forest Plan directs that forest management activities minimize sediment input to streams, meet beneficial uses, apply BMPs to ensure water quality standards are met or exceeded, and manage all water under the designated standards found in Forest Plan Appendix A. The project complies with this direction through the implementation of project design features and road improvement and decommissioning activities. The Forest Plan was amended in 1995, following a joint decision (commonly called PACFISH) by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for managing anadromous fish-producing watersheds on federal lands, including streams within the project area. The standards and guides from PACFISH would be applied to the project. The interim direction provided by PACFISH identifies and defines RHCAs, establishes RMOs, and applies standards and guidelines to meet the RMOs. PACFISH default RHCAs (buffers) include those areas within 300 feet of fish-bearing streams, within 150 feet of non-fish-bearing streams, and 100 feet on intermittent streams and wetlands of 1 acre or less. RHCA widths exceed state BMP standards. All management activities must be designed to cause no adverse effect to the designated RMOs, which dictate certain standards for large, instream woody material, stream temperature, width-to-depth ratios, bank stability, and pool frequency. The project would comply with PACFISH. 36 CFR 219.20—These regulations require projects to achieve the following objectives: conserve the soil and water resource; protect streams, streambanks, and wetlands; provide for adequate fish habitat; and give special attention to riparian areas in regard to topography, vegetation type, soils, climate, and management objectives. Endangered Species Act— The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) lists bull trout as threatened under the ESA (www.fws.gov Feb. 6 2013). Steelhead trout and fall chinook salmon are also listed as threatened (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] www.nwr.noaa.gov). Consultation with the USFWS and NOAA is required for projects affecting these species. The project would be designed to have no adverse effects on listed species. Regional Forester Sensitive Species—Since the Forest Plan was published in 1987, the Regional Forester has approved an updated list for the Forest (June 2008). The list can be found at http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5366363.pdf. This list includes 4 fish species: westslope cutthroat trout, interior redband trout, Snake River spring chinook salmon, and Pacific lamprey. The western pearlshell mussel was added in 2010. A Biological Evaluation is required to determine the effects of the project on these species. The project may impact individuals but would not lead to the listing of species under ESA. Idaho Forest Practices Act—This act regulates forest practices on all land ownerships in Idaho. Forest practices on National Forest lands must adhere to the rules pertaining to the act (IDAPA 20.02.01). The rules are also incorporated as BMPs in Idaho’s Water Quality Standards. The project would comply with the Idaho Forest Practices Act by implementing BMPs to protect and maintain water quality standards.  Analysis Methodology 3.1.33.1.3.1 Stream and Habitat Surveys Past and recent stream survey data were used to determine if instream conditions meet Forest Plan direction. Field surveys were conducted between 2010 and 2012 to assess road and culvert conditions, as well as fish presence at road crossings. General stream conditions were also noted. The survey data were used to develop proposed project activities. Google Earth (and other photo imagery), in combination with field surveys, was used to assess vegetative cover over project area streams and the availability of future woody material to those streams. Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to assess a variety of information, including road and stream miles within the project area. Habitat surveys on anadromous fish streams were conducted by the Nez Perce Tribe in 1984. Stream habitat and fish surveys were also conducted by the Forest for Middle Fork Clear Creek, Solo Creek, and Pine Knob Creek in 1993. Information collected included physical data (stream type, habitat types, substrate, woody material, and sediment levels) and biological data (fish species, distribution, and densities). Stream habitat surveys were also conducted in 2007 and 2010 in the mainstem, West Fork, and South Fork of Clear Creek and in Kay Creek as part of the PACFISH/INFISH Biological Opinion (PIBO) monitoring effort. Cobble embeddedness surveys were conducted by Forest personnel in 2012 to determine compliance with Forest Plan water quality objectives. The USFWS Dworshak Fisheries Assistance Office was also contacted in 2012 in regard to past surveys they conducted in Clear Creek. 3.1.3.2 FISHSED Modeling Cobble embeddedness is a measure of how the rocks in a stream are surrounded, or embedded, by small materials such as silt or sand. Estimates of existing cobble embeddedness in project area streams, combined with NEZSED outputs for peak sediment yield (see Hydrology section), were used to predict potential changes in summer and winter rearing/carrying capacities for trout and salmon, using the FISHSED model (Stowell et al. 1983). The model is run at the Forest Plan prescription watershed level only. The basic model assumes that an inverse relationship exists between the amount of fine sediment in spawning and rearing habitats and fish survival and abundance. In general, when sediment yields are increased over natural rates, especially on a sustained basis, fish biomass decreases (Bjornn et al. 1977). The FISHSED model is only useful for comparing alternatives (USDA Forest Service 2011) and is not designed to predict actual sediment levels. FISHSED calculations and additional information about the model, including assumptions, are in the project file.  Resource Indicators 3.1.4The following resource indicators were developed in response to public comments and internal concerns and are associated with proposed road-related watershed improvement activities. Timber harvest was not considered, because monitoring indicates that retaining PACFISH buffers are adequate to prevent harvest-related sediment from reaching streams (USDA Forest Service 2009a; USDA Forest Service 2006; FEMAT 1993; K. Smith personal observations). Roads in RHCAs: Many miles of both system and nonsystem roads exist within PACFISH RHCAs. Many of these roads are not needed for future land management activities. Unneeded roads should be decommissioned to reduce potential sediment input into streams from road surface runoff and potential stream-crossing failures. Resource indicator: RHCA road density The roads needed for management should not contribute sediment to streams from road surface runoff. Installing culverts that drain onto the forest floor from roadside ditches instead of into stream channels would minimize direct sediment contributions. Installing culverts designed to handle 100-year flow events on all streams would minimize the potential for plugging of the structure by debris. Surfacing roads could also reduce sediment runoff. Resource indicator: Number of undersized culverts replaced and cross drains added Deposited Sediment: Excessive amounts of fine sediment, particularly sand, can reduce fish reproduction success by plugging spawning gravels and affecting egg development and/or larval fish emergence (Meehan 1991; Waters 1995). Sand bedload can also decrease food production by scouring or burying gravel substrates and can decrease the amount of fish cover by filling in pools and burying logs (Alexander and Hansen 1983, 1986). The Forest Plan requires that projects that increase sediment yield in a prescription watershed (to the extent that the activity would be considered an “entry”) be modeled in both NEZSED and FISHSED. Activities included in the modeling include timber harvest, temporary road construction, and prescribed fire. Resource Indicator: FISHSED results for modeled changes in cobble embeddedness  Affected Environment 3.1.53.1.5.1 Aquatic Species and Habitats NFS lands in the Clear Creek drainage contain a minimum of 223 miles of mainstem and tributary streams. Roughly 50 miles are considered fish-bearing; however, no recent fish density information is available. Habitat for cutthroat trout occurs in all fish-bearing streams. Cutthroat trout were observed between 2010 and 2012 well into the headwaters of most of the streams, but densities were not measured. Surveys conducted by the Forest in 1993 found very high densities of cutthroat trout in Solo Creek and Middle Fork Clear Creek. High concentrations were also found in upper Clear Creek, West Fork Clear Creek, and upper Pine Knob Creek during Nez Perce Tribe surveys (NPT 1984). Clear Creek includes 35 miles of designated critical habitat for steelhead trout (ESA threatened). Steelhead were found in moderate densities in Pine Knob Creek and Middle Fork Clear Creek, but none were found in Solo Creek (USDA Forest Service 1993) or West Fork Clear Creek (NPT 1984). Low densities were found in South Fork Clear Creek (NPT 1984). NFS lands along Clear Creek include 13 miles of spring chinook habitat. Habitat for both steelhead and chinook tends to occur in the middle and lower reaches of large streams. Compared to cutthroat trout, these species require larger streams and substrate for spawning and rearing. No chinook were observed during any of the habitat surveys; however, the Kooskia National Fish Hatchery, near the mouth of Clear Creek, annually released 20–30 adult chinook above their trapping weir from 2006 to 2008. These fish likely spawned on the lower reaches of National Forest lands or on private lands (IDFG 2009). No bull trout were observed during 1993 surveys or during surveys conducted by the USFWS in 2007. Their absence was expected, as water temperatures do not appear to be conducive for this species. Bull trout prefer cold temperatures (below 14 °C) in the summer and are generally found in higher-elevation streams such as those in the upper Lochsa River (well upstream of the project area). Temperatures were measured in project area streams between 2007 and 2011. Daily maximum temperatures during the summer months averaged 16–20 °C in all streams. No surveys for pearlshell mussels or Pacific lamprey have been conducted in the Clear Creek drainage, and neither of these species was mentioned during habitat surveys. Habitat for both species is likely available in the larger streams where low gradients (<3%) and sandy substrates combine to create preferred habitats. Two series of bedrock falls act as natural barriers to upstream fish passage in the drainage. One is located 0.6 miles up from the mouth of Hoodoo Creek, and the other is located on the West Fork of Clear Creek, 2.8 miles up from the mouth. Surveys in 2010 and 2011 found no fish above these barriers. Stream surveys conducted in 1984 indicate high levels of sediment and higher-than-preferred stream temperatures in the lower reaches on private lands. Sediment levels and temperatures were lower on NFS lands. Shallow water depths and lack of pool habitat were also noted as issues affecting fish production in the middle and upper reaches of Clear Creek. Surveys conducted in 1993 also noted higher-than-preferred sediment and lower-than-preferred wood levels. The low number of pools is directly related to low wood levels, because wood is the primary creator of pool habitats in these stream types. The Forest Plan contains water quality objectives for streams in the project area (USDA Forest Service 1987b, Appendix A). These objectives are assessed using the DFC Analysis developed by Espinosa (1992) and are based on sediment levels as directed by the Forest Plan Appendix A Guidance document (USDA Forest Service 2011). Specifically, the guidance document states the following: Of the basinwide stream survey data collected over the years, the habitat components that appear to be the most repeatable and most reliably differentiate between reference and managed watersheds are measures or estimates of substrate condition, including cobble embeddedness and percent surface fines (USDA Forest Service 1998a, USDA Forest Service 2003). In addition, fish/water quality objectives in Appendix A were originally established based on substrate sediment only (Stowell 1986). …The portion of the DFC analysis that provides objectives for cobble embeddedness and percent fines by depth would be retained. Collection of measured substrate data, combined with existing legacy data and current PIBO data, where available, would be used to describe the existing condition. Substrate data would be the primary determinant in assessing whether Appendix A fish/water quality objectives are met. Appendix A states that an upward trend (improvement) is required for streams that do not currently meet the water quality objectives. Timber management can occur in these watersheds concurrent with improvement efforts as long as a positive, upward trend in habitat carrying capacity is evidenced. All streams in the project area are experiencing an upward trend (Table 3-1). Data indicate that all streams (except for the mainstem and Middle Fork Clear Creek) meet the water quality objectives based on cobble embeddedness monitoring. Table 3-1.

Buffer widths are 300 feet on each side of a fish-bearing stream, 150 feet on perennial non-fish-bearing streams, and 100 feet on intermittent stream channels. At least 10,700 acres (24%) of the analysis area are within PACFISH buffers. Regeneration timber harvest activities have occurred on approximately 22% of NFS-managed lands with an associated 190 miles of road. No-harvest buffers appear to have been retained since the 1960s on all but about 8% of the units. On the majority of the units (92%), buffers were a minimum of 50 feet wide. A total of 440 acres of regeneration harvest have occurred in the project area since PACFISH was implemented and appropriate-sized buffers were retained. A review of vegetation successional stages within the RHCAs (Figure 3-1) indicates that 9% are early successional (<40 years old), 34% are mid-seral (41–100 years old), 18% are mature (101–149 years old), and 39% are late successional (>150 years old). The majority of mid-seral stands are located in the Clear Creek Roadless Area, lower Hoodoo Creek, and lower West Fork Clear Creek and are a result of the 1931 wildfire that burned in the area. Successional stage information, combined with field reviews of the streams, indicates that RHCAs are well vegetated and only minimally (10%) affected by past timber harvest activities. Figure 3-1. Vegetation successional stages within riparian habitat conservation areas in the Clear Creek project area Roads near streams are the primary land management–related activity that affects stream conditions in the project area. Roads within riparian zones confine channels, which can negatively affect sediment and stream flow movement (Meehan 1991). Culverts under the roads are often undersized, impeding the passage of water and woody material during high flows. The small culvert size increases the risk that the pipe will plug with material and fail during high-flow events. Plugging of pipes can lead to an unwanted sediment pulse in streams. Crossing failures are costly to fix, and the sediment delivered to streams can take decades to flush out of the system. Road failures disturb existing vegetation and expose bare soil to potential erosion until the site heals. Riparian roads reduce stream shading and disrupt large, woody material recruitment through tree removal. Ditchlines that drain roads can direct flow and road surface sediment into perennial streams at crossings. These roads can be a chronic (ongoing) source of sediment and can increase water yield in streams. The US Forest Service, BLM, USFWS, and NOAA (NOAA 1998) have determined that watershed conditions can be rated “good” when streamside road densities are <1 mile per square mile (mi/mi2), “moderate” at 1–2 mi/mi2, or “poor” at >2 mi/mi2. A total of 20 miles of NFS system roads exist within PACFISH buffers, contributing to an overall road density of 1.2 mi/mi2. All but portions of 3 roads have been constructed perpendicular to streams instead of running along their length. This design limits the negative effects from roads on streams by minimizing the interaction between the two. In addition, work has begun on 85 miles of system and nonsystem roads, which were cleared for decommissioning in 2011. The roadwork includes 3.5 miles of roads in RHCAs and at least 11 stream crossing removals. Stream/road crossing surveys have been conducted on 90% of the NFS roads from 2010 through 2011. Only those roads proposed for retention were reviewed, since all crossings on roads proposed for decommissioning would be removed. A total of 200 crossings were assessed for condition, aquatic passage, potential failure risk, and level of work needed. Culverts or bridges were in place at 168 crossings; at 14 crossings, roads were in place, but culverts had been removed. A total of 10 culverts were cleared through previous NEPA for replacement. Four of these were replaced in 2012; two will be replaced in 2013. The remaining 4 will be replaced in 2014 and beyond. A total of 4 culverts were cleared for removal in 2011, with all being removed in 2012 and 2013. The road reviews found 62 culverts (“pipes”) that were adequately sized and had no need for work; 26 pipes in need of cleaning; 1 moderate-priority pipe needing removal; and 79 culverts in need of replacement (1 high-priority, 43 moderate-priority, and 35 low-priority). Roughly 46 of the pipes (58%) drain very small streams or seeps and would be replaced with 24- to 36-inch-diameter structures. The remaining 33 pipes would be replaced with structures ranging from 4 to 9 feet in diameter. NFS system roads within the project area total 190 miles, of which 147 miles (77%) are graveled roads and 43 miles (23%) are native surfaced (dirt). Placing gravel on roads has been shown to reduce sediment runoff from the road surface (Meehan 1991). Burroughs and King (1985) conducted a study in Idaho using simulated rainfall to generate runoff and sediment yield from forest roads, ditchlines, and fill slopes. Results from the study showed that gravel reduced sediment yield by a factor of 4 when compared to no surfacing. They also found that where dense grass cover was present on the fill slopes of the road, sediment yield was reduced by 99%. The cut and fill slopes of roads within the Clear Creek project area are densely vegetated with grasses, shrubs, and trees. The majority of ditchlines also contain grasses, which can trap sediment. These conditions, along with the perpendicular stream/road crossings mentioned previously, minimize the risk of roads contributing large amounts of sediment to streams. Road use by motorized traffic disturbs the road surface, with some of the soil being deposited into ditchlines, where it can be delivered to streams (Meehan 1991). Within the project area, 106 miles of roads are open seasonally or year-round to motorized use. A total of 66 miles (62%) are graveled, and 40 miles (38%) have a native surface. The combination of gravel surfacing and restricting traffic on half of the roads has helped to minimize sediment input to streams. The overall risk of roads contributing sediment to streams is considered low on 153 miles of road. The low risk is associated with restricted-use roads, roads with gravel surfacing, and roads where live stream crossings are limited or nonexistent. The risk is moderate on the remaining 37 miles of road, as these roads include multiple live stream crossings and some form of motorized use. 3.1.5.3 Effectiveness of Design Features As noted in Chapter 2, several design features have been proposed to reduce the potential effects of activities on the aquatic resource. These design features have been demonstrated as effective as described below. PACFISH buffers—All management activities since 1995 have implemented PACFISH buffers in order to eliminate or reduce impacts to riparian areas and streams. With no new large disturbances in RHCAs, no negative changes to the measured habitat parameters are expected to result from more recent management activities. Various field reviews and monitoring activities support the conclusion that the habitat conditions have improved since the writing of the Forest Plan in 1987 (see Water Quality Objectives table in the Existing Condition section). Much of the recovery is likely a result of fewer land-disturbing activities, better application of BMPs, PACFISH buffer retention, and better road design (USDA Forest Service 2009a, p. 91). Preliminary monitoring results from the PIBO monitoring across the Upper Columbia River Basin also indicate improving trends. Improvements have been noted in pool depth, bank stability, large wood frequency and volume, and the presence of spawning substrate (<3 inches in diameter) (USDA Forest Service 2009a). BMPs would be followed for all action alternatives as stipulated by the Idaho Forest Practices Act. Idaho water quality standards regulate non-point source pollution from timber management and road construction activities through the application of BMPs. The adjacent Clearwater National Forest has an excellent record of successful implementation of BMPs. Between 1990 and 2002, the Forest had a BMP implementation rate of 98% and a 97.8% rate of effectiveness (Clearwater National Forest 2003). Survey results from 2004 through 2008 indicate implementation and effectiveness rates of 98% or greater (these reports can be found at http://www.fs.fed.us/r1/clearwater/ResourceProg/ResourceProg.htm). The same BMPs would be applied to the project and are expected to have similar results.  Environmental Consequences 3.1.63.1.6.1 Direct and Indirect Effects As noted above, the analysis area for the direct and indirect effects of the alternatives is the project area. 3.1.6.1.1 Alternative A—No Action No logging, no road decommissioning, and no culvert replacements, additions, or removals would occur under the No Action Alternative. Any watershed improvement activities (culvert replacements through road reconstruction and decommissioning) would require additional NEPA analysis prior to implementation. No direct effects to streams would result from the No Action Alternative, since no stream channels or streamside areas would be disturbed. The indirect effects include the following: • Roads needed for future management that may be contributing sediment to streams would continue to do so until further NEPA is completed and funding is obtained to improve them. Culverts would remain undersized, and ditchlines would remain connected to streams. Thirty-seven miles of road would be maintained in the moderate-risk category for sediment entering streams from ditchlines. Roughly 79 crossings would remain at risk for failure due to retention of undersized culverts. An estimated average of 100 cubic yards of soil could be delivered to a stream in the event of one crossing failure. • The 3.2 miles of NFS system roads proposed for decommissioning within RHCAs could continue to deliver sediment to streams through road surface erosion or future failure. A total of 17 stream crossings are associated with these roads. The risk is considered low for all but 1 mile of road. The 1 mile of NFS road 77781 at the head of Big Cedar Creek has the highest risk of effects because it runs adjacent to the stream and occurs within 150 feet of it on average. Road densities in RHCAs would remain at 1.2 mi/mi2. • No management-related changes, either positive or negative, would occur in the existing aquatic habitat condition. Instream and riparian processes of habitat development and wood recruitment would continue in the project area. Riparian habitat conditions would continue to improve as growing, aging trees gradually provide shade and large, woody debris to streams. Alternative A would inhibit the ability of the Forest to further limit or reduce sediment delivery to streams from roads in order to meet or maintain Forest Plan water quality objectives. In the event of stream crossing failures, this alternative has the potential to affect the Idaho state standard for cold water aquatic life and salmonid spawning. The risk of crossing failures increases as culverts age and their conditions deteriorate. This alternative does not include other management activities that would affect beneficial uses. 3.1.6.1.2 Alternatives B, C, and D Design features would be used to minimize direct input of sediment to streams from management activities. PACFISH buffers would be retained on perennial and intermittent streams adjacent to timber harvest units. Temporary roads would be built along or near ridgetops with no stream crossings. Road reconstruction would install cross-drain culverts to divert roadside ditch flow onto the forest floor instead of into streams. Road surfacing with gravel would also occur where needed. Road decommissioning would remove all perennial and intermittent stream channel crossings and would recontour roads within RHCAs. No prescribed fire would be ignited within PACFISH buffers, though low-intensity fire would be allowed to back into them. Grassland improvement activities would occur outside of PACFISH buffers. Few if any direct effects would occur to fish or their habitat from implementing the action alternatives, due to the following: • PACFISH buffer retention would prevent any direct effects to fish or their habitat from timber harvest, precommercial thinning, or prescribed fire activities taking place under the action alternatives. All vegetation would be retained within the buffers. Data have shown that buffers are adequate to prevent sediment input into streams (USDA Forest Service 2006; FEMAT 1993; K. Smith personal observations). All potential instream and riparian woody debris would be retained, and no streamside vegetation would be removed. No disturbance would occur in riparian areas or stream channels during timber harvest, and past monitoring indicates that little disturbance would be expected from prescribed fire. • Road decommissioning in all the action alternatives would remove 3.2 miles of roads from RHCAs, and all affected areas would be fully recontoured. This decommissioning would result in a 16% reduction in RHCA road miles and the removal of an estimated 17 stream crossings. Decommissioning would return 13 acres of RHCA back into a forested state over time. Road densities in RHCAs would be reduced to 1.0 mi/mi2, which would move the watershed condition category from moderate to good, as defined by NOAA (1998). • Road reconstruction would replace 77 undersized culverts with culverts sized for a 100-year flow event. Cross-drain culverts would also be installed in ditchlines on both sides of the culverts in order to divert ditchline flow away from the streams. • Road decommissioning and replacement of undersized culverts are the only activities that would directly affect streams. Instream activities during culvert removals and replacements would introduce locally measurable amounts of sediments immediately downstream of the sites. The sediments and increased turbidity levels would settle out downstream; the distance is expected to be less than 500 feet due to small stream size and low flow during the dry season, when work would occur. This disturbance may degrade substrate conditions, as fine sediments deposit over existing gravels. However, sediment input would occur over a short time frame (1 day per site). The estimated amount of sediment potentially added to a stream from culvert removal is less than 20 pounds (0.04 cubic yards) per site (Foltz et al. 2008). No direct effects to threatened or sensitive aquatic species would occur, as none of these species are known to reside within a minimum of 1,000 feet of any of the removal sites. Culvert removals would provide a direct benefit to all aquatic species by eliminating the risk of future crossing failures • Culvert removal and replacement would remove about 0.1 acres of riparian vegetation at each site. Removing primarily shrubs and small trees is unlikely to cause stream temperature increases, because the area affected is small (estimated to be <10 acres for all sites combined). No measurable changes to stream temperatures are expected, because all streams above and below the work sites are well shaded by dense vegetation (shrubs/trees). • No direct effects to streams would occur from road reconditioning or cross-drain culvert installation activities since no stream channels would be disturbed. Cross-drain culverts will be installed an average of 50 feet away from stream channels, and no mechanism is present to deliver sediment to streams from this activity. • No direct effects to streams and threatened or sensitive aquatic species would occur from temporary road construction activities since all roads would be located on or near ridgetops where there are no stream crossings and would be decommissioned after use. No mechanisms are present that could deliver sediment into stream channels from these roads; PACFISH buffers and vegetation and woody debris left within harvest units act as barriers to potential sediment delivery. The action alternatives would not directly affect Idaho State standards for cold water aquatic life, secondary contact recreation, or salmonid spawning. The indirect effects to fish or their habitat from implementing the action alternatives would be minimal to beneficial because of the following: • No indirect effects to streams would occur from timber harvest or temporary road construction. PACFISH buffers are effective at preventing sediment delivery to streams from these activities. They are also effective at maintaining stream temperatures. Road reconditioning—including road surfacing and removal of small slumps that block ditchlines, divert water onto the road surface, and cause surface erosion—would be beneficial to streams. Monitoring of other projects indicates that no indirect effects should be expected from low-intensity prescribed fire that would be allowed to back into PACFISH buffers. This type of fire does not typically make its way to riparian areas or streams. • No effects to PACFISH RMOs (pool frequency, water temperature, large woody debris, bank stability, lower bank angle, and width-to-depth ratio) are expected, because riparian areas would not be disturbed. As noted in the Watershed section, water yield is not expected to increase to the point where it would decrease bank stability, and sediment yield would not increase sediment delivery to the point where it would affect width-to-depth ratios. • Road decommissioning would remove 17 crossings and the fill material associated with them. This removal would eliminate the risk of crossing failures at these sites and subsequent input of at least 1,700 cubic yards of soil into streams. Decommissioning would provide for long-term beneficial effects to streams. • Road reconstruction under all action alternatives would reduce the risk of sediment delivery to streams. Culverts would be replaced and cross-drain culverts installed at 77 stream crossings under all the action alternatives. After project activities are complete, 10 undersized culverts would remain on NFS lands. All occur on small, fishless streams. New cross-drain culverts would intercept ditchline flow and route sediment away from stream channels. Preliminary monitoring of similar pipes in the Fan Creek drainage indicates that the risk of sediment entering streams after the work is complete would be almost nonexistent (K. Smith, personal observation, 2008). Monitoring showed that only 1 out of 37 pipes routed ditchline flow down the forested slope and into a stream channel. A different design on that one pipe would have prevented any routing to the stream. The remaining pipes routed sediment for an average of 40 feet downslope from the culvert outlet, with no delivery to streams. Road reconstruction activities would allow for a continued improving trend that could help to meet or maintain Forest Plan desired sediment conditions in Clear Creek and its tributaries. • FISHSED modeling indicates minor effects to deposited sediment. Modeled changes for cobble embeddedness increase by 1%–2% under all alternatives for Hoodoo, Solo, Pine Knob, Browns Spring, Clear Creek, and Middle Fork Clear Creek prescription watersheds. No changes in cobble embeddedness occurred for South Fork Clear Creek and Kay Creek under any alternative. • FISHSED modeling indicates a 1% decrease in summer rearing capacity in all but the South Fork Clear Creek prescription watershed for all action alternatives. • FISHSED modeling shows a 1%–2% decrease in winter rearing capacity for all action alternatives in Hoodoo, Solo, Browns Spring, Pine Knob, Clear Creek, and South Fork Clear Creek prescription watersheds. No changes occurred in Middle Fork Clear Creek or Kay Creek. • Lower Clear Creek Face and Big Cedar Creek prescription watersheds were not assigned fish/water quality objectives or sediment yield guidelines, primarily because most of the area is on private lands; subsequently, no FISHSED models were run for these two prescription watersheds. • In summary, FISHSED modeling predicts a 0%–2% change in cobble embeddedness and summer/winter rearing capacity for juvenile steelhead trout rearing in B channel types for the action alternatives. Predicted changes are less than 10%. FISHSED is most appropriately used to assess the effects of changes in habitat quality when cobble embeddedness changes are greater than 10% (Stowell et al. 1983). No measurable changes in cobble embeddedness and summer/winter habitat rearing capacity are therefore expected based on this modeling. • The action alternatives would indirectly result in minor, short-term localized negative effects to cold water aquatic life during culvert removals and replacements. Because these activities are designed to improve conditions over the long term, all state designated beneficial uses would be maintained over the long term. 3.1.6.2 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects analysis area is the entire 58,990-acre Clear Creek drainage. It includes all federal, State, and private lands in the watershed. This analysis area was selected since activities outside of the drainage would have no effects on aquatic habitats within the drainage. Quantitative information was available for roads only. Google Earth was used to assess riparian conditions and the analysis is presented in qualitative form. The time frame considered for cumulative effects is 2014 to 2022. This period covers all road reconstruction and decommissioning activities from the beginning of the project until 2 years after these activities are expected to be completed. The additional 2 years after project completion is the expected amount of time it would take for shrubs and ground cover to respond after culvert replacement or decommissioning activities occur. The growth of shrubs and other ground cover limits overland flow of sediment after these activities. This analysis considers only those activities that affect road densities, culvert size, or cobble embeddedness levels (as modeled by FISHSED) during the cumulative effects time frame. The existing condition includes all past road building, fish passage culvert replacement, and decommissioning activities through 2012. The activities considered for cumulative effects are proposed project road decommissioning and road reconstruction activities in combination with the Browns Spring Creek Culvert Replacement Project (2013/2014), the proposed Clear Ridge Non-system Road Decommissioning Project (2014 and beyond), and 2 culvert replacements on county roads in lower Clear Creek that occurred in 2011. Culvert inventories found the Browns Spring culverts to be undersized but contain no fish. One was a moderate priority for replacement and the other a low priority. Both will be replaced with structures sized for a 100-year flow event. The Clear Ridge Non-system Road Decommissioning Project would remove about 15 crossings and 8 miles of roads within RHCAs. Decommissioning nonsystem roads would reestablish vegetation on 32 acres of RHCAs. These projects could add locally measurable amounts of sediments to streams, as discussed above under the road decommissioning portion of this analysis. Sediment is not expected to travel more than 500 feet downstream, due to the timing of installation (i.e., during low-flow periods) and BMP implementation to control sediment. Crossing removals are beneficial but are not included in the calculation for stream crossings, because the streams were not surveyed and it is not known if the crossings currently exist. A long-term beneficial effect would be associated with crossing removals. 3.1.6.2.1 Alternative A Lower Clear Creek has 4 appropriately sized stream crossings (2 bridges and 2 culverts) on county roads. Future foreseeable federal actions include the Browns Spring Creek Culvert Replacement Project and the Clear Ridge Non-system Road Decommissioning Project. This alternative would cumulatively retain 113, or 95%, of the undersized culverts in the watershed. The Clear Ridge project would decommission 8 miles of roads in RHCAs; however, road densities would not be affected since nonsystem roads are not included in road density calculations. However, both of these projects would provide a beneficial effect from potential sediment reductions to streams. No cumulative effects to cobble embeddedness (as modeled by FISHSED) would occur since road decommissioning and culvert replacements are not accounted for in the NEZSED or FISHSED models. 3.1.6.2.2 Alternatives B, C, and D The proposed project activities, when combined with past and foreseeable federal activities, would cumulatively reduce RHCA road density from 2.2 mi/mi2 to 2.0 mi/mi2 at the watershed scale. This improvement would move the Clear Creek watershed from poor condition to moderate condition (NOAA 1998). The action alternatives would cumulatively retain 36, or 30%, of the undersized culverts in the watershed. Road decommissioning would cumulatively return 45 acres of RHCAs to a forested condition. No cumulative effects to cobble embeddedness, summer rearing, or winter rearing capacity would occur, as FISHSED-modeled changes indicated no measurable change in these factors. Culvert replacement or decommissioning activities cannot be modeled in NEZSED or FISHSED and were therefore not assessed for cumulative effects related to sediment that may be produced from these activities. Culvert replacement and road decommissioning activities would produce an overall positive cumulative effect to aquatic habitat and species in the project area. No measurable negative cumulative effects to instream sediment are expected as a result of any of the action alternatives when combined with State/private lands and other projects on federal lands. 3.2 ECONOMICS  Analysis Area 3.2.1The project area is located within Idaho County, Idaho. The economic analysis area includes local towns and communities influenced by the timber sale activities. These towns include Grangeville, Elk City, Kamiah, Kooskia, Harpster, Stites, Clearwater, Orofino, Pierce, Weippe, and Lewiston. The timber sale influence on these towns depends on their proximity to the watershed, their economic dependence on it, and their historic use of the watershed dating to settlement more than 100 years ago. The Nez Perce National Forest has provided wood to local mills since the 1930s. The Forest’s output, along with BLM timber outputs, accounted for half the total timber harvested in Idaho County in the mid-1990s. Most of the Forest timber output was processed in mills located in or near the towns mentioned previously.  Regulatory Framework 3.2.2The project complies with Forest Plan direction to develop cost-effective projects, and it complies with the NFMA by emphasizing resource management over timber volume output. 3.2.2.1 National Forest Management Act The NFMA requires that a sale “consider the economic stability of communities whose economies are dependent on such national forest materials, or achieve such other objectives as the Secretary deems necessary” (NFMA, Sec. 14, e,1,c). The NFMA also requires that “the harvesting system to be used is not selected primarily because it will give the greatest dollar return or the greatest unit output of timber” (NFMA, Sec. 6, g,3,E,IV). The project meets the requirements of the NFMA by using the IMPLAN model to evaluate how each alternative would affect economic stability in local communities. The project also uses harvest systems that are based on ground-truthed silvicultural practices, not on the highest dollar return, to achieve the desired long-term forest and access needs. 3.2.2.2 Forest Service Manual The FSM directs that economic feasibility be considered in project design during the early planning and NEPA documentation. A sale feasibility analysis was done at Gate 1, which led to consideration of treatments providing cost-reducing economic benefits. One major adjustment was the use of mechanical site preparation versus burning site preparation methods where possible. The mechanical methods provide better leave tree survival and utilize cheaper purchaser-supplied equipment. 3.2.2.3 Forest Plan The Forest Plan requires that the project provide a sustained yield of resource outputs at a level that will help support the economic structure of local communities and provide for regional and national needs (USDA Forest Service 1987b, Goal A.1, page II-1). Alternative A would not contribute toward the Forest Timber sale program or support the economic timber harvesting structure of the local communities, while Alternatives B, C, and D would. Alternative C would best meet this goal. 3.2.2.4 Executive Order 12898 EO 12898 requires that each federal agency make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations in the United States and its territories. The Clear Creek analysis did not reveal any disproportionately high and adverse impacts to minority populations or low-income populations. None of the action alternatives are expected to negatively affect minority or low-income populations or any United States citizen. No environmental health hazards are expected to result from implementation of any alternative. This project would not disproportionately affect income level in the economic analysis area.  Resource Indicators 3.2.3Timber harvest–related jobs and income: Jobs and income generated from the project contribute to community stability. Sale feasibility: Sale feasibility is represented by the Present Net Value (PNV). A project with a positive PNV would be a sellable project. A project with a negative PNV would either not sell or require supplemental funding to make it sellable.  Analysis Methodology 3.2.4The Nez Perce National Forest Plan Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) (USDA Forest Service 1987a) describes the economic impacts of implementing the Forest Plan. The Forest Plan addresses the economic analysis process and values placed on nonconsumptive items such as recreation opportunities, community stability, cultural resources, habitats, and populations. This economic analysis will not revisit the information presented in the Forest Plan and will focus only on those costs and revenues associated with implementing the proposed activities in the project area. The Forest Service Micro IMPLAN model was used to derive the indirect and induced economic effects. Direct economic effects were derived from mill surveys conducted by the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Montana. The following response coefficients found in the table were developed for the 1997 Clearwater National Forest Timber Sale Program Information Reporting System (TSPIRS). TSPIRS, a reporting system developed jointly with the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Forest Service, has been reviewed and approved by Congress. The coefficients from the Forest Service Micro IMPLAN model to derive the indirect and induced economic effects are as follows: • Harvest-Related Jobs Generated: 13.5 per 100,000 cubic feet (MCCF) • Harvest Income to Communities: $383,406 per MCCF • Federal Income Tax Generated: $57,511 per MCCF The Region 1 Gate 1 and 2 spreadsheet and the Quicksilver model with Nez Perce–Clearwater National Forests area factors were used to determine sale feasibility and appraised value. The Quicksilver model uses recent transactional evidence based on local timber sales to determine sale value. The timber stand database and extensive field reviews were used to determine timber volume and species composition; these are the two primary factors determining gross value of a timber sale. Net value depends on costs for logging system, haul distance, slash disposal, planting, and mitigation activities. The cost estimates for this sale are based on recent similar sales in the vicinity.  Affected Environment 3.2.5In a report for the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project (Columbia Basin Assessment), titled “Rural Communities in the Inland Northwest,” communities are characterized in terms of their ability to manage change and adapt to it in positive, constructive ways. The report emphasizes community resiliency, which is a function of community conditions such as economic structure, infrastructure, civic leadership, cohesiveness, and amenities. The Columbia Basin Assessment resiliency ratings for Idaho County (Kooskia and Grangeville) and Clearwater County (Orofino, Pierce, and Weippe) are low. However, preliminary findings from a study recently completed by University of Idaho sociologists working on the Columbia River Basin Assessment show that many timber-dependent communities tend to be more resilient and able to tolerate change than is commonly assumed. The resiliency rating for Nez Perce County (Lewiston) is high. The towns of Grangeville, Orofino, Weippe, Pierce, and Lewiston all show high to very high historic employment in the wood products manufacturing industry per the Columbia Basin Assessment. As of August 2012, Idaho County had an unemployment rate of 9.4%, and the rate in Clearwater County was 13.0% (4th highest in Idaho). The average unemployment rate in Idaho is 6.9%, and the national average is 8.1%. In addition, counties dependent on federal timber receipts to help fund schools and highways find that this source of funding is drying up, so they have relied more heavily on taxes to bolster their income, to the detriment of low-income families and the unemployed who feel that timber harvest should contribute more. Idaho has always been a natural resource–based state, although as natural resource extraction declines, the state has moved toward diversification. Many communities have made impressive strides in achieving Idaho Gem Community status and working to diversify their economies. (The Gem Community program was established by the Idaho Department of Commerce to encourage communities to plan their futures.) As reported by the Idaho Department of Labor, the timber products industry went through hard times in the early 1980s, but the firms that survived were streamlined and modernized with the hope to have a consistent supply of timber from National Forest lands.  Environmental Consequences 3.2.63.2.6.1 Direct and Indirect Effects 3.2.6.1.1 Alternatives A, B, C, and D Table 3-2 displays the job and income consequences of implementing the timber harvest alternatives. The Forest Service Micro IMPLAN model was used to derive the indirect and induced economic effects of the timber harvesting; the model does not reflect additional jobs and income related to implementation of the non-timber harvest stewardship activities, such as precommercial thinning and road decommissioning, which are the same for all the action alternatives. These stewardship activities would generate some additional jobs, but not to a level like the timber harvest and would not point to any alternative as generating more than the other because they would be the same between alternatives, except for the no action alternative. Alternative A (No Action) would not generate any timber harvest jobs. Alternative C would generate the most jobs and revenue, because it generates the most timber volume, followed by Alternatives B and D. The other activities being proposed along with timber management, such as road decommissioning, precommercial thinning, broadcast burning, and reforestation, also provide jobs and income to the local economy. For example, in addition to providing jobs for heavy equipment operators required to decommission the roads, the project will create jobs for laborers performing erosion control and project inspection. Table 3-2.

The appraised value is the timber value based on recent bidding—that is, the amount the Nez Perce National Forest anticipates the timber would sell for minus costs for logging, road reconstruction, site preparation/fuel abatement, and mitigation. The PNV is the anticipated selling value minus the costs to implement the sale and reforest the land. An alternative with a positive PNV has stumpage values exceeding costs, whereas an alternative with a negative PNV has costs in excess of stumpage values and may require supplemental funding to complete all activities. Information provided by the economic models is used as a tool to understand the relative monetary differences between alternatives rather than to predict exact values for each alternative, since the variables may change between now and the time the timber sells. Alternative A (No Action) does not generate any value or accrue any costs associated with the NEPA decision, so its PNV is zero. However, Alternative A would not be able to offset the $175,000 cost of doing the NEPA analysis. Tree mortality is occurring in many of the areas planned for regeneration. If a large wildfire (100+ acres) were to start as a result of fuel buildup from the anticipated tree mortality, fire suppression costs would likely exceed $300,000 (for comparison, the 350-acre Granite Fire of 2011 cost $2.2 million). Alternatives B, C, and D are all predicted to generate enough stumpage value to cover all of the sale costs, plus reforestation, while also capturing the timber value before it deteriorates from tree mortality. All of these alternatives should generate revenue, with Alternative B being the most economically feasible and generating the highest revenue (Table 3-3). All the action alternatives would use a combination of Forest Service burning and/or machine piling for the reforestation site preparation. Site preparation and tree planting are the two largest single-cost activities associated with implementing the different alternatives, but since each action alternative has the same costs per acre, the economic effect is proportional to the amount of acres needing site preparation and planting. To reduce reforestation costs, natural regeneration should be implemented where possible and where it meets the project purpose and need. Table 3-2 displays the predicted appraised total and PNV for each alternative. As noted in the table, Alternative C produces the most volume, but Alternative B provides the greatest revenue, because Alternative B requires less site preparation and involves lower planting costs than Alternative C. Alternative B has higher site preparation and planting costs than Alternative D, but Alternative B generates enough commercial thin volume that reforestation is not required to offset the other costs (Alternative B thus produces a higher overall economic return). Table 3-3.

NEPA costs, which total about $175,000, are not included in this cost total. d Stewardship costs include precommercial thinning, road decommissioning, grass restoration, and landscape prescribed burning. 3.2.6.2 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects area includes Clearwater, Idaho, Lewis, and Nez Perce counties in Idaho. The timber volume is scheduled to be sold through 5 different sales over a 5-year period, starting in 2014. Typical sale duration would be 4 years each; the last sale would be completed in 2022 (harvest activities usually do not start on the first year a sale is sold), for a total of about 8 years of harvest activities. Post-harvest reforestation and site preparation work could continue for up to 5 years following harvest on the last sale, creating a potential end date of 2027, for a total of 13 years of harvest plus post-harvest activities. Economic impacts for activities such as logging and sawmilling lumber are shown in the section above. These impacts are described as direct and indirect effects, but they are also considered cumulative effects due to the additional jobs, taxes, and income they provide. When impacts from additional jobs and income are taken into account, this project contributes to the Forest’s 5-year timber sale plan and may boost the Forest’s output by 10 million board feet per year. Current sold sales and foreseeable local sales, as shown on the Forest’s Five Year Action Plan, would also affect the same communities and contribute to the long-term timber flow to these communities. 3.2.6.2.1 Alternative A—No Action Since this alternative does not propose any timber harvest or other stewardship activities, it would not contribute cumulatively to local community jobs and income. Alternative A would maintain current unmanaged use and related income. It could potentially increase future firefighting costs and locally generated income as trees die and create excessive fuel loadings susceptible to wildfire ignitions. 3.2.6.2.2 Alternatives B, C, and D Added to the Forest’s 5-year timber sale plan, these alternatives would sustain jobs (ranging from 1,571 to 2,133 jobs). However, Alternatives B, C, and D are not expected to generate a large number of jobs or significant amounts of income from timber harvest or roadwork; therefore, these alternatives would not be likely to cumulatively affect local communities beyond the past 3-year employment averages. The mills tend to adjust their annual production to sustain long-term outputs (instead of boom-and-bust cycles) by purchasing private and State timber along with National Forest sales. Prescribed burning is planned in association with the previously mentioned timber sale projects. Prescribed burning is mostly handled internally by the Forest Service. Forest Service employees are supported by local community services. The prescribed burning proposed under other projects in the area can be handled with the normal Forest Service workforce and therefore would not have a cumulative effect on the local communities. Additional stewardship items including road decommissioning, precommercial thinning, and grass restoration would also contribute money to the local communities. If additional forestry activities are implemented within the counties by the State or by private industry, additional forestry workers may be needed. 3.3 FUELS  Analysis Area 3.3.1The fuels analysis area encompasses the upper two-thirds of the Clear Creek drainage and all of its tributaries. This area was selected because it includes all Forest NFS managed lands that could be affected by project activities.  Regulatory Framework 3.3.2Nez Perce National Forest Plan (Forest Plan) direction and all federal and State laws and regulations applicable to fuels would be applied to the project. Nez Perce National Forest Plan—The project meets the Nez Perce National Forest Plan’s specific fire management goal for this area, which is to “protect resource values through cost effective fire and fuels treatment through the utilization of material and using prescribed fire” (USDA Forest Service 1987b, p. II-2). The modified fuel bed would decrease the probability of stand-replacing crown fire and increase firefighter effectiveness, reducing the probability of resource damage at a lower cost while utilizing wood fiber. Smoke Management—The Forest Service is a member of the Idaho/Montana Airshed Group. This airshed group is composed of State, federal, tribal, and private organizations that are dedicated to the preservation of air quality in Idaho and Montana. Its members are prescribed burners and the public health and regulatory agencies that regulate the burning cooperatively to prevent smoke impacts from fires designed to accomplish land management objectives. The analysis area falls within Airshed 12B. Project-related prescribed fire activities would be approved by the airshed group; approval would be contingent on prevailing weather conditions, other planned ignitions in the airshed, and the resultant smoke impacts, including impacts to the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness (a Class 1 airshed).  Resource Indicators 3.3.3Issue: From a fuels perspective, the vegetation includes little variation. Variations can create barriers that can slow a fire or alter its behavior (such as dropping the fire from the crowns to the ground). Existing areas of past harvest and other vegetation types such as shrubfields could act as barriers; however, they are too small to affect fire behavior at the landscape scale. The current homogeneous fuels support a risk of crown fire that could pose a threat to life, property, and other resource values. Approximately 94% of the project area is in the WUI as defined by the Idaho County Wildfire Mitigation Plan Committee (Idaho County 2009). Indicator: Percentage of project area that could support a crown fire (active, passive, or conditional) Issue: Existing landscape health is not consistent with a landscape that operates with a natural disturbance cycle. In this case, fire was the dominant disturbance agent. Mean fire return intervals in some of the landscape are above historical conditions. Age classes are trending toward larger size classes and lacking in early seral size classes. In a healthy landscape, disturbance would create larger patch sizes in a mosaic. In the analysis area, timber harvest has created a smaller, more uniform, linear-edged series of patches; fire exclusion has eliminated any new sizable disturbance-created patches since the early 20th century. Indicator: Fire Regime Condition Class (FRCC) is a measure of landscape health based on fire return interval and age class distribution. It describes the degree of departure between the current vegetation and a simulated historical reference condition. Patch size accounts for the spatial distribution across the landscape.  Analysis Methodology 3.3.4Field Sampled Vegetation (FSVeg) stand exam data were collected for the treatment units and other stands within the project area in 2011. This information was processed through the Forest Vegetation Simulator and Fire and Fuels Extension (FVS/FFE) model (Reinhardt and Crookston 2003). Outputs from this model include surface fuel loadings, fire behavior fuel models, canopy base height, and aerial fuel loadings that determine whether a fire is a surface fire or crown fire. Techniques to reduce crown fire occurrence and severity include the following: increase canopy base height; reduce canopy bulk density; reduce forest canopy continuity; and reduce surface fuels (Scott and Burgan 2005). With the exception of Alternative A, the proposed treatments accomplish some or all of the techniques. The FSVeg Spatial Data Analyzer v2.3.0 was used to collectively grow the stands through 10-year timesteps to visually show the changes through space and time. Fire type (surface or crown) was modeled in FVS/FFE under 97th-percentile weather conditions, representing extreme fire weather. Weather data from June 1 through September 30 were selected to represent the entire summer fire season. Percentile weather was computed using Fire Family Plus (Main et al. 1990). Twenty years (1990–2010) of weather data from the most representative weather station were analyzed to determine weather conditions. Two different analyses of landscape health using FRCC were conducted. One used the FRCC software and direction outlined in the Interagency FRCC Guidebook. The silviculturist developed a crosswalk between LANDFIRE Biophysical settings and VRUs; tree size class was determined by using the R1 Vmap vegetation layer. The second analysis was used only for describing the existing condition and utilized the FRCC Mapping Tool software and LANDFIRE vegetation layers. The patch size analysis (FRAGSTATS, see Silviculture report in the project record) indicates whether the area will trend toward desired conditions after treatments are completed.  Affected Environment 3.3.53.3.5.1 Fire Occurrence, History and Risks Historically, fire was the primary disturbance factor that shaped the composition and structure of forests in the Clear Creek drainage. The largest wildfires burned 27,245 acres between 1870 and the 1931 fire, which burned approximately 11,000 acres. Only 155 acres have burned since then. Overlaps in fires occurred mostly on the South Fork Clear Creek area between the late 1800s and 1931, with other minor overlaps occurring later. The overlap in all fires totals about 7,900 acres. The total area burned was therefore approximately 19,490 acres, or 45% of the drainage. Fires burned mostly on dry-to-moist habitat types of the South Fork, mainstem, and Middle Fork of Clear Creek. Stand-replacement fire occurred in the South Fork, while mixed-severity fires occurred in the upper Clear Creek and Solo Creek areas. The determination of severity was based on the overall age class distribution of trees in the area. No large fires have been documented in the moist habitat types in the headwaters of the drainage within the last 150 years. As the forests in these habitat types begin to age, they become more susceptible to mortality from insects and disease, which increases the risk of crown fire. This weakness was observed in the upper South Fork Clear Creek area in the summer of 2011, when an infestation of the Douglas-fir tussock moth (a defoliator) began occurring. Damage to trees was noticeable over about 3,000 acres. The severity of the infestation will not be known until 2013. Affected trees can recover from an initial insect attack; however, if another outbreak occurs in 2013, and trees are attacked a second time, mortality will likely occur. Typically, the second infestation kills the trees. Since tracking began in the 1970s, a total of 285 fire starts have occurred in Clear Creek. The number of starts per decade ranges from 53 to 90. The total acreage burned ranges from 19 to 80 acres per decade since 1932. Effective wildfire suppression since the early 1900s has greatly reduced fire frequency in the area. Fires that occur in the area are suppressed due to the proximity to private property adjacent to the forest boundary and the timber management areas. Current fuel profiles would allow crown fires to establish in over 50% of the area. Once established, these fires are virtually impossible to stop without the fire running into a barrier (such as a change in fuel type) or the weather variables changing (such as relative humidity rising overnight). Indirect suppression strategies would need to be employed for a crown fire. Conditions like these can lead to large amounts of burned acreage, high costs, and adverse impacts to resources including soils, wildlife, water resources, and infrastructure. Approximately 94% of the project area lies within the rural Salmon-Clearwater WUI. The WUI designation was determined by Idaho County and a group of collaborators in 2005 and revised in 2009 as mandated by the National Fire Plan of 2001 (USDI and USDA 2001). This mandate allowed each County to determine its own definition of WUI. Idaho County adopted this philosophy: “The wildland-urban interface refers to areas where wildland vegetation meets urban developments. These areas encompass not only the interface (areas immediately adjacent to urban development), but also the continuous slopes that lead directly to a risk to urban developments.” In addition, the County identified the protection of structures and private property and protection of “the biological resources of the management area” as concerns (Idaho County 2009). The Nez Perce National Forest Plan direction requires fire suppression (control, contain, confine) in about 70% of the drainage. Fires for resource benefit could be allowed to burn in the Clear Creek Roadless Area, the upper South Fork, and a portion of the West Fork of Clear Creek if sufficient fuel modifications are implemented. 3.3.5.2 Vegetation and Fuels A distinct moisture gradient occurs from west to east in the project area; this gradient is reflected in the range of habitat types in the area. The western portion of the drainage contains drier habitats that begin with bunchgrasses (which do not support trees) and move into the dry ponderosa pine /Douglas-fir /ninebark habitat types. Historically, fire played an important role in maintaining these habitat types, with low-severity fires occurring every 5–50 years and severe-intensity fire occurring every 90–200 years. Patch sizes ranged from 50 to 1,500 acres. Current patch sizes created by timber harvest range from 6 to 282 acres. Moving east, the habitats quickly transition to moister types dominated by grand fir and western redcedar. Historically, these habitat types were dominated by mixed species with sizable representation of white pine and western larch. White pine and western larch are long-lived tree species typically established after major forms of disturbance (fire windthrow) and have the potential to occupy a site for 200–300 years. Patch sizes for these species ranged from 40 to 1,000 acres historically. Current patch sizes range from 1 acre to 282 acres. The last habitat types found in the drainage are the cooler habitat types located in the headwaters of Clear Creek. These are dominated by subalpine fir and lodgepole pine and typically have stand-replacing disturbances every 90–150 years. Historically, patch sizes ranged from 40 to 1,000 acres. Current patch sizes range from 1 acre to 282 acres. Barriers to large fire spread are limited in the project area. A compilation of studies has shown that recent regeneration units or fresh fire scars are effective at stopping crown fires or reducing their effects if they are over 400 feet wide (Hudack et al. 2011). 3.3.5.3 Fire Regime and Condition Class A natural fire regime is a general classification of the role fire would play across a landscape in the absence of modern human mechanical intervention, but includes aboriginal burning (Agee 1993). Coarse-scale definitions for natural (historical) fire regimes were developed by Hardy et al. (2001) and Schmidt et al. (2002) and interpreted for fire and fuels management by Hann and Bunnell (2001). The 5 natural fire regime classifications are based on the average number of years between fires (fire frequency) and the severity (amount of replacement) of the fire on the dominant overstory vegetation. Historically, the drier mixed-conifer sites best fit a Fire Regime I, while the wetter sites best fit a Fire Regime III. However, with the unnatural effects of fire suppression, the drier sites are trending toward a Fire Regime II due to increases in ladder fuels; these conditions would increase fire severity. The same is occurring in the wetter sites, which are trending toward Fire Regime IV. Fire behavior effects and other associated disturbances for the low-departure class (FRCC 1) are similar to those that occurred prior to fire exclusion and other vegetative management activities. Ecosystems with a moderate departure from historic rates (33%–66%) have an increased risk of the loss of species composition, structural stage, and canopy closure from noncharacteristic fire. Class 3 ecosystems with a high departure from historic rates (>66%) feature vegetative composition and fuel characteristics that are highly altered from the natural regime; in these ecosystems, the risk of loss of key components is high. The FRCC in the project area, based on the vegetation attributes, is moderate (FRCC 2), with ranges from 41% in the West Fork drainage, 47% in the upper Clear Creek drainage, and 53% in the South Fork drainage. The overall FRCC, using the LANDFIRE/Vegetation Response Units (VRU) crosswalk and incorporating the fire frequency, yields a score of 39%, or a rating of moderate. A moderate rating means that the fire cycle is trending away from its natural ranges and is being affected by fire suppression or other land management activities. Over time, the drainage will trend toward the high-departure class. Estimates indicate that the area will move from moderate departure to high departure within 30 years if no disturbances occur, because the majority of the area will fall outside of the fire return interval of 30–100 years. Surface fuel loadings (downed wood) are increasing due to ongoing tree mortality and fire suppression. The benefits to soil productivity increase as more downed wood decomposes; therefore, more nutrients are available for plant growth. Ladder fuels are also increasing due to understory tree growth. Larger amounts of surface and ladder fuels increase the risk of high-severity, stand-replacing fire. This type of fire could lead to reduced soil productivity and moisture-holding capacity. From a fuels perspective, the vegetation includes little variation. Variations in vegetation patterns create barriers that can slow a fire or alter its behavior (such as dropping the fire from the crowns to the ground). Existing areas of past harvest and other vegetation types, such as shrubfields, could act as barriers; however, they are too small to affect fire behavior at the landscape scale. 3.3.5.4 Potential Fire Behavior Fire type (e.g., surface and crown) was modeled for the project area for extreme (97th-percentile) weather conditions for visual display. The percent of fire type was quantified for the actual treatment units, and all crown fire activity (active, passive, or conditional) was grouped. Currently, 51% of the project area is susceptible to crown fire.  Environmental Consequences 3.3.63.3.6.1 Direct and Indirect Effects As noted above, the analysis area for direct and indirect effects of the alternatives is the project area. 3.3.6.1.1 Alternative A—No Action Under this alternative, no treatments are planned; therefore, fuels would persist as discussed under the existing condition and accumulate further over time. Alternative A would cause no direct effects to fire type or FRCC rating, because no vegetation treatment would take place under this alternative. The indirect effect would be the trending of the landscape toward a FRCC 3 rating within 30 years. There would continue to be a lack of stands of young trees as existing stands continue on with succession. The landscape would also continue to trend toward to a more uniform forest dominated by non-early seral species. Canopy base height would remain low, crown bulk density would remain high, tree density would remain high, and the surface fuels would remain the same. The amount of the project area that could experience crown fire would increase as time passes. Therefore, direct control would be difficult, fires would be large, and costs would be high. Barriers to large fire spread would remain minimal. Direct Effects: If Alternative A is selected, 51% of the proposed treatment area would continue to be susceptible to crown fire in 2022. FRCC remains in a moderate category at 39%. The patch sizes associated with these types of landscapes remain below desired conditions. Indirect Effects: Factors favoring crown fire remain and increase over time. The project area becomes less diverse. Barriers to fire remain low, fire containment opportunities are limited, and fire size and costs are expected to increase. The landscape will trend toward a homogeneous forest dominated by large nonseral trees as the remaining smaller, younger patches continue with succession. No biomass removal opportunities or smoke emissions from logging slash will occur. 3.3.6.1.2 Alternatives B, C, and D Direct Effects The direct effect of these alternatives is a reduction in potential crown fire acreage, a slight improvement in FRCC, and a marked improvement in patch size. Potential crown fire area is reduced by 7% in all alternatives, moving the area from 51% to 44% by the year 2022. The regeneration treatments would influence FRCC ratings by changing seral classes from mature to young stands. However, approximately 50% of current early seral patches change seral class within 10 years, so the effect of the regeneration treatments is lessened. The project area remains at a FRCC 2 rating even after treatments, due to relatively low amounts of proposed regeneration harvest. Alternatives B, C, and D regenerate 6%, 10%, and 5% of the project area respectively. All the action alternatives use prescribed fire on up to 3% of the area. Alternatives B and D reduce the overall landscape departure rating from 39% to 38%, and Alternative C reduces it to 37%, which is a slight improvement on the landscape but still maintains the area in the moderate category. Patch size increases across all action alternatives (Table 3-4), driven by the varying amount of regeneration harvest. Mean patch sizes are not as large as historically occurred; however, the trend is positive. Given the distribution across the landscape, these patches emulate a mixed-severity fire regime. Treatment units range in size, which is important to landscape and fuel variability. Discontinuities in surface, ladder, and crown fuels interrupt fire spread, but relatively small patches may not have a substantial effect on large fires. Treatments of individual stands under a given prescription would probably be irrelevant to fire behavior and effects at the landscape scale, because wildfires are often larger than individual treatment units (Finney and Cohen 2003). Many of the treatments in the proposed action span several stands and therefore should be large enough to affect a large fire. Canopy base heights would be raised, crown bulk density would be substantially lowered, tree density would be decreased, and surface fuels would be treated, all of which would lower fire intensity in the treatment units. Direct control options in the event of a fire would increase across the landscape as the fuel profile is interrupted, which should reduce fire size and cost. All the action alternatives affect similar acreage, and the reduction in acreage susceptible to crown fire is the same for each alternative: 7%. Acreage susceptible to crown fire will drop from the current 51% to 44% by 2022. Table 3-4.

The overall FRCC remains a 2 across all alternatives (Table 3-5). Table 3-5.

Slash treatments would either result in biomass to be hauled away or piles to be burned. Biomass is measured in dry tons; smoke production in particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) is measured in pounds.

The amount and arrangement of fuels directly affects fire type. The project area is sufficient to display effects. The time frame for cumulative effects is 10 years. The only activities considered for cumulative effects to fuels are management activities that may increase or decrease fuels over the next 10 years. The only activity considered for cumulative effects is fire suppression/exclusion. No current activities and no foreseeable future activities would affect fuels in the cumulative effects area. Fire suppression has been effective in the project area for nearly 100 years. The incremental effect of suppressing each small fire in the watershed has promoted late seral species (rather than early seral species) and changed the forest structure, which in turn has changed the way the forest responds to fires. 3.3.6.2.1 Alternative A—No Action When combined with fire suppression, this alternative would cause a cumulative effect. Fire exclusion has created the current condition of contiguous fuels. Crown fire potential would continue to increase across the project area without treatments, FRCC ratings would move to the higher end of the moderate category in 10 years, and patch size would not be changed, which could affect future fire behavior. 3.3.6.2.2 Alternatives B, C, and D A minor positive cumulative effect would be associated with the action alternatives. Fuel modifications across the landscape and in key locations along the Forest boundary could allow for natural ignitions to burn freely in portions of the project area. Fire suppression would continue on lands managed for timber; however, treatments would reduce fuels, help to improve FRCC ratings, and reduce crown fire potential in these areas. 3.4 ROADLESS AREAS The purpose of this analysis of the Idaho Roadless Areas and unroaded resource is to disclose the project’s potential effects to roadless and wilderness attributes and determine whether it might affect future consideration for wilderness recommendations. This analysis focuses on the potential effects of project activities on wilderness characteristics as defined in the FSH 1909.12 (72.1). The analysis for the effects on other roadless resource attributes such as water resources, soils, and wildlife habitat can be found in other sections of this EIS. The 2008 Idaho Roadless Rule (36 CFR 294 subpart C) integrated local management concerns and the need to protect these areas in concert with the national objectives for protecting roadless area values and characteristics. The final Idaho Roadless Area rule designated 250 Idaho Roadless Areas and established 5 management themes, which include Wild Land Recreation, Special Areas of Historical and Tribal Significance, Primitive, Backcountry Restoration, and General Forest, Rangeland, Grassland. Allocation of an area to a specific theme does not mandate or direct the Forest Service to propose or implement any action in that area; however, management theme designations do determine permitted and prohibited activities. Certain activities, such as road building, mineral development, and timber cutting, are permitted in some themes and prohibited in others; other activities, such as motorized travel, grazing, and motorized and mechanized use, are not changed by this rule. Nez Perce National Forest Plan management direction states that roadless areas will not be managed for wilderness. The term “roadless area” refers to an area of at least 5,000 acres that does not have developed and maintained roads and is substantially natural in condition. A roadless area is specifically defined as an area that meets the minimum criteria for wilderness. Unroaded lands have natural characteristics similar to those of roadless areas but occupy less acreage. Wilderness characteristics include natural integrity, undeveloped characteristics, outstanding opportunities for solitude and primitive unconfined recreation, special features and values, and manageability. The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the environmental consequences of the proposed alternatives on the wilderness characteristics of the Clear Creek Roadless Area.  Analysis Area 3.4.1The analysis area is the 9,200-acre Clear Creek Roadless Area. The Clear Creek Roadless Area is designated as a backcountry restoration theme under the 2008 Idaho Roadless Rule. The Clear Creek Roadless Area is located at the head of Clear Creek along the western boundary of the Nez Perce National Forest. Private property adjoins this area on the northwestern boundary. The nearest roads are spurs of Road 1842 on the north, Road 650 on the west, and Road 286 on the east, but some of these roads are closed during the general hunting season to mitigate impacts on big game. Elevation ranges from 2,000 feet on Clear Creek at the forest boundary to 4,600 feet at China Point Ridge and the headwaters of Solo and Kay creeks. Topography is mountainous with steep slopes (commonly over 70%) paralleling the drainages. Ridgetops are relatively flat. The Clear Creek drainage has been a significant part of the Nez Perce Forest timber sale program since the late 1950s. Most of the acreage remaining in the Clear Creek Roadless Area has burned twice, once in 1870 and again in 1931, leaving about 7,000 acres covered with brushfields in the South Fork and Middle Fork drainages of Clear Creek. Previous conifer forests have never reestablished themselves. Vegetation in the area ranges from very moist, warm cedar habitat types to drier, warm Douglas-fir habitat types. Shrub coverage in the brushfields is primarily maple, willow, serviceberry, and various other shrubs. Bordering the brushfields are patches of young (approximately 70-year-old) timber, a mix of grand fir, Douglas-fir, and western redcedar. Understories are sparse but contain a variety of moist-site plants. Some natural meadows exist in upper Kay Creek in Section 28. The brushfields have been important big game (elk and moose) winter range, but the preferred browse species—redstem, willow, mountain maple, and serviceberry— have in recent years grown out of reach of the animals. Prescribed fire has been used in an attempt to increase the value of the range. Current uses of the area include livestock grazing, big game winter and summer range, fishing, hunting, and mining.  Resource Indicators 3.4.2Issue: A commenter expressed concern that the impacts on the Roadless Area must be evaluated in relation to its designation as proposed Wilderness in House Resolution (H.R.) 3334. Indicator: Wilderness values, impacts of the project on future wilderness designations The following resource indicators were used to compare the effect of the alternatives: Natural Integrity—The extent to which long-term ecological processes are intact and operating Undeveloped characteristics—The degree to which developments and uses are apparent to most visitors Outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive unconfined recreation—Solitude is a personal, subjective value defined as the isolation from sights, sounds, and presence of others and from developments and evidence of humans. Primitive recreation is characterized by meeting nature on its terms, without the comfort and convenience of facilities. Special features and values—Unique ecological, geographical, scenic, and historical features of an area Manageability—The ability to manage an area for wilderness consideration and maintain wilderness attributes  Affected Environment 3.4.3Natural Integrity—Past wildfires in the Clear Creek area and the resulting vegetative succession are some of the natural processes that have occurred. The landscape is prone to fire, and numerous natural ignitions occur every year. Fire management strategies for the area dictate full suppression, however, due to the Roadless Area’s proximity to private property and location within a Community Protection Zone. Opportunities for management of naturally occurring wildfire are limited. Undeveloped Characteristics—Past road building and timber harvest along the southern and eastern portions of the Roadless Area are readily apparent. The private property interface on the westernmost boundaries is highly segmented with numerous corners. The area has several grazing permits, and cows are a common occurrence. Special Features and Values—No special features or values have been identified for the Clear Creek Roadless Area. Opportunities for Solitude and Primitive Unconfined Recreation—This small area, with nearby logging activity, offers limited opportunity for solitude. Vegetative screening is high, however. The main opportunities here are bushwhacking and following game trails through dense brushfields. Manageability—This area has been reduced by at least 14,800 acres since 1979, almost entirely because of timber sales. The area boundary is imprecise except where it coincides with the forest boundary. The area boundary has been drawn to exclude existing roads from the remainder of the area.  Environmental Consequences 3.4.43.4.4.1 Direct and Indirect Effects 3.4.4.1.1 Alternative A No activities are proposed under Alternative A; therefore, under this alternative, the Clear Creek Roadless Area would remain in its current condition. No direct effects would occur to the wilderness characteristics of the area (i.e., the area’s natural integrity, undeveloped characteristics, opportunities for solitude or primitive unconfined recreation, or manageability). Continued fire suppression and lack of disturbance may indirectly cause the area to trend away from desired conditions and may affect the natural quality of the area over time. Shrubfields would continue to become decadent and would be unusable by wintering wildlife. Timber stands could become more susceptible to large-scale stand-replacing wildfire because mosaic conditions would not exist on the landscape. 3.4.4.1.2 Alternatives B, C, and D Alternatives B, C, and D would implement low-mixed severity prescribed fire on approximately 1,400 acres within the Clear Creek Roadless Area over a period of several years. Other activities proposed in Alternatives B, C, and D fall outside the Roadless Area and do not infringe on potential wilderness values; therefore, they are not discussed in this analysis. Implementation of prescribed fire would likely be accomplished using aerial (helicopter) and hand ignitions. Extensive pumps, hoselays, and hand-constructed control lines would probably be needed to control the fire along the private property interface on the westernmost portion of the Roadless Area. Natural Integrity—Implementation of the action alternatives would have a beneficial effect to the natural qualities of the area because disturbance would be sustained, although the mechanism of disturbance would be human caused and not natural. Where prescribed fire coincides with decadent shrubfields, species such as maple, willow, and serviceberry would be rejuvenated and become more available as browse for wintering wildlife. In timbered areas, the mixed-severity mosaic caused by burn would create patches of early successional forest that would ensure a balanced range of age classes distributed across the Clear Creek watershed. Undeveloped Characteristics—Implementing Alternatives B, C, or D would cause little effect to the undeveloped characteristics of the Roadless Area. Low- to mixed-severity prescribed fire closely emulates the effects of wildfire under a wide range of climate and environmental conditions. Visitors would not likely be able to distinguish whether the fire was human caused or natural. A site-specific burn plan would be developed for the project and would document the desired effects and the environmental variables necessary for implementing the prescribed fire to meet objectives. Handline construction along the private property interface may temporarily alter the undeveloped characteristics of the Roadless Area, although property/boundary line location and establishment—including limbed trees and painted boundaries—has already altered this area. Fuels along the boundary are generally light and include open ponderosa pine, shrubs, and harvested private grounds. Handline construction (including limbing trees, removing brush, and light ground scalping in combination with pumps and hoselays to control the burn) is expected to be minimal. Rehabilitation of the handlines following implementation would further reduce the evidence of development, and no evidence is expected to be visible several years after rehabilitation. Special Features or Values—Since no special features or values have been identified for the Clear Creek Roadless Area, implementing Alternatives B, C, or D would cause no effect to this category of wilderness characteristics. Opportunities for Solitude and Primitive Unconfined Recreation—Opportunities for solitude and primitive unconfined recreation would be temporarily affected during implementation of the prescribed fire. Trails 130 and 728 would likely be temporarily closed to allow for safe implementation of the burn. During ignition, sights and sounds of helicopters would likely be heard throughout the Roadless Area, although these disturbances would be expected to last only a short time. Crews operating pumps, hoses, and chainsaws would have less effect on solitude and unconfined recreation, since their activities would be confined to a small area immediately adjacent to the private property boundary in the westernmost portion of the Roadless Area. After implementation, the opportunities for solitude and primitive unconfined recreation would remain unchanged from their current state. Manageability—No effect to the manageability of the Roadless Area would result from implementation of Alternatives B, C, or D. None of the activities proposed in any of these alternatives would have an effect on the current or future location of the Roadless Area boundary. 3.4.4.2 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects boundary for this analysis is the Clear Creek Roadless Area. This boundary was selected because roadless areas are generally the pool from which future wilderness designations occur. The Clear Creek Roadless Area was proposed for wilderness designation in H.R. 3334, the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act. A forward-looking timeline to measure cumulative effects is difficult to establish, as wilderness designations can be a lengthy political process. However, if the area were designated as Wilderness, it might reasonably be expected to receive higher than ordinary use, given its close proximity to towns and relative ease of access. As pointed out above, the Clear Creek Roadless Area has shrunk by almost 15,000 acres since 1979 as a result of timber sales. The current Roadless Area boundary is imprecise and drawn to exclude timber sale areas. With the exception of prescribed fire, none of the activities proposed in Alternatives B, C, or D would affect, alter, or infringe upon the current Roadless Area boundary or have an effect on the wilderness values inside the Roadless Area. Management of naturally occurring wildfire to benefit resources in this Roadless Area is not likely to be pursued or promoted in future land management planning, due to the area’s close proximity to private lands and managed timberlands. Fire suppression is likely to continue. The prescribed fire proposed within the Clear Creek Roadless Area would sustain disturbance in a disturbance-dependent landscape, resulting in a beneficial cumulative effect to the natural qualities of the area. Because the implementation of Alternatives B, C, or D will have no effect, limited temporary effects, or beneficial effects to the wilderness characteristics of the area, the project will not alter the area’s potential to be considered for future wilderness designation. 3.5 SOILS This report summarizes the effects of the alternatives on the soils resource. This section was summarized from the “Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project Soils Report,” located in the project record.  Analysis Area 3.5.1The areas assessed for soils concerns are the individual treatment units (variable acres) and associated skid trails, landings, and temporary roads within the 43,700-acre project area.  Regulatory Framework 3.5.2Forest Plan direction and the following federal and State laws and regulations pertaining to the management of soil resources would be applied to the project: • FSM 2500 Watershed and Air Management – Washington Office (WO) Amendments 2500-2010-1 and 2500-2010-2 and Northern Region (R1) Supplement 2500-99-1 (Regional Soil Quality Standards) • Soil and Water Conservation Practices (SWCPs) Handbook - FSH 2509.22 • Idaho Forestry BMPs • Idaho Forest Practices Act (1974) • National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA) 3.5.2.1 Nez Perce Forest Plan 3.5.2.1.1 Forest Plan Amendment The Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987b) determined that for any project, soil productivity will have been maintained and any irreversible impacts to the soil resource will have been minimized (USDA Forest Service 1987b, p. II-2, Goal 18). Forest Plan Soil Quality Standard #2 (II-22) would be amended for Alternatives B, C, and D. This site-specific amendment for lands within the project area would replace the Forest Plan standard of 20% DSD with the Region 1 Soil Quality Standards listed below. The amendment would allow the project to proceed with the treatment of 3 units that currently exceed the 20% standard; in addition, the amendment would allow for the implementation of soil improvement activities. Region 1 Soil Quality Standards (FSM 2500 Supplement 2500-99-1) specify that at least 85% of an Activity Area (defined as a land area affected by a management activity) must have soil that is in satisfactory condition. In other words, detrimental impacts (including past management impacts) must affect <15% of an Activity Area. In areas where <15% detrimental soil conditions exist from prior activities, the cumulative detrimental effect of the current activity following project implementation and restoration must not exceed 15%. Where detrimental soil conditions from past activities affect more than 15% of the Activity Area, the cumulative DSD from project implementation and past activities shall not exceed the conditions prior to the planned activity and shall provide a net improvement in soil quality. 3.5.2.1.2 Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Law The Clear Creek project was designed to meet the standards set forth in the Idaho Forest Practices Act, FSM 2500—Watershed and Air Management and Northern Region (R1) Supplement 2500-99-1 (Regional Soil Quality Standards), and the FSH of SWCP (FSH 2509.22). The project complies with NFMA 16 USC 1604(g)(3)(E)(i), which states “Soil, slope or other watershed conditions will not be irreversibly damaged.” Nez Perce Forest Plan standards listed on page II-22 of the Plan would also be met, including the Forest Plan amendment for the project (Table 3-8). Table 3-8. Forest Plan compliance Standard Number Subject Summary Compliance Achieved By 1 Evaluate the potential for soil displacement, compaction, puddling, mass wasting, and surface soil erosion from ground-disturbing activities Landtype identification and evaluation Field surveys using Regional standards were conducted on each of the proposed Activity Areas (units) 2 A minimum of 85% of an Activity Area shall not be detrimentally compacted, displaced, or puddled upon completion of activities Post-project monitoring to verify compliance and to assess if additional mitigation is needed Soil improvement activities on areas with prior impacts to achieve a net improvement in soil productivity 3 Maintain sufficient ground cover to minimize rill erosion and sloughing on road cut and fill slopes and sheet erosion on other Activity Areas Project design features were developed to minimize erosion. Temporary road locations were evaluated in the field. Unit-specific design measures were developed for high subsurface erosion areas. Forest Plan Amendment (incorporates R1 soil standard) Where detrimental soil conditions from past activities affect more than 15% of the Activity Area, the cumulative detrimental soil disturbance from project implementation and past activities shall not exceed the conditions prior to the planned activity and shall provide a net improvement in soil quality Soil improvement activities on areas with prior impacts to achieve a net improvement in soil productivity Post-project monitoring to verify compliance and to assess if additional mitigation is needed    Resource Indicators 3.5.3Soil Stability and Erosion Hazard Potential—Soil erosion can result in loss of soil productivity due to surface soils moving downslope and thus removing the materials with the greatest ability to hold moisture and nutrients. Compared to the subsurface soils, surface soils in the project area contain more organic matter and have a higher volcanic ash-derived mineral content. Removal of vegetation and/or ground disturbance associated with timber harvest or fire can increase erosion on certain landtypes. Indicator: Acres of proposed harvest activity and miles of proposed temporary roads on landtypes with a high subsurface erosion hazard Soil Productivity—Past management activities in the project area have caused DSD (e.g., compaction, displacement, erosion, loss of organic matter) and decreased soil productivity. According to the Region 1 Soil Quality Standards, detrimental disturbance from management activities should not exceed 15% of an Activity Area and coarse woody material retention should be appropriate to the habitat type. In areas that exceed 15% detrimental disturbance, the combined detrimental disturbance effects of the current project (implementation and restoration) should not exceed the disturbance levels present before the activity, and activities should be directed toward a net improvement in soil quality. Indicator: Number of commercial harvest units requiring specialized project design measures to meet Regional soil standards  Analysis Methodology 3.5.4Reports and maps, aerial photos, and field reviews generated by GIS were used to analyze effects to the soil resource from the project’s proposed activities. Field sampled vegetation database (FSVeg) queries were conducted to identify past harvest activities and their time frames (see project file). All proposed harvest units were examined in the field to assess past management impacts and to evaluate potential effects to soils. Surveys following protocols outlined in the Region 1 Approach to Soils NEPA Analysis Regarding Detrimental Soil Disturbance in Forested Areas (USDA Forest Service 2009b) were conducted to determine the percentage of DSD in each of the proposed harvest units (Activity Areas). An erosion hazard assessment was used to summarize erosional characteristics based on landtype properties. This assessment described overall erosion hazards in the project area and at the unit scale to aid in the development of project design measures. Potential soil restoration opportunities throughout the project area were assessed, with a focus on old skid trails, landings, and roads. Project design features describe methods for minimizing impacts to the soil and techniques for restoring soil biophysical integrity. 3.5.4.1 Data Assumption and Limitations This methodology provides a conservative assessment of existing soil conditions (Page-Dumroese et al. 2006a), given its inherent assumptions (ocular data and soil pits). Informal comparisons found that both for single observers and between observers, category calls in this methodology have a variability of 5%. This level of survey leads to a 90%–95% confidence with error bars from 5% to 8%, depending on the amount of disturbance found. The surveys achieve statistical inference for units with either low disturbance (<7%) or moderately high disturbance (>23%) (Page-Dumroese et al. 2009). Field soil survey methodology based on visual observations can produce variable results among observers, and the confidence of results is dependent on the number of observations made in an area (Page-Dumroese et al. 2006a). The existing and estimated values for DSD are not absolute and are best used to describe the existing soil condition. The calculation of the percentage of additional DSD from a given activity is an estimate, since DSD is a combination of such factors as existing ground cover, soil texture, timing of operations, equipment used, skill of the equipment operator, the amount of wood to be removed, and sale administration. The DSD estimates for proposed project activities are mostly based on local monitoring and research results (Archer 2008; Reeves et al. 2011). The DSD estimates of proposed activities also assume that BMPs would be implemented and that soil recovery occurs over time. 3.5.4.2 Scientific Uncertainty and Controversy Site and soil productivity relies on complex chemical, physical, and climatic factors that interact within a biological framework. For any given site and soil, a change in a key soil variable (e.g., bulk density, soil loss, and nutrient availability) can lead to changes in potential soil productivity. Defining the threshold at which productivity is detrimentally disturbed is controversial. The rationale for the 15% limit of change in soil bulk density was largely based on the collective judgment of soil researchers, academics, and field practitioners, and the accepted inability to detect changes in productivity less than 15% using current monitoring methods (Powers 1990). Powers (1990) states that the soil quality guidelines are set to detect a decline in potential productivity of at least 15%. This statement does not mean that the Forest Service tolerates productivity declines at this level, but that it recognizes problems with detection limits. Soil quality standards are being studied by a cooperative research project called the North American Long-Term Soil Productivity Study (LTSP). The 5- and 10-year results were recently published (Page-Dumroese et al. 2006b; Fleming et al. 2006; Sanchez et al. 2006). The LTSP study is ongoing and provides the best available science to resource professionals. In a 10-year study, no observed reduction in tree growth occurred as a result of compaction or organic matter removal in plots with soils generally similar to those found in the project area (silt loam) (Powers et al. 2005). These results are relatively short-term and involve many site- and soil-specific factors. Future results from the ongoing study should be helpful for assessing harvest practices on soil productivity. Additional controversy surrounds the use of the term “irreversible” in the NFMA. The NFMA has guidelines that “insure that timber will be harvested from NFS lands only where soil, slope, or other watershed conditions will not be irreversibly damaged.” The DSD described in this analysis does not necessarily result in substantial and permanent impairment. DSD is reversible if the processes (organic matter accumulation, moisture, topsoil retention, and soil biota) are in place and if time is allowed for recovery. Irreversible damage to soils in the project area could result from the loss of the volcanic ash cap through erosion or removal by excavation for temporary roads and/or skid trails. Soil recovery could still occur in remaining subsurface soils, yet the exceptionally high porosity and water-holding properties of the Mazama ash cap would likely be irrecoverable.  Affected Environment 3.5.53.5.5.1 Landforms and Geology Soil characteristics in the project area vary according to slope gradient, slope aspect, parent material, texture, depth, vegetative cover, and microclimate. Landforms in the project area are mostly dissected mountain slopes (58%) and low- and moderate-relief rolling uplands (33%). The geologic substrate is primarily Belt Zone metamorphics (45%), followed by Idaho Batholith granitics (35%) and Columbia River basalt (15%). Soil parent material is primarily granitic (85%), with inclusions of basalt (8%) and sedimentary rock (3%). Surface soils are generally silty or sandy loams. The coarse fragment content in the soils is very low, generally between 5% and 10%, increasing the susceptibility of the soil to compaction and rutting from ground-based machine harvesting. More than half of the ground cover is litter; approximately 35% of the units have vegetative cover, and only 2% have bare soil. Much of the area is overlain by a mixed to intact layer of Mazama volcanic ash, ranging from 7 to 20 inches in thickness. The ash cap is thin or missing in the steeper breaklands. Ash material is physically highly favorable to root growth, being very permeable and possessing a high ability to hold moisture and nutrients. Its presence as an intact layer with little mixing is an indication of relatively stable slopes over the past 6,700 years since the ash deposition. 3.5.5.2 Landslide and Erosion Hazard Potential Landtypes are ecological land units categorized by similarities in soils, landforms, geologic substrate, geomorphic processes, and plant associations (Cleland et al. 1997). These land units have been mapped for the entire Nez Perce National Forest. Landtypes were identified for the project area to help focus field evaluations and to pinpoint any erosion hazard concerns. Landslide-prone (LSP) areas mapped on the Nez Perce National Forest are located on slopes over 60% and landtypes 50EUU and 50CUU. Areas considered highly prone to landslides comprise approximately 11% of the project area. 3.5.5.3 Soil Productivity Soils in the project area are generally silt loams, formed from loess and overlain with a moderately deep volcanic ash layer. Past natural and management activities have impacted the productivity of these soils. During the summer of 2012, field surveys were conducted on each of the proposed harvest and burn units to assess the extent of compaction, displacement, rutting, severe burning, surface erosion, loss of surface organic matter, and soil mass movements. Existing detrimental soil conditions within the units range from 0% to 22% (see project file). Soil disturbances found during the surveys included old benched roads, skid trails, dozer piling, soil displacement, rutting, and compaction. Three units exceed the 20% Forest Plan Standard; therefore, a Forest Plan amendment is needed to proceed with project activities, and the soil must be improved t so the units will be trending positive. The project area also includes 19 units that are currently over the 15% Regional Soil Quality Standard. Although not specifically addressed by a Forest Plan standard, the presence of above-ground organic matter or woody material is an important component of soil health. The retention of coarse (>3 inches in diameter) woody material is essential to maintaining soil productivity (Graham et al. 1994). Regional direction (Forest Service Manual) for organic material recommends following guidelines such as those contained in Graham et al. (1994) if more-specific local guidelines have not been developed. Graham et al. (1994) recommend 7–33 tons/acre of coarse woody material (depending on habitat type, moisture regime, and aspect). This amount should provide sufficient nutrients and organic material for soil productivity in the long term (100–300 years). Retaining existing coarse wood levels and allowing for recruitment through the natural addition of snags and/or standing trees would facilitate these benefits. Existing down woody material ranged between 0 and 43 tons/acre in units proposed for project activities, with an average of 11 tons/acre (visual observation). Litter and duff layers throughout the project area average 6 centimeters in depth. 3.5.5.4 Effectiveness of Design Features Past monitoring and research indicate that the effectiveness of the project design features would be moderate to high (Froehlich and McNabb 1983; Graham et al. 1994; Graham et al. 1999; Korband Covington 2004; Neary et al. 2008; Curran et al. 2005a, b).  Environmental Consequences 3.5.6The spatial scope for direct, indirect, and cumulative effects is the individual commercial units (variable acres) and associated temporary roads. The temporal scope for direct and indirect effects is several decades (30–50 years), covering both pre- and post-project activities. The only activities analyzed in detail are commercial harvest units and associated temporary road construction and prescribed burning. 3.5.6.1 Activities Not Analyzed in Detail Precommercial thinning: The project includes 1,890 acres of proposed precommercial thinning activities. Because precommercial thinning only utilizes hand tools and no ground-based mechanized equipment, this activity would not increase DSD in the project area. Precommercial thinning units were not surveyed. Road Maintenance and Reconstruction: Forest system roads are not considered in the determination of potential DSD (FSH 2509.18). Approximately 120 miles of road maintenance and reconstruction is proposed under Alternatives B, C, and D and would improve road drainage and reduce the risk of mass erosion. Road Decommissioning: Forest system roads are not considered in the determination of potential DSD (FSH 2509.18). Approximately 13.8 miles (55 acres) of road would be decommissioned. Road decommissioning would directly improve soil conditions by decompacting soils and adding coarse woody material and other organic matter to the existing road surface. Road decommissioning would also improve slope stability and reduce the potential risk of mass erosion from culvert failure. Under Alternative A, no road decommissioning activities would occur. Soils in these areas would remain in an unproductive condition. Restoration: Approximately 41 acres of grassland restoration is proposed. This grassland area will undergo prescribed burning and will be revegetated with native grasses and forbs. No erosion or DSD is expected. 3.5.6.2 Activities Analyzed in Detail Commercial harvest and associated temporary road construction and prescribed burning are analyzed in detail, as these activities can contribute to detrimental disturbance calculations, cause erosion, and affect soil productivity. Commercial Harvest: Alternative B proposes 8,550 acres of commercial harvest within 143 units. Alternative C proposes 8,700 acres in 145 units, and Alternative D proposes 7,530 acres in 130 units. Harvest treatments include regeneration, improvement, and commercial thinning. Both skyline yarding and ground-based skidding systems would be used to remove trees. Activity-generated slash piled along roadsides and in landings would be dispatched via sale of biomass materials, chipping, or burning. Slash within the units would be left in place or treated using prescribed burning, mastication, or machine piling and burning. Temporary Road Construction: In Alternatives B and C, approximately 36 miles of temporary roads would be constructed. Of these miles, 8.5 miles would be located on existing road templates. Alternative D proposes 18 miles of temporary roads, of which 9 miles already exist. Disturbed width for temporary roads would average 25 feet. Temporary roads would be located on low-gradient, dry ridges or upper slopes and away from water; these roads would have no stream crossings. Temporary roads are considered 100% detrimental disturbance with reduced soil productivity until vegetation, organic matter, and hydrologic function are restored. The greater disturbance associated with temporary road construction is the displacement or mixing of the topsoil, including the Mazama ash cap, during road excavation. Temporary roads would be constructed, used, and decommissioned within 1–5 years. Road decommissioning following use would promote restoration of soil structure, water infiltration, aeration, root penetrability, and soil biological activity, as observed with road decommissioning techniques used on the Nez Perce and Clearwater National Forests. These techniques would support recovery of productivity on soils disturbed by temporary roads. Prescribed Burning: Low- and mixed-severity prescribed fire is proposed on 1,370 acres in 15 units for all action alternatives. Within the proposed units, approximately 465 acres are mapped as LSP and/or susceptible to mass wasting. A design feature of no ignition in these areas (following PACFISH guidelines) would be implemented. Fire would be allowed to back into these areas. 3.5.6.3 Direct and Indirect Effects As noted above, the analysis area for direct and indirect effects of the alternatives is the 43,700-acre project area. 3.5.6.3.1 Alternative A—No Action This alternative maintains the existing condition. Alternative A would not alter the current soil erosion or landslide potential and would retain the same amount of coarse woody material, both standing and down. Existing DSD would persist with very slight natural recovery of surface layers of compacted soils. Over time, large woody debris from dead trees would fall on the ground, increasing organic matter and water-holding capacities on-site. In the absence of catastrophic fires, these trends would exist on most of the project units. Under Alternative A, no road decommissioning activities would occur that would directly improve soil conditions by decompacting soils and adding coarse woody material and other organic matter to the existing road surface. Soils in these areas would remain in a less productive condition. 3.5.6.3.2 Alternatives B, C, and D Landslide and Erosion Hazard Potential The project area has been mapped and divided into landtypes—areas featuring similar soils, hydrology, and vegetation characteristics. Soil erosion and mass wasting are natural processes, and many landtypes across the Forest have high inherent hazards of erosion, mass wasting, and landslides (NRCS 2006). These natural processes have occurred over long time periods and are fundamental factors in creating the present-day landscape. Landslide-prone (LSP) areas were identified using GIS analysis and verified in the field. For Alternative B, approximately 245 acres of LSP area are located within 21 units. Alternative C has 255 acres within 22 units, and Alternative D had 135 acres in 14 units. These LSP areas would be further delineated in the field during unit layout and would receive a PACFISH buffer. No harvest activities would occur in these areas. An erosion hazard assessment based on landtype properties was used to determine erosional characteristics of the project units and temporary roads. This assessment was used to develop project design measures to minimize erosion potential. Mass wasting, surface erosion, and subsurface soil erosion potentials were evaluated for the landtypes coinciding within the proposed harvest and burn units. (See project file for detailed information on individual units.) Surface erosion was low to moderate for all harvest units. Only 16 acres were located on landtypes rated as high for mass wasting, and these acres were located within the same areas as the LSP areas. These acres would be incorporated in the PACFISH buffered areas. Under Alternatives B and C, ground-based logging would occur on approximately 3,080 acres located in areas with high subsurface erosion potential. Under Alternative D, ground-based logging would affect 2,950 acres located in areas with a similar high risk for subsurface erosion. Generally, logging in areas with high risk for subsurface erosion is problematic only if the surface soil is removed and the subsurface and parent material is exposed. Based on past monitoring on the Clearwater Forest, an estimated average 10% of areas using ground-based logging systems are detrimentally disturbed. Using this assumption, approximately 300 acres would be utilized for skid trails and landings. Landtype erosion hazards used to assess the effects of the alternatives on soil stability and erosion potentials indicate an overall increase of erosion potential for each of the action alternatives. Surface soil loss through displacement and mixing with infertile substrata has long-lasting consequences for soil productivity. This loss occurs during temporary road construction, excavation of skid trails and landings, and displacement of soils during ground-based harvest. Even though the ash layer is not a significant source of soil nutrient content, loss of the ash layer reduces water-holding capacity and high-quality tree rooting material. Since volcanic ash is not easily replaced, these effects may be very long lasting. Design measures to reduce the potential for subsurface erosion include the following: limiting the amount of excavated skid trails and landings; fully decommissioning all excavated skid trails and landings on these landtypes; and placing large, woody material over the contoured slope for soil stabilization. For Alternatives B and C, approximately 30 miles of proposed temporary roads are located on landtypes with high subsurface erosion potential. Approximately 8.0 miles occur on already existing road templates. For Alternative D, 15 miles of temporary roads (7.5 miles existing) occur on high subsurface erosion landtypes. Location on these landtypes is often only problematic if the surface soil is removed and the subsurface material is exposed. The proposed temporary roads would be located on ridgetops and upper slopes, and only small portions would require some form of excavation. All temporary roads would be decommissioned after use, and large woody material (>3 inches in diameter) would be placed on the surface to aid in soil stability. Even if small segments in these roads cut into the subsurface material and some erosion does occur, the likelihood of sediment delivery to streams would be minimal, because temporary roads would be located on ridgetops far from stream channels. Soil Productivity Compaction, displacement, rutting, severe burning, surface erosion, loss of surface organic matter, and soil mass movements can all reduce site productivity. For the purpose of the project, proposed harvest units, temporary roads, and prescribed burn units are all considered Activity Areas. Much research has been conducted on the extent of ground disturbance from harvest activities. Disturbance has been shown to range from 4% to over 40%, depending on equipment used, method and season of operation, and silvicultural prescription (Clayton 1981; Clayton 1990; McNeeland Ballard 1992; Tepp 2002). Megahan (1980) documented that the highest amount of disturbance came from tractor yarding, with lesser amounts from skyline and aerial methods. In order to estimate the potential increase in detrimental disturbance created by proposed activities, the following assumptions were made for ground-based skidding, skyline yarding, and temporary road construction: • Detrimental soil impacts from proposed ground-based skidding are estimated at 8%–12% (average 10%) of an Activity Area based on use of designated skid trails (Archer 2008). Disturbance is generally limited to main skid trails and landings. Soil disturbance can be minimized by using existing skid trails and/or by designating the locations of new skid trails (Froehlich and Adams 1984; Froehlich and McNabb 1983). • Estimated detrimental soil impacts from proposed skyline yarding are 4% of an Activity Area, and disturbance is mostly concentrated at landings. • Impacts to soil from temporary road construction are expected to span an average width of 25 feet wherever roads are built. This estimate is based on the assumption of a running road surface 12–15 feet wide and an additional 3–6 feet, cleared of vegetation, on each side of the road, where the soil would likely be displaced and the organic litter layer disturbed and/or removed. Based on these estimates, temporary roads would affect <3% of any activity unit. • Activity-generated slash piled along roadsides and in landings would be dispatched via sale of biomass materials, chipping, or burning. Slash within units would be left in place or treated using prescribed burning, mastication, or machine piling and burning. Treatment of slash is already incorporated in the estimates discussed above, because piles occur on areas where soils are already displaced or compacted. Based on the above DSD assumptions, the proposed activities could cause soil disturbance on approximately 521 acres for Alternative B, 541 acres for Alternative C, or 502 acres for Alternative D, with the estimated increase of DSD in the harvest units ranging between 4% and 21% (see project file). The estimated increase includes skid trails, landings, and temporary roads that would be obliterated after project activities, so some measure of improvement would occur on those areas. The highest percent increase in soil disturbance occurs in units with proposed ground-based yarding methods. Some of these units have existing skid trails and landings that could be reused, thus minimizing the amount of new detrimental disturbance. Implementation of project design measures and BMPs would minimize DSD, and the decommissioning of skid trails, landings, and temporary roads would further improve soil condition. Decommissioning activities include decompaction, recontouring, adding organic matter, and seeding/planting. Soil remediation improves water infiltration, reduces potential for weed invasion, stabilizes slopes, and improves tree growth and vegetation establishment. About half of the units are below Forest standards for down large woody material due to excessive slash management after previous harvest activities. Units 107, 117, 142, and 148 (past partial cut units proposed for regeneration harvest), units 201–206, 208–212, 214–216, 220–222, 225–227, 233, 236, 304–306, 309, 310, 315–320, 322–324, 330–332, 343–351, 354, 356, 358, and 373 (past clear-cut proposed for commercial thin), and units 501 and 506 (past partial cuts proposed for improvement harvests) are lacking coarse woody material (<5 tons/acre). Units 209, 212, 213, 350, and 373 have thin litter/duff layers of <2 centimeters. Commercial thin units would retain 40%–50% of their trees (or more), providing existing and future coarse woody material, which would maintain soil stability and productivity. For regeneration and improvement units, 14–28 standing trees per acre (tpa) would be retained as individuals or in groups. In addition, 7–33 tons/acre (depending on habitat type and aspect) of down woody material would be left in the interior of each unit. Units listed above for low coarse wood material would have tree retention levels on the high end of the range to account for the lack of existing down woody material. By adhering to these design elements, the action alternatives would meet Regional soil standards for organic material by adhering to these design elements. Prescribed fire can remove organic matter from the soil or change the physical and chemical properties of soil if temperatures become too high, as in a severe burn. Underburning of drier, open stands using quick, light-severity burns that burn only top layers of duff would have minimal impacts on soils. Areas of mixed conifers where the objective is to create openings may experience more high-intensity fire, but not necessarily high-severity burns. High-severity fires can create water-repellent soils, which may result in soil erosion via mass wasting, sheet erosion, and/or gully erosion events. Mapping of local wildfires and ongoing monitoring of past prescribed burns indicate that approximately 4%–10% of the burn units would burn severely. This would be considered DSD, but the amount would meet Regional soil standards. 3.5.6.4 Cumulative Effects For the purpose of the project, proposed harvest units and associated temporary roads and prescribed burn units are considered Activity Areas. The cumulative effects areas are the same as those discussed in the section addressing direct and indirect effects. Areas affected by DSD can take several decades to recover, depending on soil texture, depth of compaction, and loss of organic material (Powers et al. 2005; Froehlich et al. 1983). This analysis considers all activities from the 1950s to the present, as well as 20–50 years into the future. Conditions in the project area are a result of both natural processes and human activities. Past management activities include permitted grazing (1960s to present), recreation, fire suppression, road building and maintenance, and previous harvest activities (1950s to 2005). Past harvest and associated road construction have caused the most impact to the soil resource. Soil disturbance from these activities was incorporated into the DSD calculations. Timber Harvest—Harvesting methods prior to the 1980s often consisted of hand felling trees, tractor skidding, machine piling of slash, and mechanical site preparation. Ground-based logging occurred on slopes exceeding 35%. Machine piling of slash often removed organic material and topsoil. Forest practices have changed over the last few decades. Project design measures, BMPs, and Forest Plan guidelines have been developed in order to reduce the extent of disturbance and maintain soil productivity. Designated skid trails, retention of woody material, operating under dry conditions, and limiting ground-based skidding activities to slopes less than 35% are now common practices. Since the 1950s, 28% of the project area has been harvested. Most harvest activities occurred between the 1960s and 1990s, with approximately 2,500 acres of intermediate harvest and 9,500 acres of regeneration harvest. The most notable effects from harvest activities were compaction, displacement, and burned areas at landings. In steeper units, impacts were more dispersed. Less steep units had linear disturbance, mostly in the form of compacted skid trails and landings. Fire—Approximately 19,490 acres (45% of the project area) have burned in the project area since 1870. Evidence of past wildfire was noted in many of the units during soil surveys. No impacts from fire suppression activities were observed. Roads—Roads also influence soil, with long-term to permanent impairment of soil productivity. Although system roads are excluded in the determination of whether projects meet Forest Plan and Regional standards, these roads are a part of the existing condition. Within the project area, approximately 180 miles or 1,100 acres of system roads occur where topsoil and subsoil have been displaced, mixed, or lost to erosion. This acreage represents about 3% of the project area. Since 1997, over 30 miles of roads have been decommissioned. The project proposes to decommission 13.8 miles of system roads. An additional 65 miles of nonsystem roads would be decommissioned under the Clear Ridge Road Decommissioning Project, which is currently under development. Grazing—Effects from grazing are moderate and tend to be highest near meadow areas, seeps, and springs. Impacts within the units are transitory (in the form of livestock trails) and are mostly on the edges of units or along old skid roads. Recreation—Recreation activities that were noted during field surveys include dispersed camping, off-highway vehicles (OHVs) and full-size vehicle use, fuelwood cutting, and hunting. Dispersed camping is generally located on already disturbed sites along system roads. Effects from recreation activities are primarily associated with full-size vehicles and OHVs using system roads during wet conditions, creating wheel ruts that concentrate water flow. Disturbance from recreation activities within harvest and burn units is anticipated to be negligible. Ongoing and foreseeable actions within the proposed Activity Areas (harvest and burn units) consist of grazing, recreation, and fire suppression. Grazing impacts could increase over a period of up to 20 years after harvest when more forage is available in the harvest units. Recreation activities are not expected to increase in the harvest units, so an increase in detrimental disturbance is not expected. Fuelwood cutting could increase after project activities, but many of the units are located along closed roads and access is limited. Fire suppression activities could increase DSD but the timing and extent of such disturbances cannot be predicted. 3.5.6.4.1 Alternative A—No Action This alternative maintains the existing condition. It would not alter the current soil erosion or landslide potential and would retain the same amount of coarse woody material, both standing and down. Existing DSD would persist with very slight natural recovery of surface layers of compacted soils. 3.5.6.4.2 Alternatives B, C, and D The cumulative effects of these Action Alternatives were based on the estimated potential of increased detrimental disturbance (based on Region 1 Supplement definitions) when added to existing disturbance and to evaluate whether the project met Regional and Forest Plan standards. The cumulative effect of past and proposed activities was determined by adding the estimated disturbance from the project (increase of 4%–21%) to the existing DSD (0%–22%). Potential cumulative DSD within the harvest units is estimated to be between 7% and 40% prior to implementation of project design measures. (See project file for detailed information on individual units.) As shown in Table 3-9, 75–78 units would require implementation of unit-specific design measures in order to meet Regional soil standards. These measures would limit the amount of increased DSD from project activities and reduce the amount of existing detrimental disturbance by obliterating existing skid trails and landings. The project would meet the Regional soil standards by limiting the extent of detrimental disturbance to <15% following project implementation or by trending positive for those units with DSD currently >15%. Table 3-9.

Methods to meet or ensure this goal may include the following: main skid trails would be located only on existing disturbed areas with minimal, one-pass trails occurring on undisturbed ground; cut-to-length forwarder systems would be used; equipment used for machine piling or mastication of activity slash would remain on designated skid trails; and logging system layout designs would limit the amount of new detrimental disturbance (portions of the unit would be dropped if the layout plan cannot reach the entire unit while staying under the 15% standard). The estimated number of acres of new disturbance has been calculated for each unit and can be found in the project file. In addition, all skid trails, landings, and temporary roads would be decommissioned. Decommissioning of skid trails and landings would directly improve soil conditions, processes, and functions in the units by decompacting soils and adding coarse woody material and other organic matter to the existing skid trails or road surfaces. Decompaction of soil would break up platy structure, increase water infiltration rates, and temporarily remove vegetation. Seed would be spread over disturbed ground to re-establish vegetative cover. Where available, duff and woody material would also be spread over the disturbed area to increase the recovery rate. Skid trail decommissioning following harvest would utilize methods similar to Forest road decommissioning methods. Improvements in soil structure, water infiltration, aeration, root penetrability, and soil biological activity have been observed on the Clearwater National Forest after road decommissioning techniques were used there. A local soil study (Lloyd et al. 2010) observed that improved infiltration rates and soil bulk densities on decommissioned roads recover to values similar to never-roaded areas at 1, 5, and 10 years following decommissioning. In this same study and time frame, soil organic matter, total carbon, and nitrogen pools and processes increased to levels similar to those found in never-roaded surfaces. The Clearwater Forest Plan Monitoring Report (USDA Forest Service 2009b) stated that road decommissioning monitoring on the Forest across a wide range of sites has documented an increase in vegetative cover from 18% the year after decommissioning to 64% at 10 years after decommissioning. Skid trail and road decommissioning following reuse would also improve slope stability and decrease long-term erosion. Soil improvement activities on existing disturbed areas are expected to accelerate soil recovery and result in immediate or near-term (approximately 1–5 years) improvement in fundamental soil properties (e.g., bulk density, infiltration rates, soil organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen). These improvement activities would also provide support for continued long-term recovery of soil functions and productivity. Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitment of Resources Loss of the volcanic ash–influenced loess through erosion or removal (excavated temporary roads and skid trails) is irretrievable. Remaining soil materials would eventually develop (over a minimum of several decades) but may lack the water- and nutrient-holding properties of volcanic ash. Small, localized areas would have reduced soil productivity until vegetation becomes reestablished and organic layers rebuild. These areas include temporary roads, skid trails, landings, and burned areas. Severely burned areas and areas with deep compaction could take decades to recover (Froehlich et al. 1983). Soil improvement activities such as decompacting soils and adding organic matter (woody material) could jump-start this process (Curren et al. 2005a, b). 3.6 VEGETATION This section summarizes the effects of the alternatives on vegetation. This section was summarized from the “Clear Creek Restoration Project Vegetation Report,” located in the project file. Historically, the primary change agent within the Clear Creek drainage was a mixed-severity fire regime with return intervals ranging from 75 years to over 300 years. Insects, disease, and humans have become the primary agents of change since fire has been absent from the area. Historic logging practices generally created small patches with regular edges that are inconsistent with natural change agents. The project is designed to utilize existing small patches of young trees to create larger patches of young trees by implementing variable retention regeneration methods, thinning through younger stands, and retaining 100% of stands in some areas. All of these activities would occur within the Focus areas. These activities were designed to create a disturbance pattern that is more in line with the size and scale of what historically would have been a mixed-severity fire regime. The location of the Focus areas was intended to utilize the existing young forest and the existing transportation system. The goals of the project are designed to promote forest health by maintaining and reestablishing long-lived, early seral species such as white pine, ponderosa pine, and western larch, which have declined significantly over the last 80 years due to white pine blister rust and lack of disturbance (Arno et al. 2000; Keane and Arno 1996). Healthy forests with ecological resilience will help provide and sustain a broad range of ecosystem services including fire/fuels, wildlife, recreation, aquatics, and commodity production. Healthy, resilient landscapes have a greater capacity to survive natural disturbances and large-scale threats to sustainability, especially under changing and uncertain future environmental conditions, such as those driven by climate change and increasing demand for human use.  Analysis Area 3.6.1The analysis area for this assessment includes only the 43,731 acres of NFS managed lands, all of which lie within the upper two-thirds of the drainage. The analysis area is ecologically and socially important for many reasons, including fish and wildlife habitat, opportunities for sustained local economic stability, protection of Nez Perce tribal treaty rights, and recreation opportunities. The analysis indicators discuss the existing conditions at treatment unit and analysis area scales. However, the existing conditions of the biophysical environment also need to be discussed at the larger spatial scale of the Middle Fork Clearwater River basin, and sometimes northern Idaho or the northwestern United States, to provide appropriate context for analyzing Clear Creek conditions. Agents of change—such as succession, weather, climate, fire, insects, and disease—must also be considered in these discussions.  Regulatory Framework 3.6.2Forest Plan direction and all federal and State laws and regulations pertaining to the management of vegetative resources on the Forest would be applied to the project, including the NFMA of 1976. In addition, diagnosis, prescription development, and forest health analysis are guided by Forest Service regulations and policy (FSH 1909.60 and 2409.17; FSM 1920, 2020, 2470, 2471, and 2472) and the Region 1 Integrated Restoration and Protection Strategy. 3.6.2.1 Nez Perce Forest Plan 3.6.2.1.1 Timber Standards Timber Standard 1. Require silvicultural examination and prescriptions before any vegetative manipulation takes place on forested lands. Final determination of the silvicultural system for areas to be harvested will be made by a certified silviculturist after an on-the-ground, site-specific analysis. All proposed treatment stands have had stand exams or have been examined on the ground by a silviculturist, wildlife biologist, and fuels specialist. All vegetative treatments will have silvicultural prescriptions approved by a certified silviculturist prior to treatment implementation. Prescriptions will consider site-specific factors as well as multiple resource objectives, NEPA decisions, other regulatory requirements and Forest Plan goals, objectives, and standards. Action alternative treatments were proposed because they balance the management, operational, silvical, and human dimension requirements and respond to the purpose and need. Timber Standard 2. Clear-cutting will not occur adjacent to previously harvested areas that are still considered openings. No harvest is being proposed adjacent to stands that would be considered an opening. All proposed harvest units that are adjacent to previously harvested stands are certified as fully stocked, and the trees are greater than 10 feet in height. Timber Standard 3. Permit timber harvest on lands classified as “unsuitable” for timber management to accomplish multiple use objectives. No harvest is being proposed on unsuitable lands. 3.6.2.1.2 Protection Standards Protection Standard 3. Minimize the impacts of the mountain pine beetle and other insect and disease infestations to the extent necessary to achieve the overall goals and objectives of this Forest Plan. Loss of the long-lived early seral components in the ecosystem is a major factor in the lack of ecological resiliency. Regeneration treatments would remove dead, dying, and at-risk vegetation, which would trend the project area toward species compositions with increased resilience. Proposed treatments would minimize adverse pest effects and maximize a range of objectives. 3.6.2.2 National Forest Management Act Vegetation Manipulation (36 CFR 219.27(b)[1]): Ensure that technology and knowledge exist to adequately restock lands within 5 years after final harvest. Restocking within 5 years of regeneration harvest is a required design item of the action alternatives. Technology and knowledge do exist to comply with this requirement. The Clearwater National Forest Forest Plan Monitoring and Evaluation Report for 2008 shows that 60% of stands harvested in 2002 have been certified, and the rest are progressing toward certification. Recent, similar monitoring data is not currently available for the Nez Perce National Forest; however, the project area is close enough to the Clearwater National Forest so that soils, habitat types, and moisture regimes are similar enough so that the Clearwater data can be used as a surrogate. The delay in certification was caused by a delay in achieving proper site preparation. This standard is met under the action alternatives. Vegetation Manipulation (36 CFR 219.27(b)[1]): Be chosen after considering potential effects on residual trees and adjacent stands. The potential short- and long-term negative effects of proposed activities on adjacent trees were considered during alternative development. Retention areas would be designed to minimize mortality during site preparation activities. Site-specific prescription modifications, such as change unit boundary, would be incorporated into the prescriptions. This standard is met under the action alternatives. Silvicultural Practices (36 CFR 219.27(c): No timber harvest, other than salvage sales or sales to protect other multiple-use values, shall occur on lands not suitable for timber production. Guidelines for determining suitability are found in the FSH (2409.13). The proposed harvest units are within the productive habitat types (as described in Cooper et al. 1991). None of the areas being proposed for treatment as part of the project are designated as unsuitable under the 1987 Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987b). This standard is met under the action alternatives. Even-aged Management (36 CFR 219.27(d): When timber is to be harvested using an even-aged management system, a determination that the system is appropriate to meet the objectives and requirements of the Forest Plan must be made. Where clear-cutting is to be used, it must be determined to be the optimum harvest method. The action alternatives propose a combination of regeneration harvests (shelterwood establishment with reserves) and prescribed burning. The regeneration harvests are even-aged regeneration harvest systems. All vegetative treatments would have prescriptions prepared by a certified silviculturist. Overall, the analysis area stands display high mortality and low growth rates. All proposed treatments meet objectives and requirements of the Forest Plan. 3.6.2.3 Forest Service Manual 2471—Harvest Cutting The size of harvest openings created by even-aged silvicultural in the Northern Region will normally be 40 acres or less. Creation of larger openings will require 60-day public review and Regional Forester approval. The public was informed during scoping that regeneration openings in excess of 40 acres were proposed for the project area. A letter of approval to exceed the 40-acre opening size, with appropriate interdisciplinary analysis and documentation, would be received from the Regional Forester prior to project decision. The action alternatives would create openings on the landscape that are closer in scale and pattern to the openings developed under historic disturbance regimes for this area. Proposed harvest openings greater than 40 acres are discussed under Patch Size in the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects section. This standard is met under all the action alternatives.  Resource Indicators 3.6.3No single indicator is a definitive measure of forest health or resilience. A healthy and resilient forest ecosystem is characterized by composition, structure, pattern, and ecological processes sustainable under current and future conditions. The basis for the forest health analysis is comparison of the existing condition and the outcome of the alternatives to the desired condition in the project area. The desired condition is specific to the project area and was developed by incorporating data from Ecological Units of the Northern Region Subsections, VRUs, the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Ecosystem Management Project, and the Selway and Middle Fork Clearwater Rivers Sub-basin Assessment. Studying historical data can reduce the chances of major future surprises (Veblen 2003). Forest composition and three characteristics of forest structure are used to assess trends toward or away from health and resilient conditions. Current conditions for these indicators were derived from legacy data Timber Stand Management and Records System (TSMRS) and FSVeg data. The effectiveness of the alternatives in addressing forest composition objectives is indicated by the following: • Percent of the project area with forest cover type dominated by the long-lived early seral species (western white pine, western larch, and ponderosa pine) compared to area dominated by grand fir and Douglas-fir (Pseudotusuga menzeseii). The effectiveness of the alternatives in addressing forest structure objectives is indicated by the following: • Percent of the project area in each stand age class. Age groups are young (0–40 years), mid-seral (41–100 years), mature (101–149 years), and old (150 years and older). Age class will be analyzed at the project area scale to allow comparison of alternatives and desired conditions at various points in time-based age class distributions by vegetation response units. • Vertical structure is used as a within-stand structural arrangement indicator. It is represented by the number of vertical layers present in a stand. Vertical structure will be compared between alternatives. The 4 vertical structure classes are single-storied, two-storied, three-storied, and continuous vertical structure. Landscape arrangement is discussed in terms of changes in patch sizes of the age classes. Comparison of current conditions and action alternatives to the desired condition is an indicator of resiliency at the project area scale.  Analysis Methodology 3.6.4This analysis relies on comparison of existing conditions to desired conditions at various spatial and temporal scales. The DFC was used for comparing the present condition of the project area and anticipated conditions under the No Action alternative and the action three alternatives over time. The interaction of successional development (as represented by habitat types in Cooper et al. 1991; USDA Forest Service 1997) and disturbances such as fire, insects, diseases, and human influences results in the species composition, structure, and landscape arrangement of an ecosystem Maps depicting habitat groups and VRUs are available in the project record. Existing conditions reflect past natural disturbances and management activities. The vegetative desired condition for the project area was developed prior to any effects analysis. It is based on multiple resource objectives, using direction from the 1987 Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987b), the proposed 2008 Plan Revision, the Selway Middle Fork Clearwater Sub-basin Assessment, and the draft Clear Creek NFMA document. 3.6.4.1 Data Sources Current vegetative conditions were summarized using a vegetation inventory model. The model uses forest stand data from FACTS, TSMRS, FSVeg, and the Most Similar Neighbor modeling program (a model that populates estimated stand data to areas without stand exams). The inventory model also uses the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) to grow all the stands to 2012 conditions, starting from the time when the stands last received a stand examination. Additionally, Region 1 Vmap data were used to further evaluate current conditions of the project area. The data were collected in 2006 and classified using the Region 1 Vegetation Council Existing Forested Vegetation Classification System. Inventory work is performed on individual stands. A stand is defined as a contiguous group of trees sufficiently uniform in species composition, arrangement of age classes, and condition on a relatively similar site (Oliver et al. 1996). The FVS model provided a variety of information that was used in the analysis, including species composition, growth over time, and fire and fuels parameters. Documentation of these FVS attributes is found in Graham et al. (1994), Dixon (2002), Crookston (1999), Frankel (1998), and McGaughey (2002). Additionally, a patch analysis derived from the Fragstats program was used to describe and compare landscape pattern, arrangement, and patch size. The patch analysis is available in the project record.  Affected Environment 3.6.53.6.5.1 Biophysical Environment Much of the vegetation in the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests is a result of the productive ash cap soils and the prevailing climatic pattern. The climate is dominated by Pacific maritime air masses and prevailing westerly winds. Within the analysis area, annual precipitation varies from 40 to 50 inches. Over 90% of the annual precipitation occurs during fall, winter, and spring months as a result of cyclonic storms in the form of a series of frontal systems moving east. The elevation of the analysis area ranges from 2,000 to 6,600 feet. 3.6.5.2 Ecological Settings and Vegetation Response Units Bailey’s ecosections were used to summarize historic vegetation information (McNab and Avers 1994). Each ecosection contains broad vegetation and topographic conditions. Local landtype classifications were used to divide each section into 3 settings, which are roughly similar to the subsections described in Ecological Units of the Northern Region: Subsections (Nesser et al. 1997). A map of potential vegetation types was used to attribute the forest cover types to the settings (Northern Region Cohesive Strategy Team 2002). The primary settings within the analysis area are Idaho Batholith Breaklands, Idaho Batholith Uplands, and Idaho Batholith Subalpine (USDA Forest Service 2006). The Subalpine setting comprises only 160 acres of the project area, and no treatments are proposed for these acres. Therefore, the Subalpine acreage will not be discussed in this analysis. Incorporated within each of the 3 settings are 7 VRUs. These units are broad ecological land sections that contain habitat type groups and terrain that have similar patterns of disturbance and successional processes. Patterns of plant community composition, age class structure, and patch size tend to fall within certain ranges for each VRU. The components used to build the VRU classification system are habitat type groups (potential vegetation), landforms, climate, and presettlement disturbance processes (such as fire regimes). The desired conditions, potential natural vegetation that could occupy the project area following a disturbance, and a discussion of successional patterns and development are presented below. . The existing conditions for age class groups are also presented to give an idea of where potential land management activities could be used to shift the project area toward desired conditions. Existing conditions are described for the year 2012 and 2017. The year 2017 was included because that is the estimated year when actual vegetative management activities would be implemented. Stands will continue to age through that time, which will result in age class shifts. Idaho Batholith—Breaklands The Breaklands are characterized by low- to mid-elevation canyons on steep south aspects. The Breaklands setting is dominated by steep slopes and deep canyon walls through which the Middle Fork and Clear Creek tributaries flow. Soils are derived from granite, border zone, and basalt geologies. Landslides and surface creep are the dominant erosion processes. The Breaklands are known for having inclusions of LSP areas and shallow soils. These characteristics make this setting more susceptible to erosion and more sensitive to disturbance. Wildfire was the primary process affecting plant succession, composition, and distribution. Steep terrain favors rapid, upslope spread of wildfires. Stand-replacing fires are more prevalent on long, steep slopes and less frequent in adjoining moist habitats. Patches on dry aspects are uneven-aged, resulting from nonlethal to mixed-severity wildfire. Patches on moist aspects are even-aged, with uniform vegetation and fuel conditions resulting from stand-replacing fires. Early seral species (shrubs, forbs, and grasses), Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and grand fir readily reestablish following wildfire episodes. VRU 3: 3,030 acres (7% of the analysis area) Desired Condition: Open stands of large ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir dominate upland habitats. Approximately 40%–60% of the landscape contains 10–25 tpa of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir older than 150 years. Mixed-severity disturbance occurs on about 10%–15% of the analysis area in any 2-decade period. Low-severity disturbances occur on up to 50% of the landscape in a decade. Old forests occur both as isolated or open-understory, large ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir (uplands) and mixed to coniferous forest (shaded or moist habitats). The desired and existing conditions for patch size, successional stage distribution, and tree size class for VRU 3 are shown in Table 3-10. Table 3-10. Desired and existing conditions for patch size, successional stage distribution, and tree size class for Vegetative Response Unit (VRU) 3 Factor Desired Conditions Existing Conditions Patch size 50–200 acres 6–183 acres 38% within size range Successional Stage Distribution (%)  Young  Mid-seral  Mature  Old-forest  No data/no survey 15%–25% 15%–35% 10%–30% 20%–50% -- 6% 66% 13% 4% 11% Tree Size Class  Non-forest  <5 inches dbh  5–8.9 inches  9–21 inches  21+ inches  No data/no survey 5%–20% 5%–30% 10%–20% 20%–40% 20%–40% -- 6% 32% 10% 15% 8% 28% (in roadless area)  The greatest departures from desired conditions in VRU 3 are the need for increases in both young- and old-forest successional stages. The action alternatives would use regeneration harvest to increase the young age class through management of the mid-seral stage, which exceeds the desired high condition by almost 1,000 acres. Commercial thinning or full retention would be used to promote healthy stands that could grow into the late- and old-forest stages. Patch sizes are on the low end of desired ranges. Proposed regeneration harvest and burning activities would increase patch sizes to better emulate natural disturbance patterns. VRU 8: 11,350 acres (26% of the analysis area) Desired Condition: Grand fir, Douglas-fir, and western redcedar dominate stands during late successional stages. Early seral stages range from relatively open to densely stocked and are usually dominated by a mix of early seral and mid-seral species, including lodgepole pine, western larch, and western white pine. Ponderosa pine, Engelmann spruce, and Pacific yew may be present. Important elements include coastal disjunct plant species, early to seral tall shrub and hardwood communities, and old-growth inclusions of western redcedar riparian habitats. Patch sizes are widely variable and result from irregular, infrequent mixed-severity fires and very infrequent stand-replacing fires throughout the landscape. Old-forest habitats dominated by shade-tolerant conifers typically occur in patches of <40 acres and are associated with topographic inclusions (benches, basins, flat ridges, and moist habitats). These smaller patches are a result of stand-replacing fires. About 50%–60% of stands originate from stand-replacing fires. Postdisturbance stands include at least 10 live tpa that are >150 years old. Relict Douglas-fir, western larch, grand fir, and ponderosa pine are common on ridges. The desired and existing conditions for patch size, successional stage distribution, and tree size class for VRU 8 are shown in Table 3-11 below. Table 3-11. Desired and existing conditions for patch size, successional stage distribution, and tree size class for Vegetative Response Unit (VRU) 8 Factor Desired Conditions Existing Conditions Patch size 300–1,500 acres 8–282 acres 0% within size range Successional Stage Distribution (%)  Young  Mid-seral  Mature  Old-forest  Private 15%–25% 20%–40% 15%–35% 10%–40% -- 9% 43% 22% 23% 2% Tree Size Class  Non-forest  <5 inches dbh  5–8.9 inches  9–21 inches  21+ inches  No data/no survey 5%–20% 5%–30% 10%–20% 20%–40% 20%–40% -- 5% 15% 4% 34% 36% old 6%  The greatest departure from desired conditions in VRU 8 is the need for an increase in young forest. The proposed action alternatives would use regeneration harvest and prescribed fire to reduce the mid-seral stage and increase patch size. VRU 12: 40 acres (<1% of the analysis area) Desired Condition: Bluebunch wheatgrass and Idaho fescue dominate dry upland habitats; shrubs dominate draws and moist inclusions. Patch sizes are limited by aspect and coniferous vegetation. Invasive forbs and grasses are reduced or eliminated. Very frequent (5- to 20-year intervals), low-severity fire maintains open grasslands and rejuvenates shrub habitats. Ponderosa pine and an occasional Douglas-fir occur incidentally. This VRU is incidental at the analysis scale because the unit comprises only 40 acres within the analysis area. All 40 acres are proposed for grassland restoration activities. Idaho Batholith—Uplands The Uplands setting is a mix of gentle-to-steep slopes that form shallow canyons. Surface soils are derived from granite, border zone, and basalt geologies. The warm, moist climate, in combination with deep volcanic ash soils, creates high site productivity for forested stands. Surface creep is the dominant erosion process; mass-wasted areas are local and uncommon. Fire was the primary landscape disturbance process affecting plant succession, composition, and distribution. The fire regime is variable due to irregular terrain that discourages rapid fire spread. This fire regime creates a mosaic of mixed- to lethal-burned uplands and nonlethal or unburned riparian habitats. Small openings created by the more frequent low- and mixed-severity fires result in a mix of tree species and ages. Stand-replacing wildfire occurs at intervals of 150–250 years or more (Kapler-Smith and Fischer 1997) and is likely associated with strong wind episodes in combination with extended drought. VRU 7: 2,570 acres (6% of the analysis area) Desired Condition: Stands are often dominated by mixed occurrences of grand fir, Douglas-fir, Pacific yew, western larch, Engelmann spruce, and lodgepole pine. Western white pine may be present. The decline in white pine has led to the increase of grand fir and Douglas-fir, which have a high susceptibility to root diseases. Pacific yew and moist old-growth are important elements. About 20%–40% of stands originate from mixed-severity disturbances, and 60%–80% originate from stand-replacing disturbances. Postdisturbance stands include at least 10 live tpa that are >150 years old. Two or more age classes are common in any given stand. The desired and existing conditions for patch size, successional stage distribution, and tree size class for VRU 7 are shown in Table 3-12. Table 3-12. Desired and existing conditions for patch size, successional stage distribution, and tree size class for Vegetative Response Unit (VRU) 7 Factor Desired Conditions Existing Conditions Patch size 40–300 acres 1–282 acres 20% within size range Successional Stage Distribution (%)  Young  Mid-seral  Mature  Old-forest  Private 10%–20% 15%–35% 10%–30% 35%–65% -- 26% 25% 28% 20% 2% Tree size class  Non-forest  <5 inches dbh  5–8.9 inches  9–21 inches  21+ inches 1%–10% 5%–20% 10%–25% 25%–35% 35%–45% 2% 27% 10% 16% 46%  The greatest departure from desired conditions in VRU 7 is the need for an increase in old forests. The young-forest stage is in excess of the desired high condition by 150 acres. The action alternatives would use regeneration harvest to create young forests and would implement commercial and precommercial thinning to promote healthy stands (by selecting for preferred, long-lived species and reducing stand densities to reduce competition for light, water, and nutrients). Thinning would help the stands progress toward the older age classes. VRU 10: 5,170 acres (12% of the analysis area) Desired Condition: Open-canopied, multi-aged old-forest stands of grand fir, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, western redcedar, and Sitka alder are the dominant cover types. Isolated Douglas-fir, western larch, lodgepole pine, and Pacific yew locally occur on ridges. Mixed alder, forbs, and grasses are well distributed and persistent as inclusions. Multi-aged, mixed-species stands originate from low- and mixed-severity disturbances, including windthrow. Old-forest habitats are dominated by shade-tolerant conifers associated with moist habitats. The desired and existing conditions for patch size, successional stage distribution, and tree size class for VRU 10 are shown in Table 3-13. Table 3-13. Desired and existing conditions for patch size, successional stage distribution, and tree size class for Vegetative Response Unit (VRU) 10 Factor Desired Conditions Existing Conditions Patch size 40–800 acres  5–282 acres 24% within size range Successional Stage Distribution (%) Young  Mid-seral  Mature  Old-forest 10%–20% 10%–30% 10%–30% 35%–65% 9% 18% 15% 58% Tree Size Class  Non-forest  <5 inches dbh  5–8.9 inches  9–21 inches  21+ inches  Unknown/no survey data 1%–10% 5%–20% 10%–25% 25%–35% 35%–45% -- 0.1% 10% 0.1% 38% 40% 12%  The greatest departure from desired conditions in VRU 10 is the need for a slight increase in the young forest. Old forest occurs near the top end of desired condition. As expected, mortality from insects, disease, and old age is becoming more evident in these stands as they mature. Proposed regeneration harvest would be used to reduce the old-forest component while increasing the young forest. Proposed commercial thinning in the mid-seral forests would promote healthy, vigorously growing stands. VRU 17: 20,485 acres (47% of the analysis area) Desired Condition: Western redcedar and grand fir are the dominant mature forest cover types in the absence of disturbance. With stand reinitiation, Douglas-fir, western white pine, and western larch occur as isolated relics in mature and old stands. The decline in white pine has led to the increase of grand fir and Douglas-fir, which have a high susceptibility to root diseases. Open-canopied, multi-aged old forest and tall shrub communities are important elements. About 40%–60% of stands evolve with mixed-severity disturbances, and 40%–60% develop following stand-replacing disturbances. Postdisturbance stands include at least 10 live tpa that are >150 years old. Old-forest habitats are dominated by shade-tolerant western redcedar and grand fir. The desired and existing conditions for patch size, successional stage distribution, and tree size class for VRU 17 are shown in Table 3-14. Table 3-14.

Proposed precommercial thinning in young forest and commercial thinning in mid-seral forests would promote healthy stands as they continue to grow into the late- and old-forest stages. Regeneration harvest would be used to increase patch sizes to more natural levels and to maintain desired levels within 5 years. 3.6.5.1 Vegetative Agents of Change Vegetation is a fundamental part of terrestrial ecosystems. The vegetation that exists across an ecosystem and through time is a function of the physical state, the climate, the plant species available in an area, the disturbance history of the site, and the successional processes that follow disturbance. Most landscapes are a mosaic reflecting the interaction between disturbance and plant succession. The interaction between disturbance forces and successional processes is a keystone process shaping the landscape vegetation mosaic (Zack and Morgan 1994). Understanding disturbance and succession and how they relate to forest composition is necessary to understand the current vegetative state. Additionally, timber harvest has created disturbances to successional patterns 3.6.5.1.1 Weather While fires can create dramatic changes to successional development and the ecosystem, weather continually modifies the ecosystem. Moisture and temperature are important to characterize the biophysical environment. Weather disturbances (such as wind events, periods of high moisture, or drought) adjust species composition, structure (at the fine and coarse scale), and function (growth; conditions conducive for insect, disease, or fire mortality) consistently throughout successional development. Weather is not predictable in terms of ecological timing or landscape arrangement, but it has continual and important influence. Examples of weather-related influences include changes in composition and structure due to an ice/wind storm, extended drought creating conditions conducive to bark beetle infestation (mountain pine beetle currently occurring at higher elevations), and the survival of regeneration based on occurrence of a series of moist or droughty years. As discussions move from weather (atmospheric conditions over a short period of time) to climate (how the atmosphere behaves over long periods of time), the continual effects of moisture, temperature, and weather disturbances define the environment and therefore the compositions, structures, and function of the ecosystem. 3.6.5.1.2 Climate Change Climate change and management of natural resources with a changing climate are both science and social issues. Managing in the face of climate change is a common forest management question, both in terms of the effect climate change will have on the managed ecosystem and the effect the Proposed Action may have on the climate. The Forest Service has been involved in climate change research for about 2 decades and has a century of science and management experience. The Forest Service has stated its objective regarding climate change as follows: The aim is to reestablish and retain ecological resilience of NFS lands and associated resources to achieve sustainable management and provide a broad range of ecosystem services. Healthy, resilient landscapes will have greater capacity to survive natural disturbances and large scale threats to sustainability, especially under changing and uncertain future environmental conditions, such as those driven by climate change and increasing human uses (Forest Service Manual 2020.2). The future of forest management in a changing climate is best addressed with approaches that embrace strategic flexibility, characterized by risk-taking, the capacity to reassess conditions frequently, and willingness to change course as conditions change (Hobbs et al. 2006 from Millar et al. 2007). The appropriate approach is an integrated strategy involving a scientific and social climate change approach that considers predictions/scenarios specific to the local ecosystem as well as analysis of specific ecosystem responses. The Washington Climate Change Impacts Assessment2 is the most recent and area-specific tool available to understand potential changes in northern Idaho. Until more scientific details for this approach are available, a conservative forest management approach is reasonable; a conservative approach is based on diversity and resilience and can be adjusted in the short, middle, and long terms (adaptive management). This is the basis for proposed treatments in the Clear Creek project area. 2 http://cses.washington.edu/cig/pnwc/pnwc.shtml 3.6.5.1.3 Fire Fire Severity • Nonlethal fires – fires that kill 10% or less of the dominant tree canopy. A much larger percentage of small, understory trees, shrubs, and forbs may be burned back to the ground lines. • Mixed-severity fires – fires that kill more than 10% but less than 90% of the dominant tree canopy. These fires are commonly patch, irregular burns, producing a mosaic of different burn severities. • Lethal fires – fires that kill 90% or more of the dominant tree canopy. These are often called stand-replacing fires, and they often burn with high severity. They are commonly crown fires. While forests can be disturbed by weather, insects, and microorganisms, all of these interact with fire. Fire can release a large amount of energy in short periods of time, which is why fire is one of nature’s most powerful disturbance forces. During summer, the Clear Creek watershed experiences significant dry periods when vegetation can sustain fires. Lightning was probably the primary ignition source prior to Euro-American settlement. Lightning and human causes are the present-day ignition sources. Fire suppression was considered to be effective at the landscape scale in the 1930s. Understanding fire as an agent of change allows understanding of the functional interactions in a healthy, sustainable ecosystem. Understanding past fire disturbance or vegetation scenarios for an area allows increased understanding of the area’s resilience and sustainability. Data from the predominant VRUs within the project area (VRUs 8 and 17), combined with the analysis done for the Clear Creek watershed assessments, indicate that only the lethal, very infrequent (151- to 300-year interval) fire regime is still operating. The nonlethal underburning fire regime no longer occurs, due to fire suppression efforts. Fires that start under underburning conditions are usually extinguished at <1 acre in size. The mid-seral successional stages are, therefore, denser and more uniform over the landscape than those that would have occurred historically. For a more detailed discussion of fire ecology, refer to the fire/fuels specialist report. 3.6.5.1.4 Insects and Disease In the absence of fire, forest insects and diseases can accelerate or reset forest succession by affecting tree species, size, and stand density. Functions of pathogens and insects in forests can be divided into 2 parts: the action, such as killing trees, decaying heartwood, or reducing growth; and the outcome, such as changing species composition of stands or changing stand structure from a mature, closed canopy to a pole-size, low-density structure (USDA Forest Service 2000). Based on summarized species composition, tree diameters, and age classes from Vmap and FSVeg, approximately 76% of the project area may currently be susceptible to insect and disease activity. This level of susceptibility is important because over the last 75 years, insects and disease have replaced fire as the most prominent agent of change. Root Diseases—Historically, root diseases were a significant factor in reducing subalpine fir and grand fir, which tended to outcompete western larch and, on some sites, white pine. Grand fir regenerated readily in the early stages of stand development but dropped out as a significant component due to high rates of mortality caused by root disease (Byler and Zimmer-Grove 1990). White pine and larch have a higher level of resistance to root diseases at this stage of stand development and were able to capitalize on the increased availability of growing space. Fire exclusion and the loss of these species through logging, blister rust, and mountain pine beetle have reduced the opportunity for early seral species to become established in root disease areas (Harvey et al. 2008). Insects: Major insect change agents of the Clear Creek watershed include mountain pine beetle, Douglas-fir beetle, Douglas-fir tussock moth, and fir engravers. Historically, mountain pine beetle played an important successional role in mature white pine or lodgepole forests; the presence of mountain pine beetle led to various significant changes, including altered species composition and widespread tree mortality that resulted in fuel buildup and increased fire susceptibility. Douglas-fir beetle and fir engravers have always been present throughout the Clear Creek watershed, and both have been observed in the project area over the last 10 years. The presence of root disease in many of the Douglas-fir and grand fir forest types has resulted in even higher endemic levels of the Douglas-fir beetle and the propensity for rapid beetle population buildups during favorable conditions (Lockman and Gibson 1998). Historically, short-term increases in fuel loading may have led to increased fire intensity and severity and subsequent development of openings conducive to regeneration of early seral species. In some cases, insect infestations may have contributed to large stand-replacing fires (USDA Forest Service 1998a). White Pine Blister Rust: White pine blister rust was introduced into northern Idaho and this analysis area in the early 1900s. Blister rust is a fungal disease that forms cankers on branches or stems of trees; the cankers then weaken the trees and may eventually kill them. Weakened trees also become susceptible to other disease or to insect attack. Trees were either killed or harvest was accelerated to capture anticipated loss of economic value. In addition, the young white pine component (established following the 34 fires in 1910) was highly impacted by blister rust, as these young trees had little natural resistance, if any, to the disease. The project area has experienced substantial white pine mortality. Heavy fuel loads, along with increasing amounts of grand fir, are likely a result of high numbers of white pine succumbing to blister rust. The presence of live 50- to 80-year-old white pine is an indicator of some level of natural genetic resistance to blister rust in these survivors. Natural blister rust resistance is thought to be <10%. The live white pine is an ecologically important component of the resource area, both in terms of its resistance to blister rust and because of its role as a successional component as the stands develop. 3.6.5.1.5 Harvest Logging activities were initiated in the area in the 1960s. Known past harvest in the project area has been cataloged and summarized in Table 3-15. Regeneration harvest converted mature stands into younger and to smaller size classes. Additional regeneration harvest occurred at the same time on adjacent private and State property. Table 3-15.

The existing and desired forest cover types in the project area are displayed in Table 3-16. The forest cover types in the project area are primarily mixed conifers and shrubs. The Uplands and the Breaklands have relic, long-lived early seral species (western larch and ponderosa pine) but are primarily composed of late-seral, shade-tolerant species. Some scattered western white pine remain in the project area. The presence of long-lived early seral components can be used as an indicator of forest health. These species and their composition, structure, and functions have the desired resistance (ability to prevent impacts and protect valued resources), resilience (capacity of ecosystem to return to desired conditions after disturbance), and response (ability to transition from current to new conditions). Currently the project area is well out of the desired range for these species. This change is consistent with the Upper Columbia River Basin (USDA Forest Service 1997) and the Northern Region Overview (USDA Forest Service 1998a). While the Forest Plan does not mandate management at levels of historic species compositions and structures, these are helpful reference points to understand what trends may be needed over the long term to increase resiliency in the ecosystem. 050010001500200025000-40years,YoungForest41-100years,MidSeral101-149years,LateSeral150+years,OldAcres VRU 3 Desired LowDesired HighYear 2012Year 2017Total Acres: 3,030 Table 3-16.

(1997). Fires in 1880 and 1919, as well as past timber harvesting, have created the current age class distribution within the project area. The current and desired age class distributions are in Figure 3-2 through Figure 3-6.  Figure 3-2.

Vertical structure depicts the number of vertical tree layers present in a stand (Berglund et al. 2008). The 4 vertical structure classes include single-storied (62% of the project area), two-storied (27%), three-storied (5%), and continuous (6%) vertical structure. The predominant class within the project area is the single-storied class, probably because the majority of the project area is in the stem exclusion stage. The single-storied stands will eventually enter the understory reinitiation stage and become multi-storied stands. The current condition is now within the desired range. It is desired to have dominance of single- and two-storied stands in the project area, with fewer areas of three-storied stands and continuous vertical structures. The single- and two-storied stands are favorable in terms of fuels management, and two-storied stands provide preferred habitat for some wildlife species. Landscape Arrangement The arrangement of stand size classes and vertical structures on the landscape influences the way some types of fire, insects, or wildlife will move across the landscape. Managing for connected landscapes is seen as a way to increase a landscape’s resilience and allow animal movement (and in some cases, plant movement). The creation of a vegetation mosaic, by design, allows the land manager to control, or at least ameliorate, hazards of all kinds (Brackebusch 1973). Patch size and arrangement must be considered with all management actions: retaining resilient, large size class patches is an important objective; land managers must also consider that the young patch established this decade may become the most resilient old-growth patches in 150 years. Not all disturbance agents produce the same patch and scale characteristics. Mixed-severity fire causes a different patch size and arrangement on the landscape than large stand-replacing fire or insect and disease disturbances do. The current average patch sizes and ranges are displayed in Table 3-17. The desired condition varies by VRU but on average strives for patch sizes of 50–200 acres minimum and 1,000 acres maximum, with variable tree retention and forest connectivity where possible. Table 3-17.

MA 20 “…is made up of forested lands…and occurs on a variety of landtypes. Approximately half of the area has a timber condition class of overmature sawtimber (150 years or older). The remainder of the area is comprised of immature stands (40–80 years) that will provide for replacement old-growth habitat” (USDA Forest Service 1987b, p. III-56). Data from the 2007 Forest Inventory and Analysis indicate that an estimated 13.4% of the Forest is old-growth habitat, as defined by Green et al. (2008). The lower and upper confidence interval bounds are 11% and 16.1%. The Forest meets the Forest-wide old-growth standard. The Forest Plan objectives for MA 20 are to maintain viable populations of wildlife species that are dependent on old-growth habitat. At least 10% of suitable old-growth habitat would be managed as old growth for old growth–associated species. This acreage will be distributed across the Forest in a way that ensures that at least 5%of the forested acres within major prescription watersheds of 6,000–10,000 acres will be managed as old-growth habitat (USDA Forest Service 1987b, page II-6). Appendix N of the Forest Plan describes the preferred distribution requirements and outlines an old-growth identification process: “Old growth stands should be at least 300 acres. Next best would be a core block of 150 acres with the remaining blocks of no less than 50 acres and no more than . mile away from another old growth block. If existing old-growth blocks are less than 100 acres, the stands between the old-growth blocks should be managed as an old-growth complex” (USDA Forest Service 1987b, p. N-2). Old-growth analysis areas (OGAAs) were designated across the Forest in order to maintain the minimum Forest Plan requirements for amount and distribution of old-growth habitats. The analysis area includes 7 OGAAs (Table 3-18). Two of the OGAAs are small and do not meet the Forest Plan assessment scale of 5,000–10,000 acres. OGAA 618 is 1,036 acres, and OGAA 619 is 935 acres. For this analysis, these OGAAs were combined with adjacent OGAAs to comply with Forest Plan direction. Verified old growth is defined by Green et al. (2008) in Old-Growth Forest Types of the Northern Region. Figure 3-7 and Table 3-18 show the verified old growth in each OGAA; the data derive from 2010, 2011, and 2012 stand exams and field validation. Table 3-18.

Clear Creek verified and unverified old growth The project area contains 11% verified old growth, which meets the Forest Plan standard. A total of 31 verified old-growth patches, ranging from 7 to 987 acres, exist within the OGAAs. Sixteen percent of the patches exceed the preferred 300-acre size, 28% are at least 150-acre core areas, 13% are between 50 and 150 acres, and 42% are <50 acres. Most of the small patches (<50 acres) are effectively enlarged by the adjacent RHCAs, which also provide linkages between all old-growth patches. This facilitates dispersal of old growth–associated species. Additional old-growth forest is present in each of the OGAAs but has not been verified by recent stand exams. Stand data (TSMRS) show an additional 1,722 acres (4%) over 150 years old and over 21 inches average dbh. Table 3-19 and Figure 3-7 show the unverified old growth in each OGAA. Additionally, 24% of the analysis area is contained within RHCAs, which would be managed for future old growth. Table 3-19.

Fire suppression would continue. Risk of large-scale stand-replacing fire would increase; the size or severity of such an event cannot be predicted. MA 20 and old-growth habitats would continue to be altered by natural events such as succession, insect and disease, and wildfire. Some mixed-conifer habitats would mature and develop old-growth habitat characteristics, including multiple canopies, snags, and large downed wood, which provide habitat for a variety of wildlife species. Canopy openings created when snags fall would allow sunlight to reach the forest floor, providing for shrub, forb, and grass growth, which would become forage for ungulates and small mammals. The risk of a crown fire would increase with increasing surface and ladder fuels. A wildfire would create large numbers of snags and would initiate young forest conditions. Canopy cover would be lost in varying amounts. A fire would reduce the amount of old-growth habitat available to species such as fisher, pileated woodpecker, goshawk, and American marten. If no fires occur, cumulative effects on MA 20 would be an increase in the amount of suitable old growth as stands age. A negative cumulative effect would occur in the event of a wildfire that removed old-growth habitat. Predicting the size and severity of wildfire is not possible, so the level of potential cumulative effects cannot be determined. Alternatives B, C, and D The direct, indirect, and cumulative effects are analyzed for each of the 7 OGAAs. The time frame for cumulative effects is 150 years, which is the time required for stands to develop into old-growth habitat. Forest Plan MA 20 would be allocated to 4,654 acres of verified old-growth habitat, which would meet Forest Plan old-growth standards. No treatment would occur in allocated MA 20 under any alternative; therefore, no direct effects to the resource would occur. MA 20 would continue to be altered by natural events, such as succession, insects and disease, and wildfire, under any action alternative. Habitat would remain available for fisher, American marten, pileated woodpecker, and northern goshawks (old growth–associated species). PACFISH buffers would provide for current and future old growth and would provide connectivity between old-growth patches and uplands. Thinning stands adjacent to old growth would increase their resilience to insects and disease, which would increase their survival and development into larger patches of future old growth. Stand-replacing fire risk would be reduced on 7% of the analysis area through project activities. This could benefit MA 20 by making the landscape more resilient to wildfire and reducing the likelihood of stand-replacing fire in old-growth habitat. There could be a slightly positive cumulative effect to MA 20 when combined with fire suppression. The Forest plan states, “Where possible, roads should not be located through or adjacent to old-growth stands in order to reduce human disturbance, loss of snags to firewood cutters, windthrow, and micro-climate changes” (USDA Forest Service 1987b, page N-2). Alternatives B and C build 2 miles and Alternative D builds 1mile of temporary roads through old-growth habitats. The average length is 0.1 miles. Road building would remove an average of 0.4 acres of vegetation on 17 road segments under Alternatives B and C and on 13 segments under Alternative D; the total amount of old growth disturbed by temporary roads would be 7 acres and 5 acres, respectively (or 0.1% of all verified old growth). The largest impact would be removal of large green and dead trees, but the effects would be indistinguishable when compared to natural diversity and openings in old-growth habitats. The roads would be decommissioned after use. Temporary roads would cause no cumulative effects to MA 20.  Environmental Consequences 3.6.63.6.6.1 Direct and Indirect Effects at the Treatment Unit Scale in terms of Eco-setting As noted above, the analysis area for direct and indirect effects of the alternatives is the project area. 3.6.6.1.1 Alternative A—No Action Under the No Action alternative, no project activities would be conducted to maintain forest health or maintain resiliency. Activities to restore forest vegetation or increase its resilience would not be implemented. Two general trends would be expected to occur (Cooper et al. 1991; Smith et al. 1997). The Uplands make up 65% of the project area. The short-term effects of the No Action alternative would include increased mortality of Douglas-fir and grand fir as stands continue to mature and experience in-stand competition, root diseases, and decay. In addition, insects would continue to cause deterioration of stands dominated by these species. The amount of existing early seral tree species in the project area would decline. The amount of medium and large size classes would decline as root disease and insects cause mortality. Grand fir and cedar would occupy the growing space left by the mortality of other species; stands would increasingly become dominated by grand fir and cedar (Byler and Hagle 2000). In the absence of natural disturbance such as fire, regeneration to fill gaps in the canopy would be limited to the same species of the current overstory, because white pine, western larch, and ponderosa pine will have limited seed sources. Douglas-fir would also gradually become less prevalent due to root disease and bark beetle mortality. Stands would continue to grow, and the diameters of trees would increase; however, the rate of this growth would slow as overstory trees die and are increasingly replaced by understory (smaller-diameter) trees. Canopy cover would remain about the same, as vertical structures would continue to move the remaining single- and two-storied stands to three-storied stands and continuous-storied stands due to mortality. The landscape would become more homogeneous, with continuous vertical structures and multiple ages (Byler and Hagle 2000). Stands would develop old-growth characteristics over time; however, when compared to similar areas 100 years ago, these stands would have fewer long-lived early seral species, more vertical structure, and multiple ages earlier in their successional development. The landscape would increasingly become less resilient to change or disturbances. Overall, while the numbers represented by current conditions are closest to desired conditions, the indirect effects of the No Action Alternative and the combination of species compositions, landscape arrangement, and structures would trend more areas to lesser health, less resistance, and less resilience than the current condition or desired conditions. The young age class (0–40 years) would continue to be underrepresented. Most stands currently within this age class will shift to the next age class (40–100 years) within 5 years. The Breaklands represent about 33% of the project area and contain a combination of Douglas-fir and dry grand fir habitat types, mostly on south-facing Breaklands. Indirectly, the No Action alternative would lead to increased grand fir and Douglas-fir as mortality in long-lived, early seral species continues due to competition and insects. Douglas-fir would not necessarily become less prevalent on the driest sites (because the lack of moisture limits natural regeneration of other species). Growing space opened by the Douglas-fir beetle mortality over the last decade would likely become grand fir and Douglas-fir, as that is the only seed source. This would continue as other disturbance agents cause mortality. Even if fire were to create sites for regeneration of long-lived early seral species of ponderosa pine, western larch, and western white pine, the lack of seed source would greatly limit this regeneration. The effects on stand growth rate, canopy cover, vertical structure, old-growth development, and overall stand health and resilience would be the same as the effects described for the Uplands setting, above. General Trends Common to All Eco-settings under the No Action Alternative: • A substantial decrease in the young age class within the next 5 years • An increase in multi-storied, multi-aged stands within stand structure due to the effects of root disease and bark beetles resulting from a continued absence of fire • Continued increase of shade-tolerant cover types with the loss of shade-intolerant cover types • An increase in the amount of mature structure • A decrease in overall resistance, resilience, and response to ecological disturbance agents 3.6.6.1.2 Alternatives B, C, and D Overview of Vegetative Aspects of the Proposed Action Table 3-20 displays the proposed vegetative management activities for each alternative, including activities proposed for Focus areas and activities proposed for other land within the project area. Table 3-20.

Historically, the most common fire regimes of the habitat types and VRUs located within the project area were lethal burns and mixed-severity fire (Smith and Fisher 1997). The project is designed to utilize existing small patches of young trees to create larger patches of young trees by implementing variable retention regeneration methods in appropriate adjacent stands, thinning through younger stands, and retaining 100% of the trees in some areas. Structure classes in areas designed as full retention would not change, because the harvesting would not occur and incursions of prescribed fire into these areas would be minimal and classified as low-severity. All activities would occur within the Focus areas. The activities were designed to create a disturbance pattern that is similar to the size and scale of what historically would have been a mixed-severity fire. The location of the Focus areas was intended to utilize the existing young forest and the existing transportation system. Regeneration harvest is used when stands have mortality rates that are higher than growth rates, either due to age or pathogens. Following harvest, stands receive site preparation and are reforested with long-lived early seral species that will increase resistance and resilience at the stand level and begin to trend the project area toward resistance and resilience. Management activities that favor resistant tree species on sites that are prone to or infected with root disease would be utilized (Rippy et al. 2005; Byler and Hagle 2005; Hagle 2006). Treatment priorities were based on DFCs and take into consideration the VRUs and habitat types, landscape species, and structure objectives of the project area. Components within harvest areas that meet overall objectives (desired conditions) would be retained; where not present they would be established. Variability will be substantial within treatment areas because the amount of retention would be based on available components (large trees, preferred species, etc.). Wildlife, fire/fuels, and visual concerns played a prominent part in maximizing retention on sites while trending the overall area toward the DFC. 3.6.6.2 Direct, Indirect, and Cumulative Effects of the Alternatives Indicators focus on characteristics that contribute to forest health. Indicators are compared to the desired conditions. The desired conditions would trend the landscape toward increased ecological resistance and resilience to reasonably expected disturbances (e.g., fire, insects, disease, and weather). Analysis indicators are the same for direct, indirect, and cumulative effects. Indicators to be discussed in this section include forest composition, age class, vertical structure, and patch size. Current conditions reflect all past natural disturbances and management activities, and while this discussion considers those current conditions, it will only specifically address the effects of the action alternatives. 3.6.6.2.1 Direct Effects at the Treatment Unit Scale Variable Retention Regeneration System (clear-cut with reserves) would establish and grow site-adapted western larch, white pine, and ponderosa pine while maintaining available and healthy western larch and ponderosa pine and groups of other species. Characteristics of the variable retention system units include the following: • All action alternatives would be similarly distributed on the following VRUs: VRU 3 (5%), VRU 7 (7%), VRU 8 (29%), VRU 10 (4%), and VRU 17 (55%). • Alternative B proposes 73% of the regeneration harvest in the grand fir/Douglas-fir cover type, Alternative C 78%, and Alternative D 75%. • 45% of all the treatment areas are in the 41–100 (years) age class, while 30% of the treatment areas are in the 101–149 (years) age class The treatment areas would resemble a mosaic of even-aged groups after harvest and planting activities are completed. Overall residual tree retention would range between 14 and 28 tpa, based on a 12-inch dbh tree. Retention of biological legacy trees, both as individuals and small groups of trees and as undisturbed forest patches, is consistent with the goals of variable retention harvesting as described by Franklin et al. (1997) and Franklin and Johnson (2011). Variable retention harvesting type methods have also been discussed in Graham and Jain (2005), Jain and Graham (2007), and Franklin et al. (1997).The best available representative western white pine, western larch, and ponderosa pine would be retained to serve as shelter and, in some cases, a seed source. Some level of shelter is needed on harsh sites to ensure regeneration success. Retained trees would remain over the long term for structure and would result in stands with two-storied vertical structure. Species composition would meet desired conditions following reforestation. Prescribed fire would be used to prepare sites and reduce shrub competition so that planted seedlings could be established. Prescribed fire would also reduce post-harvest fuel loading. Intermediate (Thinning) Treatments will not directly affect species composition, age class, or patch size at the unit scale. These treatments will, however, shift all the acres that have been treated to the single- or two-storied vertical structure (Table 3-21). Table 3-21.

The composition within the project area is currently high in grand fir and red cedar and low in long-lived early seral species. Existing western larch would continue to decline due to inter-stand competition, while ladder fuels would continue to accumulate around existing ponderosa pine. The action alternatives would decrease the grand fir and red cedar dominance type and maintain/increase existing long-lived early seral species while reestablishing them in areas where they are currently underrepresented. Table 3-22 and Table 3-23 represent the extent to which the action alternatives would shift species composition from the existing condition. Table 3-22.

The oldest age class is currently well represented. Managing for long-term resistance and resilience within the project area would help maintain existing structure development into the older age classes. Table 3-24 depicts the shift in the young age class, as this is the only age class that can realistically be managed. The time frame for the direct effects to occur would be within 5–10 years. Based on this temporal scale, the analysis includes the existing condition (2012) and 5 years into the future, when implementation is expected to take place. This is an important distinction, as current condition for some VRUs would show they are well within the DFC for the young age class; however, after 5 years many of the acres in the young age class shift to the next age class (leaving them outside of the DFCs). Additionally, comments from the public during scoping expressed concern about a deficit of the very young (brush and seedling) stage. This deficit is a reality, as 1,575 acres of the project area are in the 0–19 age class. VRU 10 contains minimal activity acres, which are insignificant at the resource area and VRU scales and are not shown in Table 3-24. Table 3-24. Shift in the young age class (in acres), by alternative and Vegetation Response Units (VRU) VRU Alternative A Alternative B Alternative C Alternative D Breaklands VRU 3 (Desired Range = 450–750 acres) 0–40 Age Class (2012) 195 296 371 221 0–40 Age Class (2017) 142 206 318 168  VRU 8 (Desired Range = 1,700–2,800 acres) 0–40 Age Class (2012) 1,037 2,028 2,190 1,701 0–40 Age Class (2017) 909 1,900 2,062 1,579 Uplands VRU 7 (Desired Range = 250–500 acres) 0–40 Age Class (2012) 664 917 1,091 903 0–40 Age Class (2017) 590 843 1,017 829  VRU 17 (Desired Range = 2,000–4,100 acres) 0–40 Age Class (2012) 4,177 5,430 6,526 5,409 0–40 Age Class (2017) 2,744 3,997 5,093 3,973  Vertical Structure: Vertical structure is important when describing some types of wildlife habitat, fuel ladders and fire spread, and successional development. The vertical structure of the project area is well within desired condition. Vertical structure at this scale would not be changed by the action alternatives since all treatments would maintain a single- or two-storied vertical structure. Patch Size: The desired condition strives for patch sizes from hundreds of acres up to 1,000 acres. Minimum patch sizes would be 50–500 acres, with variable retention and connectivity where possible. The current condition does not have patches of the desired size in any of the structural stages. Table 3-25 displays the shift in average patch size by successional stage. The action alternatives would decrease the later successional stages and increase early successional stages. The increase in patch size for the young-successional stage (stand initiation) would enable the establishment of long-lived early seral species where appropriate, which would increase long-term resilience and potential to desired patch sizes in the future. Locating regeneration treatments next to existing young forest leads to an increase in patch size among all of the structural classes. Table 3-25.

Alternative B proposes 2,240 acres of commercial thinning inside the Focus areas, Alternative C proposes 3,995 acres, and Alternative D proposes 2,017 acres. This management activity was designed to mimic an underburn as part of a mixed-severity fire disturbance pattern. Outside of the Focus areas, Alternatives B and C propose 3,366 acres of commercial thinning, and Alternative D proposes 3,144 acres. All action alternatives were designed to address the issue of stands not reaching the culmination of mean annual increment; the action alternatives take advantage of thinning opportunity while maintaining and improving stand growing conditions. Approximately 40%–60% of the overstory would be removed, leaving the largest, healthiest ponderosa pine, western larch, white pine, Douglas-fir, and grand fir. Treatment would result in a slight improvement in species composition compared to the No Action alternative but would not meet desired conditions. Stand structure would be much as it is now, with a reduction of the intermediate trees competing with the overstory. Fuel loading would be roughly the same, although canopy base height would be raised and canopy bulk density reduced. Mortality due to insects and disease would continue to change canopy and structure over the long term, with areas needing consideration for regeneration treatment in the next few decades. Gradual changes to growing space and conditions would favor regeneration of Douglas-fir and grand fir. Precommercial Thinning: All action alternatives allocate the same amount of acreage for precommercial thinning. The effects would be similar to the effects of commercial thinning. Early seral species would be retained, improving species composition by reducing competition and improving growing space. Approximately 200–300 tpa would remain following treatment. Improvement cutting: Improvement cutting is proposed in stands with an existing component of large, old ponderosa pine and western larch. In the absence of fire, these stands have substantial amounts of understory in-growth composed of grand fir and western redcedar. Improvement cutting would affect within-stand structure in much the same manner as commercial thinning does. The lower canopy would be reduced more than in a commercial thin, due to the focus on maintaining the large relic trees, reducing ladder fuels, and creating enough spacing to allow ground fire and prevent crown fire. This would increase the amount of air movement through the affected stands and increase the amount of sunlight reaching the forest floor relative to the existing condition of the stands. These two factors would increase the rate of drying of dead and down fuels during the summer months and may stimulate additional growth of understory herbs, shrubs, and shade-tolerant conifer regeneration. Slash and other dead and down fuels would be reduced through underburning following harvest. Underburning would also reduce ladder fuels, further increasing the distance between the ground and the base of the live overstory canopy. Improvement cutting typically increases the growth rate of the residual stand of trees. However, improvement cutting may also increase the rate of infection by root diseases in residual Douglas-fir and grand fir, because stumps and their attached root systems would become readily available for colonization by fungi that cause root disease. Included stands would have an even-aged overstory that may be uniformly distributed throughout the stand or may be clumpy and somewhat irregular where clumps of healthy white pine, western larch, or ponderosa pine are retained. Planting of ponderosa pine, western larch, and/or western white pine may occur wherever pre-harvest mortality has resulted in the development of small openings in the improvement cuts. This planting would improve the long-term species diversity of the overstory and the long-term resilience of the stand(s). Burning: See fuels specialist report. Restoration: Restoration is proposed on dry, upland grassland habitats and on moist inclusions (historically dominated by shrubs). Patch sizes are limited by aspect and coniferous vegetation. Invasive forbs and grasses have been introduced and are becoming dominant. Historically, very frequent (5- to 20-year intervals), low-severity fire maintained open grasslands and rejuvenated shrub habitats. Ponderosa pine and an occasional Douglas-fir occur incidentally. Restoration activities would include herbicide application and prescribed fire for site preparation, followed by seeding of native species. 3.6.6.3 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects analysis area will be the entire 65,000-acre Clear Creek watershed. This area includes federal, state, and private lands. Cumulative effects will be analyzed15 years after project implementation. Regeneration harvest areas would be certified stocked within 5 years. However, by 15 years, the stand would be moving out of the plantation seedling/sapling stage and establishing tree dominance at the sapling/pole stage. Past regeneration and intermediate timber harvests on the Forest were the only activities on federal lands considered for cumulative effects. No other present or foreseeable management activities on federal lands would affect vegetative composition, structure, arrangement, or disturbance types at the stand scale or at larger scales. Vegetative conditions on State and private lands were considered and reviewed using VMap. The Clear Creek watershed includes 24,235 acres of State or privately owned land, all of which is downstream from federal lands. Roughly 10,400 acres are in the grass or shrub cover type. The remainder is in a mixed grass/forest or forest cover type. Future timber harvest on forested private lands adjacent to the project area is expected. The Idaho Department of Lands (IDL) provided information regarding upcoming State and private harvest proposals. One private proposal involves harvest timber, but no acres were provided. The acres are expected to be small, since land ownership in the area appears as many houses on small (<100-acre) lots. The focus of harvesting on small, private ownerships is often salvage and/or partial harvest to remove dead/dying trees and/or trees of high economic value. The IDL is also proposing a 160-acre seed tree (regeneration) harvest directly adjacent to the Forest boundary and one of the proposed project harvest units (Unit 123). This harvest would remove most of the trees but would retain an average of 8 seed trees per acre. 3.6.6.3.1 Species Composition Alternative A—No Action The cumulative effect of this alternative would continue the long-term trends in loss of early seral species composition. This alternative would allow the continued decline of the remaining ponderosa pine and western larch present in these stands. Harvest activities on private and State lands would not contribute toward the establishment of early seral species, since both rely on natural regeneration to restock the stands. Shade-tolerant grand fir, cedar, and Douglas-fir typically regenerate on these sites. Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives All of the action alternatives trend the project area toward the DFC by creating openings large enough to establish long-lived early seral species at a scale that is large enough to measure. Alternative C trends toward the desired conditions the most, while Alternative D trends the least. Harvest activities on private and State lands would not contribute toward the establishment of early seral species, since both rely on natural regeneration to restock the stands. Shade-tolerant grand fir, cedar, and Douglas-fir typically regenerate on these sites. Therefore, no cumulative effects would occur at the analysis area scale. 3.6.6.3.2 Age Class Alternative A—No Action This alternative would have no effect on age class in the project area. The area would continue to be dominated by mid- and late-seral shade-tolerant species with a lack of young structure. Insects and disease would continue to be the major agents of change, resulting in multi-aged stands with continuous ladder fuels. Harvest on State lands would increase the young age class by 160 acres, which at the analysis scale would have no measurable effect. Since no federal activities are proposed under this alternative, no cumulative effects to age class would occur. Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives The action alternatives increase the younger age classes while reducing the mature age classes and maintaining the oldest age class. The oldest age class is currently well represented. Managing for long-term resistance and resilience within the project area would help maintain existing structures develop into the older age classes. Placement of the proposed regeneration treatments next to existing stands of young forest helps trend the analysis area toward the desired condition. Regeneration harvest on state land adds 0.2% toward the DFC for younger age class. 3.6.6.3.3 Vertical Structure Alternative A—No Action Although the vertical structure of the resource area is well within desired condition, the stands proposed for regeneration treatment are in the stem exclusion phase. They are currently transitioning into the understory reinitiation and a multilayer condition due to age and natural change agents. The No Action alternative would ultimately result in an area dominated by stands with continuous vertical structure, causing the area to eventually fall out of the range for DFCs. Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives All the action alternatives would continue to maintain the desired range for single- and two-storied stand conditions through regeneration, intermediate harvest, and precommercial thinning. Regeneration harvest on State lands would also maintain these conditions. Cumulatively, a slight positive effect to vertical structure would occur. 3.6.6.3.4 Patch Size Alternative A—No Action This alternative retains the existing patch sizes, which are and would remain, on average, small and fragmented. No activities are proposed that would alter patch size on federal lands. The proposed 160-acre IDL harvest would not contribute to increases in patch size on federal lands. Since no activities are proposed under this alternative, no cumulative effects to patch size would occur. Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives All action alternatives increase average patch size across all structural stages and reduce the number of patches overall within the area. All action alternatives trend the area toward the DFC by increasing patch size of existing older forest and increasing the representation of long-lived early seral species in new large patches. The harvesting on State land would contribute only slightly to increasing patch size in the cumulative effects analysis area by creating new openings adjacent to existing openings. 3.7 WILDLIFE This section summarizes the effects of the alternatives on the management of wildlife resources. This section was summarized from the “Clear Creek Restoration Project Wildlife Report,” located in the project file.  Analysis Area 3.7.1Direct, indirect, and cumulative effects analysis areas considered home range size, mobility, habitat requirements, habitat availability, and habitat quality of the analyzed species. In most cases, the direct, indirect and cumulative effects analysis area is the 43,700-acre project area which includes all proposed activity areas. It is large enough to assess the effects of proposed activities, but not so large as to make habitat changes undetectable. Effects were based on the acres of potential habitat treated by proposed activities. The timeframe for direct and indirect effects is 5 years, which is the estimated time needed to complete harvest activities. For old-growth, elk, and lynx predetermined analysis units were used as required by Regional or Forest Plan direction. There are 7 old growth analysis areas 7 elk analysis areas (EAAs), and a small portion (3,300 acres) of one 24,000 acre lynx analysis unit in the analysis area. The analysis area includes 43,700 acres of National Forest within the upper two-thirds of the Clear Creek drainage which includes the 9200 acres (21%) Clear Creek Roadless Area. The roadless nature of this area provides secure habitat for many species, such as wintering elk herds, which are dependent on more remote, isolated environments with relatively little human disturbance. Terrestrial environments in the area are diverse and provide habitat for many birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Wildlife habitat is dominated by grand fir and western red cedar at mid-elevations (91%). Open, dry ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forest, dry and moderately moist grand fir/Douglas-fir forest, and grasslands comprise 8% of the lower elevation, more westerly portions of the area. Cool subalpine forests in the headwaters make up the remaining 1% of the area. The primary ecological settings in the area are the Idaho Batholith Breaklands, Idaho Batholith Uplands, and Idaho Batholith Subalpine. The Subalpine setting is found on only 160 acres, has no treatments proposed in it, and will therefore not be addressed in this assessment. The Breaklands provide a variety of forest conditions that offer a mix of forage and cover for wintering big game and many forest raptors. Large trees, especially western larch, Douglas-fir, western red cedar, grand fir and some ponderosa pine, provide habitat for a variety of cavity-using species. Fires and endemic insect infestations also provide a continuous supply of standing snags for wildlife nesting and feeding. Young forests are essential for providing quality elk and white-tailed deer winter browse. Preferred browse species include redstem ceanothus, mountain maple, scouler willow, and service berry. These are associated with mixed-coniferous forests and are adapted to, and thrive following, dry-season (summer/fall) fire. North-slope habitats provide mid-seral and mature forest habitats for northern goshawk. Southerly exposed habitats provide mature, open-forest conditions for flammulated owls. Large patches of mature and old-forest habitats throughout provide nesting and foraging habitats for pileated woodpecker. Large standing/down dead wood levels typically range from 7 to 13 tons/acre. Sensitive and Management Indicator Species that would benefit the most from achieving the desired vegetation conditions on the breaklands include the flammulated owl, pygmy nuthatch, goshawk, pileated woodpecker, and elk summer and winter range. The Uplands provide young-forest habitats that offer quality elk and deer spring, summer, and fall forage. Plant communities with Pacific yew are a key moose winter browse. Moose favor mature grand fir forest habitats with a closed tree canopy and moderate snow depths. Moose also successfully forage in shrub habitats commonly following stand-initiation disturbances. Large patches of mature- and old-forest provide nesting and foraging habitats for pileated woodpecker and denning and prey habitats for fisher and American marten. Mid-seral and mature-forests provide habitat for northern goshawk. Infrequent wildfires favor the accumulation of large standing/down dead wood, which typically range from 20 to 40 tons/acre. Standing snags provide roosting habitats for several Sensitive bat species (fringed, long-legged, and long-eared myotis) as well as foraging and nesting habitat for a variety of birds. Large downed wood provides cover, foraging, and denning habitats for Sensitive western toads and ringneck snakes. Endemic populations of black-backed woodpeckers would be sustained across the landscape by dying and recently dead (less than 6 years since tree death) standing trees (USDA Forest Service 2007a). Sensitive and Management Indicator Species that would benefit from achieving the desired vegetation conditions in the Uplands include the American marten, fisher, moose, elk winter range, pileated woodpecker and goshawk.  Regulatory Framework 3.7.23.7.2.1 Nez Perce Forest Plan The 1987 Forest Plan documents goals, standards, objectives, and guidelines for managing Forest wildlife species and habitats. Project related Forest Plan wildlife standards and objectives are displayed in Table 3-26. The Proposed Action complies with the Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan requirements relevant to wildlife species and their habitats (Table 3-26). Table 3-26.

Snag standards would be met or exceeded. See Chapter 2 Design Measures. 10 Maintain or improve elk habitat at, or near, optimum levels by applying elk guidelines in key wolf areas outside wilderness. Elk forage production would increase by implementing this Project. Elk guidelines were applied to wolf habitat in the Project area. 11 Design timber harvest activities in moderate and high elk objective areas, when compatible with established fish/water quality objectives and economics, so that units at the far end of the road will be cut first. Harvest units are dispersed throughout the Analysis Area. Units at the far end of roads would be harvested first when compatible with fish/water objectives and economics (Chapter 2, Design Measures). 13 Consult with IDFG and USFWS to determine management of known or suspected initial wolf home sites. Correspondence with IDFG and USFWS occurred with this Project.

See Chapter 2, Design Measures.  3.7.2.2 Endangered Species Act of 1973 This act directs that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by federal agencies do not jeopardize the continued existence of any threatened or endangered species, or result in the adverse modification of habitat critical to these species. It is also the responsibility of the Forest Service to design activities that contribute to the recovery of listed species in accordance with recovery plans developed as directed by the ESA (50 CFR part 402). Section 9 of the ESA of 1973, as amended, requires threatened and endangered species be protected from “harm” and “harassment” wherever they occur, regardless of recovery boundaries. This Project analyzed effects to Canada lynx, the only listed wildlife species in the Project area. All Action Alternatives are consistent with the Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction (NRLMD) and are in compliance with the ESA and FSM 2670. Informal coordination with the USFWS on this Project was initiated on September 28, 2012. 3.7.2.3 National Forest Management Act This act requires the Forest Service to “provide for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area in order to meet overall multiple-use objectives (16 USC 1604(g)(3)(B)). The Forest Service’s focus for meeting the requirement of NFMA and implementing its regulations is on assessing habitat to provide for diversity of species. All alternatives would be consistent with NFMA direction for diversity of animal communities. Although the Action Alternatives analyzed in the Project may impact individual animals, the Project would not affect the viability of any species across its range. The Vegetation Section discusses the distribution of age classes (successional stages) and shows the Project area is trending toward historic distributions of each successional stage. Design measures (Chapter 2) were developed to retain elements of diversity (green trees, snags, and large down wood) in harvested areas. Additionally, there would be no timber harvest in RHCAs or MA 20 (old growth). Sensitive Species: Sensitive wildlife species are those that show evidence of a current or predicted downward trend in population numbers or habitat suitability that would substantially reduce species distribution. Federal laws and direction applicable to sensitive species include the NFMA and FSM 2670. The Forest is required to determine the potential effect of proposed activities on SS and to prepare biological evaluations. The Forest Service is bound by federal statutes (ESA, NFMA), regulations, and agency policy (FSM 2670) to conserve biological diversity on NFS lands and assure sensitive species populations do not decline or trend toward listing under the ESA. This document fulfills the requirements of the biological evaluation for sensitive species. The Proposed Actions would not affect sensitive species viability on federal lands, nor would it cause sensitive species to become federally listed as threatened or endangered. Species Viability: The Proposed Action, in combination with and within the context of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future management actions in the Analysis Area, would not affect population viability or distribution of native and desired nonnative vertebrate species on the Forest. The Draft Idaho Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy (IDFG 2005) contains information on species of concern or interest including range-wide and state-wide status and known population information. At the Forest-wide scale, this Project would not disturb, agitate or bother populations to a degree that causes, or is likely to cause, a measurable decrease in productivity by substantially interfering with normal breeding, feeding, or sheltering behavior.  Resource Indicators 3.7.3The primary indicator for direct, indirect, and cumulative effects to wildlife species is the effect to their habitat, or disturbance associated with proposed activities. Existing habitat conditions were determined by field observations, vegetation data, habitat modeling, disturbance/management history, and sighting records. Analysis indicators for species analyzed in detail are displayed in Table 3-27. Table 3-27.

The Forest Service Northern Region (R1) has identified 21 sensitive species (SS) that are suspected or known to be present on the Forest. The USFWS recognizes the Forest as secondary area, unoccupied habitat for threatened Canada lynx. Additional information for these species can be found in the Project file. The wildlife analysis identifies wildlife species and/or their habitat potentially present in the Analysis Area. Species include ESA listed, sensitive and MIS. The analysis presents the distribution, population status, and habitat ecology of each species and their existing habitat conditions. Modeling of potential habitat in the Analysis Area was conducted using GIS and was based on vegetative characteristics preferred by each species. Table 3-28 displays the habitat criteria used to identify suitable habitat for each species. Suitable habitat considered includes that necessary for breeding, nesting, rearing, and foraging activities. Suitability is based on stand characteristics such as tree species, tree size, and tree canopy cover. Other habitat quality considerations include patch size, snag numbers and size, downed wood, riparian habitat, and security areas. Stand criteria used to assess species’ habitat suitability were obtained from peer-reviewed technical literature on species specific research. Table 3-28.

This provides a broader scale context relative to the Analysis Area. This analysis uses the best available science to assess effects. Data related to vegetative features to model potential habitat, including species, age, size, density, canopy cover, and harvest history were taken from the TSMRS, FSVEG, FACTS, 2011 VMap, and LIDAR databases. The database was recently updated with stand exams that were conducted in 2011 and 2012. ArcMap GIS was used for modeling, mapping, and quantifying habitats and Project impacts. Considerable information on wildlife habitat conditions was obtained from the following four supporting documents: “Clear Creek NFMA Assessment” (USDA Forest Service 2011); “Selway and Middle Fork Clearwater Rivers Subbasin Assessment” (USDA Forest Service 2001); “Proposed Land Management Plan Nez Perce National Forest” (USDA Forest Service 2007a), and; the “Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan” (USDA Forest Service 1987b). Field review of treatment areas was conducted in 2011 and 2012. Field visits combined with National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) images were used to validate information gathered from other sources. The Idaho State Conservation Data Center (CDC) is the primary storehouse of sensitive or rare wildlife species survey and observation data. CDC data was mapped within a 5-mile radius of the Project area boundary to identify sensitive species potentially using the Project area. Old-growth habitat was identified using NRIS R1 Old-Growth Report Query based on 2011 and 2012 stand exams and field review during the same time period. The Idaho State Wildlife Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy provides background habitat and population information and is incorporated by reference (IDFG 2005). Information for bird species has been synthesized from the Northern Region Land Bird Monitoring Program with data available from the avian science center3, as well as The North American Breeding Bird Survey4 (Sauer et al. 2011). 3 http://avianscience.dbs.umt.edu/ 4 http://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/bbs.html 5 http://fishandgame.idaho.gov/ Population trend information for elk and moose was synthesized from data available from the Idaho Department of Fish and Game research reports5. This analysis incorporates the effects on terrestrial sensitive species and fulfills the requirements of the required Biological Evaluation, per direction pertaining to the FSM and streamlining process (USDA Forest Service 1995). The streamlined process for doing biological evaluations for sensitive species focuses on the following two areas: • Incorporating the Effects on Sensitive Species into the NEPA Document • Summarizing the Conclusions of Effects of the Biological Evaluations for Sensitive Species The following Regional Forester sensitive species may occur in the Project area: black-backed woodpecker, fisher, flammulated owl, fringed myotis (bat), gray wolf, long eared myotis, long-legged myotis, mountain quail, pygmy nuthatch, ringneck snake, and western toad. 3.7.4.1 Species Dropped from Detailed Analysis The following Sensitive species or MIS species were dropped from detailed analysis as suitable habitat is not present, or the project would not affect individuals or their habitats: American peregrine falcon, bald eagle, bighorn sheep, black swift, Coeur d’ Alene salamander, common loon, harlequin duck, long-billed curlew, Townsend’s big-eared bat, white-headed woodpecker, wolverine, northern Idaho ground squirrel, yellow-billed cuckoo, and grizzly bear. Detailed information on why these species were dropped can be found in the wildlife technical report in the project record. 3.7.4.2 Species Analyzed in Detail The area used for species analysis is primarily the 43,700 acres Project area scale. This scale is small enough to detect potential changes in habitat but not too large for them to be diluted beyond measure. There are several species where specifically identified analysis units are required to be used for the analysis. They include: Old Growth Analysis Areas (OGAAs), Lynx Analysis Units (LAUs), and EAAs. Fire suppression is the only future foreseeable management action that would occur in the project area and could affect species habitats. It is the only foreseeable action considered in the cumulative effects analysis for all species. All past activities are considered as part of the existing condition and there are no present activities that would affect the analyzed species. Private lands were not considered for most species because there is not enough detailed information on forest stand size, age, canopy cover, and species composition to determine whether or not suitable habitats are present for each species.  Environmental Consequences 3.7.53.7.5.1 Fringed, Long-eared, and Long-legged Myotis The fringed, long-eared, and long-legged myotis are Region 1 Sensitive species. Habitat for the fringed, long-eared, and long-legged myotis occurs in the project area. The fringed myotis is also considered a species of greatest conservation need in Idaho (IDFG 2005). All three species are known to be multiple habitat bats in regard to roosts, hibernacula and foraging habitats. They utilize caves, mines, buildings, cliff faces, bridges, exfoliating tree bark, snags, and crevices in rocks as roost and hibernacula sites. Large trees with protective bark and large snags provide the primary roosting habitat in the Analysis Area. The long-legged myotis generally occurs in forested montane regions (Harvey et al. 1999). Habitat is often relatively continuous tracts of late-successional forest. They forage throughout most of the night in and above the forest canopy (Harvey et al. 1999, Warner and Czaplewski 1984). In managed forests, the long-legged myotis avoided harvest units unless large snags and old trees were left in relatively high densities, such as in shelter woods and aggregate retention patches (Taylor 1999). These bats have been found in north central Idaho using managed forests with trees that range from 5 to 15 inches in diameter. The long-eared myotis often occurs in rocky areas in an extensive variety of habitats (Adams 2003). Individuals typically roost under bark, in tree cavities, in crevices in cliffs, or in abandoned buildings (Romin and Bosworth 2010, Harvey et al. 1999, Nagorsen and Brigham 1993). The species has been found roosting in the snags and stumps of Douglas-fir, western hemlock (Barclay and Kurta 2007), western red cedar (Arnett and Hayes 2009), and pine (Vonhof and Barclay 1997). There are 8,157 acres of suitable habitat for long-legged and long-eared bats. The fringed myotis inhabits a variety of habitats, including sagebrush steppe, grassland, and montane forests (Adams 2003, O‘Farrell and Studier 1980), primarily at middle elevations of 3,900 to 7,050 feet. It is often found in dry habitats where open areas are interspersed with mature forests, creating complex mosaics with ample edges and abundant snags (Keinath 2004). There are 192 acres of suitable habitat for fringed myotis. The reduction in the amount of large diameter trees and snags in previously harvested areas and the transition of older forests dominated by large shade-intolerant tree species toward a dense structure of smaller diameter, shade-tolerant tree species, primarily due to fire exclusion (Wisdom et al. 2000) has subsequently reduced bat roosting habitats. The change in species composition resulting from fire exclusion has slowly replaced such species as ponderosa pine, white pine and western larch, with stands trending toward smaller and younger size and age classes that are more susceptible to insects and disease before reaching maturity. These conditions have limited suitable habitat for fringed myotis in the project area. Two long-legged and 2 long-eared myotis were captured in the Analysis Area in 2006. Both locations occurred in grand fir forest older than 130 years. The fringed myotis has not been observed in the Project area but they were netted during a bat survey at Moose Creek Ranger Station in 1998. The Station is within 5 miles of the project area and it is assumed that this species could occur in the project area. Population Trends: Long-legged and long-eared myotis have a global rank of G5 (secure) and an Idaho State rank of S3 (vulnerable). The long-eared myotis is a bat of western North America and one of the most widely reported bats in northern Idaho (Romin and Bosworth 2010). The fringed myotis has a global rank of G4/G5 (apparently secure/widespread, abundant, and secure) and an Idaho State rank of S2 (imperiled). The Western Bat Working Group (1998) ranked long-eared myotis and long-legged myotis as moderate conservation concern. The present population status of fringed myotis is unknown. The Western Bat Working Group concluded that it may be uncommon or rare through most of its western range. It was one of the least common detected species during surveys in northern Idaho (Romin and Bosworth 2010). 3.7.5.1.1 Direct, Indirect, and Cumulative Effects Alternative A—No Action No timber harvest, temporary road construction, or prescribed burning would occur under Alternative A. Fire exclusion allows forests to become denser, preventing sunlight from entering potential roost sites. This alters the microclimate of roosts and limits easy access to the sites (Knight 1994; Mannan et al. 1996; Vonhof and Barclay 1997). Fire suppression would continue under this alternative and habitats would become denser, creating conditions that would promote stand-replacing fire. Wildfires can change vegetative structure and composition, altering roost habitat by removing loose, exfoliating bark and opening tree canopy. However, fires assist in snag recruitment, thus potentially providing more roost sites. This alternative could have both positive and negative impacts on long-legged, long-eared and fringed myotis. Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives For Alternatives B, C, and D, the determination for fringed, long-eared, and long-legged myotis is “may adversely impact individuals, but not likely to result in a loss of viability on the planning area, nor cause a trend to federal listing or a loss of species viability rangewide”. Forest management activities can have direct (i.e., fatality) and indirect (e.g., loss of habitat and/or changes in prey availability) impacts on bats. Roost abandonment or death can occur in the winter if bats are disturbed (Adam 2003). Alternative B and C would treat 593 acres (7%), and Alternative D would treat 406 acres (5%), of long-eared and long-legged myotis habitat through regeneration and improvement harvest. Six acres would be commercially thinned under all Alternatives. Under all Action Alternatives, landscape burning would occur on 75 acres (1%) of long-eared and long-legged myotis habitat. Alternative B and C would treat 93 acres, and Alternative D would treat 72 acres of suitable fringed myotis habitat using regeneration harvest. Under all Action Alternatives, landscape burning would occur on 53 acres of fringed myotis habitat Large tree and snag, old-growth habitat, and riparian habitat retention, would ensure that adequate snag habitat is available for myotis species through time. Timber harvest would remove roosting habitat; however retained live, dead, and legacy trees within treatment units would provide for some roosting and foraging and would provide future habitat structure through time. Regeneration harvest would also enhance herbaceous growth important for insect production and bat foraging. Long-legged myotis would likely use treated areas due to tree retention within the units. Treatments in fringed myotis habitat would create open areas but would remain adjacent to mature stands that contain snags preferred for roosting. Commercial and precommercial thinning would promote large tree growth for future roosting sites but would remove little habitat (thinned trees are generally too small in diameter for use). Design features include the retention of an average of 14–28 tpa in regeneration units, 80–100 tpa in improvement units, and 120 tpa in commercial thinning areas. Prescribed burning would be both positive and negative. It would create new snags but may reduce habitat availability by removing bark on trees or causing snags to fall. Burning would create more open areas preferred by fringed myotis resulting in slightly increased suitable habitat. 3.7.5.1.2 Cumulative Effects Alternative A—No Action There would be no cumulative effects to myotis species since cumulative effects can only arise from proposed actions when combined with past, present, and future foreseeable actions. There are no proposed actions associated with this alternative. Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives The cumulative effect area is the 43,700-acre Project area. The cumulative effects timeframe is 100 years because it would take this long to develop large snags in regeneration harvest and burning areas. Past actions have been accounted for in the existing condition. There are no present actions that would affect snags and bat roosting habitat. Fire suppression is the only future foreseeable management action that could affect snag and old growth habitats. Wildfires may be allowed to burn in the Clear Creek Roadless Area; however there is no way to determine the extent of fires that may occur. Fire suppression would continue outside the Roadless Area where snags would be created primarily through insect and disease outbreaks. These would be available for use by bats. The direct and indirect effects of the action alternatives are expected to maintain suitable bat habitat both within and outside of treatment areas. Old growth and PACFISH buffers would provide habitat during the cumulative effects time frame. Fire suppression and allowing fire to burn in the Roadless Area would also provide habitat for bats. No cumulative effects are therefore expected from the Action Alternatives when combined with fire suppression. 3.7.5.2 Black-backed Woodpecker The black-backed woodpecker is a Region 1 sensitive species. It is found in post-fire areas and in areas of insect outbreaks. They occur at highest densities in 1–6 year-old burns where there are abundant snags for nesting and beetles and wood-boring insects for feeding (Hutto 1995a, 1995b; Saab et al. 2004). Old forests allow populations to persist between fires in regions with long fire intervals. Black-backed woodpecker presence was primarily influenced by the occurrence of high severity burn patches (Hutto 1995 a,b). Nearly 180,000 acres burned on the Nez Perce Forest between 2006 and 2011. Over 155,000 acres burned in 2012. On average 20,000 acres burned per year for the last 20 years. Insect and disease activity has also been occurring since the 1980s. All of these areas provide habitat for black-backed woodpeckers. One fire burned 36 acres within the project area in 2008. No other fires have occurred that would provide highly suitable habitat. Black-back woodpecker occupancy is expected to be low as a result. Endemic populations of black-backed woodpeckers are likely sustained by dying and recently dead standing trees from localized insect and pathogen activity (USDA Forest Service 2007d), such as the tussock moth outbreak that occurred in 2011 in the upper South Fork of Clear Creek. There is an estimated 2,357 acres of suitable habitat in the Analysis Area. Population Trends: Idaho ranks this species as S3 (vulnerable). Breeding bird survey (BBS) data show a long-term upward trend of >0.25% per year since 1966 in north-central Idaho (Sauer et al. 2011). Idaho Partners in Flight estimates a population of 4000 birds in Idaho. The state-wide population objective is to increase bird numbers to 4400 (Rosenberg 2004). Field surveys targeting pileated and American three-toed woodpeckers were conducted in 2012 in the Analysis Area. One of 12 sample units detected black-backed woodpeckers. These surveys did not target black-backed woodpeckers, so this is an underestimate of black-backed woodpecker presence in the Analysis Area. No scientific evidence exists that the black-backed woodpecker is decreasing in numbers (Samson 2006) in the Northern Region. The study indicates 29,406 acres of suitable habitat are required to maintain a viable black-backed woodpecker population in Forest Service Region One. Bush and Lundberg (2008) show over 700,000 suitable acres on the Nez Perce Forest alone. As of September 22, 2012, the very active and prolonged fire season on the Nez Perce and Clearwater National Forests has created over 200,000 acres of burned habitat. There is adequate black- backed woodpecker habitat across the Forest. 3.7.5.2.1 Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action None of the proposed activities would be implemented. Tree mortality is expected to continue in the upper South Fork tussock moth outbreak area. Root disease is also prevalent in the Analysis Area and would provide a continuous supply of snags. Fire suppression would continue allowing for an increase in fuel loading. This would make the area susceptible to a stand replacing fire event which would create highly suitable black-backed woodpecker habitat. Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives For Alternatives B, C, and D, the determination is a “may adversely impact individuals, but not likely to result in a loss of viability on the planning area, nor cause a trend to federal listing or a loss of species viability rangewide” for the black-backed woodpecker. Alternatives B and C would treat 420 acre (18%), and Alternative D would treat 363 acres (15%) of black-backed suitable habitat through regeneration and improvement harvest. Regeneration harvest would remove snags where necessary for logging safety but would retain them where possible. Canopy cover would also be reduced. Regeneration harvest would reduce foraging opportunities for black backed woodpeckers. Improvement harvest would reduce canopy cover to 30%–40% which is at or just below preferred levels but would large trees and snags. Landscape burning would increase habitat on 229 acres (10%) of suitable habitat. Fire killed snags would provide foraging opportunities for up to 10 years. In general, project activities would reduce insect and disease mortality and reduce the risk of future stand-replacing forest fires on 28% to 25% of suitable habitat. This would reduce the potential quality and quantity of future habitat by reducing tree densities. Commercial and precommercial thinning would indirectly promote large tree growth for future roosting sites but would remove little habitat.  Project design features would retain live trees and snags in all harvest units that would provide limited foraging habitat. Use of the Project area by black-backed woodpeckers could continue as untreated area would continue to provide feeding and nesting habitat. Prescribed site preparation burning would cause some mortality in retained trees, also providing future feeding and nesting habitat. This effect would be greatest under Alternatives B and C because they have the greatest number of treatment acres. 3.7.5.2.2 Cumulative Effects Alternative A—No Action There would be no cumulative effects to black-backed woodpeckers since cumulative effects can only arise from proposed actions when combined with past, present, and future foreseeable actions. There are no proposed actions associated with this alternative. Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives The cumulative effect area is the 43,700-acre Project area. The cumulative effects timeframe is 150 years because it would take this long to develop habitats with high levels of snag habitat. Past actions have been accounted for in the existing condition. There are no present actions that would affect snag habitat. Fire suppression is the only future foreseeable management action that could affect snags. Wildfires may be allowed to burn in the Clear Creek Roadless Area; however there is no way to determine the extent of fires that may occur. A burn would create highly suitable woodpecker habitat for up to a decade. Fire suppression would continue outside the Roadless Area where snags would be created primarily through insect and disease outbreaks. These would be available for use by woodpeckers. The direct and indirect effects of the action alternatives are expected to maintain suitable woodpecker habitat both within and outside of treatment areas. Fire suppression and allowing fire to burn in the Roadless Area combined with the retention of old growth and other retention areas would maintain habitat for black-backed woodpeckers. No cumulative effects are therefore expected from the Action Alternatives when combined with fire suppression. 3.7.5.3 Canada Lynx The Canada lynx is a Threatened species. The NRLMD Record of Decision (ROD) amended 18 Forests Plans in Region 1. The direction of that decision applies to “mapped lynx habitat on NFS lands presently occupied by Canada Lynx, as defined by the Amended Lynx Conservation Agreement between the Forest Service and the USFWS. When National Forests are designing management actions in unoccupied mapped lynx habitat they should consider the lynx direction, especially the direction regarding linkage habitat.” (USDA Forest Service 2007c, p. 1). The NRLMD, ROD selected Alternative F, Scenario 2, which states: management direction would be incorporated into all forest plans, but would only apply to occupied habitat. Under Scenario 2, the direction should be “considered” for unoccupied units, but would not have to be followed until such time as lynx occupy the unit. The Nez Perce was considered to be unoccupied based on the best scientific information available at that time of the NRLMD Forest Plan Amendment. Currently, there are inconsistencies in the status of lynx on the Nez Perce National Forest. The Nez Perce Forest is labeled as unoccupied, yet there are historical and more recent anecdotal observations of lynx across the forest. However, these observations are not considered to be “verified” as defined by the NRLMD (USDA Forest Service 2007a, b; pg 3, pg 99-100, pg 142-143; USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2006 pg 4), nor do anecdotal sightings determine that there is reproduction or a resident population. The accuracy of a few of the lynx sightings is reputable because lynx were caught in traps and then verified by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. These trapped lynx were prior to 1999 and so any lynx documentation prior to 1999 was not considered in designation of a unit being listed as occupied or unoccupied. The accuracy of other sightings many be low due to observer bias in confusing lynx and bobcats. Due to the infrequent nature of lynx observations on the Nez Perce National Forest, there is no evidence to show that there is a resident population or reproduction. The Rocky Mountain Research Stations conducted surveys for lynx in 2007 for the Nez Perce National Forest. The surveys were conducted according to established protocols outlined in the NRLMD (Ulizio et al. 2007). The surveys conducted in 2008 (hair snare) and 2009 (winter track surveys) were reduced in size and scope due to snow conditions, limited personnel and limited funding. No lynx were detected during any of these survey efforts (2007, 2008, or 2009). Due to inconsistencies on the status of lynx on the Nez Perce NF, the USFWS sent a letter addressed to the Forest Supervisor, Rick Brazell on December 10, 2012 stating that “there is consensus that transient lynx may be present on the Nez Perce National Forest, at least occasionally”. The USFWS referenced two pieces of information to come to this conclusion: 1) Ulizio et al. (2007) that noted, “Historical sightings that may have been confirmed may be the result of transient lynx moving through the forest, but the infrequency of such reports suggests lynx are incidental to the area”, and 2) McKelvey et al. (2000) reported “numerous verified historical records from Idaho County”. The letter also stated that, “the issue of lynx occupancy on the Nez Perce National Forest is a separate but related matter that is not the focus of this letter”. Follow-up discussions with USFWS occurred on December 17, 2012 with Nez Perce National Forest personnel to assist in clarifying the letter. The USFWS stated that a Biological Assessment (BA) should be prepared and informal consultation would need to be completed with USFWS if a determination of a “May Affect, but Not Likely to Adversely Affect” determination was reached for Nez Perce National Forest projects. USFWS also clarified that this does not change the Nez Perce National Forest status as ‘unoccupied’, but further lynx surveys are needed to determine occupancy and any analysis for a BA should be focused on analyzing the project and its impacts on transient (not resident or breeding) lynx. The 2005 Canada Lynx Recovery Area map identified the Nez Perce Forest as secondary Canada lynx habitat6. In the 2009 mapping effort, the USFWS did not identify critical lynx habitat on the Forest7 (74 FR 8616 8702). The modeled lynx habitat within the analysis would be considered secondary areas that may contribute to lynx persistence by providing habitat that allows dispersing lynx to travel between core areas. The USFWS concluded that Forest vegetation management in secondary areas would provide adequate connectivity and opportunistic foraging habitat for dispersing lynx in the absence of specific habitat management direction (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2007). 6 http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/species/mammals/lynx/final%20lynx%20RecoveryOutline9-05.pdf 7 http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/species/mammals/lynx/criticalhabitat_files/AllUnitsMap.jpg The direct and indirect effects area will be assess using modeled lynx habitat in the Analysis Area (3,300 acres). The cumulative effects are assessed across the LAU 3050305, which totals 24,057 acres. The entire LAU contains modeled lynx habitat that consists of winter foraging (35%), lynx denning (34%). Of those areas, 9% is currently unsuitable lynx habitat. About 31% of the LAU is not modeled as potential lynx habitat and is referred to as non-lynx habitat. Impacts across an entire LAU are assessed, because the LAU contains enough habitat to support the home range of a female lynx and is large enough to assess the effects of proposed activities but not too large as to make habitat changes undetectable. Fourteen percent of LAU 3050305 lies within the Clear Creek analysis area. There are 3,300 acres of modeled lynx habitat within the analysis area. Of the 3,300 acres, 1,220 acres is winter foraging, 1,420 acres is denning, and 660 acres is non-lynx habitat. The denning and foraging habitat are dominated by grand fir and subalpine fir with a small component (10%) of lodgepole pine. The remainder of the Analysis area is too low in elevation and does not provide suitable habitats for lynx. The NRLMD established standards and guidelines for the management of lynx. Standards are management requirements used to meet desired conditions. Standards were used in those situations where it was desirable to provide sideboards for project activities. To deviate from a standard, a plan amendment would need to be completed. Guidelines were used for those risk factors that may have possible adverse effects to individual lynx. The NRLMD states, “When National Forests are designating management actions in unoccupied mapped lynx habitat they should consider the lynx direction.” The direction provided in the NRLMD is applied to lynx habitat at the LAU scale. In Table 3-29, the alternatives for the Clear Creek project are evaluated for consistency with the NRLMD Standards for Vegetation (VEG) Management activities and practices from the NRLMD ROD ( USDA Forest Service 2007c). Population Trends: Lynx populations occur at naturally low densities and very few museum or trapping records exist for Idaho County (McKelvey et al. 2000). No Canada lynx sighting records have been reported in the Project area (IDFG 2010). Two sightings have been recorded within 5 miles of the Analysis Area. The sightings are reasonably dated (1915 and 1992) and reported by people with unknown ability to correctly identify species (bobcat vs. lynx). Lynx surveys conducted on the Forest in 2007 found no evidence of lynx (Ulizio et al. 2007). At this time and based on new information presented by the USFWS (USFWS letter dated December 10, 2012), the Nez Perce National Forest will consider lynx to be occasionally present or transient. This does not suggest that lynx are breeding, denning, or rearing young on the Nez Perce National Forest, but that lynx may move through the Nez Perce National Forest during dispersal events. The Nez Perce National Forest is coordinating with the Rocky Mountain Research Station to conduct lynx surveys in the winter of 2013 following accepted NRLMD protocols to garner a better understanding of the status of lynx on the Nez Perce National Forest. Table 3-29. Clear Creek Project consistency with the Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction Is direction applicable to the Project and has it been met? Where direction is applicable but has not been met, explain the reason(s). ALL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACTIVITIES (ALL): The following objectives, standards, and guidelines apply to management projects in lynx habitat in lynx analysis units (LAU) and in linkage areas, subject to valid existing rights. They do not apply to wildfire suppression, or to wildland fire use. Standard ALL S1 New or expanded permanent developments and vegetation management projects must maintain habitat connectivity in an LAU and/or linkage area. No new or expanded developments are proposed. Habitat connectivity would be maintained in untreated areas of the LAU. Vegetation treatments would occur on less than 0.5%of the LAU. VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROJETS (VEG): The following objectives, standards, and guidelines apply to vegetation management projects in lynx habitat in LAU. With the exception of Objective VEG O3 that specifically concerns wildland fire use, the objectives, standards, and guidelines do not apply to wildfire suppression, wildland fire use, or removal of vegetation for permanent developments such as mineral operations, ski runs, and roads. None of the objectives, standards, or guidelines apply to linkage areas. Standard VEG S1 – Stand initiation structural stage limits Standard VEG S1 applies to all vegetation management projects that regenerate timber, except for fuel treatment projects within the wildland urban interface (WUI) as defined by HFRA, subject to the following limitation: Fuel treatment projects within the WUI that do not meet Standards VEG S1, VEG S2, VEG S5, and VEG S6 may occur on no more than 6% (cumulatively) of lynx habitat on each administrative unit (a unit is a National Forest). For fuel treatment projects within the WUI see guideline VEG G10. The Standard: Unless a broad scale assessment has been completed that substantiates different historic levels of stand initiation structural stages limit disturbance in each LAU as follows: If more than 30% of the lynx habitat in an LAU is currently in a stand initiation structural stage that does not yet provide winter snowshoe hare habitat, no additional habitat may be regenerated by vegetation management projects. No lynx habitat occurs in the WUI. At this time, only 9% of lynx habitat in the LAU 3050305 is currently unsuitable or in the stand initiation structural stage. The acres converted to a stand initiation structural stage for each of the alternatives include: 110 acres (0.5%) for Alternative B, 87 acres (0.4%) for Alternative C, and 58 acres (0.2%) for Alternative D. All activities are associated with regeneration harvest. No landscape burning occurs within the LAU. The project complies with Standard VEG S1 and is well below the 30% Threshold.  Standard VEG S2 – Limits on regeneration from timber mgmt. projects Standard VEG S2 applies to all vegetation management projects that regenerate timber, except for fuel treatment projects within the WUI as defined by HFRA The Standard: Timber management projects shall not regenerate more than 15% of lynx habitat on NFS lands in an LAU in a 10-year period. No lynx habitat occurs in the WUI. At this time, only 9% of LAU 3050305 is currently unsuitable or in the stand initiation structural stage. The acres converted to a stand initiation structural stage for each of the alternatives using regeneration harvest include: 110 acres for Alternative B, 87 acres for Alternative C, and 58 acres for Alternative D. The project complies with Standard VEG S2 and is well below the 15% Threshold. Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction Is direction applicable to the Project and has it been met? Where direction is applicable but has not been met, explain the reason(s). Guideline VEG G11 – Denning habitat Denning habitat should be distributed in each LAU in the form of pockets of large amounts of large woody debris, either down logs or root wads, or large piles of small wind thrown trees (“jack-strawed” piles). If denning habitat appears to be lacking in the LAU, then projects should be designed to retain some coarse woody debris, piles, or residual trees to provide denning habitat in the future. No treatments would occur in field verified lynx denning. Though treatments are proposed in ‘modeled’ lynx denning habitat, the habitat in treatment areas would be better described as lynx travel habitat. Vegetation treatments are not planned in the spruce-fir community or areas with an abundance of dead, down woody material. Treatments are proposed in dry community types made up of Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, grand fir, western larch, and western white pine. As a project design measure, harvest units will retain large down logs. Standard VEG S5 – Precommercial thinning limits Standard VEG S5 applies to all precommercial thinning projects, except for fuel treatment projects that use precommercial thinning as a tool within the WUI as defined by HFRA, subject to the following limitation: The Standard: Precommercial thinning projects that reduce snowshoe hare habitat may only occur from the stand initiation structural stage until the stands no longer provide winter snowshoe hare habitat Does not apply to the Clear Creek project. No precommercial thinning would occur in lynx habitat. Standard VEG S6 – Multi-storied stands & snowshoe hare horizontal cover Standard VEG S6 applies to all vegetation management projects, except for fuel treatment projects within the WUI as defined by HFRA, subject to the following limitation: The Standard: Vegetation management projects that reduce snowshoe hare habitat in multi-story, mature- or late-successional forests may occur only under certain conditions noted in the NRLMD. There would be no harvest in mature- or late-successional, multi-story hare habitat. Though treatments are proposed in ‘modeled’ lynx winter foraging habitat. The habitat in treatment areas would be better described as lynx travel habitat. Vegetation treatments are not planned in the spruce-fir community or areas with dense horizontal cover. Treatments are proposed in dry community types made up of Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, grand fir, western larch, and western white pine. Guideline VEG G1 – Lynx habitat improvement Vegetation management projects should be planned to recruit a high density of conifers, hardwoods, and shrubs where such habitat is scarce or not available. Priority should be given to stem-exclusion, closed-canopy structural stage stands for lynx or their prey (e.g., mesic, monotypic lodgepole stands). Winter snowshoe hare habitat should be near denning habitat. Regeneration harvest, prescribed burning (site prep), and planting in LAU 3050305 would recruit a high density of conifers near denning habitat. Tree retention would occur within all units to provide for future woody material. The acres converted to a stand initiation structural stage for each of the alternatives include: 110 acres (0.5%) for Alternative B, 87 acres (0.4%) for Alternative C, and 58 acres (0.2%) for Alternative D. Guideline VEG G4 – Prescribed Fire Prescribed fire activities should not create permanent travel routes that facilitate snow compaction. Constructing permanent firebreaks on ridges or saddles should be avoided. Prescribed fire associated with site preparation would not create permanent travel routes. No firebreaks are proposed in lynx habitat. Guideline VEG G5 – Habitat for alternate prey species Habitat for alternate prey species, primarily red squirrel, should be provided in each LAU. Habitat for alternate prey would remain available in mature- and old-growth forest in the LAU. Note: The only guidelines discussed are those that are affected by the project. Standards LAU S1 and Guidelines ALL G1, VEG G10 do not apply to the project and are discussed in the project record. 3.7.5.3.1 Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action This alternative would have no direct or short-term indirect effects on Canada lynx because no treatments would be conducted. Red squirrel (an alternate forage species to snowshoe hare) habitat would remain available on nearly 50% of mature and old forest in the Analysis Area and about 46% of the LAU. Over the long term (50–100 years), forest succession would continue in the analysis area, as modified by natural processes. Existing younger patches would continue to grow and mature. This succession would tend to reduce lynx foraging habitat, but would increase lynx denning habitat. If wildfires or extensive windstorms occur in the area, foraging habitat could be replenished, but these events may decrease denning habitat. Insect infestations and root disease would continue causing numerous dead trees to fall to the ground, which may provide high quality denning habitat if downed logs are densely layered. Because the events and processes that might affect forest succession (and therefore lynx habitat) in the analysis area are either unknown or highly variable in frequency and size, the long term indirect effect on lynx of Alternative 1 is not predictable. Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives All Action Alternatives are consistent with the NRLMD. The following analysis will evaluate the direct and indirect effects of the project on ‘transient’ or ‘dispersing’ lynx, or more specifically, lynx that may be incidental to the area or present during dispersal events. This analysis focuses on transient lynx since no lynx have been documented breeding on the Nez Perce National Forest. The areas that are not designated as ‘core lynx areas’ are considered ‘peripheral areas’, which are important in providing habitat to support lynx during dispersal movements or other periods, which then allow lynx to return to core areas (NRLMD, USFWS Biological Opinion, p. 59). These peripheral areas have secondary habitat and would include the Nez Perce National Forest. The lynx records in peripheral areas are sporadic and generally correspond to periods following cyclic population highs in Canada (NRMLD, USFWS Biological Opinion, p. 59). In the Biological Opinion, USFWS hypothesized that the peripheral areas may enable successful dispersal of lynx between populations or subpopulations, but the USFWS did not have enough information to clearly define the relative importance of secondary or peripheral areas and indicated that more research was necessary. It is unlikely that the proposed project would have adverse impacts to transient lynx since the Lynx Conservation Assessment and Strategy (Ruediger et al. 2000) described resident lynx as being generally tolerant of humans and their management activities in forested landscapes. There is limited information on how a dispersing lynx reacts to changes in landscape connectivity, but some conclusions can be drawn. Ruggiero et al. (2000) reported “Lynx readily move across landscapes fragmented by conventional industrial forestry” and even further, “documented lynx movements have involved crossing open valley bottoms and large rivers“, thus concluding that lynx can move long distances and are capable of these dispersal events. Although existing data was sparse, the data did not indicate that vegetation management or logging has impacted resident lynx or for that matter, transient lynx. It could be inferred that a threshold may be present for resident lynx. The thresholds established within the NRLMD for VEG S1 (30%) or VEG S2 (15%) were likely generated from this type of information. The Clear Creek alternatives maintain adequate habitat for a transient lynx and does not exceed the thresholds for VEG S1 or VEG S2, and would have minimal direct or indirect impacts on transient lynx. In treatment units, habitat connectivity may be disrupted at a local level by regeneration harvest or commercial thin treatments, but overall landscape connectivity would continue to allow lynx movements through this landscape in conjunction with riparian areas as well as in mature and old growth forests. Cumulatively, the proposed project would not regenerate more than 15% of lynx habitat in LAU 3050305 (Table 3-29). The majority of lynx winter foraging and denning habitat would be retained across the LAU. Even further, the treatments could create optimal conditions for lynx foraging and denning habitat considering that stands will be regenerated into younger stands adjacent to mature stands that may provide potential denning habitat. As recommended under Guideline VEG G1 (NRLMD, p. 4), “vegetation management should be planned to recruit a high density of conifers where such habitat is scarce….Winter snowshoe hare habitat should be near denning habitat”. In addition, potential future denning substrate would be retained in newly created early successional stages through snag, green tree, and coarse woody debris retention guidelines. The potential for a transient lynx to be present while implementation is occurring is extremely low. Project related (direct) impacts are considered negligible for transient lynx. Should a transient lynx be present in nearby areas when tree removal takes place, minor short-term disturbance impacts are possible. It could be perceived that lynx may be directly impacted by the noise and commotion created by heavy machinery, if present. Direct effects could be related to disturbance of individuals with lynx avoiding the area during implementation. If disturbance to individuals does occur, it would not significantly interrupt critical life history factors such as foraging for food, due to the difference in activity periods since lynx primarily forage at night or crepuscular periods. Further, given that project sites are localized areas that are mostly in timber management areas, minimal disturbance is anticipated. Overall, the short-term direct impacts are anticipated to be outweighed by the indirect, beneficial impacts to lynx by improving habitat quality over the mid- and long-term as discussed in the following section. No precommercial thinning would occur in lynx habitat under any alternative and complies with NRLMD VEG S5 (Table 3-29). (Reference NRLMD, ROD, p.33) Mature tree harvest and commercial thinning do not occur in multi-story stands and are consistent with NRLMD VEG S6 (Table 3-29). The higher elevations of LAU 3050305 have subalpine fir, grand fir and lodgepole pine; however there is minimal Engelmann spruce within the analysis area. The Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir community is important for lynx to meet its life history requirements (foraging and denning) as well as provide habitat structure for snowshoe hares that contribute to dense horizontal cover. As for the project area, it was stated in the vegetation section that the Subalpine setting comprises only 160 acres and has no treatments proposed. Alternatives B, C, and D propose to treat dry, lower elevation stands of grand fir and Douglas fir to promote early seral species such as ponderosa, western larch, and western white pine. The lower elevation, dry types are not considered important lynx habitat. Though treatments are proposed in modeled lynx winter foraging and denning habitat, the habitat types are relatively dry and would be better described as lynx travel habitat. The following description outlines which “modeled” habitats (winter foraging or denning) are being treated, but it should be noted that the models are not accurately predicting lynx habitat. For Alternative B, proposed commercial thinning would occur in 55 acres (4%) of foraging habitat and 2 acres (0.2%) of denning habitat. Regeneration harvest for Alternative B would occur in 7 acres (0.5%) of foraging and 103 acres (8%) in denning habitat. Under Alternative C, proposed regeneration harvest would occur in 6 acres (0.4%) of foraging and 81 acres (7%) of denning as well as commercial thinning in 55 acres (4%) in foraging and 2 acres of denning. Lastly, Alternative D proposes commercial thinning in 55 acres of foraging and 2 acres in denning as well as regeneration harvest in 2 acres of foraging and 56 acres (5%) of denning. The commercial thinning treatments would remove trees but would not reduce overstory cover significantly. Since the treatment areas would be better described as lynx travel habitat, no indirect effect to transient lynx habitat is anticipated. The regeneration harvest treatments would remove most trees and convert the stands over to a stand initiation structural stage. The acres converted to a stand initiation structural stage for each of the alternatives include: 110 acres (0.5% of the LAU) for Alternative B, 87 acres (0.4%) for Alternative C, and 58 acres (0.2%) for Alternative D. Regeneration harvest would reduce canopy cover for a transient lynx over the short-term, but over the mid and long-term regeneration harvest would provide future hare foraging habitat in 20–30 years when trees become dense and tall enough to provide cover above the snow line. None of the alternatives would impede lynx travel, exploratory movements, or dispersal through this landscape because proposed treatments occur at a small scale (<0.5% of the LAU). Though forest roads can change landscape connectivity for many wildlife species, preliminary information suggests lynx do not avoid roads (Ruggiero et al. 1994). After the Lynx Conservation Assessment and Strategy (LCAS) was published in 2005, the USFWS published a Clarification of Findings in the Federal Register commonly referred to as the Remand Notice, which stated, “We found no evidence that some activities such as forest roads, pose a threat to lynx” (USDA Forest Service 2007c, p.3). Lynx-vehicle collisions have been found on paved, high-speed highways with high volumes of traffic (e.g., reintroduced lynx in Colorado and Maine). Forest roads generally have low speeds and are gravel. The CFLRA does not allow the construction of permanent roads, thus, permanent road construction is not proposed for this Project. Any new temporary roads constructed will be recontoured after use, so a short-term loss of habitat connectivity can be anticipated, but will be restored after project is implemented. A linkage area is defined in the NRLMD, Record of Decision as “providing connectivity between blocks of lynx habitat. Linkage areas occur both within and between geographic areas, where basins, valleys, or agricultural lands separate blocks of lynx habitat, or where lynx habitat naturally narrows between blocks.” Linkages are ‘officially’ designated in collaboration with the Forest Service and USFWS to provide for connectivity across areas that are generally non-forested. The Clear Creek project area does not contain any official linkage areas. 3.7.5.3.2 Cumulative Effects Alternative A—No Action A total of 2,035 acres (9%) of lynx habitat in the LAU has been harvested or burned within the last 30 years. These areas are in the stand initiation or earlier structural stage and do not provide winter snowshoe hare habitat. Roughly 2% of these areas will become hare habitat within the next10 with the remainder to follow in up to 25 years. There would be no cumulative effect to hare or lynx habitat since there are no future foreseeable activities that would affect it. Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives For threatened species it is required under the ESA that cumulative effects are measured across state and private lands. There is no state or private lands that exist within LAU 3050305 and so no ESA cumulative effects are anticipated. For NEPA, cumulative effects can only occur when added to past, present, and future foreseeable actions. Past and proposed actions are accounted for and discussed under the direct and indirect effects sections above. All past vegetation management projects have been incorporated into the baseline information for the lynx habitat models. Fire suppression is the only future foreseeable action in the LAU; however the effects cannot be determined since the amount of potential suppression is not known. There are no cumulative effects from the project since there are no other measurable foreseeable actions and the effects to lynx habitat from the proposed actions are small (0.2% - 0.5% of the LAU). Under all action alternatives, the NRLMD standards and guidelines would continue to be met in the LAU. Existing Canada lynx habitat and snowshoe hare winter habitats are expected to remain available, well distributed and connected, within the LAU due to minimal proposed management. No measurable effects to lynx populations at the Forest or regional scale, or alteration of current population trend, are expected from any of the alternatives based on the widespread availability of suitable habitats across the Forest and region (USDA Forest Service 2007b). The proposed federal action described for Alternatives B, C, and D will have “no effect” on the Canada lynx and/or its habitat. This determination is based on: 1. All objectives, standards and guidelines in the 2007 NRLMD would be met. 2. Negligible, short-term direct effects to transient lynx may occur related to disturbance (noise and mechanize equipment) during implementation of vegetation treatment. However, over the mid and long-term any short-term impacts would be offset by the positive benefits of regenerating snowshoe hare habitat for lynx foraging as described as a Guideline in VEG G1 (Table 3-29). 3. Travel habitat would be maintained across the LAU. Lynx, if present, are potentially transient animals traversing across the forest, thus no long-term impacts to individual lynx and their habitat are anticipated. 4. Forest roads generally have low speeds and are gravel, and do not pose a threat to lynx. No permanent road construction is proposed. Any new temporary roads constructed will be recontoured after use. 5. Lastly, the proposed Federal actions described under Alternative B, C, and D is not occurring within designated critical habitat, it would not result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. 3.7.5.4 Fisher The fisher is a Region 1 sensitive species, a Forest MIS, and an Idaho species of greatest conservation need (IDFG 2005). There have been 11 fisher observations (2 observed tracks, the rest are individuals or trapping records) reported within five miles of the Analysis Area between 1982 and 2005. Two occurred within the Project area. The scattered distribution of these reports indicate well-distributed habitat. Fishers are associated with mature coniferous forests and specific structural elements—particularly large trees and coarse woody debris (Ruggiero et al. 1994). They inhabit mesic, coniferous forest between 3,500–6,000 feet elevation, although habitat preference changes with season, age, and sex (Badry 2004; NatureServe 2012). Fishers avoid open ground (Buskirk and Powell 1994; Powell 1993) and have a preference for structurally complex areas with multiple canopy layers, including understory shrubs and large amounts of woody debris (USDA Forest Service 1998b, Marshall et al. 1996, Powell 1993). Ruggiero et al. (1994) concluded that riparian zones, high elevation old growth grand fir, and subalpine fir stands are important habitat components for fisher (Powell 1993). Fishers appear able to use "many different habitats for hunting as long as these areas provide overhead cover at either the stand or patch scales" (Weir and Harestead 2003: p. 9). Sufficient overhead cover in foraging habitat may be provided by either tree or shrub cover. In a study on the Nez Perce National Forest in the Elk City area from 1985 to 88, most fisher observations were in mesic grand fir habitat types (Jones 1991). Grand fir and Engelmann spruce dominated stands the fishers used in summer. Similarly, in winter fishers used grand fir, Engelmann spruce, and lodgepole pine dominated stands. Summer habitat had a relatively high component of moderate to large diameter Engelmann spruce, large diameter Douglas-fir, and pacific yew. Fishers avoided stands with a strong lodgepole or ponderosa pine component. Winter habitat included stands with a relatively high basal area in Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine. Fishers also strongly selected wetland forest types, with selection for forested riparian habitats evident at several scales in summer and winter (Jones 1991). In summer, 50 percent and 75 percent of observations were within 49 and 75 feet of water. Moving across landscapes, fishers commonly used forested riparian areas, where preferred resting habitat and prey may be more available than in surrounding habitats. In north-central, Idaho, home ranges contained 53 percent mature/old growth stands on average. In summer, 90 percent of observations were in mature/old growth forest. In winter, 54 percent were in mature/old growth and 46 percent in young forest (Jones and Garton 1994). Availability of large diameter logs (>21 inches dbh) appeared to be particularly important in winter habitat selection. Mature/old growth stands were used extensively for resting, while hunting occurred in a range of successional stages, including young sapling and pole forest. For resting, fishers preferred stands with canopy cover greater than 60 percent and for hunting they preferred canopy cover greater than 80 percent. They avoided areas with less than 40% canopy closure and drier habitats. There are 10,037 acres (23%) of currently suitable summer habitat (mature/ old forest) and 13,570 acres (31%) of winter habitat (seedling/sapling/young forest) for fisher in the analysis area. Population Trends: Fishers have a global ranking of G5 (secure) and a state rank of S1 (critically imperiled). Fishers are distributed throughout most of their historical territory in the Clearwater drainage, although the population remains at a low level (Buskirk and Ruggiero 1994). Samson (2006) indicates 100,078 acres are required to maintain a viable fisher population in Forest Service Region One. Bush and Lundberg (2008) show over 440,000 suitable acres of summer habitat and over 700,000 acres of winter habitat occur on the Nez Perce Forest. 3.7.5.4.1 Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action This alternative would have no direct effects to mature or old growth habitat since no activities are proposed. Habitats would continue to be altered by natural events such as succession and insects/disease. Fire suppression would continue. Snag and large down wood habitat elements would remain available as trees die (and fall) from natural causes. A wildfire and/or insect and disease activity would leave greater numbers of snags and large down wood than exist now but would also reduce canopy cover. These more open areas would provide unsuitable conditions for fisher. Ongoing fire suppression may be beneficial for this species because it can help maintain mature and older habitats on the landscape longer. Winter habitat would continue to be available across the analysis area. Connectivity across the landscape would continue to be provided by RHCAs. Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives For Alternatives B, C, and D, the determination is a “may adversely impact individuals, but not likely to result in a loss of viability on the planning area, nor cause a trend to federal listing or a loss of species viability rangewide” for the fisher as Sensitive species. As an MIS, fisher populations would be expected to continue to display population stability across the Nez Perce National Forest under Alternatives B, C, and D. Proposed regeneration harvest would simplify suitable fisher habitats in the short term (<50 years) by eliminating canopy cover and layering, reducing large down wood, and reducing standing snags in treated areas. Snags and down wood would be provided for over the long term through tree retention design features. Canopy cover would increase to suitable levels after about 30 years. Proposed commercial thinning would have minimal effects by retaining enough structure and overstory canopy to be used by fisher. The Action Alternatives would reduce the likelihood of a large, intense fire. Fires have both positive and negative effects on fisher (as discussed under the No Action alternative). Jones (1991) suggests that landscape scale habitat management should incorporate young- to mid-successional stages to provide habitat for prey species while retaining mature and late-successional habitats that provide important denning and resting habitat. The project has been designed to maintain all successional stages within the Project area which would continue to provide suitable habitat for fisher. Alternatives B and C would conduct regeneration and improvement harvest on 580 acres (6%) of currently suitable summer habitat and Alternative D regenerates 438 acres (4%). Landscape burning occurs on 22 acres (0.2%) and would have similar effects to regeneration and improvement harvest activities. Retained trees, snags, and down logs in these areas would provide future habitat for fisher as the stands age. All action alternatives commercially thin 35 acres (0.3%) of summer habitat. Commercial thinning would reduce canopy cover to 40%–60% and would maintain a canopy cover level suitable for fisher use. Alternatives B and C conduct regeneration and improvement harvest on 1,124 acres (8%) and 1,646 acres (12%) of fisher winter habitat respectively. Alternative D does not conduct these types of harvest. No landscape burning is conducted on fisher winter habitat under any alternative. Alternative B, C, and D commercially thin 2,210 acres (16%), 1,731 acres (13%), and 2,013 acres (15%), respectively. The effects of regeneration/improvement harvest and commercial thinning on winter habitat are the same as for summer habitat. Habitat quality in currently suitable summer and winter fisher habitat would decrease in all Action Alternatives. Alternatives C would convert 18% of mature habitat to early seral conditions. Alternative B converts 16% and Alternative D coverts 4%. No harvest would occur in verified old-growth or RHCAs under any alternative. These areas would continue to provide suitable habitat and well as connectivity between suitable habitat patches on over 30% of the landscape. Insects and disease events would continue across the landscape causing tree mortality. These would produce snags and large down wood used by fishers for denning and resting. Commercial thinning would have minimal effects on up to 16% of fisher habitat. Summer and winter fisher habitats would remain well distributed and available under all alternatives. Trends in fisher populations at the local and forest scale would not be affected by project activities due to the wide availability of suitable habitats. 3.7.5.4.2 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects area for fisher is the 43,700-acre project area. The time frame for cumulative effects is 150 years which is the approximate amount of time required for stands to develop into a mature or older vegetative state and snags to develop into a condition that provides habitat for old growth and snag dependent species. Alternative A—No Action There would be no negative cumulative effects from this alternative since no actions would occur. The effects of fire suppression are the same as those discussed under the direct and indirect effects of the No Action alternative. Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives Past activities have been accounted for in the existing condition. Fire suppression could have positive effects on fisher habitat by limiting fire in mature and older forests. The cumulative risk to fisher habitat from the action alternatives is considered low due to the retention of old growth, PACFISH buffers, snag retention guidelines, and other mature stands that would provide fisher habitat after treatment. Young forest would continue to provide winter habitat for fisher. Woody debris would continue to accumulate and be created as trees age and die. At the Forest level and across the range of the species, the effects of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions would be small to negligible. 3.7.5.5 Flammulated Owl This species is a Region 1 sensitive species and an Idaho species of greatest conservation need (IDFG 2005). Idaho flammulated owl habitats are typically mid-elevation, mature or older open ponderosa pine and/or Douglas-fir forest (IDFG 2005). Groves et al (1997) showed flammulated owls used “…stands with mature to old ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir, multiple canopy layers, low tree densities, moderate to low canopy closure, and moderate ground cover”. They prefer habitat on warm, south facing slopes. Clear Creek has limited habitat for these birds. There are 779 acres (2%) of suitable habitat in the Analysis Area. Habitat for flammulated owls is scattered and occurs in relatively small patches. The highest quality habitat occurs primarily on breaklands along lower Clear Creek. Population Trend: In Idaho, the flammulated owl has a state rank of S4 (apparently secure). There is no population trend data for Idaho; however the Forest Service Region 1 conducted flammulated owl surveys across Montana and Idaho. Sixty-nine owls were detected on Nez Perce Forest. The 2005 effort included surveys in the nearby South Fork Clearwater River. Additional surveys were conducted in 2008 in Region One, including on the Forest. Flammulated owls were detected on 55% of the routes with the Nez Perce Forest having the highest proportion detections. A study conducted by Samson (2006) found no scientific evidence that the flammulated owl is decreasing in numbers in the Northern Region of the Forest Service (Samson 2006). There were 2 confirmed sightings 4 miles north of the Project area in 1995 (IDFG 2010). Flammulated owl presence in the Project area has not been confirmed. Flammulated owls are difficult to detect because they are nocturnal and have low population densities. 3.7.5.5.1 Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action No activities would occur under this alternative. Habitat would continue to be sparse, widely scattered, and in relatively small patches. Habitat quality and quantity would decrease as tree density in ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir habitats increase due to a lack of disturbance and fire suppression. Forest conditions would trend away from preferred open grown, old-growth habitats. The increase in tree density would also increase the risk of stand-replacing fire in potential habitats. This type of fire would lead to habitat loss. Nesting habitat would increase slowly as a result of insect and disease outbreaks where fire does not occur. Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives For Alternatives B, C, and D, the determination is a “may adversely impact individuals, but not likely to result in a loss of viability on the planning area, nor cause a trend to federal listing or a loss of species viability rangewide” for the flammulated owl. Proposed activities would have both positive and negative effects. Regeneration harvest would have the greatest potential to negatively affect flammulated owls. It occurs on 20%, 27%, and 21% of suitable owl habitat under Alternatives B, C, and D, respectively. Harvest would remove snags suitable for nesting and roosting. It would also reduce the number of canopy layers and ground cover which would improve foraging opportunities. Design features would retain 14–28 tpa and 15%–20% canopy cover in clumps and as scattered individual trees. All legacy trees would be retained. Retained trees would provide nesting and perching habitat after implementation and into the future as stands become denser and develop multi-layered canopies. Wright et al. (1997) found that flammulated owls were present in approximately half of the selectively logged stands in her study area south of Missoula, Montana. Howie and Ritcy (1987), in a British Columbia study, found that most owls occurred in mature and old stands of Douglas-fir with 35%–65% canopy closure that had been selectively logged 2 to 3 decades prior. Improvement harvest would occur on 13% of potential owl habitat under Alternatives B and C. Roughly 4% would be treated under Alternative D. Proposed activities would improve habitat by making ponderosa pine stands more resilient to wildfire, reducing the Douglas-fir and grand fir component, and retaining large ponderosa pine habitats in an open understory condition. Canopy would be reduced and would provide for foraging opportunities. Commercial thinning would occur on 5%, 1%, and 4% of flammulated owl habitat under Alternatives B, C, and D, respectively. This activity would maintain suitable feeding, perching, and nesting habitat by retaining 120 tpa and retain 40–60% canopy cover. Precommercial thinning would occur on 3% of owl habitat under all alternatives. Both commercial and precommercial thinning would select for ponderosa pine and other resilient species preferred by owls. These activities would reduce tree density and promote the development of large trees and suitable owl habitat over the long term (>100 years). Landscape burning would occur on 4% of owl habitat under all alternatives. It would increase snag habitat, decrease understory Douglas-fir and grand fir, and increase stand resiliency to wildfire. In higher severity areas, it may reduce habitat quality or quantity but the amount is not predictable. The proposed activities would reduce nesting habitat through regeneration harvest but would retain or improve foraging habitat. Ponderosa pine cover types would increase on up to 7% of the breakland setting where regeneration harvest occurs. This would increase the amount of future habitat for flammulated owls. All treatments would increase the resilience of ponderosa pine and create the forest structure necessary to support the flammulated owl over time. The proposed activities are not likely to alter the population trend at the project or forest level due to the mostly positive effects associated with them. The negative effects are expected to be limited and there is no sign of decline at the regional level (Samson 2006). Owls would also continue to be able to use the treated areas primarily for foraging. 3.7.5.5.2 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects area for flammulated owl is the 43,700-acre project area. The time frame for cumulative effects is 100 years which is the time it takes to develop large snags and trees used for nesting. Alternative A—No Action The direct and indirect effects of this alternative when combined with fire suppression could lead to negative cumulative effects on flammulated owl in the event of a wildfire. Snags would be created but canopy cover would be reduced. Determining the extent and probability is not possible; however 50% of the Project area is currently susceptible to stand replacing fire. Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives  There would be both positive and negative cumulative effects associated with the action alternatives. The project would reduce the amount of flammulated owl habitat by 21–27% through regeneration harvest in the short term (<100 years) but would create suitable habitat in all commercial, precommercial, and burned areas over the cumulative effects time frame. The potential for stand replacement fire is reduced by 7% across the Project area under all action alternatives. Fire suppression would maintain dense stands in untreated areas reducing the quality of owl habitat and increasing the risk of stand replacement fire in those areas. The level of cumulative effects cannot be assessed but are expected to be negligible. 3.7.5.6 Gray Wolf Gray wolf is a Region 1 Sensitive species. Wolf habitat spans a broad range of elevations and habitat types. Key habitat components include: a sufficient year-round prey base of ungulates and alternate prey; suitable, somewhat secluded denning and rendezvous sites; and sufficient space with minimal exposure to humans (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 1987). The Pilot Rock wolf pack uses the Analysis Area. One rearing location was documented in 2007, and wolves with pups were observed in 2007, 2008, and 2010, where two rendezvous sites have been confirmed. No den sites were identified. Two wolves were captured in Hoodoo Creek in 2007 and wolf tracks were observed in 2011. The Analysis Area provides a variety of suitable habitats for wolves and their prey. Ungulates comprise more than 90 percent of wolves' diets from spring through winter in the Rocky Mountains. Mule and white-tailed deer, elk, and moose are the principal prey species (USDI FWS 1987). Elk provide the primary prey base for wolves. Maintaining elk habitat effectiveness (EHE) above minimum Forest Plan standards, providing elk security areas above minimum recommendations and managing winter range to enhance elk forage productivity and quality would provide a sufficient prey base to sustain wolf populations according to State objectives for the Dworshak and Lolo Wolf Management Zones (WMZs). Population Trends: The gray wolf recovery plan (USDI FWS 1987) established a recovery goal of 10 breeding pairs for three consecutive years in central Idaho. There are currently 101 wolf packs in Idaho as of 2011. Recovery objectives have been met and exceeded. 3.7.5.6.1 Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action There would be no direct or indirect effects to denning or rendezvous sites. Habitat security would remain unchanged and high (see Elk section). Wolves would continue to have abundant prey sources. Insects and disease pockets would help maintain the prey species forage base of shrubs, forbs, and grasses. Fire suppression would continue which would increase the risk for wildfire. Large infestations or wildfire would reduce hiding cover for wolves and their prey, but would increase forage over a period of 20 years. Foraging habitat for elk would decline in these areas after 20 years as a result of forest succession. Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives The proposed activities would have no direct or indirect effects on known rendezvous sites since no activities are proposed in or near them. For Alternatives B, C, and D, the determination is a “may adversely impact individuals, but not likely to result in a loss of viability on the planning area, nor cause a trend to federal listing or a loss of species viability rangewide” for the gray wolf. All Action Alternatives would increase forage for elk. Harvesting and landscape burning would reduce tree canopy cover and promote the growth of native shrub species important for elk forage. The amount of forage from regeneration and improvement harvest would increase by 7%, 10%, and 5% under Alternatives B, C, and D, respectively. Forage improvements would last for about 30 years. Hiding cover would decrease by the same amounts in the treated areas and would be recovered in about 20 years. Landscape burning would occur on 3% of the Project area and would promote forage growth on winter range in all Action Alternatives. Elk habitat effectiveness would decline from 0% to 8% under the Action Alternatives, but would remain above minimum Forest Plan objectives (see Elk section). There would be no change to elk security as a result of the action alternatives. Increases in elk forage, and therefore forage opportunities for wolves, are expected on 8% to 13% of the Project area. Reduced hiding cover would improve the potential hunting success for wolves in treatment areas. 3.7.5.6.2 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effect area is the 43,700-acre Project area and includes seven elk analysis units. The cumulative effects timeframe is 20 years because it would take this long for regeneration harvest and burned areas to develop into hiding cover. Cumulative effects were assessed using EHE because elk are the main prey base for wolves. Elk security was not addressed since there are no changes to it as a result of any of the alternatives. Alternative A—No Action The effects of this alternative are the same as those described under the direct and indirect effects. There would be no cumulative effects since there are no proposed actions with this alternative. Alternatives B, C, and D  The cumulative effects of the action alternatives on EHE and wolves would be both positive and negative. Fire suppression would reduce forage quality and quantity by not allowing fires to burn; however proposed activities would increase forage by 8% to 13% depending on the alternative. The level of potential positive or negative cumulative effects cannot be determined as fire severity and size is not predictable. 3.7.5.7 Mountain Quail This species is a Region 1 Sensitive species and an Idaho species of greatest conservation need (IDFG 2005). The species is on the fringe of its western range in Idaho and on the Forest (Idaho PIF 2000). Preferred habitat is dense thickets of rose, hawthorn, black currant, serviceberry, elderberry, blackberry, chokecherry and willow (Wisdom et al. 2000, Gutierrez and Delehanty 1999, Heekin and Reese 1994). They also use densely vegetated draws, shrubby understory and forest and meadow edges in open ponderosa pine and Douglas fir (Heekin and Vogel 1995). In Idaho, mountain quail habitat was dominated by tall shrubs that averaged 10 feet in height with an average canopy density of 45 percent that were within a few hundred feet of water. They occur most frequently in draws with shrub galleries along the breaks and secondary drainages of the Snake, Salmon, and Clearwater Rivers. Nests are primarily located within 200-300 yards of water since chicks require water soon after hatching (Johnsgard 1973; Wisdom et al. 2000). Known, recent locations on the Forest are in dry, low elevation, face drainages of the Salmon River. Mountain quail habitat is more commonly found on private lands at lower elevations in the Clear Creek watershed near Kooskia, Idaho (about 10 miles northwest of the Analysis Area) and along the lower Selway River canyon. Mountain quail historically occurred in the Project area. Mountain quail breed and winter in warm and dry shrub-dominated communities (IDFG 2005). Healthy shrub-dominated riparian areas are important features of suitable habitat and provide corridors for quail to move to higher elevation breakland habitat in summer. There are 187 acres of currently suitable early successional mountain quail habitat in the Project area. All if it is within VRU 3 in the Clear Creek Roadless Area and occurs along stream breaklands. VRU 3 contains 6% young seral conditions and is well below the desired condition of 15–25%. A small covey of mountain quail were observed 1 mile from the northeast boundary of the Project area in 1997 (IDFG 2010); however the observations were not confirmed. Population Trend: Mountain quail populations have been declining in the intermountain west for the past several decades (Gutierrez and Delehanty 1999), and the Idaho population has experienced the same pattern of decline since the 1930s (Heekin and Reese 1994). Mountain quail occur along the Snake, Boise, Clearwater, Salmon, and Little Salmon River canyons (Heekin and Reese 1994). Remaining habitat areas are fragmented and populations often exist in isolated islands (Wisdom et al. 2000). Habitat in the Salmon River near Riggins, Idaho, supports a stronghold population. 3.7.5.7.1 Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action Currently suitable habitat would become unsuitable over time as tree density and canopy cover increase and shrubs decrease. Habitats would be more susceptible to stand-replacing wildfire, which could directly harm birds but would create additional habitat for quail. Alternatives B, C, and D For Alternatives B, C, and D, the determination is a “may adversely impact individuals, but not likely to result in a loss of viability on the planning area, nor cause a trend to federal listing or a loss of species viability rangewide” for the mountain quail. Proposed landscape burning would increase mountain quail habitat by 19% (35 acres). Burning would reduce the Douglas-fir and grand fir component in ponderosa pine stands, retaining large ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir trees, and promoting shrub growth. Landscape burning would help maintain open conditions; however birds may be disturbed by proposed activities. The risk is considered low given the small amount of proposed treatment acres and the expected low number of birds in the area. 3.7.5.7.2 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effect area is the 43,700-acre Project area. The cumulative effects timeframe is 20 years because this is when shrub habitat conditions would begin declining. Alternative A—No Action There could be minor cumulative effects from this alternative. No activities would be conducted to improve quail habitat and fire suppression would prevent the development of suitable habitat resulting from wildfire. Alternatives B, C, and D The Action Alternatives would improve habitat quality through the use of prescribed fire. Proposed treatments may increase the potential for allowing the future use of naturally ignited fire in the Roadless Area. This could be beneficial to quail. Fire suppression would continue outside of the Roadless Area; however little habitat for quail exists outside of it. Minimal, but positive cumulative effects to mountain quail would be expected. There could be a positive trend in quail populations but it would be negligible due to the limited number of acres being treated. 3.7.5.8 Pygmy Nuthatch This species is a Region 1 sensitive species and an Idaho species of greatest conservation need (IDFG 2005). In Idaho, the pygmy nuthatch has a state ranking of S1 (critically imperiled). They are residents in mountain conifer woodlands, often in open woodland with large trees (Baicich and Harrison 1997). In Idaho, they are mainly found in pine forests and woodlands, especially ponderosa pine. They prefer older, open ponderosa pine habitat with <70% canopy cover. Nests appeared most often in cavities excavated by other birds (McEllin 1979). Raphael and White (1984) and Brawn and Balda (1988) found 100% of nests were in snags, not live trees. There are 960 acres of suitable habitat in the Analysis Area, most of which occurs on the breakland setting in VRU 3. Old forest preferred by nuthatches on this VRU is at 4% which is well below the desired condition of 20%-50%. Habitat is scattered in small patches generally under 15 acres in size. Home ranges of nuthatches are 4 to 10 acres. This species requires snags for nesting and forages on pine seeds and insects extracted from tree bark. Two pygmy nuthatches were recorded in the Analysis Area during a breeding bird point count survey in 1994. Population Trend: Rosenberg (2004) and Partners In Flight (PIF) estimate approximately 5,000–5,300 individuals on a year-round basis in Idaho. BBS data indicate a positive population trend of >1.5% change per year from 1966–2010 for the northern and north-central Idaho pygmy nuthatch population. 3.7.5.8.1 Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action Suitable habitat would be reduced in the Project area over time as tree density and canopy cover increases with forest succession. Ponderosa pine habitats would continue to be encroached on by shade tolerant Douglas-fir and grand fir further limiting suitable habitat. Fire suppression would limit the creation of new habitat. Snags would be retained across the landscape and would continue to develop as stands age which would provide nesting habitat for nuthatches. Existing young pine plantations would not provide suitable habitat for about 100 years. Alternatives B, C, and D For Alternatives B, C, and D, the determination is a “may adversely impact individuals, but not likely to result in a loss of viability on the planning area, nor cause a trend to federal listing or a loss of species viability rangewide” for the pygmy nuthatch. Landscape burning on 280 acres (9%) of VRU 3 in currently unsuitable habitat would be beneficial to nuthatches. It would create suitable habitat by reducing Douglas-fir and grand fir, retaining large legacy trees, creating snags and maintaining ponderosa pine habitats in an open understory condition. Under all Action Alternatives, 87 acres (9%) of currently suitable habitat would be maintained with prescribed fire. Improvement harvest would open the understory and enhance conditions on 37 acres (4%) of suitable habitat under Alternatives B and C, and 23 acres (2%) under Alternative D. Commercial and precommercial thinning would reduce canopy cover and promote the development of large ponderosa pine over 100 years which would be beneficial to pygmy nuthatch. Commercial thinning would occur on 131 acres (14%) of suitable habitat under Alternatives B and D, while Alternative C thins 101 acres (11%). All Action Alternatives precommercially thin 46 acres (5%) of suitable habitat. Regeneration harvest under the Action Alternatives would reduce nesting potential by 46 acres (5%), 77 acres (8%), and 19 acres (2%) under Alternatives B, C, and D respectively. Green tree and snag retention within treatment units would help retain some nesting and foraging habitat through the life of the stand. Ponderosa pine would be planted on breaklands which would increase its representation by 6%, 7% and 4% under Alternatives B, C, and D, respectively. This would create habitat over the long term and would benefit pygmy nuthatches. The project could have a positive trend on local pygmy nuthatch populations over time as it maintains 9% of the currently suitable habitat, increases habitat in the short term (10 years) by 13% and increases habitat in the long term (100 years) by up to 35%. The project partially reduces nesting habitat through regeneration harvest by 2% to 8%. 3.7.5.8.2 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effect area is the 43,700-acre Project area. The cumulative effects timeframe is 100 years because it would take this long to develop large snags and trees used for nesting after regeneration harvest. Alternative A—No Action The direct and indirect effects of this alternative when combined with fire suppression could lead to negative cumulative effects on pygmy nuthatch in the event of a wildfire when older forest are burned. Snags, however, would be created and would be available for future nesting. Determining the extent and probability of fire effects is not possible; however 50% of the Project area is currently susceptible to stand replacing fire. Alternatives B, C, and D There would be both positive and negative cumulative effects associated with the action alternatives. The project would reduce the amount of nuthatch habitat by 2% - 8% through regeneration harvest in the short term (<50 years) but would create suitable habitat in all commercial, precommercial, and burned areas over the cumulative effects time frame. The potential for stand replacement fire is reduced by 7% across the Project area under all action alternatives. Fire suppression would maintain dense stands in untreated areas reducing the quality of nuthatch habitat and increasing the risk of stand replacement fire in those areas. Fires would have short term negative but long term positive effects. 3.7.5.9 Ring-necked Snake This species is a Region 1 sensitive species and an Idaho species of greatest conservation need (IDFG 2005). Ring-necked snakes can be found in forested, brushy areas or open hillsides that have rocks, logs, talus or other debris for cover and they may use microhabitats that are moist (Storm and Leonard 1995). In west-central Idaho they are typically found adjacent to perennial rivers or streams in grassland or forested habitats (IDFG 2005). They are nocturnal and hide underground or under surface cover (wood, rocks) during the day making detections difficult. They feed on small invertebrates. An unrecorded observation of a ring-necked snake 5 miles north of the Project area was made in the 1990s. Similar elevations and drier vegetation types occur in the Analysis Area making it possible that these snakes are present in the area. There are 3,030 acres of potential ring-neck habitat on the low elevation breaklands (VRU 3) where grasslands, open dry forest, and dry and moderately moist forest provide suitable conditions. Roughly 730 acres occurs within PACFISH RHCAs. Population Trends: The ring-necked snake has a global rank of G5 (secure) and an Idaho State rank of S2 (imperiled). Current population and trend are unknown. 3.7.5.9.1 Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action Fire suppression would continue under this alternative and habitats would become denser, creating conditions that would increase the risk of stand-replacing fire. Wildfires can directly harm ring-neck snakes and reduce their habitat. Long-term (>20 years) beneficial effects from fire include snag recruitment and subsequently large down wood recruitment which creates habitat for ring-necked snakes. Currently 50% of the Project area is susceptible to stand replacement fire. Alternatives B, C, and D For Alternatives B, C, and D, the determination is a “may adversely impact individuals, but not likely to result in a loss of viability on the planning area, nor cause a trend to federal listing or a loss of species viability rangewide” for the ring-necked snake. Timber harvest and landscape burning activities can cause direct mortality through contact with fire, machinery, or yarded logs. The effects on direct mortality cannot be estimated, but given the lack of observations and the use of protected riparian areas as habitat, the risk is expected to be low. Riparian habitat used by snakes would not be affected due to PACFISH buffer implementation. Regeneration harvest would treat 66 acres (2%), 177 acres (6%), and 27 acres (1%) of suitable habitat under Alternatives B, C, and D respectively. Commercial thinning would treat 236 acres (8%), 125 acres (4%), and 171 acres (6%) of suitable habitat respectively. Improvement harvest would treat less than 1% under all alternatives. Harvest activities would remove trees that would have eventually become downed wood and suitable habitat for snakes. Regeneration harvest would remove the most potential habitat compared to other treatments. Snags and standing live trees as well as downed wood would, however, be retained in all harvest units which would provide limited current and future habitat for snakes. Talus slopes and rock outcrops used by snakes would not be affected. Opening the tree canopy would stimulate shrub growth which could increase invertebrate production and therefore foraging opportunities for ring-necked snakes. Landscape burning would treat 191 acres (6%) of suitable habitat under all alternatives. The effects to ring-necked snakes would vary depending on fire intensity. Low intensity areas are expected to have no effects while high severity areas could cause direct mortality to snakes. Beneficial effects would be the increase in downed wood material (suitable habitat) 5 to 10 years after the burn when snags fall. Grassland restoration activities occur on 0.1% of suitable habitat and would have no effect on this species. The overall negative effects to ring-necked snakes from proposed harvest and burning activities is expected to be low due to the retention of trees and downed wood in treatment areas and the retention of PACFISH buffers. No change to population trends of ring-neck snakes would therefore be expected from proposed activities. 3.7.5.9.2 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effect area is the 43,700-acre Project area. The cumulative effects timeframe is 20 years because this is the time when snags would to start falling in treated units creating habitat for ring-neck snakes. Alternative A—No Action There would be no direct effects to ring-necked snakes from this alternative. Indirect effects include increased stand densities resulting from fire suppression and an increased risk of stand replacing fire. This could result in direct mortality of snakes; however the risk is expected to be low as snakes can take cover under and may be protected by downed wood, rocks or talus slopes. Both positive and negative cumulative effects would be expected from this alternative as previously discussed. The levels are expected to be low due to the limited amount of potential habitat and effectiveness of fire suppression. Alternatives B, C, and D Cumulative effects to ring-neck snakes are expected to be both positive and negative and are the same effects as those discussed in the direct and indirect effects section. No quantitative estimate of cumulative effects can be provided since the number of potential fires and their size cannot be predicted. Harvest and landscape burn activities would reduce the risk of crown on 7% of the project area and 17% of VRU 3. Fire suppression would continue outside the Clear Creek Roadless Area (which is 28% of VRU 3). Naturally ignited fires in the Roadless Area may be allowed to burn after harvest and burn treatments are completed. This would allow for natural process to continue on 2,180 acres (72%) of VRU 3 which would be both beneficial and detrimental to ring-necked snakes depending on fire severity and size. 3.7.5.10 Western Toad The western toad is a Forest sensitive species and an Idaho species of greatest conservation need (IDFG 2005). Western toads breed in temporary and permanent lakes, ponds, streams, and road ditches. They prefer shallow, warm areas with mud bottoms, and typically breed in May and June. Potential breeding and dispersal habitat occurs throughout the area along the network of riparian areas (10,700 acres, or 24% of the Analysis Area). Toads can be found from dry grasslands to moist subalpine forests, but optimal habitat is found in humid areas with moderate undergrowth (Nussbaum et al. 1983). They are largely terrestrial, but generally found within fair proximity to water. In Idaho, western toads are associated with almost all habitats within 1,600 feet of water. Adult western toads are largely terrestrial and are very active at night. They have been known to move up to 1 mile from their breeding habitats, (Bartelt et al. 2004) often into upland habitats (Bull 2006). Toads selected south-facing slopes, preferred open sites to forested settings, and sites with high density of burrows, rocks, logs, or rootwads that provided cover (Bull 2006). Burned and harvested sites were not avoided by western toads in Bull’s study. Guscio et al. (2007) found western toad occurrence increased after wildfires and they used severely burned areas. Use shifted from severely burned to moderately burned areas in the late summer likely as a result of more ground/canopy cover and higher soil moistures. There are 510 acres of potential upland toad habitat (<30% canopy cover and south aspects) in the Project area. Population Trends: This toad has a state rank of S4, apparently secure. Population trends in Idaho are difficult to track due to a lack of baseline information, but they are well distributed (Engle and Harris 2001). The western toad is known to occur on the Forest but none have been reported in the Analysis Area. 3.7.5.10.1 Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action There would be no actions, and therefore no direct effects to western toad upland habitat under this alternative. There would be a reduction in the amount upland openings preferred by toads as forest stands age and become denser. Fire suppression would minimize the amount of new openings that could be potentially created by wildfire. Downed wood used for cover currently exists and recruitment would continue as a result of tree mortality caused by insects, diseases, and potential wildfire. Alternatives B, C, and D Western toad breeding habitats would be protected under all alternatives through no-harvest RHCA implementation. A minor amount of habitat could be lost through road decommissioning and road improvement activities. Permanent puddles occur along the edges of several roads as a result of poor road drainage. Long-toed salamanders were observed in 5 different roadside puddles (Smith, personal observation in 2010 and 2011). Tadpoles have been observed in similar pools but were not identified to species. Tadpoles are likely either western toads or Columbia spotted frogs. Road improvement or decommissioning would improve drainage and are proposed to limit the affect to area streams. The effects to toads from these activities are considered low due to a low numbers of sites where roadside puddles occur. For Alternatives B, C, and D, the determination is a “may adversely impact individuals, but not likely to result in a loss of viability on the planning area, nor cause a trend to federal listing or a loss of species viability rangewide” for the western toad. Alternatives B and C would improve upland habitat for toads on 55 acres (11%) and Alternative D would improve 59 acres (12%) of suitable habitat respectively through regeneration harvest. Commercial thinning would occur on 4 acres under Alternative B and D. Harvest activities would decrease canopy cover while retaining downed wood for cover. No landscape burning would occur in suitable toad habitat. Proposed activities have the potential to cause direct mortality to toads due to tree falling and yarding, site preparation burning, and road work. The risk is expected to be low due to design features that minimize yarding corridors in harvest units and road work being completed during the drier parts of the year. No change in the population trend of toads is expected at the project level due to the limited amount of habitat being affected and the fact that treatments would slightly improve habitat quality for toads. All breeding habitat would be protected through the retention of RHCAs. 3.7.5.10.2 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effect area is the 43,700-acre Project area. The cumulative effects timeframe is 20 years because this is the time when tree canopy cover would begin to close and reduce the quality of upland toad habitat. Alternative A There effects to upland toad habitat are the same as the direct and indirect effects discussed above. This alternative would cumulatively reduce upland toad habitat because no landscape disturbance would occur which would maintain relatively closed canopies across the project area. Fire suppression would limit the number and size of fires that could create upland habitat for toads. Alternatives B, C, and D All action alternatives would maintain or increase the quality of upland habitat for toads. Treatments may allow for the use of naturally ignited fire in the Clear Creek Roadless Area which could create additional habitat. Fire suppression would occur outside of the Roadless Area limiting disturbance opportunities and toad habitat development there. The cumulative effects of the project would be beneficial (from harvest) to neutral depending on the amount of fire suppression activities. It is not possible to predict the amount of disturbance minimized by fire suppression. 3.7.5.11 American Marten The pine marten is a Nez Perce Forest high elevation old growth MIS. Optimal habitat for marten has been described as mature/old-growth spruce-fir forest with at least 30% canopy cover, plentiful fallen logs and stumps, and a lush understory of shrubs and forbs. Marten in north-central Idaho were found to use a variety of forest types in winter, but activity was highest in Engelmann spruce/subalpine fir stands with mesic habitat types, >30% canopy cover, and overstory age >100 years (Koehler et al. 1975, Koehler and Hornocker 1977). Mature lodgepole pine is also suitable in moist habitat types, and in areas of high precipitation, dense cedar-grand fir forests at lower elevations provide habitat for the marten as well (Koehler et al 1975). There are 17,328 acres of suitable habitat for marten in the Project area. Marten habitat is well distributed and connected throughout the area in the mid-to upper elevations. Population Trends: Total population size is unknown, but probably is at least several hundred thousand in the United States and the species can be regarded as secure (NaturServe 2012). Few data sets allow evaluation of population trends over long periods (Ruggiero et al. 1994). Samson (2006) indicates 17,297 suitable habitat acres are required to maintain a viable marten population in the Forest Service Northern Region. Bush and Lundberg (2008) show over one million suitable acres on the Forest. 3.7.5.11.1 Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action This alternative would have no direct effects to mature or old growth habitat since no activities area proposed. Habitats would continue to be altered by natural events such as forest succession and insects/disease. Fire suppression would continue. Snag and large down wood habitat elements would remain available as trees die (and fall) from natural causes. A wildfire and/or insect and disease activity would leave greater numbers of snags and large down wood than exist now but would also reduce canopy cover. These more open areas would provide unsuitable conditions for marten. Ongoing fire suppression may be beneficial for this species because it can help maintain mature and older habitats on the landscape longer. Alternatives B, C, and D Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives Under Alternative B, C, and D, marten populations would be expected to continue to display population stability across the Nez Perce National Forest. Proposed regeneration harvest would simplify suitable marten habitats in the short term (<50 years) by eliminating canopy cover and layering, reducing large down wood, and reducing standing snags in treated areas. Snags and down wood would be provided for over the long term through tree retention design features. Canopy cover would increase to suitable levels after about 50 years. Proposed commercial thinning would have minimal effects by retaining enough structure and overstory canopy to be used by marten. The Action Alternatives would reduce the likelihood of a large, intense fire. Fires have both positive and negative effects on marten (as discussed under the No Action alternative). Jones (1991) suggests that landscape scale habitat management should incorporate young- to mid-successional stages to provide habitat for prey species while retaining mature and late-successional habitats that provide important denning and resting habitat. The project has been designed to maintain all successional stages within the Project area which would continue to provide suitable habitat for marten. Alternatives B and C would conduct regeneration and improvement harvest on 1,189 acres (7%) of currently suitable habitat and Alternative D regenerates 796 acres (4%). Retained trees, snags, and down logs in these areas would provide future habitat for marten as the stands age. All action alternatives commercially thin 40 acres (0.2%) of marten habitat. Commercial thinning would reduce canopy cover to 40%–60% and would maintain a canopy cover level suitable for marten use. No landscape burning occurs in marten habitat. No harvest would occur in verified old-growth or RHCAs under any alternative. These areas would continue to provide suitable habitat and well as connectivity across over 30% of the landscape. Insects and disease events would continue across the landscape causing tree mortality. These would produce snags and large down wood used by martens for denning and resting. Marten habitat would remain well distributed and available under all alternatives. Trends in marten populations at the local and forest scale would not be affected by project activities due to the wide availability of untreated suitable habitats at the project and Forest level. 3.7.5.11.2 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects area for marten is the 43,700-acre project area. The time frame for cumulative effects is 150 years which is the approximate amount of time required for stands to develop into a mature or older vegetative state and snags to develop into a condition that provides habitat for old growth and snag dependent species. Alternative A—No Action There would be no negative cumulative effects from this alternative since no actions would occur. The effects of fire suppression are the same as those discussed under the direct and indirect effects of the No Action alternative. Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives Past activities have been accounted for in the existing condition. Fire suppression could have positive effects on marten habitat by limiting fire in mature and older forests. The cumulative risk to marten habitat from the action alternatives is considered low due to the retention of old growth, PACFISH buffers, snag retention guidelines, and other mature stands that would provide marten habitat after treatment. Woody debris would continue to accumulate and be created as trees age and die. 3.7.5.12 Northern Goshawk The northern goshawk was identified as a Forest MIS for old-growth forest. Nesting habitat was chosen as the indicator because it is the primary limiting factor for goshawks and is represented by a much narrower range of vegetation structure and composition than the post-fledgling areas and forage area. Foraging habitat for goshawks may occur along the edges of open areas and is not considered limiting. Goshawks use large landscapes, integrating a diversity of vegetation types over several spatial scales to meet their life-cycle needs (Squires and Kennedy 2006). In “The Northern Goshawk Status Review,” the USFWS found that the goshawk typically uses mature forest or larger trees for nesting habitat; however, it is considered a forest habitat generalist at larger spatial scales (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 1998). The USFWS found no evidence that the goshawk is dependent on large, unbroken tracts of old-growth or mature forest (63 FR 35183 June 29, 1998). Nest areas are usually mature forest with large trees, relatively closed canopies (50%–90%) and open understories (Squires and Kennedy 2006). In central Idaho, goshawks nest in a variety of forest stands that are comprised of mature trees with relatively high canopy cover and open understories (Moser 2007). Nest trees typically range between 12” and 21” dbh and are located on relatively gentle terrain with 70% of nests occurring on shaded aspects. Favored habitats typically are located in forest stands having only 1 or 2 canopy levels with an open or mixed-density understory. The goshawk is a habitat generalist at the foraging area scale. Goshawk foraging areas are heterogeneous and may include some mature forest components (Squires and Kennedy 2006) as well as a mix of other forest and nonforest components (i.e. sagebrush, grasslands, lowland riparian, and agriculture) (Younk and Bechard 1994, Reynolds 1994, Patla et al. 1997). Goshawks require habitats for prey that contain snags, downed logs, woody debris, large trees, herbaceous and shrubby understories, and a mixture of stand structural stages (Wisdom et al. 2000). They are an opportunistic predator that take prey items on the ground, on vegetation, in the air, and rely on a variety of forested and non-forested habitats. There are 2,066 acres (5%) of currently suitable nesting habitat in the Analysis Area. Goshawks have been recorded across the Forest and one was observed foraging near the Project boundary during recent field reviews. Population Trends: The goshawk is rated secure across its range (global rank G5) and is apparently secure (state rank S4) in the state of Idaho (Digital Atlas of Idaho 2010). The goshawk population in the northern Idaho portion of the Northern Rockies Bird Conservation Region (BCR) is estimated to be approximately 3,900 birds (Rosenberg 2004). State-wide, the goshawk estimated population is 5,600, with a population objective of 6,200 individuals as noted by Rosenberg (2004). Survey data indicates an overall declining population Idaho since 1966; however it remains relatively stable in the Northern Rockies BCR (Sauer et al. 2011). No evidence exists that the northern goshawk is declining in number in the western United States (Kennedy 1997, USFWS 1998, Kennedy 2003, Anderson et al 2005, Squires and Kennedy 2006). Samson (2005) also concluded no scientific evidence exists that the northern goshawk is decreasing in number in the Forest Service Northern Region. Samson (2006) concluded that 30,147 acres of post-fledging habitat was needed across Region One to maintain a minimum viable population of the northern goshawk. Bush and Lundgren (2008) found over 275,000 acres of post-fledgling habitat on the Forest, more than nine times the area needed to maintain viable populations region-wide. 3.7.5.12.1 Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action No management actions would take place. Habitats would continue to be altered by natural events such as succession, insect and disease, and potential wildfire. A wildfire and/or insect and disease activity would likely leave behind greater numbers of snags than exist now but would also reduce canopy cover that may create unsuitable conditions for goshawk nesting. In general, nesting habitat would increase and foraging habitat would decrease as forest succession continues to fill in understories and increase stand canopy closure. Fuel build-up resulting from fire suppression activities would continue, thereby increasing the likelihood of a stand-replacing fire. Stand-replacing fires would reduce nesting habitat in the short term (<50 years) but would create it and other various elements of goshawk habitat in the long term (>50 years). Alternatives B, C, and D Under Alternative B, C, and D, Northern goshawk populations would be expected to continue to display population stability across the Nez Perce National Forest. All action alternatives would harvest in suitable goshawk nesting habitat. Alternatives B and C would regeneration harvest 93 acres (5%), and Alternative D would harvest 85 acres (4%). Activities would reduce habitat quality by eliminating canopy cover and layering, and reducing some standing snags. Landscape burning on 45 acres (2%) of nesting habitat would have similar effects except that snags would be retained and additional ones created. Harvest and burning activities would preclude treated areas from being used by nesting goshawks until canopy cover increases to suitable levels (generally >50 years). Implementation of snag and green tree retention guidelines in harvest units, as well as PACFISH buffers, would retain trees for future nesting and help limit effects of habitat simplification. Commercial thinning would remove suppressed trees leaving 40%–60% of the tree canopy and about 120 tpa. All alternatives would thin 160 acres (8%) of suitable goshawk nesting habitat. Treatments may not retain enough overstory canopy to be used by nesting goshawks, but would promote large tree growth and would provide for foraging opportunities. Thinned areas would become suitable habitat as canopy cover increases over time (>20 years). During Project implementation, human activity, equipment noise, and burning might preclude use of the area by goshawks. Any active nests found in a treatment unit would be reported to the Zone or Forest a wildlife biologist and activities halted while site specific conservation measures are developed. This would reduce the likelihood of disturbance or injury to individual birds. None of the Action Alternatives would harvest in the 4,654 acres of MA 20 or the 10,700 acres of RHCAs. This equates to 35% of the analysis area. Mature and old forest habitat would therefore be maintained across the Project area and would be available for goshawk use. The Project is not expected to negatively affect goshawk population trends in the project area or at the Forest level due to the availability of untreated habitat in at both of these scales. Regional estimates indicate sufficient habitat is available to maintain population viability (Samson 2006; Bush and Lundgren 2008). 3.7.5.12.2 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effect area is the 43,700-acre Project area, which includes seven OGAAs. The cumulative effects timeframe is 150 years because it would take this long for regeneration harvest areas to develop old growth habitat characteristics. OGAA’s were also selected because goshawks are an old growth MIS. Alternative A—No Action The potential cumulative effects of this alternative are the same as those described under the direct and indirect effects of the No Action alternative. There is a potential for cumulative effects; however levels cannot be determined because estimating the size and severity of potential future fires resulting from fire suppression is not possible. Alternatives B, C, and D Harvest and burning activities open and remove tree canopy, creating edges and clearings which would increase the amount of grasses, forbs, shrubs, and tree seedlings and improve habitat conditions for some goshawk prey species. Fire suppression would maintain closed canopies in untreated areas potentially improving nesting habitat over time. Suppression also increases the risk of stand replacing fire which could remove nesting habitat. Proposed treatments reduce the crown fire (stand replacement) potential by 7% across the project area. The OGAAs would retain 6% to 21% verified old growth (see Old Growth section) which would provide nesting habitat for goshawk over time. Additional old growth would be maintained in RHCAs. Negative cumulative effects are not expected due to the availability of untreated habitats and the likelihood that a wildfire would not burn all available nesting habitats during a fire event. There may be slight positive cumulative effects associated with creating openings for prey species. 3.7.5.13 Pileated Woodpecker The pileated woodpecker was identified as a Forest MIS for old-growth forest and large snag habitat. The pileated is most often associated with mature forests (Samson 2006) although the presence of large trees for nesting is reported to be more important than forest age (). Pileated woodpeckers are relatively common in both cut and uncut mid-elevation forests, and appear to do well in a matrix of forest types (Hutto 1995a). They nest in both previously harvested stands that contain remnant large trees and snags, and in mature and old growth forests. The pileated woodpecker is able to do well in young and fragmented forests that retain abundant remnant structure, such as large diameter snags and down woody debris (Mellen et al. 1992). Pileated woodpecker surveys were conducted in 2012 in the Analysis Area and within a mile outside of its boundary. Eleven pileated detections were made, 8 within the area and 3 in the one mile buffer. Nineteen additional observations were recorded throughout the Analysis Area during project review in 2011 and 2012. Pileated woodpeckers were also detected in 59% of the surrounding surveyed areas of the Middle Fork Clearwater and Selway Rivers. Pileated woodpeckers are common and widespread in the Project area and across the Forest. Nesting habitat was chosen as the indicator because it is the greatest limiting factor for pileated woodpeckers. Nesting habitat has a narrower range of vegetation conditions when compared to foraging habitat. The Northern Region of the Forest Service summarized available scientific information on the pileated woodpecker (Samson 2006). The report found that the nest tree is the most important variable to estimate breeding habitat use by the pileated woodpecker (). Large snags (>20 inches dbh) were preferred over live trees for nesting in the Northern Rocky Mountains, and nesting occurred in, mature cottonwood bottoms, ponderosa pine, and larch stands but also reported use of mixed conifer and cedar-hemlock. The minimum canopy cover selected by pileated woodpeckers for nesting stands ranges from 15 to 60 percent depending on the habitat type (Bull et al. 1992 Warren 1990, Bull and Holthausen 1993, Bonar 2001).  There are 8,160 acres (19% of the Analysis Area) of currently suitable nesting in the Project area. About 3,000 acres of Douglas-fir habitat was attacked by tussock moth in 2011. Tree mortality is expected to increase in the area in combination with mortality caused by root disease which would provide additional nesting and foraging habitat for woodpeckers. Population Trends: The pileated woodpecker is rated as secure across its range (global rank G5) and apparently secure (state rank S4) in Idaho (Digital Atlas of Idaho 2010). There are an estimated 9,000 birds in Northern Idaho (Partners in Flight 2007). Breeding Bird Surveys compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey show an increasing population trend for pileated woodpecker over the past 45 years both at the scale of the Northern Rockies and in Idaho (Sauer et al 2011). The time frame covers almost five decades, including the period when intensive timber harvesting occurred (Bull and Jackson 1995). Samson (2006) concluded that no scientific evidence exists that indicates pileated woodpeckers are declining in the Northern Region. He indicates 90,441 acres are required to maintain a viable pileated woodpecker population in the Forest Service Northern Region. Bush and Lundberg (2008) show 444,789 acres of foraging habitat and 299,667 acres of nesting habitat on the Nez Perce Forest. Based on Bush and Lundberg’s (2008) estimate, the Forest contains over three times more nesting habitat than is needed to provide viability at the Regional level. 3.7.5.13.1 Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action Root disease is prevalent in the Analysis Area and provides a continuous supply of Douglas-fir and grand fir snags which are suitable nesting and foraging trees. Fire suppression would continue. Fuels in the Analysis Area would continue increasing, making the area susceptible to a stand-replacing fire event. A stand replacing event would create snag habitat for pileated woodpeckers. Snags are currently lacking on 22% of the Analysis Area where regeneration harvest has occurred. Habitat quality would improve in these areas as forests mature over time. Overall, suitable habitat would remain available across the area as forest succession continues. Alternatives B, C, and D Under Alternative B, C, and D, pileated woodpecker populations would be expected to continue to display population stability across the Nez Perce National Forest. No activities would occur within MA 20 old growth and RHCAs (35%) of the analysis area) which would provide suitable and connected nesting habitat across the Project area. Regeneration and improvement harvest occurs on 476 acres (6%) of suitable nesting habitat under Alternatives B and C and 373 acres (5%) under Alternative D. Regeneration harvest would reduce habitat quality by simplify habitats by reducing canopy cover and layering, large down wood and standing snags in treated areas. Implementing snag and green tree retention would help limit these effects. Nesting habitat would be available in these areas once canopy closure reaches preferred levels (about 100 years). Commercial thinning would occur on 399 acres (5%) of suitable nesting habitat and would leave 40%–60% of the tree canopy and about 120 overstory trees per acre. Thinning promotes large tree growth and may retain enough structure and canopy to be used by pileated woodpeckers. Removal of some nesting habitat would occur; however snags tend to be limited in these younger stands. The retention of legacy trees, as well as green trees and snags where possible would provide future nesting habitat through time. No landscape burning or improvement harvest occurs in suitable nesting habitat. 3.7.5.13.2 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effect area is the 43,700-acre Project area, which includes seven old growth analysis areas. The cumulative effects timeframe is 150 years because it would take this long for regeneration harvest areas to develop old-growth habitat. Cumulative effects were also assessed using old-growth forest because pileated woodpecker are an old growth MIS. Alternative A–No Action The potential cumulative effects of this alternative are the same as those described under the direct and indirect effects of the No Action alternative. There is a potential for cumulative effects; however levels cannot be determined because estimating the size and severity of potential future fires resulting from fire suppression is not possible. Alternatives B, C, and D Proposed treatments under all alternatives would slightly reduce pileated nesting habitat. Fire suppression would maintain closed canopies in untreated areas potentially improving nesting habitat over time. Suppression also increases the risk of stand replacing fire which could remove nesting habitat. Treatments would reduce the crown fire (stand replacement) potential by 7% across the project area. Snags would continue to be available across the landscape in untreated areas especially where insect and disease events occur. The OGAAs contain 6% to 22% verified old growth (see Old Growth section) which would provide nesting habitat for pileated woodpeckers over time. RHCAs cover 24% of the Project area and would be managed for old growth habitat which would also provide habitat for pileated woodpeckers. No measurable cumulative effects to pileated woodpecker populations at the local or regional scale, or alteration of current population trend, are expected. This is based on increasing populations and the availability of unaffected suitable nesting habitats in the Analysis Area and across the Forest and region. 3.7.5.14 Rocky Mountain Elk Elk is a MIS for commonly hunted big game species on the Forest. Elk are habitat generalists and use a diversity of forest types and structures that provide forage and hiding cover. They forage in meadows and early seral communities from spring through early summer, use more closed canopies from late summer through fall and rely upon low elevation, warm aspect, and snow-free or snow-limited areas for foraging in the winter. Adult bulls often winter at much higher elevations than cows and immature elk. Elk also require forest cover for security. Preferred calving sites are generally large meadows, shrub fields, and early seral forest openings in close proximity to water. Population Trends: Elk populations in the Analysis Area were relatively insignificant until a series of major fire events occurred in 1919, 1928, and 1934. These significantly increased forage availability and population levels. Elk also benefited from predator control efforts. The Analysis Area falls in the Idaho Department of Fish and game Elk City Elk Management Zone and is in Management Unit 16. Recent (2008) elk population surveys in the unit showed stable cow and slightly elevated bull elk numbers which are slightly up from the 2000 survey. Cow elk numbers currently meet, and bull numbers exceed State population objectives (Table 3-30). However, calf recruitment decreased from 19 calves per 100 cows (from 1990 to 2000) down to 17 in 2008. The calf:cow ratio is an important indicator of population recruitment and long-term herd viability. A ratio of at least 25 calves to 100 cows is needed to offset natural mortality. Reasons for the decline are unclear but may be related to reductions in forage quality (poor condition of cows and low calf weights), high predation rates, less security area, and greater human disturbance and/or hunting pressure. Table 3-30. Elk winter population status and objectives for Management Unit 16 based on the most recent survey (IDFG 2008) Management Unit Survey Year Current Status Population Objectives Cows Bulls Adults Cows Bulls Adults 16 2008 897 275 238 800–1,200 175–250 100–150  3.7.5.14.1 Elk Winter Range The Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987b; III-46) designated MA 16 as big game winter range. The goal for MA 16 is to improve the quality of the winter range habitat for deer and elk through timber harvesting, prescribed burning, and other management practices. Winter range is primarily below 4,500 feet in elevation and has southern-to-western exposures. The vegetative types included are non-forest grasslands, seral brushfields, and timbered lands. High quality forage is an important component of elk winter range. Elk eat grasses, forbs, and the tips of twigs from some woody vegetation. Shrub fields and conifer forests provide a higher proportion of winter forage than grassland sites. Species such as redstem ceanothus, serviceberry, mountain maple, choke and bitter cherry, and syringa provide much of the winter forage available to elk. The Analysis Area has 15,600 acres of MA 16 winter range (35% of the Analysis Area). Elk also use non-MA 16 areas. Additional winter range is interspersed in the summer range EAAs. A collaborative effort with the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation to map elk winter range in Idaho identified approximately 28,798 acres of winter habitat in the Analysis Area (66% of area). Fifty-nine percent of it occurs on the western redcedar/grand fir and Douglas-fir/grand fir breakland settings. Winter habitat occurs on 39% of the western redcedar/grand fir upland setting during more mild winter conditions. Most of the MA 16 winter range is closed to motorized use or part of the Clear Creek Roadless Area, providing high levels of secure habitat during the winter months. Most of the wintering elk in Clear Creek are found in Solo Creek and upper Clear Creek where low open road densities provide security areas from winter recreation disturbances. Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action There would be no direct effects to elk winter range under Alternative A because no activities would occur. Winter range forage quality and quantity would decline as tree canopy cover continues to increase due to vegetative succession continues. Insects and disease would continue to create canopy gaps which provide openings for a continuous supply of shrubs, forbs, and grasses, although it is very limited when compared to the forage produced from wildfire. Fire suppression would increase the susceptibility to wildfire due to increased fuel loading. A large fire could significantly increase the amount of winter forage and would decrease cover; however predicting the time and size is not possible. Forage quantity would again decline and hiding cover restored about 20 years after a fire as trees regenerate. About 2,400 acres of regeneration harvest has occurred in MA 16 with 842 acres occurring since 1990. Sixty-five percent of these areas are too old (>20 years) to provide high quantity and quality forage. Those occurred since 1990 are moving into the hiding cover stage and only provide low quantities of forage. Alternative A does nothing to create early seral habitats that would provide high quantities of quality forage. Alternatives B, C, and D Regeneration and improvement harvest would be conducted on 1,497 acres (10%), 1,925 acres (12%), and 1,104 acres (7%) of MA 16 winter range under Alternatives B, C, and D, respectively. Harvest would reduce elk hiding cover habitat by 10%, 12%, and 7% for the Action Alternatives. All alternatives use landscape burning on 1,370 acres (9%) of MA 16. Burning in late summer or early fall would increase coverage of shrub species and mimic natural fire seasons. Burning would reduce hiding cover by up to 9% but could be less depending on fire severity. The proposed treatments would reduce tree canopy cover and allow sunlight, water and nutrients to be more available to shrubs, forbs, and grasses which would increase forage production on winter range. Forage quality may increase as a result of burning. Post-harvest burning in the fall would stimulate resprouting of important shrubs such as redstem and Schouler willow. These two species are often absent from new openings after harvest and may not re-establish in the absence of fire. Orme and Leege (1976) showed that fall burning produced over three times the seedlings than did spring burning. Higher quality forage would benefit cow elk during winter months. Forage quantity would increase for 20–30 years or until tree canopy cover closes and forage plants begin declining. Alternative C (21%) provides the greatest benefit to elk winter forage, followed by Alternative B (19%) and D (16%). Commercial thinning occurs on 953 acres (6%), 647 acres (4%), and 775 acres (5%) of the winter range under Alternatives B, C, and D, respectively. Thinning would have short term (<10 years) benefits on elk winter range forage. Thinning retains 40-60% of the canopy cover which limits shrub growth. Hiding cover would be slightly reduced under all alternatives. Precommercial thinning occurs on 560 acres (4%) of the winter range and would have minimal effects on elk winter forage as much of the canopy cover is retained which limits shrub growth. Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects analysis is the 43,700 acre Project area. The timeframe is 20 years because this is the time when tree canopy cover would begin to close and reduce the quality of elk winter forage. Alternative A—No Action The cumulative effects for this alternative are the same as described under the direct and indirect effects of the alternative. There would be a continued decline in elk winter forage quantity and quality if no wildfires occur. Forage could increase in the event of a wildfire however it is not possible to predict the amount or location. Alternatives B, C, and D The Action Alternatives would conduct regeneration or improvement harvest and landscape burning on up to 30% of MA 16 winter range. These treatments would create early seral habitats that provide high quantities of quality forage for about 20 years. Insects and disease would continue to create openings for the limited growth of shrubs, forbs, and grasses. Fire suppression would continue and fuels would continue to increase in untreated areas. A large fire could significantly increase the amount of winter forage and would decrease hiding cover for elk; however predicting the time and size is not possible. Habitats would be less susceptible to wildfire because proposed treatments reduce crown fire potential on 7% of the Analysis area. 3.7.5.14.2 Elk Summer Range Existing Conditions The majority of the Analysis Area is considered summer range for elk. Important habitat components for elk include foraging sites, hiding cover, calving areas, rutting, and security areas. Forage availability and abundance has declined throughout the area due to a lack of disturbance (fire, timber harvest) and subsequent increases in tree copy cover. Hiding cover is available in forested stands that are 20 years or older. “Guidelines for Evaluating and Managing Summer Elk Habitat in Northern Idaho” (Leege 1984) was used to evaluate summer elk range and considers road open road density, livestock grazing, and cover-forage ratios. The Forest Plan objective for summer range EHE is to achieve a minimum of 50% effectiveness in each EAA. There are seven EAA and all units currently meet the objective (Table 3-31). Table 3-31. Elk summer range habitat effectiveness by alternative in the Clear Creek Analysis Area. The Forest Plan objective is 50% for each Elk Analysis Area (EAA). Elk Analysis Area (EAA) EAA Acres Summer Habitat Effectiveness (%) Alternative A Existing Alternative B Alternative C Alternative D S.

Summer range would be more susceptible to wildfire when compared to the Action Alternatives due to increasing fuel loads resulting from fire suppression. A large wildfire would reduce hiding cover in the short-term (10–20 years) but would increase forage. All EAAs would continue to meet the Forest Plan objective of 50% (Table 3-31). Alternatives B, C, and D Regeneration and improvement harvest and prescribed fire would remove hiding cover while increasing summer forage in the Project area. Alternative B treats 4, 311 acres (10%), Alternative C treats 5,858 acres (13%), and Alternative C treats 3,760 acres (9%) of the Project area. Forage quantity would increase for 20–30 years and then decline as tree canopy cover closes. Improvements in the quantity and quality of forage would improve the condition of cow elk going into winter and ultimately improve calf survival. Reductions in elk habitat effectiveness occur in all but one EAA under all Action Alternatives (Table 3-31). These result from shifts in the distribution from hiding cover to forage. Reductions occur because some created openings are greater than 800 feet from hiding cover. Elk use in forage areas is reduced when distances to hiding cover exceeds 800 feet (Leege 1984). Although the proposed treatments would reduce EHE, all EAAs remain within the minimum Forest Plan objective (Table 3-31). Elk populations are expected to respond favorably to proposed treatments due to increased foraging opportunities. Commercial and precommercial thinning has no effect on the calculations for elk habitat effectiveness (Leege 1984). Cumulative Effects The geographic boundary for assessing cumulative effects on elk summer habitat effectiveness is the combined seven EAAs within the 43,700 acre Project area. The time frame for cumulative effects is 20 years, which is the time it takes for new plantations to restore elk hiding cover in the harvested areas. Alternative A- No Action There would be no direct or indirect, and therefore no cumulative effects to modeled EHE since fire suppression is not considered in the model. Alternatives B, C, and D- Action Alternatives There would be no direct or indirect, and therefore no cumulative effects to modeled EHE since fire suppression is not considered in the model. All activities maintain EHE above Forest Plan minimum levels. 3.7.5.14.3 Elk Security Existing Conditions Security areas are places where wildlife can retreat for safety when affected by disturbance. In general, security areas are over 250 acres in size and >0.5 miles from an open road or trail. The Hillis et al. (1991) guidelines for elk security area recommend that an elk analysis unit have at least 30% secure habitat. All but one EAA meets the recommended guideline (Table 3-32). Unauthorized motorized use is occurring in the Analysis Area but the level is low and seasonally isolated to a few roads. Table 3-32. Security areas in Clear Creek Elk analysis areas Elk Analysis Area (EAA) Name Existing (%) South Fork Clear Creek 71 Clear Creek 1 51 Clear Creek 2 62 Clear Creek 3 16 Pine Knob* 34 Brown Springs 45 Solo Creek 49  Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action There would be no direct or indirect effects to elk security since no changes to motorized access would occur. Alternatives B, C, and D There would be no direct effect to security areas because none of the alternatives construct permanent roads or change access restrictions on existing roads or trails. Roads proposed for decommissioning are currently closed or are impassable to motorized vehicles due to fallen trees or thick vegetation. Decommissioning would have minimal effects on current elk security. Decommissioning would permanently prevent any future motorized access which would maintain elk security areas indefinitely. Indirectly, regeneration harvest in security areas would create openings and potentially increase vulnerability to hunters. The risk is considered low and with security being reduced from 1% to 11% of security areas. All but one EAA maintains security areas above the recommended 30%. The Clear Creek 3 EAA currently does not meet the recommendation and would be further reduced by 3%. This EAA occurs within the upper West Fork Clear Creek/Hoodoo Creek area and is not likely to ever meet security recommendations due to the number and location of open roads that occur throughout it. Disturbance to individual animals would occur during project implementation but would only last while units are being harvested. The design feature of harvesting units at the far of a road first would reduce disturbance to elk by limiting continuous logging traffic in these areas. Regeneration harvest effects on security would last 20 years until hiding cover is re-established in these areas. Cumulative Effects Alternative A—No Action There would be no direct or indirect, and therefore no cumulative effects to modeled elk security since fire suppression is not considered in the model. Alternatives B, C, and D There would be no direct or indirect, and therefore no cumulative effects to modeled elk security since fire suppression is not considered in the model. Road decommissioning from the South Fork/West Fork EA was already considered in the existing condition. 3.7.5.15 Shiras Moose Moose are a Forest MIS representing hunted big game species and old-growth/Pacific yew habitats. Moose in north-central Idaho select dense Pacific yew stands in old-growth grand fir communities during winter (Pierce and Peek 1984). Suitable habitats are characterized by an overstory of old growth grand fir and an understory of Pacific yew (a primary winter forage species for moose). An increase in the frequency and extent of yew has likely resulted from fire suppression; however timber harvest has likely reduced it in these same areas. Pacific yew was typically slashed and burned during regeneration timber harvest practices prior to 1987 (Crawford 1983 and Stickney 1980). From 1987 to 1991, harvest and burning were constrained in areas allocated to moose winter range. Since 1992, timber harvest and burning in Pacific yew stands have been reduced considerably based on the Conservation Guidelines for Pacific Yew (USDA 1992). Past harvest has reduced patch size and interior conditions, and isolated Pacific yew stands. The Forest Plan designated MA 21 as grand fir/Pacific yew communities to be managed for moose winter range. The goal in MA 21 is to provide for the continuing presence of Pacific yew suitable for moose winter habitat. The Forest Plan contains Management standards and practices for timber harvest and fire management can be found in the Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987b, pg. III-59). There are 3,686 acres (8%) of MA 21 in the Analysis Area and of it all occurs in the southern third of the area. There are 2,700 acres (77%) of currently suitable moose winter range habitat in MA 21. The other 23% is not suitable due to past harvest, most of which occurred in, or prior to, the 1980s. Harvest resulted in the creation of patchy areas of suitable habitat. There are 8 patches ranging in size from 8 to 2,658 acres (mean=599). The two largest patches are over 1,400 acres. Past timber harvest and postharvest site preparation (hand, mechanical, and burning) reduced the winter habitat suitability for moose through the removal of the conifer overstory and the Pacific yew understory. The Forest Plan limits the amount of MA 21 regeneration harvest to 5% per decade and prescribes the retention of 50% of the live yew component scattered throughout the harvest unit in one-quarter to one-half acre patches. The preferred harvest type is patch clearcuts (preferably 5-10 acres and no more than 20 acres), individual tree selection, group selection or shelterwood. Leave strips between yew stands should also be retained to provide travel corridors for moose. There is additional moose winter range totaling 8,156 acres outside of MA 21 in areas of subalpine fir (VRUs 1 and 10) and in smaller patches of grand fir/ yew in the headwater of the Project area (VRU 7). These are included in the effects analysis below but do not require the same Forest Plan guidelines as MA 21. Desired conditions for these areas are to retain a variety of conifer species including grand fir, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, western red cedar, Douglas-fir, western larch, lodgepole pine, and Pacific yew. These areas help to support moose populations in the project area. Suitable and potential summer range for moose is available throughout the mid- and upper elevations of the Analysis Area. Peek et al. (1987) recommended no more than about 45% of MA 21 should be in an age class younger than 90 years, and no more than 14% should be logged in any 30-year period. Roughly 835 acres (23%) of MA 21 is currently younger than 90 years old and 388 acres (11%) was harvested between 1982 and 2012. The area currently meets these recommendations. Population Trends: The Analysis Area is in IDFG Management Unit 16. Moose are managed where populations are large enough to support controlled hunts. Management Unit 16 currently has 4 antlered moose harvest permits which is down from 14 to 17 permits issued since 2000. Population levels of moose have fluctuated noticeably over time. Several sets of moose tracks were observed both within MA 21 and outside of it during field surveys. 3.7.5.15.1 Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action There would be no direct or indirect effects under this alternative since no activities would occur. MA 21 habitats would continue to provide moose winter habitat. Old grand fir trees would die of insects and disease, creating canopy gaps where small patches of regenerating trees would develop. This process would perpetuate the multistory conditions characteristic of grand fir/Pacific yew winter range. Outside of MA 21, in VRUs 1, 7, and 10, this process would also occur. Alternatives B, C, and D Regeneration harvest would occur on 130 acres (3%), 161 acres (4%), and 49 acres (1%) of MA 21 for Alternatives B, C, and D, respectively. This harvest type would reduce mature grand fir levels within treatment units, limiting the development of future old growth grand fir. Design features would limit patch size and retain overstory trees and existing Pacific yew in order to maintain a presence and perpetuate moose winter range. Regeneration harvest in MA 21 may slightly fragment moose winter habitat, but silvicultural prescriptions consistent with the Forest Plan would be applied to minimize effects. All grand fir and Pacific yew would be retained within PACFISH buffers which would provide a future seed source for grand fir and yew and also provide travel corridors for moose. None of the Action Alternatives would exceed the 5% per decade harvest requirement for MA 21. Regeneration harvest would occur on 329 acres and 345 acres (4%) under Alternatives B and C, and 255 acres (3%) for Alternative D, outside of MA 21 on moose winter range. Mature grand fir trees would be removed within treatment units, limiting the development of old growth grand fir. All trees, including grand fir and yew (in VRU 7) would be retained within PACFISH buffers which would provide a future seed source for grand fir and also provide moose travel corridors. Moose summer and winter habitat would continue to be available. Precommercial thinning would occur on 283 acres (8%) of MA 21 under all alternatives. Commercial thinning would occur on 363 acres (10%), 332 acres (9%), and 298 acres (8%) of MA 21 under Alternative B, C and D respectively. Precommercial thinning would occur on 248 acres (3%) outside of MA 21 on moose winter range. Commercial thinning activities would occur outside of MA 21 on moose winter range on 625 acres (8%) for Alternative B and 581 acres and 607 acres (7%) for Alternatives C and D. Thinning would not affect suitable moose winter habitat as little to no Pacific yew remains in the stands due to past harvest and site preparation. Thinning would favor early seral species and Douglas-fir limiting the availability of grand-fir in the future. Some grand fir is present and would be retained in the stands due to tree spacing requirements and natural regeneration as stands age. Grand fir would also be retained in PACFISH buffers which would provide a future seed source for the species and suitable habitat for moose. The Alternatives B and D would meet both recommendations as described by Peek et al. (1987). Alternative C would exceed the amount of regeneration harvest over a 30 year period by 1%. Alternative B, C, and D would increase harvested areas to 14%, 15%, and 12%, respectively. The amount of stands under the age of 90 years would be increased to 26%, 27, and 24% for each of the alternatives, respectively and would remain well below 45%. 3.7.5.15.2 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects area is the 43,700 acre project area. This area contains all MA 21, all grand fir/yew habitats, and provides general moose habitat. The time frame for cumulative effects is 30 years as that is the time it takes for a closed canopy to develop over understory yew trees in harvest units with Forest Plan MA 21 retention requirements. Alternative A- No Action There could be minor cumulative effects under this alternative from fire suppression which would increase the risk of stand replacing fire in the Project Area. This type of fire could kill existing yew and create large canopy openings where yew would have low survival. Predicting the size and severity of wildfire is not possible so the level of potential cumulative effects cannot be determined. Alternatives B, C, and D The Action Alternatives would reduce grand fir habitat slightly (<4%) but would be within Forest Plan guidelines for MA 21. Project activities would reduce the risk of stand replacing fire on 7% of the Project area which would reduce the potential impacts to MA 21 and other moose habitat. Fire suppression would continue but the risk of fire would be lessened under these alternatives when compared to the No Action Alternative. Predicting the size and severity of wildfire is not possible so the level of potential cumulative effects cannot be determined. 3.8 WATERSHED This section summarizes the effects of the alternatives on the watershed resources. This section was summarized from the “Clear Creek Restoration Project Watershed Report,” located in the project record.  Analysis Area 3.8.1The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project encompasses 43,730 acres within the Clear Creek watershed (5th field HUC #1706030401). Clear Creek is a tributary to the Middle Fork Clearwater River. The direct and indirect effect areas for the sediment yield and road density indicators are the 10 Forest Plan prescription watersheds. The effect areas for the water yield indicator are the 3 subwatersheds (6th field HUC) within the project area: Upper Clear Creek, South Fork Clear Creek, and Lower Clear Creek. The cumulative effects area for all indicators is the Clear Creek watershed (5th field HUC).  Regulatory Framework 3.8.2Nez Perce Forest Plan direction and all federal and State laws and regulations applicable to watershed resources would be applied to the Clear Creek project, including the Clean Water Act, Idaho Water Quality Standards, Idaho Forest Practices Act, Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act, and EOs 11988 and 11990. The Clear Creek project was designed to comply with the Clean Water Act, Idaho Water Quality Standards, Idaho Forest Practices Act, Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act, and EOs 11988 and 11990. All major streams in the project area would have improved or maintained water quality conditions and would continue to support beneficial uses. 3.8.2.1 Nez Perce National Forest Plan Forest standards for water resources are found in the Nez Perce National Forest Plan on pages II-21 through II-22 (USDA Forest Service 1987b) and include the following: • Apply BMPs to project activities to ensure water quality standards are met or improved. • Use R1/R4 sediment and water yield guidelines. • Evaluate site-specific water quality effects and complete cumulative watershed effects analysis. • Meet fish/water quality objectives as outlined in Forest Plan Appendix A (including Forest Plan amendments 5, 11, and 26). Guidelines for percent sediment yield over base and for entry level frequency per decade are established to approximate the maximum sediment yield allowable to meet fish/water quality objectives. The Forest Plan was amended in 1995, following a joint decision (commonly called PACFISH) by the U.S. Forest Service and BLM for managing anadromous fish-producing watersheds on federal lands (Forest Plan Amendment 20). This amendment also includes direction for restoration opportunities and cooperation with other agencies and individuals. PACFISH buffer widths exceed State BMP standards. Forest Plan standards for water quality (USDA Forest Service 1987b, pp. II-21 to II-22 and Appendix A) apply to this project, and compliance would be achieved via project design features, BMPs, effects analyses, and field reviews (Table 3-33). Table 3-33. Compliance with Nez Perce National Forest Plan water standards Standard Numbera Subject Summary Compliance Method Nez Perce Forest Plan Standards 1 Apply Idaho Water Quality Standards and BMPs. Project design features and BMPs listed in Chapter 2 2 Utilize R1/R4 sediment yield and R1 water yield guidelines. Effects analysis 3 Evaluate site-specific water quality effects. Field reviews (conducted in 2011 and 2012) 4 Complete watershed cumulative effects analysis. A cumulative watershed effects analysis for the Middle Fork Clearwater River was completed for this project. 8 Meet fish and water quality objectives in Forest Plan Appendix A (includes Forest Plan amendments 5, 11, and 26).

Included in these standards are provisions for identifying beneficial uses, establishing the status of beneficial uses, setting water quality criteria, and establishing BMPs to control nonpoint sources of pollution. EO 12088 also requires the Forest Service to meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act. Section 313 of the Clean Water Act requires federal agencies to comply with all federal, state, interstate, and local requirements with respect to control and abatement of water pollution, and to cooperate with relevant processes and sanctions and administrative authority. Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act stipulates that states must identify and prioritize water bodies that are water quality limited (i.e., water bodies that do not meet water quality standards). For waters identified on this list, states must develop a total maximum daily load (TMDL) for the pollutants, set at a level to achieve water quality standards. No streams in the project area are listed for pollutants in the EPA-approved 303(d)/305(b) 2010 Integrated Report (IDEQ 2011). Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires permits to dredge or fill within waters of the United States. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers administers these provisions. Culvert removal and replacement activities proposed under the Clear Creek project would require authorization under section 404, through application of either nationwide or site-specific permits. Section 402 of the Clean Water Act discusses permitting under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). The Clear Creek project may require an NPDES permit. A recent court case, Northwest Environmental Defense Center v. Brown, 640 F.3d 1063 (9th Cir. 2011), held that stormwater runoff associated with logging roads that flows into systems of ditches, culverts, and channels before being discharged into forest streams and rivers is a point source discharge requiring an NPDES permit. Because the Forest Service was not a party to the case, the Ninth Circuit’s decision did not impose any affirmative duties on the Forest Service. Permanent legislation is pending in both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives that would amend section 402 of the Clean Water Act to exempt stormwater discharges resulting from silvicultural activities from NPDES permit requirements. Due to these factors, potential NPDES permitting requirements for stormwater discharges from logging roads in the Clear Creek project area are still uncertain. If legislation should determine that an NPDES permit is required for this project, the Forest Service will comply with any applicable NPDES permitting requirements. 3.8.2.3 Idaho Water Quality Standards EPA regulations require each state to adopt an antidegradation policy as one component of its water quality standards. The objective of the Idaho Anti-degradation Policy is, at a minimum, to maintain and protect existing instream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect those uses (IDAPA 16.012501.01). Beneficial uses and water quality criteria and standards are identified in the Idaho Water Quality Standards and Wastewater Treatment Requirements (IDAPA 58.01.02, IDAPA 37.03.02). 3.8.2.3.1 Idaho Forest Practices Act This legislation regulates forest practices on all land ownership in Idaho. Forest practices on NFS lands must adhere to the rules pertaining to water quality (IDAPA 20.02.01). These rules are also incorporated as BMPs in the Idaho Water Quality Standards. 3.8.2.3.2 Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act This legislation regulates stream channel alterations between mean high water marks on perennial streams in Idaho. Instream activities on NFS lands must adhere to the rules pertaining to the Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act (IDAPA 37.03.07). These rules are also incorporated as BMPs in the Idaho Water Quality Standards. 3.8.2.3.3 Executive Orders 11988 and 11990 These orders provide for protection and management of floodplains and wetlands.  Resource Indicators 3.8.3Water Quality and Quantity: All Clear Creek project activities should maintain or improve water quality. The Clear Creek project would therefore be designed to produce no measurable increase in bacteria, nutrients, oil and grease, inorganics, sediment, or temperature. The balance of water yield and sediment yield in a watershed influences the water quality/quantity of a stream system. Water yield refers to stream flow quantity and timing and is a function of water, soil, and vegetation interactions. Changes in amount or distribution of vegetation can affect water yield and ultimately alter stream channel conditions. A measurement of 25%–30% equivalent clear-cut area (ECA) is generally recognized as an indication that water yield has increased beyond acceptable limits (Gerhardt 2000). Active erosion of the landscape yields sediment to streams and occurs naturally. When an excess of sediment—that is, over the natural (balanced) amount—is delivered to a stream, the stream’s ability to route the sediment out of the system is diminished, and water quality is reduced. Harvest and road-related activities have the potential to increase erosion production and sediment delivery into streams. Roads influence both water quantity and quality. Roads concentrate surface water and are a source of sediment entering streams. Watershed road densities >3 miles per square mile (mi/mi2) are categorized as low condition (i.e., poor conditions for watershed resources) (NOAA 1998). Resource Indicators: • Percent increase in ECA • Percent sediment yield increased over base (natural), as modeled by NEZSED • Reduction in watershed road miles  Analysis Methodology 3.8.4GIS-generated reports and maps, aerial photos, and field reviews were used to analyze effects to water quality and quantity from the Clear Creek proposed activities. Resource condition observations were conducted in the field during 2011 and 2012. Headwater channels, ephemeral swales, and springs/seeps in the proposed treatment units and downstream of them were examined and recorded on a map. Forest stand database (FSVeg) queries were conducted to identify past harvest activities and the time frame during which they occurred (see project file). Information from the Selway and Middle Fork Clearwater Rivers Subbasin Assessment (USDA Forest Service 2001) and from the Clear Creek Watershed NFMA Assessment (2012) was used to develop the existing condition and cumulative effects evaluation. Models were used to provide estimates, not absolutes, for comparison of alternatives. An ECA analysis using treatment and recovery coefficients from Ager and Clifton (2005) was conducted to determine existing and percent increase in ECA. The NEZSED model was used to estimate the predicted percent increase in sediment yield over base (natural) conditions to determine if thresholds from Forest Plan Appendix A would be exceeded. The methodology for using the NEZSED model is described in detail in the Forest’s guidance document, Implementation Guide to Appendix A of the Nez Perce National Forest Plan (Conroy and Thompson 2011). Sediment yield is calculated in tons per year and reported as “percent increase over base” conditions. Sediment yield is calculated for base conditions (without management activities), current conditions (cumulative of past and existing management activities combined with base conditions), and predicted conditions (cumulative of past, existing, and proposed activities combined with base conditions) for each of the proposed project alternatives. These percentages of sediment yield over base conditions are then compared to the sediment yield guidelines for prescription watersheds listed in Appendix A of the Forest Plan. Disturbance entries or the numbers of large activities in a decade are also calculated to compare with guidelines established in Appendix A of the Forest Plan. Additional information about the models used in this analysis can be found in the project file.  Affected Environment 3.8.53.8.5.1 Watershed Descriptions The Clear Creek project area (43,730 acres) is encompassed by the Clear Creek watershed, which flows into the Middle Fork Clearwater River. The 58,990-acre Clear Creek watershed contains 3 subwatersheds: Upper Clear Creek, South Fork Clear Creek, and Lower Clear Creek. These subwatersheds are divided into 10 Forest Plan prescription watersheds. The existing conditions of the watersheds are shown in Table 3-34. Watershed boundaries and stream locations are displayed in Figure 3-8 and Figure 3-9. No municipal water supplies or source waters are within, adjacent to, or downstream of the project area. The entire Clear Creek drainage is 65,000 acres; however, the Leitch Creek and Little Cedar Creek subwatersheds were not considered in the analysis, as they have no Forest Service ownership within them. A search of water rights applications, permits, decrees, licenses, claims, and transfers was made for the areas located in the Clear Creek project area. Twenty water rights were identified: 19 for the U.S. Forest Service and 1 for the State of Idaho. Uses include minimum stream flow, stock water, and federal reserved use. Further details of each water right are located in the project file. The proposed action alternatives analyzed for this project would not alter any existing water rights claims or decrease the available water relative to these claims. Table 3-34.

Forest Plan prescription watersheds and major streams in the Clear Creek watershed  Figure 3-9. Clear Creek subwatersheds (6th level HUC)  Forested seeps and springs are found throughout the project area and often mark the upper extent of perennial flow. Stream channels range from headwater channels that are relatively steep and confined (Rosgen A) to lower-gradient Rosgen B and C channels (Rosgen and Silvey 1996). During the summers of 2011 and 2012, resource specialists evaluated conditions of headwater perennial and intermittent channels, ephemeral draws, and springs and seeps within and downstream of the proposed project area. In addition, temperature data and instream channel conditions of major streams were gathered (see fisheries report). Channels are primarily stable, not entrenched, and are fully accessible to their floodplains (which are generally less than 30 feet wide). Banks are stable, and channel substrate consists of silts and sands, gravels, and cobbles. Ephemeral draws show no evidence of downcutting. In many of the larger stream channels, bank cutting and deposition from 2011 runoff events were noted. Runoff data obtained from Streamstats (USGS) show that runoff in the Clear Creek watershed was in the >90 percentile range for 2011, indicating flows higher than usual for the area. These streams are in a stable condition, with balanced cutting and deposition. Stream bank damage was noted in locations where livestock cross streams or drink. The amount of disturbance was minimal and mostly near closed-road stream crossings. Beneficial uses and water quality criteria and standards are identified in the Idaho Water Quality Standards and Wastewater Treatment Requirements (IDAPA 58.01.02). Designated Beneficial Uses (IDAPA 58.01.02, Section 120) for the Middle Fork Clearwater River Subbasin are cold water biota, salmonid spawning, domestic water supply, and primary contact recreation. Designated Beneficial Uses for Pine Knob Creek, Browns Spring Creek, and Clear Creek (mainstem) are cold water biota, secondary contact recreation, and salmonid spawning. The Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ) has determined that the streams are fully supporting those beneficial uses (IDEQ 2010 Integrated Report 2011). For those streams not individually listed (undesignated surface waters), beneficial uses include cold water biota and secondary contact recreation. Solo Creek and Middle Fork Clear Creek were found to be fully supporting these beneficial uses, while Kay Creek, South Fork Clear Creek, Hoodoo Creek, and Big Cedar Creek have not been assessed. The IDEQ direction is to improve or maintain water quality conditions in order to support beneficial uses. No streams within the Clear Creek drainage are listed for impairment by pollutants in the EPA-approved 2010 IDEQ 303(d)/305(b) Integrated Report (IDEQ 2011). Conditions in the Clear Creek project area are a result of both natural processes and human activities. Past human-related activities include recreation, fire suppression, road building and maintenance, and harvest activities (1950s–2000s). Past harvest and associated road construction have had the most impact, with some increases in water yield and sediment yield. Harvest activities (Forest Service lands only) have occurred on 5%–70% of each watershed in the Clear Creek project area Table 3-34. Water Yield: Compaction, disturbance, or removal of the ground surface and disturbance or removal of vegetation can alter water yield. Water yield refers to stream flow quantity and timing; water yield measurements are important because stream flow is a key determinant of the energy available for erosion, transport, and deposition of sediment within channels. Increased water yields may be associated with channel scour, bedload movement, or redistribution of sediment in depositional areas. Water yield generally increases after vegetative treatments, due to a reduction in transpiration and precipitation interception losses. Removal of forest canopy can increase snowpack accumulation and melt rates, thereby increasing runoff rate and volume. The presence of roads and skid trails typically increases overland flow due to soil compaction; these impacts are similar to those of canopy removal from timber harvest. No federal, State, or Nez Perce Forest Plan standards govern peak flow increases in Idaho. The Forest Plan calls for maintaining the stability, equilibrium, and function of all streams on the Forest. ECA is often used as an indicator of potential changes in water yield and represents the amount of forest canopy openings in the watershed. Existing roads are considered permanent openings in ECA estimates. The ECA method should only be applied to relatively large vegetation management projects where proposed timber harvest or fuel treatments (or both) would affect large proportions of 6th code hydrologic units. Analysis of water yield is probably not necessary for treatments that remove 20% or less of basal area, because the effects are not likely measurable (Troendle et al. 2009). Effects of thinning, fuel treatments, and partial cuts on water yield are likely to be short-lived and may not even be measurable (Troendle et al. 2009). An ECA analysis using treatment and recovery coefficients from Ager and Clifton (2005) was conducted to determine the existing ECA condition. Past harvest, wildfire, and roads were included in the analysis. Existing ECAs at the 6th field HUC scale range from 2% to 7% (Table 3-34). Each of the subwatersheds is considered in high (good) condition of <15% ECA (NOAA 1998). Sediment Yield: Active erosion of the landscape yields sediment to streams and occurs naturally or as the result of management activities. When an excess of sediment—that is, over the natural (balanced) amount—is delivered to a stream, the stream’s ability to route the sediment out of the system is diminished, and water quality is reduced. Prescription watersheds were assigned fish/water quality objectives in Appendix A of the Forest Plan. These objectives provide management direction in terms of the maximum estimated increase in sediment over baseline conditions that can be approached or equaled for a specific number of years per decade. In 1987, eight of the Forest Plan prescription watersheds did not meet their fish/water quality objectives, and sediment was the primary limiting factor. These same watersheds have an Upward Trend Requirement, which allows timber management to occur, concurrent with improvement efforts, as long as a positive, upward trend in habitat carrying capacity is indicated. Objectives for Big Cedar Creek and Lower Clear Creek Face were not designated, nor were sediment yield guidelines assigned. The sediment yield guidelines (the maximum sediment yield allowable to meet fish/water quality objectives) for each watershed are shown in Table 3-37. Appendix A of the Forest Plan also assigned entry frequency guidelines for each of the watersheds. Few activities have occurred in any of the watersheds in the past 10 years to qualify as an entry, when considering sediment production. The most recent harvest was the Middle Fork timber sale in the Pine Knob Creek drainage in 2005. Roads are a source of sediment to streams, particularly at culvert inlets where cutslope slumping occurs and on roads in need of more drainage structures. Road densities within the prescription watersheds range from 1.6 to 4.8 mi/mi2. A watershed in high (good) condition generally has a road density of <1 mi/mi2. Watersheds with 1–3 mi/mi2 are rated as moderate, and those with >3 mi/mi2 are rated as low (poor) condition (NOAA 1998). Of the 10 Forest Plan prescription watersheds, 5 are rated as moderate condition, and 5 are rated as low condition Table 3-34. The baseline road miles for this project include the 10 miles of road decommissioning that occurred under the South Fork/West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning 2011 decision.  Environmental Consequences 3.8.63.8.6.1 Direct and Indirect Effects Direct and indirect effects areas are the 10 Forest Plan prescription watersheds that contain Clear Creek project activities; these areas represent the lowest level at which effects would be seen. 3.8.6.1.1 Alternative A—No Action Under this alternative, no proposed management actions would occur. Actions occurring on state and private lands would continue. Because no vegetation removal or ground-disturbing activities would occur, no direct effects would result from this alternative. Under Alternative A, road density and road-related erosion (indirect effects) would remain unchanged. Benefits from the reconditioning, reconstruction, and decommissioning of roads, proposed as part of the action alternatives, would not be attained. These roads would continue to be a potential source of sediment and would continue to intercept water and reroute it to stream systems. Alternative A does not propose any new activities that would directly or indirectly affect wetlands or floodplains or increase water temperatures. 3.8.6.1.2 Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives Regeneration, Improvement, and Commercial Thinning The effects of vegetative manipulation on water yield are complex, highly variable, and dependent on many independent factors such as elevation, climate, aspect, and especially precipitation. Removal of vegetation has the potential to increase stream flow in the short term (0–10 years) due to changes in evaporation, precipitation, wind patterns, and soil infiltration and percolation (Fowler et al. 1987; Dunne and Leopold 1978). Alternative B proposes 2,609 acres of regeneration, 5,606 acres of commercial thinning, and 331 acres of improvement. Alternative C proposes 4,156 acres of regeneration, 4,220 acres of commercial thinning, and 331 acres of improvement. Alternative D proposes 2,178 acres of regeneration, 5,141 acres of commercial thinning, and 211 acres of improvement. Table 3-35 displays vegetation removal activities by alternative for the three 6th field HUC subwatersheds. The most harvest occurs under Alternative C, followed by Alternative B, then D. Harvest activities were assessed using ECA and the NEZSED model. Table 3-35.

The ECA analysis takes into account the initial percentage of crown removal and the recovery through vegetative regrowth since the initial disturbance. Existing roads are considered permanent openings in ECA estimates. The analysis takes a simple snapshot in time, with the assumption that all Clear Creek project activities would be implemented in 1 year. ECA predictions are used to compare alternatives and are not viewed as absolutes. This water yield indicator serves only as a red flag that suggests a potential for decreased stability due to sustained increased energy in the stream channel. The ECA method was developed to address concerns about water yield increases and potential effects on channel morphology. In the early 1970s, channel impacts (primarily scouring) were often observed, and these impacts were thought to be caused by water yield increases. During that period, clear-cutting was common, timber harvest levels were substantially higher, and impacts to streams were common. Forest management practices have changed dramatically since that time. Streams have buffers of 100–300 feet on both sides of the watercourse, and BMPs are implemented on all projects. All of these changes have greatly reduced the impacts of forest management on stream channels and aquatic habitat. The estimated percent increase in ECA from harvest activities, temporary road construction, and prescribed burning ranges from 6% to 15%, depending on watershed and alternative (Table 3-36). When these increases are added to the existing ECAs, they produce ECA estimates that predict what watershed conditions will be like after the Clear Creek project. These ECA estimates range from 9% to 18% for Alternatives B and C, and from 7% to 16% for Alternative D. The highest increases in ECA occur under Alternative C, followed by Alternative B, then D. Table 3-36.

At the 6th field HUC level, ECAs of <15% indicate high (good) condition. ECAs of 15%–30% indicate moderate condition, and ECAs of >30% are considered low (poor) condition (NOAA 1998). Watershed condition for the ECA indicator would move from high condition to moderate condition for the Upper Clear Creek subwatershed for all action alternatives and for Lower Clear Creek subwatershed for Alternative C. These numbers are at the low end of the moderate category. As stated above, these ECA estimates are based on the assumption that all project activities would occur in 1 year. In reality, these activities would be staggered over several years. Much research has been conducted on harvest activities and the potential for increased peak flows and water yield. Most of these studies looked at clear-cut activities in areas with openings of >2–5 tree heights and no riparian buffers. Regeneration harvest accounts for <8% of any of the subwatersheds. Proposed variable tree retention levels of 14–22 tpa would result in openings of 50–100 feet (1 tree height), on average. Field assessments confirmed that streams in the project area are in stable condition, and changes in channel conditions are not expected to occur. Ground-disturbing harvest activities can also increase sediment loads in the intermittent and small perennial channels within and adjacent to treatment units (0–2 years). Topography, retained woody material, and PACFISH buffers would capture and store most of the material. As ground cover is reestablished, hillslope erosion would diminish (0–3 years). The NEZSED model was used to estimate the predicted percent increase in sediment yield from the proposed activities under Alternatives B, C, and D. The predicted increases in sediment production by the NEZSED model are for relative comparison to existing conditions and do not reflect actual instream sediment yields expected from the project. The NEZSED model results have their primary utility in comparing differences between each proposed alternative and the existing condition; model results are also useful for comparing the proposed alternative to the guidelines of Appendix A of the Forest Plan. A more detailed discussion of the NEZSED model is in the Forest Plan Appendix A guidance document (Conroy and Thompson 2011). As shown in Table 3-37, each of the prescription watersheds would remain below the sediment yield guidelines allowable under Forest Plan Appendix A (USDA Forest Service 1987b), under all alternatives. The highest increases were found in Alternative C, followed by Alternative B, then D. Table 3-37.

With no activities qualifying as entries in 9 of the prescription watersheds in the last decade, all alternatives are within Forest Plan Appendix A guidelines for sediment yield. For Pine Knob Creek, an entry was made in 2005 for the Middle Fork timber sale. This watershed is allowed 2 entries per decade, so it also meets the Forest Plan guideline. Implementation of project design measures, adherence to BMPs, and maintenance of PACFISH buffers would reduce potential erosion and further limit the risk of sediment reaching streams. Any sediment yield increases would be short-term (0–6 years), and beneficial uses in Clear Creek and the Middle Fork Clearwater River would be maintained. Prescribed Burning Low- and mixed-severity prescribed fire is proposed on 1,370 acres in 15 units (701 – 715) for all action alternatives. This activity is assessed using ECA and the NEZSED model. Precommercial Thinning Although precommercial thinning would cause some opening of the canopy, ECA would not increase; therefore, water yield would not increase either. Ground vegetation would be left undisturbed. Thinning would be completed with chainsaws, so no ground-disturbing activities would take place; therefore, neither soil erosion nor sediment input to streams would increase. Temporary Road Construction Approximately 36 miles of temporary roads would be constructed to access harvest units for Alternatives B and C, 8.7 miles of which occur on existing templates. Alternative D proposes 17.5 miles of temporary roads, including 8.7 miles located on existing templates. Temporary roads generate the most erosion when they are first constructed, and lesser erosion would occur during the 1–2 years the proposed roads would be open. Erosion would stabilize 2 years after decommissioning occurs. Temporary roads were included in the ECA and NEZSED analyses. Increase in ECA from temporary road construction is <1% for all watersheds. Increase in peak flow from this activity is unlikely. The erosion potential from temporary roads would be short-term (0–5 years), since the roads would be built, used, and decommissioned over a period of 1–3 years and located on low-gradient, dry ridges or upper slopes, away from water, with no stream crossings. Project design measures for temporary roads would minimize the erosion produced over the short life of these roads. For example, temporary roads would be closed to public motorized use during project activities, reducing the chance of increased erosion from vehicles driving on wet roads and rutted surfaces. Road Maintenance and Reconstruction Approximately 120 miles of roadwork is proposed and would include spot surface gravel placement and possible culvert repairs, replacements, or additional installations to improve drainage. Road maintenance and improvements are considered a beneficial effect to water quality (Burroughs 1990; Grace and Clinton 2006; Switalski et al. 2004; Swift and Burns 1999). Surface graveling has been shown to be effective at reducing erosion from road surfaces, especially at road/stream crossings. Studies have found gravel reduces sediment by 70%–79% (Burroughs and King 1989). Although this activity is designed to reduce sediment input over the long term, a minor increase in sediment is expected to occur in the short term (1 year). Road Decommissioning Road erosion and sediment yield usually decline over time but continue at a chronic level indefinitely (USDA 1981). Approximately 13.2 miles of road are proposed for decommissioning with this project. Road removal would reduce road density (Table 3-38) and provide an improvement in the overall watershed condition. However, even with the proposed road decommissioning, the current (existing) watershed condition ratings would remain the same for each of the watersheds. For Big Cedar Creek, road miles on the Forest Service portion of the watershed were reduced by 20%. Road miles on LSP areas were reduced by 15%. At the 6th field HUC level, road density in Upper Clear Creek went from 3.1 mi/mi2 (high/poor condition) to 2.8 mi/mi2 (moderate condition). In Lower Clear Creek, road density went from 3.0 mi/mi2 to 2.9 mi/mi2. South Fork Clear Creek road density remained moderate at 1.8 mi/mi2. Table 3-38.

The proposed road decommissioning projects include the removal of culverts, which would improve stream bank stability, width-to-depth ratio, and floodplain connectivity at localized sites. Some short-term sediment delivery is expected in the smaller tributaries that bisect the decommissioned roads. Sediment would be delivered during project implementation and during the stream channel stabilization period of 2–3 years. Road decommissioning activities would produce some short-term sediment, both temporally and spatially (Foltz et al. 2007). Past monitoring of obliteration showed only minor amounts of sediment delivered to headwater streams, mostly in the form of suspended sediment, as indicated by increases in turbidity. Design criteria and BMPs would be applied to each of these activities to minimize increases of sediment delivery to stream channels. Road decommissioning may produce short-term (0–3 years) and localized sediment increases, but it would produce both immediate and long-term recovery benefits. Water Temperature The Clear Creek project is not expected to increase stream water temperatures, due to implementation of PACFISH buffers (see “Aquatics” section). Floodplains and Wetlands No activities, other than roadwork, are proposed in floodplains or wetlands. PACFISH buffers would be implemented along streams and seeps/springs in the commercial and precommercial thin units. The protection of health, safety, and welfare, the prevention of loss of property values, and the maintenance of natural systems would be retained under all of the action alternatives.  Cumulative Effects 3.8.7Cumulative effects arise when the incremental impact of an action is added to impacts from past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions. Past harvest activities and associated road construction have had the most impact, with increases in water yield and sediment yield in the Clear Creek drainage and its tributaries. The cumulative effects area is the Clear Creek watershed (5th field HUC), which encompasses the entire Clear Creek project area. The temporal scope for watershed effects extends from the 1950s to 2037. The beginning date is based on the time frame of the first harvest and road construction activities in the watershed. Evidence from those events is still noticeable on the landscape in the form of old skid trails and landings and the current road system. The scope continues to year 2037, which is approximately 24 years after project implementation, the estimated amount of time required for ECA levels from this project to be no longer perceptible. 3.8.7.1 Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Actions Several timber sales have occurred in the 3 subwatersheds evaluated in this analysis (see project file and ECA analysis). Timber sales conducted between the early 1950s and late 1990s involved many miles of new road construction, little to no tree retention in regeneration harvest areas, and dozer piling of slash. These activities resulted in widespread and persistent impacts on the subwatersheds and caused increased sedimentation and increased water yields. The Forest Service owns 72% of the Clear Creek watershed, and past harvest activities have occurred on approximately 28% of that Forest Service land. Forest practices have changed over the last few decades. Project design measures, BMPs, and Forest Plan guidelines have been developed in order to reduce ground-disturbing activities and subsequent sediment delivery. Operating under dry conditions, implementing PACFISH buffers, retaining trees in regeneration harvest units, and limiting ground-based yarding to slopes <35% have become common practices. Over 30 miles of Forest Service system roads have been decommissioned in the Clear Creek watershed since 1996. This activity produced localized short-term sediment during implementation but created long-term sediment reductions and benefits to overall channel conditions. Present actions include permitted grazing, recreation, fire suppression, road maintenance, and control of noxious weeds using chemical, mechanical, and biological methods. Recreational activities produce little to no impact to water quality or quantity or to floodplain/wetland functions. Most effects from recreation are primarily due to associated road use, especially during wet conditions. Effects from grazing include stream bank instability and reduced water infiltration rates in areas with soil compaction (localized areas). Fire suppression activities are infrequent and limited in size, and road maintenance has minimal short-term effects and long-term benefits (Burroughs and King 1989). The following foreseeable future or concurrent actions may occur in the Clear Creek watershed: • Browns Spring culvert replacements (decision 2012): This activity involves the replacement and upsizing of 2 culverts in the Upper Clear Creek subwatershed. • Eastside Allotment project (decision 2013): This project includes an adaptive management plan to improve pasture and water quality conditions while keeping livestock numbers the same. • Clear Ridge Road Decommissioning (decision 2012): This project proposes 65 miles of nonsystem roads for decommissioning, which will improve water infiltration and reduce soil erosion potential. • Harvest of state of Idaho lands: The Bruin Storm project would seedtree harvest approximately 160 acres in the Lower Clear Creek subwatershed in the next 5 years. • Private land harvest: This project includes undetermined amount and prescription of harvest of private lands in the Crane Hill area (Upper Clear Creek subwatershed) in the next 5 years. The first 3 projects are considered watershed improvement projects and will help to improve water quality and quantity. Any increases in erosion and subsequent sediment yield would be short-term and in isolated locations. The last 2 projects are harvest activities that could increase ECA and soil erosion. The small amount of acreage involved would increase ECA by <1% in the Clear Creek watershed. These projects would follow water and soil quality protection practices regulated through the Idaho Forest Practices Act. 3.8.7.2 Alternative A—No Action Cumulative effects arise when the incremental impact of an action is added to impacts from past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions. Alternative A would create no direct or indirect effects; therefore, no cumulative effects to water yield or sediment yield would occur under this alternative. 3.8.7.3 Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives 3.8.7.3.1 Water Yield Even though NFS lands comprise 72% of the Clear Creek watershed, they contribute 84% of the average annual flow of Clear Creek. Percent increase in ECA is used as an indicator of change in water yield resulting from reductions in forest canopy.

A lower ECA indicates a higher (better) watershed condition. ECAs of <15% indicate high (good) condition (NOAA 1998). The estimated existing ECA for the Clear Creek watershed is 4% and includes past activities on Forest Service, state, and private lands. Estimated increases in ECA from the Clear Creek project are 10% for Alternatives B and C and 9% for Alternative D. When these increases are added to the existing ECAs, they produce ECA estimates that predict what watershed conditions will be like after the Clear Creek project. Final ECA estimates are 14% for Alternatives B and C and 13% for Alternative D. ECA estimates predict that watershed conditions would remain high (good) under all 3 action alternatives. Therefore, no stream channel alteration from increased water yield is expected from the Clear Creek project. As shown in Figure 3-10, ECA would decrease to its pre-project level (4%) after 12 years for Alternatives B and D and after 15 years for Alternative C. ECA from Clear Creek activities would no longer be discernible after 24 years.  Figure 3-10. Percent Equivalent Clearcut Area (ECA) over time for Clear Creek watershed (5th field HUC) New research indicates that water yield increases (and associated effects on streams) may not be as important as previously thought, especially in the context of contemporary forest management. The primary concern about changes in water yield is how they may directly or indirectly affect stream channels, aquatic habitat, and water quality. Numerous studies have documented the effects of forest canopy removal on water yield, but surprisingly, very few have demonstrated a direct link between water yield changes and channel impacts in a forested environment. For example, Grant et al. (2008) conducted a comprehensive literature review and determined no field studies have made a direct link between peak flow increases and channel impacts. Schnakenberg and MacDonald (1998) found no correlation between ECA and stream channel characteristics in forested catchments in Colorado. MacDonald et al. (1995) studied the relationship between WATSED-predicted water yield/peak flow increases and channel characteristics on the Kootenai National Forest. None of the channel types (pool riffle or colluvial step-pool) showed any increase in bankfull width or width-to-depth ratio with more intensive management. However, correlations were found between management indices and sediment characteristics; these correlations suggest that sediment delivery is a more important consideration than water yield. Analysis of reference and managed streams on the Flathead National Forest suggests no relationship between bankfull width and the degree of management (Kendall 2011), a finding that is consistent with the results of MacDonald et al. (1995). Grant et al. (2008) concluded that the effects of peak flow increases are relatively minor in comparison to other anthropogenic changes to streams and watersheds. In general, channel impacts associated with peak flow increases alone are likely to be much less significant than other impacts associated with forest management activities. In general, management-induced increases in peak flow diminish with the percentage of watershed impacted and increasing recurrence interval. Management effects on peak flow events over a 6-year recurrence interval are highly speculative (Grant et al. 2008). 3.8.7.3.2 Sediment Yield Although the NEZSED model did predict an increase in sediment yield, the increase was well below that allowable under Forest Plan Appendix A. In addition, road density in the Clear Creek watershed was reduced from 2.7 mi/mi2 to 2.6 mi/mi2. Figure 3-11 shows the predicted sediment yield generated by the Clear Creek project and routed to the mouth of Clear Creek, for each alternative. This includes the existing sediment yield over base from past project activities, plus the additional sediment yield generated from the Clear Creek project. 0204060801001202011201220132014201520162017201820192020Routed Sediment Yield Over Base  (Tons/Year) Year Sediment Yield Over Base (Natural) Routed to Mouth of Clear Creek Alt.

This number was added to the base (natural) sediment yield of Clear Creek (2,762 tons/year) to determine the combined effects to the watershed. This is the amount of routed sediment yield delivered to the mouth of Clear Creek for the peak activity year of 2013. This number does not include private land activities on the downstream portion of the Clear Creek watershed. For the year 2013, Alternative C produces the highest increase in sediment yield over base, at 118 tons/year. At this highest level, the amount of sediment yield is only 4% over base (natural). The differences in the total sediment yields produced by the action alternatives are relatively inconsequential (<1%). Table 3-39.

Roads that have moderate to high risk of failure, that are near fish bearing streams or are being used by unauthorized vehicles will require full decompaction and natural slope recontour. All roads with stream crossings or other watershed concerns will be recontoured including stream grade channel restoration. Roads identified in this project not meeting the above criteria may be abandoned. Abandoned roads have no stream crossings, are well vegetated, are resistant to surface erosion and are not prone to mass failure. Each road used for timber haul in accordance with this project will be either reconditioned or reconstructed based on the existing condition of the roadway. Reconditioning roads consists of standard maintenance, such as road blading, brushing, removal of small cutslope failures, applying rock in wet areas and removal of obstructions such as rocks and trees. Reconditioning also includes maintenance of existing culverts. Road reconstruction improves the roadway. This includes replacing and installing new culverts for cross drains and live water culverts, placement of rock surfacing, placement of roadway fill and installation of new signs or gates. Other activities include installation of drainage dips, road blading, brushing and removal of obstructions. The definitions for road reconstruction and road reconditioning above do not include all activities that can be completed under each classification; these definitions are for informational purposes only. Reconditioning and reconstruction is based on the current condition of the roadway. As the project continues, road failures or different access may require the type of work and roads requiring work to change. This is an approximation of road work for the Clear Creek project. Table 1 lists the road work for this project. Table 1.

Soil quality standard #2 currently reads as follows: “A minimum of 80 percent of any activity area shall not be detrimentally compacted, displaced, or puddled upon completion of activities. This direction does not apply to permanent recreation facilities and other permanent facilities such as system roads.” The following amendment is proposed, specific to the Clear Creek project area: “Where detrimental soil conditions from past activities affect 15 percent or less of the activity area, a cumulative minimum of 85 percent of the activity area shall not be detrimentally compacted, displaced, or puddle upon completion of activities. Where detrimental soil conditions from past activities affect more than 15 percent o the activity area, the cumulative detrimental soil disturbance from project implementation and past activities shall not exceed the conditions prior to the planned activity and shall provide a net improvement in soil quality.” This guidance is taken from R1 soil quality guidelines found in R1 Supplement No. 2500-99-1 of Forest Service Manual 2500 - Watershed and Air Management. Analysis of Factors Soil Standard #2 (Forest Plan II-22) would be amended with a site specific Forest Plan Amendment for the Clear Creek project area on the Moose Creek Ranger District. The amendment would allow vegetation treatments and soil improvement activities to proceed in areas with extensive pre-existing detrimental soil conditions. The amendment takes into account the amount of existing detrimental soil disturbance, and allows the flexibility to achieve multiple resource objectives while showing an upward trend in net soil conditions. Timing: the amended Soil Standard #2 would be effective until the Forest Plan is revised or amended. The Nez Perce National Forest Plan is scheduled for revision in 2013. The temporal scope of the amendment is therefore limited. Location and Size: the propose Forest Plan amendment would affect implementation of activities only in the Clear Creek project area. The project area is about 43,730 acres, and is located in Township 30, 31, 32 North, Ranges 5 and 6 East, Boise Principle Meridian. The project area represents less than 2 percent of the total 2,274,146 acres of National Forest System land in the Nez Perce National Forest. The size of area affected is therefore limited. Proposed activities in the Clear Creek project include soil remediation to achieve a net improvement in proposed treatment units with past soil disturbance. Soil improvement actions can increase water infiltration, increase soil productivity, reduce potential for weed invasion, and stabilize bare slopes. Actions include decompacting soils, recontouring to slope, and adding organic matter, including large woody material. These activities would establish a quicker improving trend for soil conditions; advancing tree growth and vegetation establishment. Goals, Objectives, and Outputs: The Forest Plan goal for soils is to maintain soil productivity and minimize any irreversible impacts to soil resource. The Forest Plan objective for soils is to maintain soil productivity and minimize soil erosion through the application of best management practices, careful riparian area management, use of fish/water quality drainage objectives, and soil and water resource improvement projects. This amendment is fully consistent with the goals and objectives of the Nez Perce Forest Plan. Because the amendment would: impose a standard to maintain soil productivity and allow activities to restore areas with considerable pre-existing detrimental soil disturbance. These activities would respond directly and indirectly to the Forest Plan goal and objective for soils. The activities would not inhibit achievement of the Forest Plan goal/objective. This amendment would allow a net improvement in soil condition in the units treated with prior impacts. This is a site-specific amendment to the Forest Plan soil quality standard #2 for lands in the Clear Creek project area. This site-specific amendment would allow the Clear Creek project to proceed despite the fact that several proposed units currently exceed the 20% compacted, displaced or puddle soils standard. The soils analysis in the Clear Creek project area found that some units harvested in the 1960 to 1980s using ground based and jammer logging systems, have compacted or displaced soils over more than 20% of the harvested area. Proposed activities for the Clear Creek project include soil remediation activities to achieve a net improvement in proposed vegetation management units. In order to enter these units under the Clear Creek project, an amendment to soil quality standard #2 is needed. Management Perspective: Amendment of Forest Plan Soil Standard #2 is specific or applicable only to the Clear Creek activity area. This amendment does not apply to activities occurring outside the Clear Creek project area. The proposed change would occur on less than 2 percent of the Forest, therefore there would be no measurable change to goods and service produced in the total forest panning unit (2,274,146 acres, Forest) prior to completion of the Forest Plan revision. This direction does not apply to permanent recreation facilities and other permanent facilities such as system roads. This amendment would make the Forest Plan standard consistent with Regional soil quality guidelines (USDA 1999).  Purpose and Need of Amendment Purpose The purpose of this amendment is to allow activities to occur on areas with greater than 20 percent detrimental soil disturbance. Need Past harvest activities have altered soils conditions in the Clear Creek project area. The current Forest Plan standards and the Forest Service Region1 soil quality guidelines provide direction to maintain soil productivity. The proposed amendment would change Forest Plan standard #2, allowing for activities to occur on areas with greater than 20% soil detrimental disturbance, as long as soil improvement activities are implemented. Based on the current condition a project specific Forest Plan amendment is needed for Alternatives B, C and D to allow for harvest activities to occur on three units of the Clear Creek project. Direct, indirect and cumulative impact of amendment Direct and indirect effects No Action Alternative Alternative A would not amend the Forest Plan. Soil conditions in three units of the Clear Creek project area would remain detrimentally disturbed. No soil improvement activities would occur. Action Alternatives Alternatives B, C and D are evaluated in this analysis, and would require a Forest Plan amendment for soil standard #2. These alternatives would not adjust the goals, objectives or outputs as described in the Forest Plan. This amendment would allow the Clear Creek project to proceed despite the fact that three of the proposed units currently exceed the 20% compacted, displaced or puddle soils standard. The amendment would allow vegetation treatments and soil improvement activities to proceed in areas with extensive pre-existing detrimental soil conditions. The amendment takes into account the amount of existing detrimental soil disturbance, and allows the flexibility to achieve multiple resource objectives while showing an upward trend in net soil conditions. Proposed activities in the Clear Creek project include soil remediation to achieve a net improvement in proposed treatment units with past soil disturbance. Soil improvement objectives are to increase water infiltration, increase soil productivity, reduce potential for weed invasion, and stabilize bare slopes. Actions include decompacting soils, recontouring to slope, and adding organic matter, including large woody material. These activities would establish a quicker improving trend for soil conditions; advancing tree growth and vegetation establishment. This site specific amendment applies to the Clear Creek project area. The amended Soil Standard #2 would be effective until the Forest Plan is revised or amended. The Nez Perce National Forest Plan is scheduled for revision in 2013. The temporal scope of the amendment is therefore limited. This amendment would make the Forest Plan standard consistent with Regional soil quality guidelines (USDA 1999). Cumulative effects There are no cumulative effects with the proposed amendment to the Forest Plan. The amendment is project specific and limited in time. Application of FSM 1926.51 Directives Not Significant Criteria The determination of whether this proposed amendment is significant was done using the process in the Forest Service Planning Handbook, 1926.51 (http://www.fs.fed.us/emc/nfma/index5.html). The handbook states changes to the land management plan that are not significant can result from four specific situations. This forest-wide amendment is compared to those situations below: Table 6. Soils Amendment Criteria Considered Changes to the land management plan that are not significant Alternative B, C, and D Forest Plan Soil standard #2 - Amendment 1. Actions that do not significantly alter the multiple use goals and objectives for long-term land and resource management. The objectives set forth in the Forest Plan for soils would not be altered. The goal to maintain soil productivity and minimize any reversible impacts to the soil resource would still be met. 2. Adjustments of management area boundaries or management prescriptions resulting from further onsite analysis when the adjustments do not cause significant changes in the multiple-use goals and objectives for long-term land and resource management. The proposed amendment does not alter the multiple-use goals and objectives for long-term land and resource management.  The amendment only affects the analysis for this project. It is a project specific amendment that would have no effect to Forest Plan objectives or outputs. 3. Minor changes in standards and guidelines. This amendment would only apply to the Clear Creek project. All other soil goals and standards would apply to this project. This amendment alters soil standard #2 to be consistent with regional soil guidelines. 4. Opportunities for additional projects or activities that will contribute to achievement of the management prescription. Future projects would follow the current Forest Plan standard. This amendment would not adjust management area boundaries or management prescriptions in future analyses. Conclusion – Significance/Non-Significance The preliminary determination is that the adoption of this amendment to the Nez Perce National Forest Plan, soil standard #2, is not significant. This conclusion is based on consideration of the four factors identified in the Forest Service Planning handbook, 1926.51 and review of the Forest Plan. This amendment is fully consistent with the current Forest Plan goals and standards and Region 1 soil quality guidance.  Appendix D Proposed Site-Specific Forest Plan Amendment—Old Growth Proposed Site-Specific Forest Plan Amendment—Old Growth NEZ PERCE NATIONAL FOREST LAND AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN AMENDMENT NO. 42 (PROPOSED) SITE-SPECIFIC AMENDMENT TO APPENDIX N FOR THE CLEAR CREEK PROJECT AREA The purpose of this amendment is to replace the Forest Plan Appendix N definitions of old growth with the definitions found in Old Growth Forest Types of the Northern Region (Green, et al., 1992, errata corrected 02/05, 12/07, 10/08, 12/11). The Green et al. definitions are regarded as the “best available science” for the classification of old growth at the site-specific level. This nonsignificant amendment is site-specific, and would apply only to the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project action alternatives. This amendment would not apply to any activities or projects outside the project area. This amendment would not change the Forest Plan objective for MA 20, which is to maintain viable populations of old-growth-dependent wildlife species. “At least 10 percent of the forested acres across the Forest that are suitable old-growth habitat will be managed as old-growth habitat. This acreage will be distributed across the Forest in a way which assures that at least 5 percent of the forested acres within major prescription watersheds of 6,000 to 10,000 acres will be managed as old-growth habitat.” (USDA-FS 1987, page II-6). Adopting the definitions for old growth found in Green et al. that define successional stages, stratification by habitat types, and other site conditions would help refine our interpretation of the old growth characteristics described in Appendix N of the Forest Plan. Additionally, adoption of this amendment would ensure consistent terminology and analysis. Old growth determination is done through data collection in accordance with Region One stand exam protocols that correlate to the definitions found in Green et al. Literature cited: Green, Pat; Joy, John; Sirucek, Dean; Hann, Wendell; Zack, Art; Naumann, Bob. 1992.
