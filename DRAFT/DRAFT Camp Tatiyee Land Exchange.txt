The proposed exchange includes the transfer of one, 344.24acre parcel of federal land into private ownership and 18 parcels, totaling 1,719.32 acres, of private land into federal ownership. The land to be transferred to the USFS includes one 110.57-acre parcel to the ASNFs; eleven parcels totaling 1,153.18 acres to the CNF; one 11.15-acre parcel to the PNF; and five parcels totaling 444.42 acres to the TNF. The proposal to exchange lands responds to the USFS’s need for consolidation of federal land ownership patterns. Non-federal lands within national forests that are included in this exchange proposal are surrounded by national forest system lands, and contain special features and habitats such as wildlife species habitat and perennial waters. The non-federal lands are also classified as desirable for acquisition because they contribute to an undesirable ownership pattern across the forests, making management of surrounding national forest system land more challenging. Provide Written Comments to: Edward W.

The federal land proposed for exchange are located in Navajo County and the non-federal lands proposed for exchange are located in Cochise, Gila, Graham, Maricopa, Navajo, Pima, Santa Cruz, and Yavapai Counties. The affected USFS units are the Lakeside Ranger District in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests (ASNFs); the Douglas, Nogales, Safford, Santa Catalina, and Sierra Vista Ranger Districts in the Coronado National Forest (CNF); the Bradshaw Ranger District in the Prescott National Forest (PNF); and the Cave Creek, Pleasant Valley, and Tonto Basin Ranger Districts in the Tonto National Forest (TNF). The proposal to exchange lands responds to the USFS’s need for consolidation of federal land ownership patterns. Non-federal lands within national forests that are included in this exchange proposal contain special features and habitats such as critical habitat and perennial waters. Currently, these lands are available for future development that could diminish the value of those resources and support activities that would be incompatible with the surrounding national forest character. The non-federal lands currently contribute to an undesirable ownership pattern and are classified as desirable for acquisition by the USFS. The federal lands in the exchange are located in the Community-Forest Intermix Management Area of the 2015 ASNFs Land and Resource Management Plan. The management direction for this area states that lands proposed for exchange by the USFS are needed to meet the needs of expanding communities, would provide for consolidation of public lands, improve management or benefit specific resources, and meet overriding public needs. The federal lands, if conveyed, could be subject to development. However, the stated intent of the proponent is to continue operating the youth camp at its current site on the parcel if the land is conveyed. In 1997, the Lions Foundation of Arizona, Inc. (LFA), through its representative, Page Land & Cattle Co., proposed to exchange private land for federal National Forest System (NFS) land where their Camp Tatiyee youth camp (which is authorized by a special use permit [SUP]) is located. LFA proceeded to acquire non-federal properties in the ASNFs, CNF, PNF, and TNF and presented the ASNFs with their proposal for the Camp Tatiyee land exchange in 2007. A Value Consultation was prepared for the proposal in May 2007 by the USFS, which concluded at that time that the exchange proposal appeared to be structured in compliance with the value requirements of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) activities were initiated with scoping and preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA). A scoping letter dated 30 October 2007, was mailed to adjacent landowners, potentially interested parties, and affected SUP holders who were believed to have an interest in or be affected by the project. Comments were requested by 15 December 2007. Based on the comments received and litigation regarding a land exchange elsewhere on the ASNFs, the USFS determined that an EA would be insufficient for the NEPA process and an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) would be prepared. U.S. Forest Service Preliminary issues identified with this proposal include concerns over the loss of opportunity for the continued use of the ASNFs land for wildlife viewing and recreation by residents living in the area adjacent to the federal parcel and concerns regarding the effect of possible future development of the federal parcel. At this time the alternatives under consideration include taking no action or exchanging lands as identified in the proposed action. The Draft EIS (DEIS) analyzes the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the alternatives. Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future activities on both private and NFS lands are considered in the analysis. The DEIS includes discussion of site-specific mitigation.  The EIS scoping process was initiated on 26 March 2010, with publication of the Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS for the proposed Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange. The on-going scoping process will identify any new key issues and previously unknown potential environmental effects of the proposed action. Major conclusions include: The proposed assembled exchange would result in federal acquisition of 1,719.32 acres in the national forests of Arizona and conveyance of 344.24 acres of land within the incorporated Town of Pinetop-Lakeside in the ASNFs. If the exchange occurs, the non-federal lands proposed for the exchange would no longer be subject to potential development, but would instead be incorporated into the appropriate USFS management regime. The conveyed federal lands would be subject to future development. However, the stated intent of the proponent is to maintain and improve the youth camp which has been operated on a portion of the parcel since 1958. If development were to occur, no riparian habitat, aquatic or wetland habitat would be impacted because these habitats do not naturally exist on the federal lands proposed for exchange. Future uses or development on the lands conveyed out of federal ownership would become subject to all applicable laws, regulations, and zoning authorities of state and local governing bodies. If the no action alternative was selected, the federal lands would continue to be managed by the USFS. The non-federal lands, which include special features and habitats such as critical habitat and perennial waters, would remain subject to future development. Based upon the potential effects of the alternatives analyzed in this DEIS, the Forest Supervisor, ASNFs (the responsible official), will decide if the lands offered for exchange are desirable, in the public interest, and suitable for inclusion in the NFS. Table of Contents Document Structure.................................................................................................................................... 1 Chapter 1.

This DEIS discloses the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts that would result from implementation of the proposed action and alternatives. The document is organized into six chapters: Chapter 1. Purpose of and Need for Action: The chapter includes information on the purpose of and need for the project, the agency’s proposal for achieving that purpose and need, and the history of the project proposal,. This section also details how the USFS informed the public of the proposal and how the public responded. Chapter 2. Alternatives, including the Proposed Action: This chapter provides a detailed description of the proposed action as well as alternative methods for achieving the stated purpose and need. These alternatives were developed based on significant issues raised by the public and agencies. This discussion also includes mitigation measures. Finally, this chapter provides a summary table of the potential environmental consequences associated with each alternative. Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences: This chapter describes existing conditions and the potential environmental consequences from implementation of the proposed action and alternatives. This analysis is organized by resource area. Chapter 4. Other Considerations Required Under NEPA: This chapter describes short-term uses and long-term productivity; unavoidable adverse effects; irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources; cumulative effects; and other required disclosures. Chapter 5. Consultation and Coordination: This chapter provides a list of preparers and agencies consulted during the development of the DEIS. Chapter 6. References: This chapter provides citations for the references used throughout the analyses. Appendices: The appendices provide more detailed information to support the analyses presented in the DEIS. Index: The index provides page numbers for key document topics. The index will be provided in the Final EIS. Additional documentation, including more detailed analyses of project-area resources, may be found in the project planning record located at the Lakeside Ranger District, 2022 West White Mountain Boulevard, Lakeside, Arizona 85929 Chapter 1. Purpose of and Need for Action Purpose and Need The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) currently owns a section of land (344.06 acres) on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests (ASNFs) that is challenging to manage because (1) it is an isolated parcel, surrounded by private land on three sides and the Fort Apache Indian Reservation on the fourth side; (2) it requires more administrative oversight because other authorized uses, including the Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace Youth Camps and several utility and irrigation rights of way, are also located on the parcel, and (3) it lacks many of the characteristics of desirable and suitable National Forest System (NFS) land. The USFS also currently has to manage around several isolated private land parcels lying within the Prescott National Forest (PNF), Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests (ASNFs), Tonto National Forest (TNF), and Coconino National Forest (CNF). Managing around these parcels makes management of NFS land in those areas more complicated, costly, and less efficient. These private parcels also include special features, wildlife species critical habitat, perennial waters, and other forest resources and characteristics of desirable and suitable NFS land. These resources are at risk of possible future loss or use that differs from surrounding NFS land management uses if the parcels remain under current private ownership. The USFS needs (1) reduced administrative oversight of the section of USFS land where special use permits have increased over the years and (2) consolidated contiguous federal land ownership patterns on NFS lands, specifically on proclaimed Arizona national forests, with land containing resources and characteristics of desirable and suitable NFS land and excluding land no longer suitable for NFS land management. The purpose of this project is to Specific purposes and objectives for this project are to fulfill the identified needs and meet USFS objectives for land acquisition and management outlined in the various forests’ land management plans (LMPs; including the 2015 Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests (ASNFs) LMP): Further detailed information that informed the establishment of the purpose and need for and development of this project is found in the existing and desired conditions sections in Chapter 1 and the affected environment sections in Chapter 3, which provide more in-depth detail on the existing conditions of the land by resource area. Proposed Action The ASNFs is considering exchanging lands with LFA and BC2 LLC, through Lawyer’s Title of Arizona, Inc., as Trustee, under authority of the General Exchange Act of 20 March 1922; the FLPMA; and the Federal Land Exchange Facilitation Act of 20 August 1988. The proposed land-for-land exchange would result in federal acquisition of approximately 1,719.32 acres of non-federal lands in the ASNFs, CNF, PNF, and TNF, and the conveyance of approximately 344.24 acres of federal land within the incorporated Town of Pinetop-Lakeside, Arizona from the ASNFs. For a land-for-land exchange to take place, both parties to the exchange must agree on the total package. If the non-federal lands are acquired by the USFS, they would be incorporated into the Management Areas (MA), areas designated for specific management uses, in which they are located (36 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 254.3(f)). Management direction for any acquired lands would be the same as that for the surrounding federal lands, unless otherwise modified by future amendment(s) to the forest LMP where the specific parcel is located or as a result of a project specific change. The LFA has stated that it is their intention to continue operating Camp Tatiyee as a youth organization camp. The operators of Camp Grace, another camp located on federal land,  have been extended the opportunity by LFA to acquire the land where their camp is located at the conclusion of the exchange so they can also continue operating. The parcel would be available for residential or commercial development in full compliance with and as permitted under Town of Pinetop-Lakeside zoning ordinances. Foreseeable future development on the land are addressed in the cumulative effects section in the DEIS, including land use, recreation and public access, socioeconomics, plants and wildlife, wetlands and floodplains, water quality and water rights, cultural resources, mineral resources, roads, fire and fuels, hazardous materials, and other key issues identified in the scoping process.1 The conveyance of the federal land would increase the number of acres of private land within the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside by 344.24 acres while eliminating an isolated USFS parcel. The land would continue to be used for existing youth organization camps with the remainder being available for future development within the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside in accordance with local zoning ordinances. USFS administration of over a dozen SUPs on the federal land would no longer be necessary, and any existing easements would be maintained as part of the conveyance. The non-federal lands would provide additional federally managed habitat for wildlife and plant species. The consolidation of public land ownership would result in a reduction in mixed ownership patterns. The elimination of numerous miles of common federal/private property boundaries and corners would contribute to increased management efficiency and a reduction in future administrative costs. Possible future residential/subdivision development on the private inholdings would be eliminated. On a USFS-wide basis, there would be a net gain of 1,375.08 acres of land that would be available for public outdoor recreation uses. Figure 1-1 shows the regional location of the 19 parcels proposed for exchange in the proposed action. Figures 1-2 through 1-14 display the location of each individual parcel. The Mogollon Rim Trail, a popular hiking trail that is located on the federal parcel, would also transfer to non-federal ownership. However, maintenance of this trail for public access and use by the public would be a condition of the land exchange. Design and maintenance of the trail subsequent to the exchange 1 Lands conveyed out of federal ownership become subject to all laws, regulations and zoning authorities of State and local governing bodies (Forest Service Manual 5400). Various State of Arizona agencies as well as the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside, and possibly Navajo County, are the regulatory authorities for all land uses and development-related activities that would be permitted on the conveyed federal land as they are for the other private land within the corporate limits of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside. The USFS has long taken the position that zoning and regulation of uses on private land are within the responsibility of state and local governments. Local authorities are in the best position to determine appropriate uses of private land. Except as authorized by law, order, or regulation, USFS policies, practices, and procedures shall avoid regulating private property use (Forest Service Manual 5403.3). Local governments have traditionally agreed and insisted that such decisions be left to them. would be developed and agreed upon as part of the ultimate real estate transaction between the USFS and the private parties involved in the exchange. Tables 1-1 and 1-2 summarize the locations of the lands involved in the proposed exchange.

(LFA), an Arizona non-profit organization, through Page Land & Cattle Co., proposed to exchange the private land for the federal NFS land where the Camp Tatiyee youth camp is located. The camp has been operated under a USFS special use permit (SUP) since 1958. LFA proceeded to acquire non-federal properties in the PNF, ASNFs, and TNF, and presented the ASNFs with their proposal for the Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange in 2000. A 2003 preliminary value analysis concluded that the estimated value of the federal land far exceeded that of the offered non-federal lands and that LFA would need to acquire additional properties for the proposed exchange to proceed. In December 2005, Page Land & Cattle Co. submitted a revised proposal that now included a number of parcels located in the CNF that were previously acquired by BC2 LLC, an Arizona limited liability company, for a land exchange proposal that had been known as the Cote Land Exchange. At this time, a previously offered inholding of the ASNFs was withdrawn from the offered non-federal lands. A Value Consultation for the proposed land exchange was completed on 9 May 2007, and is documented in the Feasibility Analysis that was approved by the Acting Director of Lands & Minerals, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, Southwestern Region on 9 August 2007. The Value Consultation concluded that the proposed land exchange is in compliance with the equal value requirement of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), as amended. An Agreement to Initiate the Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange was authorized by the Acting Director of Lands & Minerals, USDA Forest Service, Southwestern Region on 1 October 2007. Due to project delays, a revised Feasibility Analysis was prepared and was approved by the ASNFs’ Deputy Forest Supervisor on 1 August 2014. The associated Amended Agreement to Initiate was also approved by the ASNFs’ Deputy Forest Supervisor on 1 August 2014. Lawyer’s Title of Arizona, Inc. currently holds the 18 non-federal, privately owned parcels in Arizona in trust for the benefit of LFA and BC2 LLC. These parcels are located within the boundaries of the ASNFs, CNF, PNF, and TNF. Locations of Land Parcels Proposed For Exchange Legal Land Descriptions Complete land descriptions of both the federal and non-federal lands are as follows: Property the USDA Forest Service would consider exchanging: Chapter 1 Complete land descriptions of both the federal and non-federal lands are as follows: Property the USDA Forest Service would consider exchanging: Sitgreaves National Forest Lakeside Ranger District Camp Tatiyee Parcel GILA AND SALT RIVER MERIDIAN, Navajo County, Arizona T. 9 N., R. 22E. sec. 16 – Lots 3, 4, 7, 11, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, and 24. sec. 17 – lots 1 and 2.

The 1987 ASNFs LMP describes the parcel as forested land outside special MAs. Management emphasis for the parcel includes timber and fuelwood production, wildlife habitat, livestock grazing, watershed, and dispersed recreation. The entire parcel is located within the wildland-urban interface, and is subject to management for fire control and prevention. The parcel does not contain and is not near any inventoried roadless areas, Wild and Scenic River corridors or study areas, wilderness, or prime farm, range, or forestlands. Additionally, the 1987 ASNFs LMP is being revised and expected to become final in 2015. The new MA designation for this area would be classified as Community-Forest Intermix MA. As outlined in the 2015 LMP, land included in this MA lies within one half-mile of “communities-at-risk.” The ASNF LMP defines “communities-at-risk” as, “identified in the Federal Register, high risk urban communities within the wildland-urban interface” (USFS 2015a). Lands in the Community-Forest Intermix MA comprise a portion of the wildland-urban interface that occurs forest-wide. The wildland-urban interface are areas throughout ASNF around human development at imminent risk from managed burns and wildfires. The Community-Forest Intermix MA can be used as a zone for fire suppression activities and acts as a buffer to protect land and property adjacent to the MA from wildfire damage. The Community-Forest Intermix MA is managed to minimize the risk of fire spreading into (or from) adjacent developed areas (USFS 2015a). Currently, a portion of the parcel is occupied by two youth organization camps authorized by separate SUPs. Camp Tatiyee, operated by Camp Tatiyee, Inc. an instrumentality of the LFA, has an authorized occupancy of 80 acres. Camp Grace, a separate and unrelated organization, operated by Mission of Grace, Inc., has an authorized occupancy of 15.8 acres. Numerous other land uses are authorized through separate SUPs or easements. The northern boundary of the federal land is a Town of Pinetop-Lakeside road easement (Wagon Wheel Road). The private land north of the road is occupied primarily by single family residences with one commercial business located north of the northwest corner of Wagon Wheel Road and State Route (SR) 260. The majority of the eastern boundary is the centerline of SR 260. The private land on the east side of SR 260 is primarily subdivided residential property. A number of those lots are currently being marketed for residential and commercial development. A few have been developed as commercial properties. The southern one-third of the east boundary is shared with commercial business properties located in the Maverick Center. The southern boundary is partly a Navajo County road easement (Vallery Lane). The private land south of the road is occupied primarily by single family residences. The western boundary abuts undeveloped Fort Apache Indian Reservation land. Non-federal Lands to be Exchanged The non-federal lands to be exchanged in the proposed action consist of 18 separate parcels totaling 1,719.32 acres. The properties would be incorporated into four different forests based on location, with management designations to be applied based initially on the surrounding federal land. A detailed review of the federal parcel and each non-federal parcel proposed for exchange is provided in Chapter 3, Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences. A summary is provided below. Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests Carlisle Parcel The Carlisle tract consists of a single 110.57-acre parcel in the ASNFs. It is located approximately 6.5 miles northwest of Show Low, Arizona in the Lakeside RD. The property is described primarily as pinyon-juniper woodland. Management emphasis is fuelwood production, wildlife habitat, watershed condition, and livestock grazing (USFS 1987, 2015a). Coronado National Forest A total of eleven tracts within the CNF are scattered across the Santa Catalina, Douglas, Safford, Nogales, and Sierra Vista RDs. Happy Valley 40, Happy Valley West, and Happy Valley East Parcels The Happy Valley 40, West, and East (40 and West in Pima County, and East in Cochise County) parcels are located in the Happy Valley area east of Tucson within the Rincon Mountains, Santa Catalina RD. The Happy Valley 40 parcel is 40 acres and is located approximately 1 mile east of Saguaro National Park approximately 0.5 mile east of the Rincon Mountain Wilderness area. The Happy Valley West and East parcels are just over a mile east of Happy Valley 40 and are 80 and 239.08 acres, respectively. These parcels are surrounded by two different MAs: fuelwood/forage production and riparian habitat protection and improvement. The fuelwood and forest production lands are typified by desert scrub, grassland, chaparral, and woodland vegetative types; lands managed for improved riparian habitat include perennial streams and wetter intermittent drainages. In both areas, visual qualities are to be retained, dispersed recreational activities are encouraged when the productivity of the land or resources is not adversely affected, and watershed and soil conditions are to be maintained or improved. The production land MA focuses on the sustained harvest of livestock forage and fuelwood, the maintenance or improvement of game habitat, mitigation of impacts to wildlife and cultural resources, and improving productivity. The riparian land is managed to perpetuate the diversity of unique wildlife and vegetative species and improve riparian resources, reflect the USFS goal to protect regeneration of riparian species, and obligation to protect threatened and endangered species habitat. Protection of riparian habitat may result in exclusion of recreational activities and/or use by livestock if satisfactory riparian conditions are not achievable or maintained. Facilities may be allowed and maintained for the purpose of protecting these resources (USFS 1986a). Harshaw Creek Parcel The Harshaw Creek parcel is located approximately 6 miles southeast of Patagonia, Arizona along Harshaw Creek between the Patagonia Mountains and the Canelo Hills within the Sierra Vista RD and is accessed via National Forest System Road (NFSR) 58. The Harshaw Creek parcel is 75.80 acres surrounded by two different MAs: fuelwood/forage production and maintenance of unique ecological values. In both areas, management seeks to provide sustainable livestock forage and fuelwood, permissive recreational usage, and protection of visual, soil, and watershed resources. However, in areas managed to perpetuate unique wildlife or vegetative species, essential habitat designation may severely restrict usage of that land beyond environmental restoration. These MAs may include unique riparian systems, oak and mesquite bottoms, and known, essential habitats for threatened and endangered plants and animals (USFS 1986a). Mansfield Parcel The Mansfield parcel consists of nine patented lode mining claims totaling 182.41 acres located approximately 7 miles northwesterly of Patagonia, Arizona in Mansfield Canyon within the Santa Rita Mountains, Nogales RD and is accessed via NFSR 72. Mansfield parcel is surrounded by a MA for the sustained harvest of livestock forage and fuelwood. In addition to forage and fuel, game habitat, visual quality, and watershed and soil conditions are maintained or improved. Management or activity impacts on cultural resources and non-game wildlife are fully mitigated. Dispersed recreational activities are encouraged when the productivity of the land or resources is not adversely affected. Land under this MA typically includes desert scrub, grassland, chaparral, and woodland vegetative types (USFS 1986a). Ronstadt Highway and Ronstadt Tank Parcels The Ronstadt Highway parcel is 134.43 acres and is located in the Stockton Pass area along SR 266 approximately 3 miles southeast of Fort Grant Arizona State Prison. The Ronstadt Tank parcel is 80.00 acres and is located in Bar-X Canyon approximately 5 miles southeasterly of the Ronstadt Highway tract and is accessed using NFSR 664. Both parcels are located in the Pinaleno Mountains surrounded by the Safford RD. Both parcels are enclosed by MAs for the sustained harvest of livestock forage and fuelwood. In addition to forage and fuel, game habitat, visual quality, and watershed and soil conditions are maintained or improved. Management or activity impacts on cultural resources and non-game wildlife are fully mitigated. Dispersed recreational activities are encouraged when the productivity of the land or resources is not adversely affected. Land under this MA typically includes desert scrub, grassland, chaparral, and woodland vegetative types (USFS 1986a). Rucker East and Rucker West Parcels The Rucker East and Rucker West parcels are located approximately 30 miles north of Douglas, Arizona in the Rucker Canyon within the Chiricahua Mountains within the Douglas RD. NFSR 74 accesses the parcels. These parcels are each 160.00 acres and are surrounded by two different MAs: recreation and forage/fuelwood production. Fuelwood and forest production lands are typified by desert scrub, grassland, chaparral, and woodland vegetative types; lands managed for recreation feature undeveloped grasslands, woodlands, coniferous forest, and riparian areas that have a high attraction to recreationists. In both areas, watershed and soil conditions are managed for maintained or improved conditions. On lands managed for recreational opportunity, the objective is protection, maintenance, and improvement of the unique physical, biological and cultural resources which makes the land attractive for recreation. All management activities on these lands are designed to maintain or enhance the recreational opportunities. On lands managed for fuelwood/forage production, dispersed recreational activities are encouraged when the productivity of the land or resources is not adversely affected. The production land MA focuses on the sustained availability of livestock forage and fuelwood, the maintenance or improvement of game habitat, mitigation of impacts to wildlife and cultural resources, and improving productivity (USFS 1986a). Stronghold and Stronghold Well Site Parcels The Stronghold and Stronghold Well Site parcels are located approximately 9 miles northwest of Pearce, Arizona in East Stronghold Canyon within the Dragoon Mountains accessed by NFSR 84. The Stronghold parcel is 1.02 acres, whereas the Stronghold Well Site parcel is a partial interest in 0.44 acres. The surrounding MA is primarily recreational uses with the objective of protecting, maintaining, and improving the unique physical, biological and cultural resources which makes the land attractive for recreation. All management activities on these lands are designed to maintain or enhance the recreational opportunities. Watershed conditions are managed in such a way as to be improved or maintained. Land under this MA typically includes undeveloped grasslands, woodlands, coniferous forest, and riparian areas that have a high attraction to recreationists (USFS 1986a). Prescott National Forest Babcock Parcel The Babcock parcel is a patented lode mining claim of 11.15 acres located approximately 3 miles south of Crown King, Arizona in PNF Bradshaw RD and accessed via NFSR 192. For the MA surrounding the parcel, management emphasis is on improvement of watershed condition to increase water yield and wildlife habitat improvement. It includes primarily chaparral with interspersed pinyon/juniper vegetative types (USFS 1986b, 2015b). Tonto National Forest The five TNF parcels are located in the Cave Creek, Tonto Basin, and Pleasant Valley RDs. The MAs surrounding all of these parcels emphasize wildlife habitat improvement, livestock forage production, and dispersed recreation. Watersheds are to be managed so as to improve them to a satisfactory or better condition and to improve and manage riparian areas to benefit riparian dependent resources. Lands typical of this MA include desert, chaparral/pinyon-juniper, ponderosa pine, and riparian vegetative types (USFS 1985). Red Rover Parcel The Red Rover parcel is 61.92 acres, accessed via NFSR 254, and located approximately 15 miles northeast of Carefree, Arizona. The parcel contains a number of patented lode mining claims. Red Rover Parcel straddles Maricopa County to the north and Yavapai County to the south. The parcel is in the New River Mountains in the Cave Creek RD. Tonto Creek 1, Tonto Creek 2, and Tonto Creek 3 Parcels The Tonto Creek parcels are located approximately 11 miles northwest of Roosevelt Lake, Arizona and are accessed via SR 188. Tonto Creek 1 is 120.00 acres, Tonto Creek 2 is 160.00 acres, and Tonto Creek 3 is 70.00 acres. The parcels are located almost entirely within the Tonto Creek floodplain in the Tonto Basin RD. Pleasant Valley Parcel The Pleasant Valley parcel is located approximately 3 miles west of Young, Arizona, and is 32.50 acres. It is found at the head of Walnut Creek Canyon in the Pleasant Valley RD and is accessed via NFSR 134. Existing Condition The non-federal lands that are being offered for exchange are generally rural undeveloped properties that would greatly contribute to the consolidation of public land ownership, as well as improve the overall resource management on each national forest. A number of the parcels are located in areas that are becoming more desirable for future residential development. Future development on the properties would greatly diminish their value as natural forest lands and could possibly result in the establishment of activities that would be incompatible with the surrounding national forest character and management. The parcels meet several criteria for land that is desirable for acquisition in each respective national forest LMP. The parcels currently contribute to a mixed ownership pattern within the national forest boundaries that makes natural resource management more difficult and costly to carry out. Small privately owned parcels of land within national forest boundaries (inholdings) significantly increase land management responsibilities because of the miles of common, or shared, property boundaries that need periodic inspection and maintenance, the potential for encroachment or trespass occurring on the adjacent NFS lands, and the possibility of conflicting uses that adversely affect natural resources located on the surrounding national forest lands. Under the 2015 ASNFs LMP, the federal land proposed for this exchange is managed as Community-Forest Intermix Management Area land. The management direction contained in the 2015 ASNFs LMP states that lands owned by the USFS can be exchanged in order to meet the needs of expanding communities, provide for consolidation of public lands, improve management or benefit specific resources, and meet overriding public needs. Detailed, resource-specific discussions of existing conditions on each parcel are included in Chapter 3. Desired Condition Under the desired future condition, the isolated sections of NFS land outside of larger forest areas and private inholdings surrounded by NFS lands have both been reduced. Multiple benefits that have been realized with the addition of the non-federal lands include a reduction in mixed land ownership patterns with the consolidation of public land ownership; numerous miles of shared property boundaries and corners have been eliminated which contributes to management efficiency; the elimination of possible future residential/subdivision development on the former private inholdings; and the acquisition of additional riparian and wildlife habitat that is now under federal management. The isolated federal parcel has been conveyed into private ownership, in addition to the Camp Tatiyee SUP, over a dozen other SUP authorizations will no longer need to be administered, the Rim Trail continues to be available for public use, the special-needs youth camp (Camp Tatiyee) has secured a permanent location and is able to continue to serve disabled children from throughout the state, and the rest of the property is now available for community expansion. Decision Framework The responsible official for this project is the ASNFs Supervisor. The Forest Supervisor will review the proposed action, alternatives, no-action alternative, and the environmental consequences in consideration of the purpose and need in order to make an informed decision. Laws, Regulations, Policy, and Agency Direction The land exchange was consistent with the goals and objectives of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service Strategic Plan Fiscal Years 2007-2012, specifically: • Goal 2, Provide and Sustain Benefits to the American People: • Objective 2.2. Provide a reliable supply of rangeland products over time that (1) is consistent with achieving desired conditions on NFS lands and (2) helps support ranching in local communities. • Goal 3, Conserve Open Space: • Objective 3.1. Protect forests and grasslands from conversion to other uses. • Goal 4, Sustain and Enhance Outdoor Recreation Opportunities: • Objective 4.2. Secure legal entry to national forest lands and waters. The USFS has the responsibility to manage NFS lands for appropriate public uses. This includes making adjustments in land ownership that are clearly in the public interest and are consistent with land management planning objectives. The proposed exchange would need to be consistent with the management direction, goals and objectives in each forest LMP and serve the public interest (36 CFR 254.3(b)(2)). Each forest’s LMP Standards and Guidelines has been reviewed and it has been determined the non-federal lands are desirable for acquisition. Land adjustments (e.g., exchanges, purchases) help to consolidate the NFS land base, reduce administrative problems and costs, enhance public access and use, and support resource management objectives. Management direction for land exchanges includes: • Land exchanges should not result in the creation of isolated NFS parcels surrounded by other ownerships. • Land acquisitions and exchanges should evaluate and possibly include associated beneficial encumbrances (e.g., water rights, mineral rights, easements, instream flow). • NFS lands that are made available for exchange generally meet one or more of the following criteria: (1)isolated tracts or scattered parcels that cannot be efficiently managed, (2) recreation residence tracts, (3)provide for consolidation of public lands, (4) improve management or benefit specific resources, or (5)overriding public needs. • Lands desirable for acquisition generally meet one or more of the following criteria: (1) lands that contain vital species habitat or vital wildlife habitat (e.g., calving areas, critical winter range); (2) lands needed for developed or dispersed recreation; (3) wetlands, riparian areas, and other water oriented lands; (4) lands that contain unique natural or cultural values; (5) lands that improve public land management, meet specified administrative needs, or benefit other NFS programs; (6) lands that provide needed access, protect public lands from fire or trespass, or prevent damage to public land resources; (7) lands that are needed to consolidate public landownership or meet research needs; (8) lands that are needed to meet programs prescribed or endorsed by acts or reports of Congress or the USDA; (9) inholdings that contain needed access; or (10) undeveloped inholdings. The ASNFs and the PNF are currently in the process of finalizing new LMPs. The Record of Decision (ROD) for both the new ASNFs LMP and PNF LMP are scheduled to be signed in 2015. Management direction for the Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange analysis is based on the resource objectives in the new 2015 LMPs. The 2015 ASNFs LMP provides overall direction to meet desired conditions by identifying management goals and objectives to reflect conditions on the ground. For the purposes of this EIS, existing conditions (affected environment) will be analyzed under the current 1987 and 1986 LMPs for ASNFs and PNF, respectively, as these areas are currently under this direction. The new plans are scheduled to be completed in 2015 and therefore, future conditions (environmental consequences) will be analyzed under the new 2015 plans. Public Involvement During the initial evaluation of the exchange as an Environmental Assessment (EA), the ASNFs initiated a public scoping process. A land exchange notice was published once per week for four consecutive weeks between 5 and 27 November 2007, in the newspapers serving the areas affected by this proposal: the White Mountain Independent (ASNFs), Arizona Daily Star/Tucson Citizen (CNF), Daily Courier (PNF), East Valley Tribune (TNF), and Payson Roundup newspapers (Appendix A). The board of supervisors in the counties containing federal and non-federal parcels, elected state representatives, tribal governments, and the Arizona Congressional Delegation were notified via mail. A scoping letter dated 30 October 2007 (Appendix A), was mailed to adjacent landowners, potentially interested parties, and affected SUP holders who were believed may have an interest in or be affected by the project. The letter explained that interested parties should access the listing of the project on the ASNFs website to find a description of the lands being considered for exchange, the legal land descriptions of the parcels, and maps displaying their locations. Comments were requested by 15 December 2007. The Notice of Intent to prepare and Environmental Impact Statement was published in the Federal Register on 25 March 2010. In addition, notification included: listing of the project in the ASNFs’ Quarterly Schedule of Proposed Actions; distribution of letters to individuals, organizations, and agencies who previously indicated interest in the Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange; and communication with Tribes. News releases were distributed inviting the public to a scoping meeting that was held on 13 April 2010. News releases were distributed to the Arizona Republic (the regional newspaper of record), and each forest’s newspaper of record: the White Mountain Independent (ASNFs), Arizona Daily Star (CNF), Daily Courier (PNF), Arizona Capitol Times (TNF), and to other papers serving areas affected by this proposal: Tucson Citizen, Sierra Vista Herald, Nogales International, Eastern Arizona Courier, East Valley Tribune, and Payson Roundup (Appendix A). Supervisors in the counties containing federal and non-federal parcels, elected state representatives, tribal governments, and the Arizona Congressional Delegation were notified of the scoping meeting in a mailing sent out on 2 April 2010. Commenters were encouraged to contact the ASNFs concerning any questions about the proposed land exchange or to obtain additional information. Using comments from the public, other agencies, and tribal consultation, (see Issues section), the interdisciplinary team developed a list of issues to address. A description of these identified issues follows. Issues Issues are disputes, debates, or discussions about environmental effects of a proposed project. The USFS separated the issues identified into two groups: significant and non-significant issues. Significant issues were defined as those directly or indirectly caused by implementing the proposed action. Non-significant issues were identified as those: (1) outside the scope of the proposed action; (2) already decided by law, regulation, forest plan, or other higher level decision; (3) irrelevant to the decision to be made; or (4) conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence. The Council on Environmental Quality NEPA regulations explain this delineation in Sec. 1501.7, stating that agencies shall “identify and eliminate from detailed study the issues which are not significant or which have been covered by prior environmental review (Sec. 1506.3).” Any non-significant issues and reasons regarding their categorization as non-significant that were identified during scoping are described in the Public Scoping Report in the Administrative Record. This section presents the key issues identified during the scoping process and internal agency review. Environmental Assessment Scoping Period During the EA scoping period, the ASNFs received 14 responses/inquiries. Several commenters expressed concern about effects to wildlife use/viewing, and concern about the continued use of the federal parcel for outdoor recreation by local residents. The DEIS analysis includes effects of the foreseeable future uses on the federal land to wildlife use/viewing and outdoor recreation should the land be conveyed to the proponent. Other comments expressed concern about the extent of possible future development on the federal parcel, excluding currently existing authorized land uses. The DEIS evaluates these concerns. Environmental Impact Statement Scoping Period During the EIS scoping period, the ASNFs received 10 comments. Comments included notice from SUP holders who wish to establish easements on the Camp Tatiyee parcel if the land exchange is completed. One comment expressed concern that the land exchange was unbalanced and that there may be socioeconomic ramifications that would result from the transfer. Socioeconomics impacts associated with the balancing of federal and non-federal properties are analyzed in detail in Chapter 3, Socioeconomics. One comment requested that the EIS address the future management of the non-federal parcels, including the habitat benefits and other resource concerns at issue on these parcels. This discussion is included throughout Chapter 3, and notably in the section discussing impacts to plants, fish, and wildlife. One comment emphasized the importance of maintaining the Mogollon Rim Trail for public use (Issue 1 below). Three comments expressed concern regarding loss of property values for the landowners with property abutting the Camp Tatiyee parcel (Issue 2 below). Identification of Issues The comments received during the EA and EIS scoping periods were analyzed to determine if they should be used to further define the proposed action or if any possible mitigation measures were needed. Issue 1: Recreation and Access Concern: The land exchange would remove access to the popular Mogollon Rim Trail. Response: LFA is committed to maintain the Mogollon Rim trail, including the parking area and entrance. While the trail would no longer be under public ownership, the LFA is working with the USFS to ensure that the trail will continue to be a public resource. For additional information, refer to Chapter 3, Recreation and Public Access. The proposed action alternative would not eliminate forest access or recreational opportunities, though it would require residents of abutting properties to travel a greater distance (but generally no more than 1.5 miles) to reach ASNFs land. Issue 2: Land Values and Socioeconomics Concern: Residents owning property that abuts the Camp Tatiyee parcel raised the concern that privatizing the land and allowing it to be subject to development would adversely affect their property values. The land exchange would also reduce forest access and existing recreational opportunities in the Pinetop-Lakeside area. Response: In consideration of the present economy and general oversupply of housing, the land within the Camp Tatiyee parcel would likely remain vacant until development would be a profitable enterprise. Development on the Camp Tatiyee parcel would not take place until the demand exists for new residences. If the land exchange occurs, the proponent working with the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside development processes would utilize reasonable setbacks and other measures to help minimize impacts to maintain the mountain forest character of the area. When development becomes economically feasible on the Camp Tatiyee parcel, the parcel would be subject to the rezoning and subdivision approval processes required by the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside. Both of these processes include an opportunity for public comment and input. While development plans are not known at this time, the development would likely be similar to the surrounding low-density residential development. Camp Tatiyee would continue to operate at its current location. Camp Grace would have the option to purchase the land where it is located to continue operating as well. Other Related Efforts Other USFS Real Estate Activities in the Geographic Region The ASNFs has been consolidating ownership through land exchanges throughout the geographic region. Other similar efforts include the Black River Land Exchange and the Show Low South Land Exchange. These exchanges are land-for-land exchanges seeking to bring the isolated ASNFs lands into private ownership to be available for development to meet the needs of the growing community, consolidate public lands, improve management or benefit specific resources, and meet overriding public needs. In addition, the ASNFs is engaged in two disposition actions: the Woodland Lake Park Land Conveyance, in which the Woodland Lake Park parcel is being sold to the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside, and the Lakeside Ranger Station land conveyance, in which the ASNFs is selling the land currently housing the Lakeside Ranger Station and the Lakeside Campground at auction. The NEPA analysis for the Black River Land Exchange, Show Low South Land Exchange, and Woodland Lake Park Conveyance has been completed. The Lakeside Ranger Station Land Conveyance is still in an alternative development phase. Forest Plan Revisions Additionally, as mentioned in the Laws, Regulations, Policy, and Agency Direction section above, the proposed exchange would need to be consistent with the management direction, goals, and objectives in each forest LMP and serve the public interest (36 CFR 254.3(b)(2)). The ASNFs and the PNF are currently in the process of finalizing new LMPs. The ROD for both the new ASNFs LMP and PNF LMP are scheduled to be signed in 2015, before the final decision is made on this land exchange. For the purposes of this EIS, existing conditions (affected environment) have been analyzed under the current 1987 LMPs for ASNFs and PNF, as these forests are currently under this direction. The new plans are scheduled to be completed in 2015 and therefore, future conditions (environmental consequences) have been analyzed under the new 2015 plans. The TNF and CNF are also in the process of revising their plans. However, the revision process for both the TNF and CNF is still in development stages and would be too speculative to incorporate into analyzed future conditions of this EIS. Chapter 2. Alternatives Including the Proposed Action Introduction This chapter describes and compares the alternatives considered for the Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange. This chapter includes a description of the two alternatives that were considered: the no action and proposed action. Some of the information used to compare the alternatives may be based upon the design of the alternative (e.g., acres of land currently in federal ownership versus acres of land in federal ownership after exchange) and some of the information may be based upon the environmental, social and economic effects of implementing each alternative (e.g., total acres of federal land currently containing wetlands and floodplains versus total acres of federal land containing wetlands and floodplains after exchange). Alternatives Considered in Detail Alternative 1: No Action Under the no action alternative, lands would remain under the current ownership and existing management. While this alternative does not satisfy the purpose and need of the project, it was analyzed as required by the Council on Environmental Quality regulations 40 CFR 1502.14 (d). Alternative 2: The Proposed Action Under the proposed action the USFS would exchange one large parcel of federal land to LFA and BC2 LLC, for 18 private parcels through the Lawyer’s Title of Arizona, Inc., which holds the 18 private parcels in trust. Approval would include the transfer of one 344.24-acre parcel of federal land into private ownership for 18 parcels of private land totaling 1,719.32 acres into federal ownership. The 18 parcels of land to be transferred to the USFS include one 110.57-acre parcel to the ASNFs; 11 parcels totaling 1153.18 acres to the CNF; one 11.15-parcel to the PNF; and 5 parcels totaling 444.42 acres to the TNF. Existing easements on the federal parcel would be maintained after the exchange. Additionally, utility special uses, as described in the land use section of Chapter 3, would be converted to easements to benefit the utility. Lastly, the road access and associated Mogollon Rim Trail would likewise remain open to the public for use. Mitigation Under the Proposed Action The USFS, in consultation with the Arizona State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), has developed a Memorandum of Agreement outlining mitigation measures to be used as part of the Proposed Action (USFS 2014d; Appendix B). By following the Treatment Plan outlined in the Memorandum of Agreement, and discussed further in the cultural resources section of Chapter 3, adverse effects to cultural resources would be mitigated under the Proposed Action. Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study Federal agencies are required by NEPA to rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives and to briefly discuss the reasons for eliminating any alternatives that were not developed in detail (40 CFR 1502.14). Public comments received in response to the proposed action provided suggestions for alternative methods for achieving the purpose and need. Some of these alternatives may have been outside the scope of the purpose and need of the project, duplicative of the alternatives considered in detail, or determined to be components that would cause unnecessary environmental harm. Therefore, a number of alternatives were considered, but dismissed from detailed consideration for reasons summarized below. The range of alternatives for a land exchange proposal is limited by the exchange process itself. A balanced exchange package is arrived at by a series of proposals and counter proposals between the federal and non-federal parties until both parties accept a proposal of parcels. Once both parties agree on an acceptable proposal of parcels, the USFS moves forward with the analysis of the proposed action to exchange those parcels. The exchange proposal analyzed in this document reflects lands mutually agreed upon by the non-federal landowners and the USFS. The federal lands are classified as base-for-exchange (i.e.the federal land being evaluated to leave the NFS) and would be reclassified when it has been determined they meet required criteria as identified in the ASNFs LMP and a decision has been made to exchange the identified lands. Land exchanges convey land, interests in land, and the resources associated with them. The environmental analysis focuses on the future use and management of the lands conveyed and acquired and the effect of the exchange on the lands that adjoin them. During discussions between the parties in 2003, it was determined that additional non-federal lands would need to be added to the proposal as the estimated value of the federal land far exceeded that of the non-federal lands. Reducing the size of the federal parcel to be exchanged was not considered as the ASNFs means to dispose of the entire isolated parcel of federal land. Reducing the size of the federal parcel would mean the ASNFs would continue with managing an isolated parcel of land which has lost its character as National Forest land and is completely surrounded by non-federal lands. Direct Purchase of Non-Federal Parcels Alternative The direct purchase of non-federal lands by the U.S. is an alternative to a land-for-land exchange. However, Land and Water Conservation Fund Act funds that are the primary source of funding for the purchase of non-federally owned lands have historically been available in very limited amounts and only for the highest national priorities. It is anticipated that funding available for land purchases will continue to be very limited into the foreseeable future. Even if funds were available the exchange proponents have stated they are not interested in selling the land to the U.S. Their offer is only for a land-for-land exchange, with the objective being the acquisition of the federal land containing the Camp Tatiyee youth organization camp. Deed Restrictions Alternative The use of deed restriction(s) to direct and control possible future development on the federal land once it has been conveyed into private ownership was considered. The purpose for deed restricting the federal land is to limit or control its use or development after conveyance in order to mitigate an environmental concern. A deed restriction alternative has been eliminated from further study because no environmental concerns are known to exist that would require perpetual protection through the reservation of rights by the U.S. (36 CFR 254.3(h)). Foreseeable future development on the federal land would be subject to the same state laws, county ordinances, and Town of Pinetop-Lakeside zoning ordinances and subdivision regulations as the adjacent private lands. Specific protection measures for either the federal land or adjacent private lands through deed restriction do not appear to be necessary. The intended use of the federal land appears to meet the established management objectives of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside. A deed restriction would not be required in order to fulfill the identified purpose and need. Comparison of Alternatives This section provides a summary of the effects of implementing each alternative analyzed in Chapter 3. Information in Table 2-1 is focused on activities and effects where different levels of effects or outputs can be distinguished quantitatively or qualitatively among alternatives. Chapter 3, Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences, provides a detailed analysis of the effects found within Table 2-1. Table 2-1. Alternative Comparisons Affected Resource/Issue  Alternative 1 No Action  Alternative 2 Proposed Action  Land Use  Federal  No change; SUPs would continue to need periodic review and re-authorization for existing land uses to persist.  Significant change, as property would no longer be subject to USFS management. Land could be subject to development if the land owners change the zoning of the parcel.  Non-federal  No change  Significant change possible as parcels would be subject to land management under the forest LMP, rather than less-restrictive county planning.  Recreation and Public Access  Federal  No change  Negligible impacts. Federal parcel would no longer be accessible for public use, with the exception of the Mogollon Rim Trail.  Non-federal  No change  Beneficial impacts. Non-federal parcels would be available for public recreation, as appropriate under their forest LMP designation.  Affected Resource/Issue  Alternative 1 No Action  Alternative 2 Proposed Action  Socioeconomics  Federal  No change  Less than significant impacts. County would see a reduction in payment in lieu of taxes (PILT) funding. Loss may be offset by property taxes on previously federal parcel, pending any development that may occur on the parcel.  Non-federal  No change  Less than significant impacts. Counties where non-federal parcels lie would see a reduction in private property tax, but this would be offset by an increase in PILT funding.  Plants, Fish, and Wildlife  Negligible impacts. The federal parcel has minimal quality habitat for sensitive, threatened, or endangered species.  Federal  No change  Beneficial impacts. The non-federal land includes high value habitat for sensitive, threatened, and endangered species that is adjacent to critical habitat designations.  Non-federal  No change  Grazing  Federal  No change  No change  Non-federal  No change  Negligible impacts. Non-federal parcels currently used for grazing would be evaluated within each forest for the suitability of ongoing grazing access.  Prime and Unique Farmlands  Federal  No change  No change  Non-federal  No change  No change  Wetlands and Floodplains  Federal  No change  No change; no wetlands or floodplains are located on the federal parcel  Non-federal  No change  Beneficial impacts. Approximately 98 acres of wetlands and 527.76 acres of floodplain would be conveyed to and managed by the USFS.  Affected Resource/Issue  Alternative 1 No Action  Alternative 2 Proposed Action  Water Quality, Rights, andClaims  Federal  No change  No change. All existing water rights would be maintained with the exchange.  Non-federal  No change  No change. All existing water rights would be maintained with the exchange  Cultural Resources  Federal  No change  Mitigated adverse impacts. Cultural resources would leave USFS management and protection. Mitigation would be subject to SHPO coordination.  Non-federal  No change  Beneficial impacts. Any cultural resources located on non-federal parcels would be conveyed to and managed by the USFS.  Mineral Resources  Federal  No change  No change. Subsurface/mineral rights are conveyed as part of the exchange.  Non-federal  No change  No change. Subsurface/mineral rights are conveyed as part of the exchange. Any mineral exploration would be subject to USFS policies and requirements  Roads  Federal  No change  Negligible impact. Parking access to the Mogollon Rim Trail would be maintained as part of the proposed action.  Non-federal  No change  Negligible impact. Private road access on the non-federal parcels would transfer to USFS ownership for evaluation for improvement, maintenance, closure, or obliteration.  Fire and Fuels  Federal  No change  Negligible impacts. Management for fuels and fire safety would become the responsibility of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside.  Affected Resource/Issue  Alternative 1 No Action  Alternative 2 Proposed Action  Non-federal  No change  Negligible impacts. Management for fuels and fire safety would become the responsibility of the USFS, instead of counties.  Hazardous Materials  Federal  No change  No change  Non-federal  No change. Waste rock at the Mansfield Parcel would remain unevaluated by the Abandoned Mine Lands Program for cleanup.  Negligible impacts. Waste rock at the Mansfield Parcel would be evaluated and ranked for clean up under the Abandoned Mine Lands Program.  Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences Introduction This Chapter summarizes the physical, biological, social, and economic environments of the project area and the effects of implementing each alternative on that environment. It also presents the scientific and analytical basis for the comparison of alternatives presented in the alternatives chapter. Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Future Actions A cumulative effect is the effect on the environment that results from the incremental effect of the action when added to the effects of other past, present and reasonably foreseeable future actions, regardless of what agency or person undertakes the other actions and regardless of land ownership on which the other actions occur. An individual action when considered alone may not have a significant effect; however, when its effects are considered in sum with the effects of other past, present and reasonably foreseeable future actions, the effects may be significant. Cumulative effects are assessed in terms of how the proposed action will add to the past, present and reasonably foreseeable activities. Table 3-1 displays projects which are in or adjacent to the project area and have the potential to contribute to a cumulative effect. Table 3-1.

Plants, fish, and wildlife; water quality; cultural resources; recreation; roads; fire and fuels.  Land Use Affected Environment Federal Land Forest Land Management Plan As discussed in Chapter 1, the Camp Tatiyee parcel (344.24 acres, Navajo County, Lakeside RD, ASNFs) is located within the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside (Town) in Navajo County, Arizona. The development (or lack thereof) of the federal land is currently managed under the 1987 LMP for the ASNFs at the time of this analysis. The Camp Tatiyee parcel under the existing 1987 plan is classified as part of the Management Area 1 and describes the parcel as forested land outside special MAs. Management emphasis for the parcel includes timber and fuelwood production, wildlife habitat, livestock grazing, watershed, and dispersed recreation (USFS 1987). The parcel does not contain and is not near any inventoried roadless areas, Wild and Scenic River corridors or study areas, wilderness, or prime farm, range, or forestlands (USFS 1987). Additionally, the development of the Camp Tatiyee parcel prior to proposed private ownership would have changed from the 1987 LMP designations to the new 2015 LMP and would be classified as part of the new designation Community-Forest Intermix MA. As outlined in the 2015 LMP, land included in this MA lies within one half-mile of “communities-at-risk.” The ASNF LMP defines “communities-at-risk” as, “identified in the Federal Register, high risk urban communities within the wildland-urban interface” (USFS 2015a). Lands in the Community-Forest Intermix MA comprise a portion of the wildland-urban interface that occurs forest-wide. The wildland-urban interface refers to areas throughout ASNF around human development at imminent risk from managed burns and wildfires. The Community-Forest Intermix MA can be used as a zone for fire suppression activities and acts as a buffer to protect land and property adjacent to the MA from wildfire damage. The Community-Forest Intermix MA is managed to minimize the risk of fire spreading into (or from) adjacent developed areas (USFS 2015a). Local Zoning Zoning districts have been established for the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside in the Town Code in order to guide local development. The Town has “zoned” the federal land within its municipal limits; however, the zoning designation is unenforceable so long as the land stays within federal ownership, as the Town lacks jurisdiction over federal land. The Camp Tatiyee parcel is currently zoned as open space, and the existing land use is consistent with this designation with few approved exceptions, which are detailed below. The federal land is bordered on the north, east, and south by light commercial and residential development. The land to east is within the Town’s municipal boundary, and the current uses are consistent with the Town’s zoning district designations (Figure 3-1). The properties along the northeastern border of the federal parcel, across State Route (SR) 260, are zoned as primarily planned unit development surrounded by small areas zoned as open space. The planned unit development zoning district allows for mixed-residential uses, such as townhomes, condos, multi-family dwellings, cooperatives and timeshares (Town of Pinetop-Lakeside 2014). The properties along the southeastern border, both abutting the federal parcel and across SR 260 are zoned as light commercial (C1)and rural residential (R-LOW). The C-1 zoning district allows for a wide variety of uses, including multiple/single family dwellings, hotels/motels, private schools, churches, banks, offices, home occupations, restaurants, cafes. The R-LOW zoning district is more limited, with low density residential allowing for a maximum of one dwelling unit per acre (Town of Pinetop-Lakeside 2001). In addition to single-family dwellings, other types of structures are allowed and may include guest ranches, churches, private schools and home occupations. The lands to the north and south of the Camp Tatiyee parcel do not fall within the Town’s municipal boundary, and are therefore subject to the planning and zoning regulations of Navajo County. The light commercial and residential uses present are consistent with Navajo County zoning designations. The land to the north of the federal parcel are zoned as Commercial-Residential (C-R), Multi-family Residential (R-2), and General Zoning District (A-General) (Navajo County 2014). The R-2 zoning district allows for multiple family dwellings or other types of high-density housing (minimum 2,000 square feet per dwelling unit, minimum lot size of 6,000 square feet) as well as orphanages, rest homes, nursing homes and convents. The C-R zoning district allows for multiple-family residential (minimum 1,000 square feet per dwelling unit, minimum parcel size of 6,000 square feet) uses as well as commercial retail and entertainment, and light manufacturing, The A-General zoning district allows for residential uses (singlefamily dwellings, one dwelling per a minimum of one acre), farms, recreational, institutional, commercial and industrial uses (Navajo County 2012). The land to the south of the parcel is zoned (R1-10) and Rural One zoning district (RU-1). The RU-1 district allows for residential uses (one dwelling unit per acre), farms, recreational and institutional uses. The R1-10 district allows for single-family dwellings (minimum lot size 10,000 square feet) churches, schools, parks, playgrounds, and other community facilities. The land to the west of the Camp Tatiyee parcel is undeveloped and is part of the Fort Apache Reservation, and is not subject to municipal or county zoning. The Fort Apache Reservation is under the jurisdiction of the White Mountain Apache Tribe, and recreational permits are available for purchase for fishing, camping, rafting and other outdoor recreation activities (White Mountain Apache Tribe Game & Fish 2014). Land Use The federal parcel is partially developed and has a number of land uses authorized by the USFS SUPs and easements. Uses include two youth organization camps, a recreation trail, NFSR, and water, energy and telephone utility features. Table 3-2 below summarizes the land uses currently authorized on the federal parcel. Table 3-2.

Facilities on the site include four dormitories with a total capacity of 125 people, three staff cabins, a dining hall and kitchen, a recreation hall with stage, an indoor heated pool, an outdoor ramada with barbeque, an infirmary, sensory therapy room and outdoor recreational amenities. The recreational amenities include nature trails, a fishing pond, an archery range, an outdoor playground, a baseball field and a basketball court. Through the summer, Camp Tatiyee hosts intervals of 72 campers per week up to 600 per season. When the summer camp is not in session, late August through early May, groups can rent facilities for private use (Lions Camp Tatiyee 2014). Camp Grace occupies a separate but nearby portion of the federal parcel with an SUP that includes approximately 16 acres. The camp is available to rent year-round by groups for private use. Facilities on the site include 14 cabins, a three bedroom guest house, two restroom facilities with showers, an outdoor ramada, an amphitheater-style campfire pit, a commercial kitchen and dining hall, and outdoor recreational amenities. The recreational amenities include a volleyball area, a horseshoe pit, a basketball court, a baseball and a soccer field, tetherball, an activity course, and a small lake (Mission of Grace 2014). The remainder of the parcel is primarily used for pedestrian recreation. The Mogollon Rim Interpretive Trail #615 is heavily used year round by thousands of people, and the entirety of the trail is located on the federal parcel. The USFS manages an access road and parking lot for the trail. The Recreation and Public Access section in this chapter provides additional detail on the Mogollon Rim Trail. There are three other NFSRs located on the parcel that are directly managed by the USFS. NFSR 300 (currently closed to the public), NFSR 9705L1 and NFSR 9705L2, access roads to Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace, respectively. Non-federal Land The non-federal land includes 18 parcels, located throughout eight counties in Arizona and four national forests, totaling approximately 1,719 acres. The existing conditions for each parcel are described below, and additional information on the non-federal parcels is included in Chapter 1, Proposed Action, Non-federal Lands to be Exchanged. This discussion is organized by the national forest that surrounds the non-federal parcel. Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests The Carlisle parcel (110 acres, Navajo County, Lakeside RD, ASNFs) is located approximately 6.5 miles northwest of Show Low, Arizona. The parcel is not currently encumbered and remains undeveloped and unoccupied. The property as currently described under the 1987 LMP is primarily pinyon-juniper woodland, in a management area emphasizing fuelwood production, wildlife habitat, watershed condition, and livestock grazing (USFS 1987). Detailed information on grazing can be found in the Grazing section of this chapter. NFSR-134 crosses the northeast corners of the parcel. A telephone line crosses the parcel from north to south along the western boundary of the parcel. Utility poles and transmission lines maintained by Navopache Electric Cooperative, Inc. traverse the parcel from east to west (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). Coronado National Forest The Happy Valley East parcel (239 acres, Cochise County; Santa Catalina RD, CNF) is located in the Happy Valley area east of Tucson, Arizona, in the Rincon Mountains and is approximately 1 mile east of the Happy Valley 40 parcel. The parcel is not currently encumbered and remains undeveloped and unoccupied. The MAs surrounding the parcels include fuelwood/forage production and riparian habitat protection and improvement. The fuelwood/forage MA focuses on the sustained harvest of livestock forage and fuelwood, the maintenance and improvement of game habitat, and mitigation of impacts to wildlife and cultural resources. The riparian habitat MA focuses on improving riparian resources, and an effort to protect and regenerate unique species of riparian flora and fauna. Protection of this habitat may limit recreational uses (USFS 1986a). Paige Creek and Buckhorn Spring are present on the parcel, and a public road traverses it. Grazing and recreational uses such as hunting have been known to occur on the parcel (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011b). Detailed information on grazing can be found in the Grazing section of this chapter. Additional information on recreational activities can be found in the Recreation and Public Access section in this chapter. The Happy Valley West and Happy Valley 40 parcels (80 acres and 40 acres, respectively, Pima County, Santa Catalina RD, CNF) are located in the Happy Valley area east of Tucson, Arizona, in the Rincon Mountains. The Happy Valley 40 parcel is located approximately 1 mile east of Saguaro National Park, and approximately 0.5 miles east of the Rincon Mountain Wilderness Area. Turkey Creek runs through the parcel, as well as several dirt roads for all-terrain vehicle recreational use. The Happy Valley West parcel is located approximately 1 mile east of the Happy Valley 40 parcel. Paige Creek and Buckhorn Spring are present on the parcel, and a public road traverses it. Both parcels are not currently encumbered and remain undeveloped and unoccupied. Recreational uses such as hunting have been known to occur on the parcel (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011b). Cattle grazing has also been known to occur on both the Happy Valley 40 and the Happy Valley West parcels. The MAs surrounding the parcels include fuelwood/forage production and riparian habitat protection and improvement. Detailed information on grazing can be found in the Grazing section of this chapter. Additional information on recreational activities can be found in the Recreation and Public Access section in this chapter. The Harshaw Creek parcel (76 acres, Santa Cruz County, Sierra Vista RD, CNF) is located approximately 8 miles southeast of the Town of Patagonia, Arizona, along Harshaw Creek, between the Patagonia Mountains and the Canelo Hills. The parcel is bordered on the west side by private property (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011b). The terrain is rocky and covered in grasses, shrubs, and trees. The parcel is surrounded by two MAs: fuelwood/forage production, and maintenance of unique ecological values. Both MAs seek to provide the sustained harvest of livestock forage and fuelwood and the protection of visual, soil and water resources while permitting recreational uses. However, some uses may be restricted in the MA, where the focus is on maintaining and restoring unique ecology. The parcel is not currently encumbered and remains undeveloped and unoccupied. Easements for Santa Cruz County road right of way are present on the parcel (recorded 9 November 1998), and access to the parcel is via Harshaw Road. The Mansfield parcel (182 acres, Santa Cruz County, Nogales RD, CNF) is located in the Santa Rita Mountains southeast of Tucson, Arizona and approximately seven miles northwest of Patagonia, Arizona. The terrain is rugged and consists of steep hillsides, gulches and springs. The parcel is surrounded by a fuelwood/forage MA. The MA seeks to provide the sustained harvest of livestock forage and fuelwood and the protection of visual, soil and water resources (USFS 1986a). The parcel is not currently encumbered and remains mostly undeveloped and unoccupied. Nine historic (now abandoned) patented mining claims in the Wrightson Mining Claim are located on the parcel (Mineral Survey number 4318). Site improvements include two 4-wheel drive roads on the eastern half of the parcel (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009a). Detailed information on the mining operations is presented in the Hazardous Materials section of this chapter. The Ronstadt Highway parcel (134 acres, Graham County, Safford RD, CNF) is located in the Stockton Pass area along SR 266, approximately three miles southeast of Fort Grant Arizona State Prison, in the Pinaleno Mountains. The parcel’s northeast corner is bordered by a small private parcel, but is otherwise bordered on the north by NFS and Arizona State Trust lands. The parcel is surrounded by a fuelwood/forage MA, which seeks to provide the sustained harvest of livestock forage and fuelwood and the protection of visual, soil and water resources (USFS 1986a). The parcel is not currently encumbered and remains undeveloped and unoccupied. The primary use of the parcel is free range  cattle grazing. The cattle drink from a 10-foot-square earthen reservoir (soil depression) located at the southeast corner of the parcel. Detailed information on grazing activities can be found in the Grazing section in this chapter. An easement exists for ingress and egress via the existing ranch road, to any portion of the parcel south of the Arizona SR 266 centerline. A stock tank is the only structure that exists on the parcel (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011b). The Ronstadt Tank parcel (80 acres, Graham County, Safford RD, CNF) is located in Bar-X Canyon approximately five miles southeast of the Ronstadt Highway parcel. The parcel is also located in the Pinaleno Mountains. The parcel is entirely surrounded by NFS lands in the CNF, and surrounded by a fuelwood/forage MA. The MA seeks to provide the sustained harvest of livestock forage and fuelwood and the protection of visual, soil and water resources (USFS 1986a). The parcel is not currently encumbered and remains mostly undeveloped and unoccupied. A small paved road, NFSR 664, provides access to the parcel. Free range cattle grazing occurs on the parcel. Recreational uses such as hunting have also been known to occur and a USFS trail crosses through the northwest corner of the parcel. Structures on the parcel include a cement water tank, a well, and an earthen reservoir lined with clay that was constructed in 1985 (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011b). Detailed information on grazing, the water tank, and recreational features can be found in the Grazing, Water Quality, Rights, and Claims, and Recreation and Public Access sections in this chapter. The Rucker East and Rucker West parcels (160 acres and 160 acres, respectively, Cochise County, Douglas RD, CNF) are located approximately 30 miles north of Douglas, Arizona, in the Rucker Canyon within the Chiricahua Mountains. The parcels are separated by a strip of privately owned land. The parcels are surrounded by two different MAs: fuelwood/forage production and recreation. The fuelwood/forage MA seeks to provide the sustained harvest of livestock forage and fuelwood and the protection of visual, soil and water resources. The recreation MA has the objective of protection, maintenance and improvements of the unique biological and cultural resources that make the land suitable for recreation (USFS 1986a). The parcels are not currently encumbered and remain mostly undeveloped and unoccupied. A paved road, NFSR 64, running east and west provides access to the parcel. The parcel is used for free range cattle grazing, and a small creek runs through it (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011b). Detailed information on grazing can be found in the Grazing section in this chapter. The Stronghold and Stronghold Well Site parcels (1 acre and 0.4 acre, respectively, Cochise County, Douglas RD, CNF) are located approximately nine miles northwest of Pearce, Arizona in the East Stronghold Canyon within the Dragoon Mountains, and north of the East Stronghold Campground. The parcels are bordered to the north and south by residential properties that have not been developed and contain no improvements. The surrounding MA is recreation (USFS 1986a). The parcels are not currently encumbered and remain mostly undeveloped and unoccupied. Access to the parcel is provided by a small paved road, NFSR 84, along the eastern border of the parcel. A second paved road exists on the western border of the parcel, leading to the East Stronghold Campground one-quarter mile to the south. An additional improvement is a well site near the parcel’s border (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011b). Prescott National Forest The Babcock parcel (11 acres, Yavapai County, Bradshaw RD, PNF) is a patented lode mining claim located approximately 3 miles south of Crown King, Arizona. The terrain is rugged and consists of steep hillsides, desert plants (primarily chaparral with interspersed pinyon-juniper vegetative types), and boulders. As described in the existing 1986 LMP, the MA surrounding the parcel is focused on the improvement over watershed condition to increase water yield and improvement of wildlife habitat conditions (USFS 1986b). The parcel is not currently encumbered and remains undeveloped (i.e. no surface structures, improvements, or modifications observed on site) and unoccupied. The parcel is accessed via NFSR 192. The Ochre Mining Claim (MS number 2711) in the Tiger Mining District, established in 1909, exists on the parcel (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2010). Tonto National Forest The Red Rover parcel (62 acres, Yavapai and Maricopa Counties, Cave Creek RD, TNF) is located approximately 15 miles northeast of Carefree, Arizona in the New River Mountains. The terrain is rugged and consists of steep hillsides, desert plants (primarily chaparral with interspersed pinyon-juniper vegetative types), and boulders. The MAs surrounding the parcel are focused on the improvement of watershed condition to increase water yield and improvement of wildlife habitat conditions, as well as livestock forage production, management of riparian areas, and dispersed recreation (USFS 1985). The parcel is not currently encumbered and remains mostly undeveloped and unoccupied. No structures or improvements were observed on the subject site, however mining is known to have occurred in the past. A power transmission line runs east-west approximately one mile from the parcel. Three patented lode mining claims (Red Rover Company, MS numbers 6, 7, and 15) are located on the parcel, in the Magazine Mining District established in 1919 (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2010). Tonto Creek 1, Tonto Creek 2, and Tonto Creek 3 parcels (120 acres, 160 acres, and 70 acres, respectively, Gila County, Tonto Basin RD, TNF) are located approximately 11 miles northwest of Roosevelt Lake, Arizona, within the Tonto Creek floodplain. The land surrounding the parcel is undeveloped and makes up the Tonto Creek floodplain. The MAs surrounding these parcels are focused on the improvement of watershed condition to increase water yield and improvement of wildlife habitat conditions, as well as livestock forage production, management of riparian areas, and dispersed recreation (USFS 1985). The parcels are not currently encumbered and remain undeveloped and unoccupied. The parcel is accessed by SR 188. The land is mainly used for recreational activities, including hunting and fishing. A small modern manmade dam of boulders exists on the site; fishermen presumably created the dam to trap fish (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). This dam lies within the creek and is of ephemeral construction; it would not have survived high water conditions and could not date any earlier than the modern period. Pleasant Valley parcel (33 acres, Gila County, Pleasant Valley RD, TNF) is located approximately three miles west of Young, Arizona, and lies at the head of Walnut Creek Canyon. The MAs surrounding the parcel are focused on the improvement of watershed condition to increase water yield and improvement of wildlife habitat conditions, as well as livestock forage production, to manage riparian areas, and dispersed recreation (USFS 1985). Portions of the parcel’s perimeter are fenced but not enclosed entirely. Walnut Creek runs southwest to the northeast of the property, but the creek occasionally runs dry. The parcel is not currently encumbered and remains mostly undeveloped (a water tank for cattle is located on the parcel) and unoccupied. Access to the parcel is via NFSR 134. The parcel is mainly used for free range cattle grazing and there is a large water tank on site (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). Detailed information on grazing can be found in the Grazing section of this chapter. Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the proposed action, the federal parcel (344.24 acres) would be conveyed to private ownership. Existing SUPs for utilities on the federal parcel would be converted to easements at the time of the conveyance. Existing NFSRs on the parcel would leave federal management and be subject to land owner maintenance. The land would continue to be available for use by the Camp Tatiyee youth organization camp. The SUP holder for the second youth organization camp, Camp Grace, would have the option to purchase the land that Camp Grace occupies, and maintain the camp. Public access to the remainder of parcel would be at the discretion of the landowner. Existing zoning designations that were unenforceable while the parcel was under federal ownership would apply upon transfer to private ownership. In order for any uses other than open space to be established on the parcel, the parcel would require rezoning. The rezoning process provides multiple opportunities for public notification, review, and comment, via Planning and Zoning Commission and Town Council hearings prior to the approval and adoption of the new zoning ordinance. The parcel, if rezoned, would likely be developed consistent with the adjacent zoning districts, and may include a planned unit development, C-1, and R-LOW, as described in the previous section. As mentioned above, the USFS would cease to administer the SUPs currently on the property, and management of the NFSRs on the parcel would be transferred to the local authority. Utilities with active SUPs on the parcel would establish easements on the privately owned parcel. Additionally, the development of the Camp Tatiyee parcel prior to private ownership would have changed from the 1987 LMP designations to the new 2015 LMP and would be classified as part of the new designation Community-Forest Intermix MA. However, upon conveyance, these new designations would no longer apply to this parcel. Non-federal Land Under the proposed action, the 18 non-federal parcels would be transferred to federal ownership, and no future development would occur. The non-federal parcels would be integrated into the USFS LMP for each respective area under the proposed action. Table 3-3 lists the future MA designations for each parcel. Table 3-3.

The MAs listed in the table reflect the revised MAs for the ASNFs and the PNF. The revision process for the CNF and TNF is still preliminary, and MA designation may change after the completion of this NEPA process. The non-federal parcels would be evaluated by the USFS for potential inclusion in any surrounding grazing allotments and recreation areas, as applicable. No significant direct or indirect effects to grazing are anticipated from the proposed action. For more information on grazing, see the Grazing section in this chapter. The USFS would continue to recognize the limited existing easements and authorized uses located on the non-federal parcels. Cumulative Effects Federal Land The cumulative effects analysis considers past, present, and foreseeable future actions that could contribute to the direct and indirect effects of the proposed action. Under the proposed action, the federal parcel would be conveyed to private ownership, as described in the previous section. The parcel would be subject to development under the zoning ordinance of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside. Within the vicinity of the federal parcel, the activities most likely to contribute to a cumulative effect to land use include: • Woodland Lake Park Tract Townsite Act Purchase: A Town of Pinetop-Lakeside proposal for the phased purchase of 543 acres of federal lands administered by the ASNFs (EA complete September 2013). • The Show Low South Land Exchange: A proposed land exchange consisting of 1,028 acres of NFS lands in the ASNFs and Coconino National Forest (CocNF) in exchange for 1,558 acres of non-federal lands in the PNF, CocNF, and ASNFs. • Lakeside District Office Conveyance: NFS land at the Lakeside Ranger Station for sale under the USFS Facility Realignment and Enhancement Act. This also involves analyzing the location of a new ranger station (action currently under analysis). • Apache-Sitgreaves Land Management Plan Revision: Update of the 1987 LMP to revise the management strategies and protocols throughout the ASNFs (Draft ROD issued 17 December 2013; expected ROD 2015). One land exchange and two land conveyances are future actions to be considered within the project region. The Show Low South Land Exchange, which would involve a trade of federal land for non-federal land, would allow for a consolidation of USFS lands and would make the private lands transferred into federal ownership available for public recreation and other uses. The Woodland Lake Park FONSI and DN (issued 6 September 2013) conveyance and the Lakeside District Office (expected decision 2016) conveyance are two separate actions, which would involve selling USFS land into private ownership. The federal land conveyed would be subject to future development at the discretion of the land owner. Any future development for either project would be subject to the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside’s zoning ordinance. The combination of the proposed action with these other real estate actions would result in a total loss of approximately 1,722 acres of undeveloped federal land that is immediately accessible to the residents of the City of Show Low, the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside, and unincorporated Navajo County lands. While some of the land would continue to operate in a manner similar to existing conditions—e.g., the Camp Tatiyee and Woodland Lake Park would continue to exist with improvements designed to continue existing operations—much of the land may be subject to development via rezoning and subdivision properties. While this does constitute a substantial loss of open space to the local residents, there is still ample ASNFs-managed land that offers less fragmented open spaces that is also in the immediate vicinity of the City, Town, and County lands. The 2015 ASNFs LMP revision updated the 1987 plan and changed the MA designation for the federal parcel from forage/fuelwood production (Management Area 1) to Community-Forest Intermix as part of the forest-wide wildland-urban interface. The wildland-urban interface refers to areas throughout ASNFs around human development at imminent risk from managed burns and wildfires. The Community-Forest Intermix MA can be used as a zone for fire suppression activities and acts as a buffer to protect land and property adjacent to the MA from wildfire damage. The Community-Forest Intermix MA has been developed to minimize the risk of fire spreading into (or from) adjacent developed areas. This changed the emphasis from producing livestock forage to more focus on eliminating fuels that could lead to the spread of wildfires. Thus, the conveyance of the Camp Tatiyee parcel, considered cumulatively with other local land activities, would result in an adverse, but less than significant direct impact to land use. No indirect significant cumulative impacts to land use are anticipated. Non-federal Land Under the proposed action the 18 non-federal parcels would be conveyed to federal ownership. Table 3-3 shows the MAs that would currently be anticipated to apply to each parcel. The 2015 ASNFs LMP update discussed above would apply to the non-federal Carlisle parcel. The PNF LMP update would similarly apply to the Babcock parcel. The CNF and TNF are currently undergoing revisions to their LMPs that have the potential to alter MAs in the vicinity of the parcels, but those revisions are too preliminary to predict any changes here. The 2015 ASNFs LMP revision updated the 1987 plan and changed the MA designation for the land surrounding the Carlisle parcel from forage/fuelwood production to Community-Forest Intermix as part of the forest-wide wildland-urban interface. The wildland-urban interface are areas throughout ASNFs around human development at imminent risk from managed burns and wildfires. The Community-Forest Intermix MA can be used as a zone for fire suppression activities and acts as a buffer to protect land and property adjacent to the MA from wildfire damage. The Community-Forest Intermix MA has been developed to minimize the risk of fire spreading into (or from) adjacent developed areas. This changes the emphasis from producing livestock forage to more focus on eliminating fuelwood that could lead to the spread of wildfires. Thus, the conveyance of the non-federal parcels, considered cumulatively with other local land activities, would not result in any significant direct or indirect impacts to land use. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the no action alternative, existing conditions would remain unchanged. The USFS would continue to administer the SUPs and easements located on the federal parcel and incur the associated expenses. Additionally, the higher level of management associated with the 2015 LMP Community-Forest Intermix MA would continue to be required. Non-federal Land The non-federal parcels would remain in private ownership. Therefore, the no action alternative would result in no impacts to land use for the non-federal parcels. Cumulative Effects Federal Land The cumulative effects analysis considers past, present, and foreseeable future actions that could contribute to the direct and indirect effects of the no action alternative. Under the no action alternative, the federal parcel would remain under its current ownership, as described in the previous section. One land exchange and two land conveyances are future actions to be considered within the project region. The Show Low South Land Exchange, which would involve a trade of federal land for non-federal land, would allow for a consolidation of USFS lands and would make the private lands transferred into federal ownership available for public recreation and other uses. The Woodland Lake Park conveyance and the Lakeside District Office conveyance are two separate actions, which would involve selling USFS land into private ownership. The federal land conveyed would be subject to future development at the discretion of the land owner. Any future development for either project would be subject to the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside’s zoning ordinance. These three projects will cause adverse but not significant direct impacts to local land use activities. No indirect cumulative impacts are anticipated to land use under the no action alternative. Non-federal Land Under the no action alternative, the non-federal parcels would remain under private ownership. The ASNFs, CNF, PNF, and TNF are currently undergoing revisions to their LMPs that would have the potential to alter MAs in the vicinity of the private parcels. The 2015 ASNFs LMP revision updated the 1987 plan and changes the MA designation for the vicinity around the Carlisle parcel from forage/fuelwood production to Community-Forest Intermix as part of the forest-wide wildland-urban interface. The wildland-urban interface refers to areas throughout ASNFs around human development at imminent risk from managed burns and wildfires. The Community-Forest Intermix MA can be used as a zone for fire suppression activities and acts as a buffer to protect land and property adjacent to the MA from wildfire damage. The Community-Forest Intermix MA has been developed to minimize the risk of fire spreading into (or from) adjacent developed areas. This changes the emphasis from producing livestock forage to more focus on eliminating fuelwood that could lead to the spread of wildfires. The private lands would not be subject to the potential land use changes that result from the LMP revisions, and therefore no significant cumulative direct or indirect impacts are anticipated the non-federal parcels under the no action alternative. Recreation and Public Access Affected Environment Federal Land The development (or lack thereof) of the federal land is currently managed under the 1987 LMP for the ASNFs at the time of this analysis. The Camp Tatiyee parcel under the existing 1987 plan is classified as part of the Management Area 1 and describes the parcel as forested land outside special MAs. Management emphasis for the parcel includes timber and fuelwood production, wildlife habitat, livestock grazing, watershed, and dispersed recreation (USFS 1987). The existing youth organization camps (i.e., Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace) that occupy the eastern portion of the federal land are both private facilities and are therefore not legally open to public use. These camps occupy approximately 96 acres, or 28 percent of the 344-acre site. The balance of the federal parcel is available to, and used by, the public. The Mogollon Rim Interpretive Trail #615 is a 1mile long self-guided recreational trail that is located on the federal land. This trail is open to public use, and a trail head is located along the western side of SR 260, between the driveways that provide access to and from Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace. The Mogollon Rim Interpretive Trail includes scenic vistas, and is visited by thousands of people annually (USFS 2014a). Non-federal Land Non-federal land is private property which is by definition not legally open to public use. However, many of these non-federal parcels are located adjacent to USFS MAs that permit or encourage recreational activities under specified conditions (i.e., when recreation does not adversely affect the productivity of the land or resources). Depending on the condition of fencing or other barriers along the property boundaries, it is possible that public recreational activities on adjoining federal land may spill over into non-federal land. Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the proposed action, an approximately 344-acre federally-owned parcel would be transferred from public to private ownership. As a result, public access for recreation would be permanently lost within the majority of the federal land. However, because the proposed action would assure continued access for public use of the Mogollon Interpretive Trail #615, the impact to Recreation and Public Access would be less than significant. Non-federal Land Under the proposed action, 18 parcels encompassing approximately 1,719 acres would be incorporated into four different forests. The public would be able to access additional NFS lands that do not currently have legal road access. This land would be managed by the USFS and management designations would be applied initially based on surrounding federal land. The following non-federal parcels are located adjacent to USFS MAs that either permit or encourage recreation under certain circumstances: • Happy Valley East • Happy Valley West • Harshaw Creek • Ronstadt Highway • Rucker East • Rucker West • Stronghold • Stronghold Well Site The above parcels total more than 990 acres. Assuming that these parcels would be designated to permit or encourage recreation, consistent with the adjoining USFS MAs, then the proposed action would increase the amount of land that is accessible to the public for recreational purposes. Moreover, based upon a review of LMP compliance and public benefits determination presented in Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange Feasibility Analysis (USFS 2014b), all of the non-federal parcels would provide a benefit to dispersed recreation, which includes camping, hiking, hunting, wildlife viewing, and vehicular access. As a result, the proposed action would have a beneficial impact to recreation and public access on non-federal land. Cumulative Effects The following past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects would contribute to the direct and indirect effects to Recreation and Public Access described above. • Under the Show Low South Land Exchange project, there would be a net gain of 530 acres which would be largely available to recreationists (USFS 2013). The acquired land would be located in the ASNFs, the PNF, and the CocNF. The Show Low South project would also involve the relocation of a portion of the Buena Vista Trail #637 and the construction of a new trail head on federal land. These actions would accommodate the land exchange, while preserving public access to the trail for recreational purposes. • The Woodland Lake Park Tract Townsite Act Purchase project would result in a net loss of 543 acres of land administered by the ASNFs. • The Lakeside Ranger Station Conveyance project would involve the sale at auction of administrative lands and Lakeside campground in the ASNFs. From a statewide perspective, the proposed action and the Show Low Land Exchange project would result in a net increase of approximately 1,900 acres that would be transferred to USFS management. Much of this land is expected to be accessible to the public for recreational activities, and the net increase associated with these two land exchange projects would compensate for the loss of USFS land that would occur as the result of the Woodland Lake Park Tract Townsite Act Purchase and the Lakeside Range Station Conveyance project. However, from a more localized perspective, the loss of USFS land would occur primarily in the Lakeside RD (i.e., in areas between 5 and 8 miles of the proposed action) and therefore, residents of Pinetop-Lakeside, Show Low, and surrounding areas would experience more impacts than those living in other areas affected by the proposed action. However, because the proposed action would retain public access to the Mogollon Interpretive Trail #615 and because the Show Low South project would assure public access to the realigned Buena Vista Trail #637, the main recreational attractions in the area, the localized cumulative impact would be less than significant. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the no action alternative, the land exchange would not occur, and public access would continue to be provided to portions of the federal land outside the SUP areas, including the Mogollon Interpretive Trail #615. No direct or indirect impacts to Recreation and Public Access would occur. Non-federal Land Existing land use and activities on the non-federal land would continue under the no action alternative. As a result, there would be no direct or indirect impacts to Recreation and Public Access. Cumulative Effects The cumulative land exchange and conveyance projects described above would reduce the amount of federally-managed land throughout the state. As a result, there would be a net loss in the amount of USFS land that is publicly available for recreational use. However, because access to the Buena Vista Trail #637 would be retained, the impact would be less than significant. Because the no action alternative would not have any impacts relative to Recreation and Public Access, this alternative would not contribute significantly toward the cumulative effect on this resource. Socioeconomics Affected Environment Federal Land Population Table 3-4 shows population and population growth Navajo County (where federal land would become private land), the state of Arizona, and the U.S. in 2000 and 2010.

Under the proposed action Camp Tatiyee would still be operated as a summer camp while some of the land on the parcel would become open for development. However, no specific plans for future development have been made. Since the proposed action does not call for development, and no specific plans for development have been made, effects related to potential development that may occur given private ownership of the land are covered as cumulative impacts. Population Because the proposed action does not involve activities (such as residential property development or activities that may generate or deter economic growth) that may encourage population to relocate to Navajo County, it is not anticipated that the proposed action would bring about a change in population characteristics or trends in Navajo County. Employment and Income Because the proposed action does not involve activities that may generate or deter economic growth, it is not anticipated that the proposed action would lead to changes in employment and income in Navajo County. Property Values and Taxes The foremost socioeconomic change that would occur from the transfer would be related to local property taxes. Federal property is not taxable by local governments while private property is taxable. As such, the land that is being transferred would become taxable. As the land would become taxable, two effects would be anticipated (1) property tax revenues would increase and (2) PILT revenues would decrease. The net effect would likely be minimal (i.e., increased property tax revenues would likely be largely offset by decreased PILT payments) and any overall effects related to government revenue and the provision of public services would be less than significant. Some concerns have been raised that if the land is conveyed to private hands it could become developed (changing from its current open space land use), which may have a detrimental effect on nearby residential property values. Research does suggest that proximity to open space can have an effect on property values (Bolitzer and Netusil 2000, Geoghegan 2002, Sengupta et al. 2003, Anderson and West 2006). Effects of open space on nearby property values have been shown to be mixed but, overall, beneficial to prices (Bolitzer and Netusil 2000, Sengupta et al. 2003). Furthermore, one study indicates that beneficial effects on property values are stronger with permanent open space than with developable open space (Geoghegan 2002). Given the findings of this study, because the proposed action would convey land from being non-developable to being developable, the proposed action may negatively affect nearby property values. The impact on individual properties, however, would tend to be small given that the overall impact of open space on property values is greatest in urban areas, where open space is at a premium, and lower in areas such as Navajo County, where open space is abundant (Anderson and West 2006). Because Navajo County is a rural area, where open space is not at a premium, any effects on property values, related to conveying land from permanent open-space to developable land would be less than significant and be limited to those properties nearest to the transferred parcel. Non-federal Land The proposed action would transfer 18 separate parcels totaling 1,719 acres from private ownership to federal ownership. Population Because the proposed action does not involve activities (such as residential property development or activities that may generate or deter economic growth) that may encourage population to relocate, it is not anticipated that the proposed action would bring about a change in population characteristics or trends in the various affected counties. Employment and Income Because the proposed action does not involve activities that may generate or deter economic growth, it is not anticipated that the proposed action would lead to changes in employment and income in the various affected counties. Property Values and Taxes The foremost socioeconomic change that would occur from the transfer would be related to local property taxes. Federal property is not taxable by local governments while private property is taxable. As such, the land that is being transferred would become non-taxable, which would likely have the effect of decreasing local government revenues. Conversely, PILT revenues would stand to increase. Table 3-19 shows estimates of increased federal land, PILT payments per acre, and increased PILT payments for each county that would be affected. Table 3-19. Anticipated PILT Payment per Acre by County with Proposed Action Location  Additional Federal Land (acres)  PILT Payment per Acre  Potential Increase Annual in PILT Payment  Cochise County  560.5  $2.38  $1,333  Gila County  382.5  $1.93  $740  Graham County  214.4  $2.53  $543  Maricopa County1  N/A  N/A  N/A  Navajo County  110.6  $2.54  $280  Pima County  120.0  $2.06  $247  Santa Cruz County  258.2  $2.26  $584  Yavapai County1  73.1  $1.22  $89  Note1: Acreage and payment associated with Red Rover parcel applied to Yavapai County. N/A=not applicable. Source: DOI 2014. Table 3-20 compares the potential increase in PILT payment with the 2013 property taxes paid to each county. The net effect would be minimal (i.e., decreased property tax revenues would likely be largely offset by increased PILT payments) and any overall effects related to government revenue and the provision of public services would be less than significant. For those counties that would result in an net loss of income (i.e., Gila County, Santa Cruz County, and Yavapai County), the total property tax contributes less than 0.02 percent of each counties’ property tax revenue. Thus, the net loss would be less than significant. Table 3-20.

Increased development in the region may lead to increases in population and economic activity, which tend to lead to increases in government revenues and public services capacity. Effects of increased development on home prices would tend to be mixed and, for the vast majority of properties in the region, less than significant relative to other factors that affect housing values. Non-federal Land Projects that convey land from private to federal hands could have cumulative impacts in terms of the potential for reduced economic activities that may result from federal ownership. For instance, some existing or potential mining operations or cattle grazing activities may be disallowed under federal ownership, leading to a potential reduction in overall economic activity. This effect is anticipated to be less than significant relative to overall economic activity in the region. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal and Non-federal Land Because the no action alternative would not affect socioeconomic conditions, no impacts are anticipated in association with the proposed action. Cumulative Effects Federal Land and Non-federal Land Because the no action alternative would not affect socioeconomic conditions, no impacts are anticipated in association with the proposed action; as such cumulative impacts are not anticipated. Plants, Fish, and Wildlife Affected Environment Consultation between the USFS and USFWS associated with Region 3 LMPs has resulted in Biological Opinions (BO) that provide guidance on all activities conducted on NFS lands that may require amendments to Region 3 LMPs. The USFS Region 3 consulted with the USFWS on the 11 LMPs for all national forests and grasslands in the region, and a final biological and conference opinion (LMP BO) was issued on 10 June 2005. In order to address a number of issues concerning the LMP BO, the Forest Service reinitiated Endangered Species Act (ESA) Section 7 consultation with the USFWS in May 2010. Consultation was completed on 30 April 2012, with individual biological opinions for each forest in the Southwestern Region. The new ASNFs LMP BO (ASNFs LMP BO 2012) will henceforth be utilized. It is the current direction of the Southwestern Region to conduct a consistency check to determine whether an amendment to a LMP would be consistent with the requirements of the ASNFs LMP BO. A LMP amendment is considered to be consistent with the ASNFs LMP BO if it: (1) results in effects (to species and/or designated critical habitat) that were analyzed in the BO; (2) does not result in exceeding the amount of take issued in the BO; (3) meets the assumptions stated in the BO; and (4) would result in continuing to implement the terms and conditions of the BO. Based on a review of the ASNFs LMP BO in relation to proposed project activities, implementation of any of the alternatives proposed would be consistent with the new ASNFs LMP BO. A second consistency review will be completed when the final BO is available for the 2015 ASNF LMP, and the analysis for this land exchange will be revised appropriately. The ASNFs also completed a biological assessment and evaluation (BA&E) specific to the land exchange proposed here. The BA&E focused on the federal parcels involved in the proposed land exchange (3C Consulting 2010). The BA&E evaluated impacts to federally protected species listed as threatened and endangered (T&E) under the ESA; Forest Service sensitive species, management indicator species (MIS) listed by the ASNFs, CNF, and PNF; and migratory birds protected under the Migratory Birds Treaty Act as a result of implementing the proposed action alternative. While the BA&E does not specifically include the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, potential impacts for bald and golden eagles are described in both the BA&E and in this analysis. The BA&E did not analyze effects to plants and wildlife as a result of the no action alternative because no change would occur to federal parcels. A summary of the BA&E results are presented below. Because of the preparation date of the BA&E, the MIS considered were those identified in the 1987 ASNFs LMP. Because the ASNFs has since updated its LMP, this DEIS focuses its analysis on the MIS identified in the 2015 LMP. Furthermore, the BA&E did not include recently listed species, e.g. the Mexican gray wolf, the northern Mexican gartersnake, and the narrow-headed gartersnake. These species are included in this DEIS and the BA&E is likewise being revised to reflect the newly-listed species. A summary of the Determination of Effects for Federally-listed and Proposed Species can be found in Appendix B. Federal Land The vegetation of the federal parcel is primarily ponderosa pine with a small Gambel oak component and two man-made ponds. There is no naturally occurring riparian habitat on this parcel; however, an irrigation ditch and the ponds do support some riparian plant and animal species. The ponds have water year round but the irrigation ditch that feeds them is frequently dry. Willows and sedges grow along the irrigation ditch and ponds. The ponds have cattails, and are populated with bullfrogs, bass, and sunfish. A total of four federally listed threatened, endangered, proposed, or candidate species were identified as having potential habitat within the federal lands: the federally threatened Mexican spotted owl, Chiricahua leopard frog, narrow-headed gartersnake, and northern Mexican gartersnake. None of the listed threatened species have designated critical habitat within the federal parcel. Designated habitat was proposed for the gartersnakes on 10 July 2013. The ASNFs LMP (2015) lists MIS for ponderosa forest habitats. In addition, the regional forester has designated some species as sensitive (S). Table 3-21 presents the species that have the potential to be found within the federal parcel, their status (federally listed, state listed, USFS sensitive and/or MIS), and their key habitat elements. Table 3-21.

Owls nest and roost primarily in closed-canopy forests or rocky canyons. Forests used for roosting and nesting often contain mature or old growth stands with complex structure. The federal parcel is relatively flat with little continuous shade canopy, and thus is only marginal for use by foraging owls. No Mexican spotted owls were detected during surveys conducted in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005. Chiricahua Leopard Frog The Chiricahua leopard frog occurs chiefly in the oak, mixed oak, and pine woodlands, and was last recorded on Lakeside RD in 1974. This frog is highly aquatic, and is almost always associated with permanent water, preferably with emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation. Chiricahua leopard frogs prefer rocky streams with deep rock bound pools; it inhabits montane springs, streams, and tanks. Historically, it was found in numerous valley wetlands and cienegas. Fifty percent of the populations documented in Arizona were associated with natural lotic systems. The others were associated with stock tanks (39 percent) and natural or artificial lakes (11 percent). No individuals were found during 2003 or 2009 surveys within federal parcel. The presence of predatory species including bull frogs and predatory fishes in the ponds would likely prevent the Chiricahua leopard frog from being established in the federal parcel. Narrow-headed Gartersnake The narrow-headed gartersnake occurs primarily in pinyon-juniper and pine-oak woodlands, and can be found in ponderosa pine forest. The snake favors permanently flowing streams, especially those associated with shrub-sized and saplings of Arizona alder, velvet ash, willows and canyon grape. The snake is highly aquatic, and forages under water for native fishes. As of July 2014, the snake has been listed by the USFWS under the ESA under the “threatened” designation. While the manmade aquatic habitats present on the federal parcel could provide potential, albeit poor, habitat for the narrow-headed gartersnake, it is unlikely that the gartersnake would become established on the federal parcel. Establishment would be prevented by the absence of densely vegetated riparian habitat and the presence of predatory species including bull frogs and predatory fishes competing with and shrinking the gartersnake’s prey base. Northern Mexican Gartersnake The northern Mexican gartersnake uses a combination of three ecosystems: source area ponds (potentially including stock ponds) and cienegas, lowland river riparian forests and woodlands, and upland stream gallery forests. The snake is most abundant in densely vegetative habitat. The snake is somewhat aquatic, and forages under water for native fishes and native frogs. Their diet is also supplemented with earthworm and vertebrates such as small rodents, lizards, salamanders, tree frogs, and juvenile and tadpole nonnative bullfrogs. As of July 2014, the snake has been listed by the USFWS under the ESA under the “threatened” designation. While the manmade aquatic habitats present on the federal parcel could provide potential, albeit poor, habitat for the northern Mexican gartersnake, it is unlikely that the gartersnake would become established on the federal parcel. Establishment would be prevented by the absence of densely vegetated riparian habitat and the presence of predatory species including bull frogs and predatory fishes competing with and shrinking the gartersnake’s prey base. Mexican Gray Wolf This species was reintroduced to the ASNFs in 1998 as nonessential experimental under Section 10(j) of the ESA (50 CFR 17. 84(k)). The USFWS issued a final rule on 16 January 2015 listing the Mexican wolf as an endangered subspecies under the ESA. The Mexican wolf had previously been protected under the listing for the gray wolf (Canis lupus). The analysis area is not within the primary or secondary recovery zones for this species. The primary recovery zone is the Blue Range Primitive Area which occupies a large portion of the Clifton RD. The secondary recovery zone includes the remainder of the ASNFs and the entire Gila NF (USFWS 2015). Wolf groups (or packs) usually consist of a set of parents (alpha pair), their offspring, and other non-breeding adults. Wolves begin mating when they are two to three years old, sometimes establishing lifelong mates. Wolves usually rear their pups in dens for the first six weeks. Dens are often used year after year, but wolves may also dig new dens or use some other type of shelter such as a cave. An average of five pups is born in early spring and is cared for by the entire pack. They depend on their mother's milk for the first month, then are gradually weaned and fed regurgitated meat brought to them by other pack members. By 7-8 months of age when they are almost fully grown, pups begin traveling with the adults. Often, after 1 or 2 years a young wolf leaves and tries to find a mate and form its own pack. Lone dispersing wolves have traveled as far as 500 miles in search of a new home. Wolf packs usually live within a specific territory. Territories range in size from 50 square miles to greater than 1,000 square miles, depending on how much prey is available and their seasonal movements. Packs use a traditional area and defend it from strange other wolves. Their ability to travel over large areas to seek out vulnerable prey makes wolves good hunters. Wolves may travel as far as 30 miles in a day. In March 1998, the USFWS released three Mexican gray wolf packs into the designated Blue Range Wolf Recovery Area. This area encompasses 6,854 square miles of the ASNFs in southeastern Arizona and the Gila NF in southwestern New Mexico. Human caused mortalities continue to be the primary cause of death for released Mexican wolves. As of the end of December, 2009, Mexican gray wolf reintroduction project personnel know of 27 radio-collared wolves. As of the end of December 2011, the wild population in Arizona and New Mexico was at a minimum population of 58 known wolves with 32 in Arizona consisting of six packs. This species has been documented via telemetry studies in the region of the federal parcel, as close as the Town of McNary on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation and areas on the fringes of Show Low, Pinetop-Lakeside, and Vernon. Arizona State Wildlife Species of Concern All five of the federally listed species described above are also Arizona State Wildlife Species of Concern. American Peregrine Falcon The American peregrine falcon occurs around steep, sheer cliffs overlooking woodlands, riparian areas or other habitats supporting avian prey species in abundance. The falcons may also be found in less optimal habitat, including small, broken cliffs in ponderosa pine forest or large, sheer cliffs in very dry areas. American peregrine falcons favor birds as their primary prey, and may feed on bats secondarily. The federal parcel is relatively flat, and does not provide the cliffs or open expanses favored by the falcons. There is no suitable nesting habitat within the federal parcel but it is likely used as foraging habitat. Bald Eagle Bald eagles favor areas with high water-to-land edge, and areas with unimpeded views including both horizontal and vertical aspects. Areas selected for as wintering habitat will have an adequate food supply, and have open water such as river rapids, impoundments, dam spillways, lakes, and estuaries. Potential roosting and perching habitat are present in federal parcel. The two ponds within the parcel could be used as foraging habitat for bald eagles; however, these ponds are so small that it is unlikely that they could provide sufficient space and forage to be important to wintering bald eagles. Bald eagles have been observed overwintering along Woodland Lake. Northern Goshawk The northern goshawk is a forest generalist foraging in most forest types. It typically nests in stands of large ponderosa pine or mixed conifers. The federal parcel contains both potential foraging and nesting habitats. This parcel was surveyed for goshawks in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2009, and 2010. A single goshawk responded to the surveyor in 2003. No nest was found; it is likely the goshawk was foraging in the area but was likely nesting outside of the parcel. The presence of Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace on this parcel likely cause sufficient noise disturbance during the goshawk breeding season to preclude nesting adjacent to the existing structures even though some of the largest trees on the parcel are located close to and within these camps. Additional noise disturbance could be contributed to the presence of SR 260 on the northeast side of the parcel and the residential and commercial development on the north, south and east sides of the parcel. Osprey The osprey is known to breed within the White Mountains and along the Mogollon Rim. Ospreys nest in coniferous trees, alongside or near rivers and lakes. Ospreys favor open canopies with clear nest access when landing. Ospreys feed primarily on fish, and will supplement their diet with snakes, frogs, and small birds and waterfowl. Ospreys have been observed feeding and nesting along Woodland Lake. The federal parcel lacks a similar water body, and is less likely to provide suitable habitat for nesting or foraging ospreys. Northern Leopard Frog Northern leopard frogs may be found in a variety of habitats including grassland, brush land, woodland, and forest. The frogs are usually in permanent waters with rooted aquatic vegetation, but are also found in ponds, canals, marshes, springs, and streams. Northern leopard frogs primarily feed on small invertebrates, and may forage far from water. The presence of predatory species including bull frogs and predatory fishes in the ponds on the federal parcel would likely prevent the northern leopard frog from being established in the federal parcel. Forest Service Sensitive and Indicator Species The previously discussed American peregrine falcon, bald eagle, Mexican spotted owl, northern goshawk, narrow-headed gartersnake, and northern leopard frog are all considered sensitive species by the USFS. In addition, the Mexican spotted owl and northern goshawk are MIS for ponderosa pine forests on the ASNFs. Allen’s Lappet-browed Bat Allen’s lappet-browed bat has been found primarily in ponderosa pine, pinyon-juniper, Mexican woodland and riparian areas of sycamores, cottonwoods and willows. The bats are often found near boulder piles, cliffs, rocky outcrops or lava flow, and have been captured along streams or over ponds where the bats may be seeking insects, water or both. The bats generally roost in caves and abandoned mineshafts, but may use snags as well. The bats primarily feed on soft-bodies insects. The federal parcel provides suitable foraging habitat, but few large snags on the parcel and no known caves or rock crevices that could provide suitable roosting habitat. Long-tailed Vole The long-tailed vole is found in alpine meadows and grassy habitats within coniferous forests and near riparian habitats. The voles feed on green plants in summer and roots and bark in winter, when they burrow under the snow. They are prey to owls and mustelids (i.e., weasels, ferrets, and similar species). Potential pockets of vole habitat occurs within the federal parcel. Merriam’s Shrew Merriam’s shrew is found in dry habitats with short-grass prairies and sagebrush. The shrew spends a significant amount of time foraging for food, and often use the runways of various species of voles for foraging. Merriam’s shrews primarily feed on insects, earthworms, spiders, and sometimes small vertebrates. They are prey to owls. Potential pockets of shrew habitat occurs within the federal parcel. Arizona Sneezeweed Arizona sneezeweed is an annual or biennial flowering forb found in regions of ponderosa pine forests, especially around wet places such as bogs, ponds, lakes, and roadside ditches. Arizona sneezeweed habitat is common throughout the ASNFs. Potential habitat for this species occurs on the federal parcel around the two ponds, on roadsides and in low lying areas where water puddles after rainstorms. Arizona Sunflower The Arizona sunflower is a flowering herbaceous perennial, found in open pine and juniper woodlands. It has been found within five miles of Show Low, but has not been documented in Arizona since 1984. The federal parcel includes suitable habitat for the Arizona sunflower, and it could potentially occur there. Non-federal Land Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests The Carlisle parcel is a combination of semi-arid grassland and pinyon-juniper woodland. The parcel is relatively flat. The Carlisle parcel has potential habitat for Chiricahua leopard frog within a small pond. The Carlisle parcel also has potential habitat for the Mexican gray wolf. The wolves are habitat generalists and can be found in deserts, grasslands, shrublands/chaparral, and various types of woodlands. The wolves succeed where human population density and persecution level are low and prey densities (primarily elk or other ungulates) are high. Coronado National Forest The Happy Valley 40, East, and West parcels are part of the Happy Valley Riparian Area, a large riparian corridor along Page Creek. The corridor is considered to be an exceptional habitat for neo-tropical migrant birds. The Happy Valley parcels also include a combination of oak and mesquite woodlands, shrublands, and grasslands. The parcels have assemblages of diverse mesquite and acacia types, creosote brush, and succulents. The riparian corridors include mesquite species, mulefat, arrow-weed, and willow species. Page Creek and Turkey Creek could provide potential habitat for the northern Mexican gartersnake. The Happy Valley 40 parcel is within designated Mexican spotted owl critical habitat; the Happy Valley East and West parcels, while not within critical habitat, may provide foraging habitat. The Happy Valley parcels also include potential habitat for the northern aplomado falcon (Falco femoralis septentrionalis), a federally endangered falcon. The falcon is considered a “non-essential experimental population” within Arizona, a status which provides protection similar to that of a listed threatened species. Northern aplomado falcons use varying habitats, including oak savannahs, various desert grassland associations, and open pine woodlands. The falcons require open terrain with scattered trees, relatively low ground cover, an abundance of insects and small to medium-sized birds (for prey), and a supply of nest sites. The falcon has not been observed in Arizona for over 40 years. The Happy Valley Riparian Area offers potential habitat for the southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii), a federally endangered bird that breeds in the southwestern United States. The flycatcher favors dense riparian habitats (cottonwood/willow and tamarisk vegetation) with saturated soils, standing water, or nearby streams, pools, or cienegas. The three Happy Valley parcels may also provide habitat for the Sprague's pipit (Anthus spragueii), a bird species identified as a candidate for federal listing. Habitat within these parcels is likely to be marginal at best, for while the birds do use grasslands and wetlands similar to those interspersed throughout these parcels, they generally prefer large expanses of these habitats, rather than the small clumps of habitat present here. However, the habitat is better quality for the federally threatened yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus). The cuckoos prefer open woodlands and riparian woodlands, and typically nest in tall cottonwood and willow riparian woodland. The Harshaw Creek parcel includes three-eighths of a mile of the intermittent Harshaw Creek, which supports a healthy riparian community. The Harshaw Creek parcel also includes a combination of oak and mesquite woodlands, shrublands, and grasslands. The parcel has assemblages of diverse mesquite and acacia types, creosote brush, and succulents. The Harshaw Creek parcel also includes an isolated area of bedrock outcropping, typified by cliffs and canyons, with unstable scree slopes. Species associated with the outcropping areas include elephant-tree, ocotillo, Bigelow's bear-grass, teddy-bear cholla, and other desert species and succulents. The Mansfield parcel includes a perennial spring that drains into Mansfield Canyon Creek. The creek supports riparian and wetland habitats within and beyond the Mansfield parcel. The Mansfield parcel includes pinyon-juniper woodlands, pine-oak forests and woodlands, diverse grasslands. The riparian corridor includes willow species and large cottonwoods. The Ronstadt Highway and Ronstadt Tank parcels are primarily a combination of desert grassland and chaparral, with a sizeable pinyon-juniper woodland component. The Rucker parcels include Rucker Canyon Creek, an intermittent stream with perennial pools and a robust riparian community. The parcels are primarily a combination of pinyon-juniper and oak woodlands. The Rucker West parcel includes bedrock outcroppings, as well as smaller areas of chaparral and grasslands. The Rucker East parcel has more riparian habitat, and is almost entirely pinyon-juniper and pine-oak woodlands. The parcels also include portions of federally designated critical habitat for the Mexican spotted owl, as well as a post-fledgling area for northern goshawks. The Stronghold Parcels are entirely pinyon-juniper woodland. Prescott National Forest The Babcock parcel is an interspersed mix of chaparral and pine-oak woodlands and forests. Tonto National Forest The Pleasant Valley parcel is primarily savannah grasslands, with two isolated patches of pinyon-juniper woodlands, and a corridor of riparian woodland surround Walnut Creek Canyon. The Red Rover parcel is an interspersed mix of chaparral and pinyon-juniper woodlands. The parcel also has an isolated patch of pine-oak woodlands. The Tonto Creek parcels run in and along Tonto Creek. This creek supports habitat for several threatened, endangered, and sensitive species, as well as substantial wetland habitat. The Tonto Creek parcels are primarily Sonoran Desert scrub, typified by cactus (including saguaro and barrel cactus) and paloverde and creosotebrush scrub. There are few grasses or herbs. While the majority of the cover of Tonto Creek 1 is Sonoran Desert scrub, there are also several pockets of mesquite-dominated scrub, riparian woodlands, and desert wash assemblages. The riparian woodland features box-elder, cottonwood, and various willow species. The desert wash has sparse vegetation, primarily acacia, mesquite, and desert willow species. Tonto Creek 1 also has a large riparian area that is dominated by introduced species (primarily salt cedar). Tonto Creek 2 has large continuous areas of riparian woodlands, but also has a small pocket of invasive riparian species. Tonto Creek 3 also has high quality continuous native riparian woodlands, but also has the largest assemblages of non-native riparian species. Tonto Creek is home to the northern Mexican gartersnake, but invasive bull frogs have been observed to be adversely impacting the population. Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Under the proposed action alternative, the federal parcel would be conveyed to private ownership and non-federal parcels conveyed to Forest Service ownership. Federal Parcel Table 3-22 summarizes the potential impact to species potentially found on the federal parcel under the proposed action. These summaries are derived from the approved BA&E for this project. Table 3-22. Potential Impacts to Sensitive Species with the Potential to Occur on the Federal Parcel Species  Potential Impact  Rationale  Birds  American Peregrine Falcon  Minimal effect  There is no suitable nesting habitat within the federal parcel but it is likely used as foraging habitat. The proposed action would not affect the suitability of this parcel as foraging habitat.  Bald Eagle  Minimal effect  Implementation of the proposed action would reduce ASNFs habitat by over 344 acres of wintering habitat. However, the habitat and foraging quality is poor, and there is substantial higher quality habitat in the vicinity.  Mexican Spotted Owl  No effect  No Mexican spotted owls were observed in any surveys. The federal parcel is poor habitat for the owls, making it unlikely that one would attempt to establish in the parcel.  Northern Goshawk  Potential effect  Surveys indicated that a goshawk may use the parcel for foraging purposes. However, because of frequent human activity, as well as noise from SR 260, the parcel is currently poor foraging or nesting habitat for goshawks.  Osprey  No effect  The habitat and foraging quality is poor, and there is substantial higher quality habitat in the vicinity.  Species  Potential Impact  Rationale  Reptiles  Narrow-headed Gartersnake  No effect  The proposed action is not expected to alter the habitats around the two ponds and would not impact the narrow-headed gartersnake if any are found on the parcel. Their presence is unlikely, as the ponds are stocked with non-native predatory species that prey on gartersnakes and gartersnake prey base, preventing them from being established.  Northern Mexican Gartersnake  No effect  The proposed action is not expected to alter the habitats around the two ponds and would not impact the northern Mexican gartersnake if any are found on the parcel. Their presence is unlikely, as the ponds are stocked with non-native predatory species that prey on gartersnakes and gartersnake prey base, preventing them from being established.  Amphibians  Chiricahua Leopard Frog  No effect  The Chiricahua leopard frog is unlikely to occur on the federal parcel, as it was absent in all surveys. The perennial water sources on the federal parcels are stocked with non-native predatory species that prey on leopard frogs, preventing them from being established. The Chiricahua leopard frog is also not found within dispersal distance of the federal parcel, making it even less likely that the leopard frog would be established on the federal parcel.  Northern Leopard Frog  No effect  The perennial water sources on the federal parcels are stocked with non-native predatory species that prey on leopard frogs, preventing them from being established.  Species  Potential Impact  Rationale  Southwestern Toad  No effect  The flowing water on the federal parcel is intermittent, and is of marginal use for the southwestern toad. The perennial pond-water sources on the federal parcels are stocked with non-native predatory species that prey on toads, preventing them succeeding on the parcel.  Mammals  Allen’s Lappet-browed Bat  Potential effect  There are few large snags on the parcel and no known caves or rock crevices that could provide suitable roosting habitat. The proposed action would reduce ASNFs habitat by 344 acres of potential foraging habitat.  Long-tailed vole  Minimal/ No effect  Exchange of this parcel would result in a reduction of potential habitat. However, given the isolated nature of the habitat on this parcel, it is unlikely that any voles on this parcel are important to the survival of the overall population of voles on the ASNFs.  Merriam’s Shrew  Minimal/ No effect  Exchange of this parcel would result in a reduction of potential habitat. However, given the isolated nature of the habitat on this parcel, it is unlikely that any shrews on this parcel are important to the survival of the overall population of shrews on the ASNFs.  Mexican Gray Wolf  Minimal/no effect  The proposed action would remove some potential habitat for the Mexican gray wolf, but given its wider potential range it is not likely to have a measurable effect on the Mexican gray wolf populations within the ASNFs.  Plants  Arizona Sneezeweed  Minimal effect  Implementation of the proposed action would not alter potential habitat around the ponds but could alter habitat elsewhere on the parcel. The proposed action would not result in a measurable change in this species population on the ASNFs.  Species  Potential Impact  Rationale  Arizona Sunflower  No effect  The proposed action would remove some potential habitat for the Arizona sunflower but given its wider potential range it is not likely to have a measurable effect on the Arizona sunflower populations within the ASNFs.  Non-federal Parcels The proposed action would bring the non-federal parcels into federal ownership, and allow for more continuous habitat management by eliminating these inholdings. The USFS mandate to improve habitat and water quality would result in an overall benefit to biological resources located on these parcels. Several of the parcels also have the potential to benefit listed or sensitive species. The Rucker parcels include areas mapped as Mexican spotted owl critical habitat which would be transferred to federal ownership and would not undergo future development. Thus, the project would have a beneficial effect to Mexican spotted owl critical habitat. These parcels also include a northern goshawk post-fledging area that would also be subject to federal management and protection. Cumulative Effects With only beneficial direct or indirect effects through the gain of potential habitat in the land exchange to any T&E species, no detrimental cumulative effects would occur. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Under the no action alternative, the federal parcel would remain under federal ownership, no development would occur, and plant, fish, and wildlife resources would continue to receive protection. The non-federal parcels, however, would continue to be unprotected, and the management of sensitive, but unlisted species (e.g., the northern goshawk) would be at the discretion of the land owner. Cumulative Effects Projects that include development and noise (i.e., Second Knoll Shooting Range and the Pueblo Park Mineral Materials Pit projects) could affect the habitat used by Mexican gray wolf. Wildfires can reduce or degrade habitat quality. Given the scale of these potential developments relative to the larger scale of existing habitat, no adverse cumulative effects to T&E species would occur. Grazing Affected Environment Lands throughout Arizona are used for the grazing of livestock. A stockman may elect to graze livestock on his own land, via a grazing lease on someone else’s private land, or as a permittee of a federal grazing allotment. Federal Land As of 2011, the ASNFs administered 92 active grazing allotments and 2 designated sheep driveways. Livestock grazing contributes to the livelihood of the permittees and to the economy of local communities and counties. Although the federal parcel could be utilized for grazing (among other uses), as specified in the LMP, grazing does not currently occur on the site and there is no grazing allotment (USFS 2015a). Non-federal Land There are privately-administered grazing leases on 15 of the non-federal parcels (Figure 3-2): • Carlisle Parcel • Happy Valley 40 Parcel • Happy Valley East Parcel • Happy Valley West Parcel • Harshaw Creek Parcel • Mansfield Parcel • Pleasant Valley Parcel • Red Rover Parcel • Ronstadt Highway Parcel • Ronstadt Tank Parcel • Rucker East Parcel • Rucker West Parcel • Tonto Creek 1 Parcel • Tonto Creek 2 Parcel • Tonto Creek 3 Parcel The grazing leases on the non-federal parcels are surrounded by grazing allotments on USFS land that are all active and permitted for cattle. The allotments are managed through separate permits by the individual ranger districts. Grazing does not currently occur on any of the other non-federal parcels (USFS 2014c). Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the proposed action, the federal parcel would be conveyed to private ownership. The federal land is not part of a grazing allotment. The land exchange would not result in any reduction of animal units on an active grazing allotment. No direct or indirect impacts to grazing would occur on federal land from the implementation of the proposed action. Non-federal Land Under the proposed action, the exchange would occur and the existing grazing leases on the non-federal lands would be terminated. The grazing leases on the non-federal parcels belong to the same permitees on adjacent federal land, thus the permittee may be able to continue to graze livestock on the exchanged parcel if the USFS is able to expand the existing allotment. The non-federal lands would be integrated into ongoing USFS management plans for each respective area. The non-federal parcels would be evaluated by the USFS for potential inclusion in any surrounding grazing allotments and permits. However, any decision to authorize future livestock grazing on the affected allotments is not a component of the analysis for an exchange of lands and would be considered in a separate environmental analysis following the exchange. Because the areas surrounding the non-federal parcels would continue to be grazed under the existing allotments, no significant direct or indirect effects to grazing are anticipated from the proposed action. Cumulative Effects The non-federal lands would be integrated into the USFS management plans for each respective area under the proposed action. The federal land would not be part of a grazing allotment. Any future grazing effects to the non-federal lands, if any, would be considered in the environmental analysis for the affected allotments. There are no known actions that, in conjunction with the proposed action, would result in substantial impacts to grazing. No cumulative effects are anticipated. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the no action alternative, the exchange would not occur, and the federal parcels would continue to not be grazed. No direct or indirect impacts to grazing would occur. Non-federal Land Since the non-federal parcels would not be transferred to federal ownership, they would not be considered for inclusion in a Forest Service grazing allotment. Existing grazing leases would not be terminated. No direct or indirect effects to grazing would occur. Cumulative Effects Since no direct or indirect effects would occur, no cumulative effects would occur under this alternative. Prime and Unique Farmlands Affected Environment Federal Land Under the Farmland Protection Policy Act (FPPA) (7 U.S. Code § 4201 [2011]), federal agencies are directed to identify and take into account the adverse effects of federal programs on the preservation of farmland, to consider appropriate alternative actions which could lessen adverse effects, and to assure that such federal programs are, to the extent practicable, compatible with state or local government programs and policies to protect farmland. FPPA guidelines developed by the USDA apply to farmland classified as prime or unique, or of state or local importance. Farmland subject to FPPA does not have to be currently used for cropland. The federal parcel is composed of Amos clay loam, Overgaard gravelly loam, and Overgaard-Elledge complex. None of the soils located on the parcel are considered prime and unique farmland (USDA 2014b). Non-federal Land The Babcock parcel is composed of Barkerville extremely rocky sandy loam and Moano very rocky loam. These soils are not considered prime and unique farmland (USDA 2014b). Happy Valley East parcel is composed of Romero-Nodman rock outcrop complex and Mabray rock outcrop complex. These soils are not considered prime and unique farmland (USDA 2014b). The Harshaw Creek parcel is composed of Grabe-Comoro complex, Fareway rock outcrop complex, and Chihuahua-Lampshire association. The Grabe-Comoro complex is considered prime and unique farmland, if irrigated. However, no area of the Harshaw Creek parcel is currently used for agriculture and the Harshaw Creek parcel is not irrigated. Thus, the Grabe-Comoro complex is not considered prime and unique farmland. The remaining Harshaw Creek parcel soils are not considered prime and unique farmland (USDA 2014b). The Mansfield parcel is composed of Lampshire-Graham rock outcrop association, Barkerville-Gaddes and association. Neither of these soils are considered prime and unique farmland (USDA 2014b). The remaining non-federal parcels do not have available soil data. Given the lack of prime and unique farmland soils in the geographic area, it is highly unlikely that prime and unique farmland occurs on the Carlisle Parcel, Pleasant Valley Parcel, Red Rover Parcel, Stronghold Parcel, Stronghold Well Site Parcel, Tonto Creek 1 Parcel, Tonto Creek 2 Parcel, and the Tonto Creek 3 Parcel (USDA 2014b). The Rondstadt Highway Parcel, Ronstadt Tank Parcel, Rucker East Parcel, and Rucker West Parcel all have prime and unique farmland (if irrigated) within 5 miles. No area of these parcels is currently irrigated (USDA 2014b). Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the proposed action alternative, the federal parcel would be conveyed to private ownership. There are no areas within the federal parcel that are designated as prime and unique farmlands. There would be no direct or indirect effects to prime and unique farmlands. Non-federal Land There are no areas within the nine non-federal parcels that are designated as prime and unique farmlands. There would be no direct or indirect effects to prime and unique farmlands. Cumulative Effects With no direct or indirect effects to prime and unique farmlands, no cumulative effects would occur. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the no action alternative, the exchange would not occur, and the federal parcel would continue to be managed under the current forest plans. No direct or indirect effects to prime and unique farmlands would occur. Non-federal Land Since the non-federal parcels would not be transferred to federal ownership, they would not be considered for inclusion in the NFS. Current uses would likely continue to occur. No direct or indirect effects to prime and unique farmlands would occur. Cumulative Effects With no direct or indirect effects to prime and unique farmlands, no cumulative effects would occur. Wetlands and Floodplains Affected Environment Water resources reports were prepared for the federal and non-federal land that are part of land exchange. Information from these reports is summarized below. Federal Land There are 0 acres of wetlands and 0 acres of floodplain located on the federal parcel. Non-federal Land As summarized in Table 3-23, there are approximately 98 acres of wetlands and 527.76 acres of floodplain located on the non-federal lands (USFS 2014b). Table 3-23. Summary of Wetlands and Floodplains on Non-federal Lands to be Exchanged Parcel Name  Wetlands (acres)  Floodplain (acres)  Carlisle  0  0  Happy Valley East  2  4  Happy Valley West  14  22  Happy Valley 40  8  12  Harshaw Creek  26  26  Mansfield  2  3  Ronstadt Highway  <1  1  Ronstadt Tank  2  3  Rucker  42  93  Stronghold  <1  <1  Babcock  0  0  Red Rover  0  0.76  Tonto Creek 1, 2, and 3  0  360  Pleasant Valley  0  3  Total Acreage  98  527.76  Source: USFS 2014b. The Ronstadt Tank parcel contains an important livestock and wildlife watering tank that is divided into three sections; a main pool, a secondary pool, and a sediment trap. The total surface area inundated by the stock tank is approximately 2.9 acres and can contain up to approximately 27 acre-feet of water (USFS 2011). The earthen stock tank and overflow spillway appear to be in good condition with no erosion or sinkholes (USFS 2011). Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Under the proposed action, the USFS would receive a net gain of approximately 98 acres of wetlands and 527.76 acres of floodplain through exchange of 18 non-federal parcels for the federal parcel. The resources present on these non-federal parcels would receive greater protection under federal jurisdiction and management. This would complement the USFS’s ongoing efforts to protect and increase riparian habitat. The proposal complies with USFS policy (Forest Service Manual [FSM] 2527.3) and is consistent with the intent of Executive Order (EO) 11988, Floodplain Management and EO 11990, Protection of Wetlands. Federal Land Under the proposed action, the exchange would occur and the federal parcel would be conveyed to private ownership. This parcel contains 0 acres of wetlands and 0 acres of floodplain. Therefore, the USFS would not lose any wetlands or floodplains due to the proposed land exchange. Non-federal Land Under the proposed action, the exchange would occur and the 18 non-federal parcels would be conveyed to federal ownership. Approximately 98 acres of wetlands and 527.76 acres of floodplain would be conveyed to the USFS. These wetlands and floodplains and any associated riparian habitat would then be managed by the USFS and be provided the additional protection of federal ownership. The livestock and wildlife watering tank at the Ronstadt Tank parcel would continue to provide a source of water to livestock and wildlife and would also benefit from management by the USFS. If acquired in the land exchange, the tank would be classified as a “Class D Dam” (FSM 7511.1) and would have a hazard classification of LOW (FSM 7511.2(1)). Cumulative Effects Cumulative effects with regards to wetlands and floodplains are discussed in a general qualitative manner due to the scale of the analysis area. A number of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact wetlands and floodplains: • The proposed Second Knoll Target Range and associated access roads in the Lakeside RD of the ASNFs. • The Woodland Lake Park Tract Townsite Act Purchase project, which would result in a net loss of 543 acres of land administered by the ASNFs but there is no expected change to existing wetlands and floodplains in the parcels to be sold; • The sale of National Forest lands at the Lakeside Ranger Station under the Forest Service Facility Realignment & Enhancement Act, which would result in no expected change to existing wetlands or floodplains. • Timber Mesa – Vernon Wildland-Urban Interface Project. • The Pueblo Park Mineral Materials Pit in the Alpine RD of ASNFs. • The Show Low South Land Exchange on the Apache-Sitgreaves, Coconino, and Prescott national forests, which would result in USFS receiving a net gain of approximately 110.5 acres of wetlands and between 163 and 166 acres of floodplains. • The Upper Rocky Arroyo Restoration in the Lakeside RD of the ASNFs. • The Show Low South Fire Risk and Fuels Reduction in the Lakeside RD of the ASNFs. • Wildfires. • Timber harvesting. • Residential development as addressed in the City of Show Low General Plan. While these projects could potentially affect wetlands and floodplains, these projects on NFS lands are managed to mitigate impacts to wetlands. Under the proposed action alternative, a net gain in approximately 98 acres of wetlands and 527.76 acres of floodplain would occur. Other cumulative projects would result in either a net gain (approximately 110.5 acres of wetlands and between 163 and 166 acres of floodplain under the Show Low South Land Exchange) or no change in acreage of existing wetlands and floodplains. Future development on the federal parcel would not affect wetlands or floodplains on adjacent NFS lands. Future development at Camp Tatiyee would be subject to all applicable federal, state of Arizona, and local rules and regulations. Wetlands and floodplains transferred to federal ownership would be subject to more stringent management objectives than those in private ownership. Federal acquisition of additional lands containing these resources would contribute towards reversing the long-term trend of declining riparian habitat in the southwest. With more stringent management objectives under federal ownership, beneficial cumulative impacts are anticipated. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Under the no action alternative, there would no change to the wetland or floodplain acreage under current federal management. Federal Land Under the no action alternative, the exchange would not occur, and the federal parcels would continue to be managed under the current respective forest plans. No direct or indirect effects to wetlands or floodplains would occur. Non-federal Land Under the no action alternative, the non-federal parcels would not be transferred to federal ownership, and they would not be considered for inclusion in the NFS. These lands could be developed, which could negatively affect wetlands and floodplains and potentially remove any associated riparian habitat. Cumulative Effects There are no known actions that, in conjunction with the no action alternative, would result in substantial impacts to wetlands or floodplains. Water Quality, Rights, and Claims Affected Environment Federal Land Under the proposed action, the federal lands would be conveyed together with any and all associated and appurtenant water rights. The federal parcel does not have any water rights identified for conveyance. Water quality in the Show Low Creek watershed, which includes areas of the federal parcel, is monitored by the Arizona Department of Water Quality and the City of Show Low and managed through the Show Low Creek Watershed Enhancement Partnership (2007). Water in the watershed is primarily used for municipal, recreational, and some agricultural and industrial purposes and is supplied mostly by snowmelt and Pinetop, Thompson, and Scott Springs. Non-federal Land No existing water rights have been identified on the Happy Valley 40, Happy Valley East, Happy Valley West, Babcock, Red Rover, Tonto Creek, or Pleasant Valley parcels. A Water Resources Evaluation was completed as part of the Feasibility Analysis (USFS 2014b) and details the existing water rights on the remaining parcels. The findings of that evaluation are summarized here. The Carlisle parcel includes one claim (Certificate Record No. 38-83314) for 2 acre-feet per year stock pond for use as stockwater. The Stronghold parcel has no surface water rights, however it does have a divided interest well. The Stronghold parcel, as defined in this analysis includes an undivided 2/20th interest in and to the well site; Well Registration No. 55-610090. There is no known agreement between any of the interest holders regarding how this well is maintained or managed. The Ronstadt Tank parcel includes both a surface claim and a registered well. The surface claim (Certificate of Water Right No. 33-089677) authorizes use of the waters of Bar X Canyon for the purpose of stock watering. This is used primarily in conjunction with the use of a grazing permit on the adjacent federal lands (Forest Grazing Permit 50462, 0 Bar 0 Allotment). The well site (Well Registration No. 55601473) is similarly used for stock watering. The Ronstadt Highway parcel includes two distinct surface water claims for the purpose of stock watering. Statement of Claim of Right to Use Public Waters of the State No. 36-102332 includes 0.5 acre-feet per year within section 3, and 0.2 acre-feet per year within section 4, Township 10 South, Range 24 East. Certificate of Water Right No. 33-89575 includes the waters of a unnamed wash, a tributary of Pitchfork Canyon for the purpose of stock watering, and for a volume up to 768,000 gallons per year and storage up to 2 acre-feet. The Mansfield parcel includes one surface claim to be used for stockwater and mining. The claim is registered as Assignment (Conveyance) of Statement of Claim No. 36-48816 and is for up to 16 acre-feet per year. The Harshaw Creek parcel includes one surface claim to be used for stock watering. The claim is for the Santa Cruz River, Harshaw Creek, (Registry No. 36-102368.2), and is for 2 acre-feet per year. Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Drought conditions from 1996 to 2005, coupled with increasing residential growth, spurred shortages in water supplies in the Show Low and Pinetop-Lakeside area and drew concern for water quality issues. In 1988, Arizona Department of Environmental Quality placed Rainbow Lake on Arizona’s 303(d) list of impaired waters due to excessive weeds, pH, and nutrient overloading. This is due primarily from agricultural and residential pollutants that infiltrate tributaries such as Show Low Creek and causes some concern for any proposed uses that could occur if the federal parcel is turned over to town zoning, which would split the land into two distinct zones; A-general and Industrial (Navajo County Public Works 2011). The concern is that the increase in demand for land and water use in the Show Low and Pinetop-Lakeside area could further the issues facing the watershed by introducing more residential and industrial uses to areas once protected by the USFS. Under the proposed action, the federal parcel would be conveyed to private ownership. While the parcel is within the Show Low Creek watershed, there are no naturally occurring intermediate or perennial waters located on the parcel. With no water rights or claims conveyed on the federal parcel, no direct or indirect effects to water quality, rights, or claims would occur. Non-federal Land Under the proposed action, the non-federal parcels and associated and/or agreed upon water rights/claims (a total of 720 acre-feet in annual volume) would be conveyed to federal ownership. Under the protection of the NFS, the parcels would not be developed and no adverse effects to water quality would occur. Cumulative Effects There are no known actions that, in conjunction with the proposed action alternative, would result in measurable cumulative impacts to water quality, rights, or claims. Any future land exchanges, including the planned Show Low South Exchange, would involve a similar trade of lands and any associated water rights and claims. However, as with the proposed action alternative, land exchanges often involve a net gain of water rights and claims. In general, projects on national forests are designed to minimize effects to water quality. No cumulative impacts are anticipated. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the no action alternative, the exchange would not occur, and the federal parcel would continue to be managed by the Forest Service. No direct or indirect effects to water quality, rights, or claims would occur. Non-federal Land Under the no action alternative, the non-federal parcels would not be transferred to federal ownership and could be subject to development. While development could affect water quality, plans would likely include mitigation measures to avoid major impacts to water quality. No adverse direct or indirect impacts to water quality, rights, or claims would likely occur. Cumulative Effects There are no known actions that, in conjunction with the no action alternative, would result in cumulative impacts to water quality, rights, or claims. Cultural Resources Affected Environment Federal Land A cultural resources intensive pedestrian survey (Leonard 2006) was conducted for the entire federal parcel of federal land proposed for exchange out of federal ownership. This survey resulted in the identification of 12 archaeological sites and 38 isolated occurrences. Five additional isolates were found in 2006 during unrelated surveys on the parcel. Three of the archaeological sites and all of the isolated occurrences are not considered eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) (Leonard 2006). The remaining eligible archaeological sites within the federal parcel include: AR 03-01-07-1378/AZ P:16:231 (ASM) -Lithic and ceramic scatters AR-03-01-07-1379/AZ P:16:232 (ASM) -Mogollon habitation site AR 03-01-07-1380/AZ P:16:233 (ASM) -Bedrock milling area AR-03-01-07-1381/AZ P:16:234 (ASM) -Lithic and ceramic scatter AR 03-01-07-1382/AZ P:16:235 (ASM) -Bedrock milling area and lithic scatter AR-03-01-07-1384/AZ P:16:237 (ASM) -Lithic and ceramic scatter AR 03-01-07-1385/AZ P:16:238 (ASM) -Bedrock milling area AR-03-01-07-1386/AZ P:16:239 (ASM) -Bedrock milling area AR-03-01-07-1389/AZ P:16:242 (ASM) – Historic Irrigation Ditch (1909) All prehistoric sites listed above are eligible for listing in the NRHP under criterion D for their potential to yield information important to understanding the prehistory of the area. The historic irrigation ditch (AR-03-01-07-1389/AZ P:16:242 [ASM]) is eligible for listing in the NRHP under criterion A for its importance to the development of local agricultural infrastructure. Non-federal Land AZSite, Arizona’s online cultural resource inventory system, was examined for archaeological surveys and resources within the 18 non-federal parcels. The record search indicated that four of these parcels had been partially surveyed: the Happy Valley East parcel (three surveys); the Ronstadt Highway parcel (one survey); Rucker West parcel (one survey); and the Tonto Creek 1 parcel (one survey). Of the survey efforts that were carried out on portions of these parcels, only the survey on the Rucker West parcel recorded cultural resources within the project area (Horton 1999). The survey in the Rucker West parcel is a small linear corridor running north/northwest to south/southeast through the central portion of the parcel. Three sites were recorded within the parcel, two of them, a multicomponent prehistoric ceramic scatter and historic house foundation and a prehistoric lithic scatter have been determined eligible for the NRHP (Horton 1999). Archaeological surveys have not been conducted on 14 of the non-federal parcels, the Carlisle, Happy Valley 40, Happy Valley West, Harshaw Creek, Mansfield, Ronstadt Tank, Rucker East, Stronghold, Stronghold Well, Babcock, Red Rover, Tonto Creek 2, Tonto Creek 3, and Pleasant Valley parcels. Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, nine Native American tribes and one chapter were notified of the project: Hopi Tribe, Navajo Nation, Pueblo of Zuni, San Carlos Apache Tribe, Tonto Apache Tribe, White Mountain Apache Tribe, Yavapai-Apache Tribe, Yavapai-Prescott Tribe, Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, and the Ramah Chapter of the Navajo Nation. Under the proposed action, nine archeological sites on the federal parcel considered eligible for listing in the NRHP would be adversely affected by the proposed transfer of these properties out of federal control. One eligible archaeological site, AR-03-01-07-1389, is a historic irrigation ditch constructed in 1909. Though this ditch lies on ASNFs-administered property, the ditch was established prior to the creation of the USFS. The Ditch Bill Act of 1986 grants permanent easements for irrigation ditches across federal land. The easement, ownership, operation, and use of the ditch would not be affected by the proposed land exchange, and this site will not be considered further. For the remaining eight archaeological sites eligible for the NRHP that would be adversely affected by the proposed action, a historic properties treatment plan and memorandum of agreement among the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the USFS were developed to resolve and mitigate the direct and indirect adverse effects (USFS 2014d; Appendix B). Mitigation measures in the treatment plan include photographic documentation, mapping the sites, conducting surface artifact collections, and data recovery through excavation. Through mitigation, adverse effects to these sites would be resolved. Non-federal Land Transfer of the non-federal lands to federal ownership would have a beneficial effect on any cultural resources present. Any cultural resource sites found on the non-federal lands would come under federal management and would receive the full protection of federal laws. No negative direct or indirect effects to cultural resources would occur as a result of the proposed action. Cumulative Effects Federal Land Policies set forth in the ASNFs LMP are designed to avoid and mitigate adverse effects to cultural resources. Because of these policies, all future projects in progress or proposed for the ASNFs, which are considered as cumulative events, include appropriate avoidance and mitigation practices for cultural resources. Several planned or reasonably foreseeable activities within the Lakeside RD of the ASNFs have the potential to adversely affect cultural resources. Three actions on the ASNFs; the Timber Mesa-Vernon Wildland Urban Interface Fuels Reduction & Forest Restoration Project, Show Low South Fire Risk and Fuels Reduction Project, and Upper Rocky Arroyo Restoration Project involve work with vegetation for fuels reduction and/or habitat restoration. Each of these projects requires that all known cultural resources be avoided or treated to reduce the potential for negative fire impacts by use of Appendix J of the Region 3 Programmatic Agreement. The cumulative effects of these projects would be a net beneficial effect for cultural resources through protection from catastrophic wildfire. Three additional planned or reasonably foreseeable actions; the Woodland Lake Park Townsite Act Purchase, Lakeside Ranger Station Conveyance, and the Show Low South Land Exchange are expected to transfer six archaeological sites eligible for the NRHP and one unevaluated archaeological site out of federal ownership, and adversely affect one eligible site through construction. Any adverse effects anticipated through these projects would be mitigated through data recovery in consultation with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, Arizona SHPO, and culturally affiliated Tribes. Data recovery as a mitigation strategy would lead to a cumulative loss of historic properties. All of the potentially affected sites represent relatively common site types on the Forests, so no unique sites would be affected. Based on the health of the resource in the Lakeside RD, the net loss of these sites is not considered significant. Non-federal Land The acquisition of additional federal lands through the Show Low South Land Exchange would have a beneficial effect on cultural resources. All cultural resources on non-federal land that do not currently receive protection, would receive federal protection once the land is transferred into federal ownership. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the no action alternative, the federal parcel would not be transferred out of federal ownership and would continue to be administered by the ASNFs. All federal lands within the ASNFs are managed according to the ASNFs forest plan which mandates protection for cultural resources. As a result of this protection, there would be no adverse effect to cultural resources on federal lands as a result of the no action alternative. Non-federal Land Cultural resources on non-federal lands would continue to remain in private ownership and receive no additional protection with the exception of human burials, which are protected under the Burial Protection Law (Arizona Revised Statues [ARS] 41-865 and ARS 410844). If present, direct or indirect adverse effects to cultural resources could occur as a result of development activities. Under the no action alternative, the added benefit of consideration and protection for cultural resources when under federal control would not occur. Cumulative Effects Federal Land Under the no action alternative, the cumulative effects to cultural resources on federal lands would be the same as described in the cumulative effects of the proposed action. The effect of past, present and reasonably foreseeable projects would result in the transfer of cultural resources out of federal ownership and protection. As discussed in the cumulative effects section for the proposed action, the adverse cumulative effects to cultural resources would be mitigated and resolved. Through mitigation and resolution the net effect of these cumulative actions would be adverse but not significant. Non-federal Land Under the no action alternative, the cumulative effects to cultural resources on non-federal lands would be the same as described in the cumulative effects of the proposed action. The effect of past, present and reasonably foreseeable projects would result in the transfer of cultural resources into federal ownership and protection. Through the transfer of non-federal lands into federal ownership, additional resources would receive protection with a net beneficial effect to cultural resources. Mineral Resources Affected Environment A mineral report (dated 7 August 2003) was prepared for the exchange parcels in 2003, and updated in 2008. Conclusions of this report, which was prepared by a certified mineral examiner for Region 3 of the USFS, are presented below. Federal Land There is little to no potential for mineral commodities on the federal parcel; there is a low potential for coal, oil, and gas. The federal parcel is not considered prospectively valuable. Non-federal Land None of the non-federal parcels are considered prospectively valuable. The Happy Valley, Stronghold, Rucker, and Ronstadt parcels are not prospectively valuable for leasable minerals, and have low potential for locatable minerals and salable minerals. Several of the remaining parcels have low to moderate potential for resources: • The Carlisle non-federal parcel has low potential for coal and oil & gas. The parcel has low potential for locatable minerals and salable minerals. • The Mansfield parcel has low to moderate potential for locatable minerals, and low potential for salable minerals. • The Harshaw Creek parcel has low potential for sodium and potassium. • The Babcock parcel has low to moderate potential for locatable minerals, and low potential for salable minerals. • The Red Rover parcel has low to moderate potential for locatable minerals, and low potential for salable minerals. • The Tonto Creek and Pleasant Valley parcels have low potential for locatable minerals. The mineral report was forwarded to the Bureau of Land Management, Albuquerque, New Mexico office, which submitted their concurrence on 2 December 2008. Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Should the land exchange be executed, neither the U.S. nor the private landowner would reserve any mineral right, royalty, or other mineral interest. Federal Land Under the proposed action, the exchange would occur, and most of the federal parcel would be subject to development if the landowner pursues and receives an approved re-zoning and subdivision plan. There would be no direct or indirect effects of development activities on mineral resources. Respective mineral resources would be conveyed along with the surface. Non-federal Land Under the proposed action, the non-federal parcels would be integrated into the NFS and be managed as directed under respective forest plans. There are no plans to further explore the potential for locatable minerals on the Mansfield, Babcock, Red Rover, Tonto Creek, Pleasant Valley, or any of the other non-federal parcels. There are no plans to pursue the potential for oil, gas, or coal on the Carlisle parcel or any of the other non-federal parcels. No effects regarding mineral resources would occur. Respective mineral resources would be conveyed along with the surface. Cumulative Effects With no direct or indirect effects to mineral resources, no cumulative effects would occur. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land No change would occur to current use and management of the federal parcel. No effects regarding mineral resources would occur. Mineral estates would remain the same. Non-federal Land The exchange would not take place and development would likely occur on the existing non-federal parcels. There would be no direct or indirect effects of development activities on mineral resources. Mineral estates would remain the same. Cumulative Effects With no direct or indirect effects to mineral resources, no cumulative effects would occur. Roads Affected Environment Federal Land The federal land is located along the western side of SR 260 between Wagon Wheel Road (to the north) and Vallery Lane (to the south). Each of these three roadways is a non-NFSR that is administered and maintained by state and local agencies. NFSR 300 (Mogollon Rim Drive) passes through the eastern portion of the federal land. This roadway generally follows the southern boundary of the Lakeside RD and is designated by the USFS as being closed to public vehicular traffic on the federal parcel, but open in adjacent sections of the road (USFS 2008). A portion of Mogollon Rim Drive to the north of the federal land is open and paved. Immediately to the south of Wagon Wheel Road, Mogollon Rim Drive is neither paved nor surfaced. The federal land also contains two short east/west roadways. These roadways provide access to Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace via SR 260. These roads are designated as open to all motorized vehicles. This designation includes Maintenance Level 2, which is assigned to roads open for use by high clearance vehicles. Non-federal Land Access to and from many of the non-federal parcels is provided by various NFSRs, and other public and private roadways. Table 3-24 lists NFSRs and other roadways that cross portions of the non-federal parcels. As described in the Feasibility Analysis (USFS 2014b), private landowners have informally permitted public access through their land via various NFSRs. Table 3-24.

Although none of these roadways are expected to be significant for local or regional traffic circulation, within the federal parcel Mogollon Rim Drive provides pedestrian access to large areas of undeveloped land lying along the southern and western boundaries of the Lakeside RD. This road is closed for public use. No non-NFS roads on the federal parcel would be affected by the land exchange. Although the proposed action does not include the ultimate development of the federal land after its transfer to private ownership, a future indirect traffic effect may occur if this land is developed. As discussed in the Land Use section of this chapter, nearby land uses in the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside are designated for residential or commercial development. These types of developments would add new trips to the surrounding street system, particularly during peak commuting periods. This traffic would contribute incrementally to existing traffic volumes and may necessitate traffic control measures to regulate the flow of traffic into and out of the parcel. The future indirect impacts of site development should be addressed by the applicant when a specific development proposal is brought forward to the Planning and Zoning department of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside. Non-federal Land Access to and from non-federal parcels would continue to be provided by the roadways summarized in Table 3-24. After acquisition, possible future transportation improvements within the non-federal land would be in accordance with USFS travel management requirements and procedures, including the managing forest’s LMP and the Travel Management Rule. Where NFSRs have been informally permitted through non-federal parcels, the proposed action would preclude possible future revocation of these informal agreements by the private landowners. As a result, these roadways would continue to be available for public access and administrative resource management under the proposed action. Because all non-federal land would be transferred to federal ownership, the acquired lands would be managed under objectives set forth in the respective forest plans, and private roads would be analyzed for potential inclusion in the USFS transportation system. Cumulative Effects Provided that access to surrounding areas is maintained, the proposed action would have no direct impact on Roads. As a result, the proposed action would not contribute toward any direct cumulative effect on this resource. However, an indirect cumulative impact may occur as the result of potential future development of the federal parcel, as discussed above. The additional traffic associated with this development, taken together with traffic from present and reasonably foreseeable future projects, would increase traffic volumes on SR 260, NFSRs, and other public streets near the federal parcel. In turn, this may cause increased vehicle delays and queues at intersections, and increased congestion along roadway segments. The significance of this indirect cumulative impact should be determined by the applicant at the time a specific development proposal is brought forward to the Planning and Zoning department of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside. Where significant traffic impacts are identified, applicable measures should be implemented to reduce the effect to a less than significant level. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the no action alternative, the land exchange would not occur, and the existing USFS roads would be retained in their current condition and alignment. No direct or indirect impacts to roads would occur. Non-federal Land Existing land use and activities on the non-federal land would continue under the no action alternative. As a result, there would be no direct impact relative to roads. However, a possible indirect effect may arise if private landowners elect to revoke their informal permission for NFSRs to cross their land. In this event, the NFSRs would no longer be available for public access and administrative resource management. As there are no current indications that any of the permissions will be revoked, the indirect impact is less than significant. Cumulative Effects Because the no action alternative would not have any impacts relative to roads, this alternative would not contribute toward any significant cumulative effect relative to this resource. Fire and Fuels Affected Environment Federal Land Existing levels of live and dead fuels on the federal parcel are generally consistent with surrounding forest lands. There is no evidence of recent wildfires on the federal parcel. The parcel underwent fuels treatment in 2005-2006, as authorized in a Decision Memo issued in 2004 (USFS 2004). Treatment was accomplished via mechanical thinning and fuel removal. Thinning of live trees was accomplished to achieve a goal of 60 square feet of basal area per acre. Non-federal Land Fuels on the non-federal parcels are generally consistent with surrounding forest lands. Any fuels treatment completed on the non-federal parcels would be at the discretion of the landowner. Three of the non-federal parcels have been burned as part of major fire events over the past 15 years. The Cave Creek Complex was a fire initiated by a lightning strike in 2005 and burned a total of 43,950 acres, including the entirety of the Red Rover parcel. The Grapevine Fire was initiated by lightning in 2012 and burned a total of 18,431 acres, including the majority of the Ronstadt Highway parcel, and parts of the Ronstadt Tank parcel. Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land The land exchange would occur, and the private owners/developers would be responsible for implementation of fire and fuel treatments on the acquired parcels. Firefighting capabilities would be provided to meet requirements of the respective counties. The Forest Service would be responsible for ensuring that proper vegetation management occurs within the wildland-urban interface to mitigate or lessen the potential of wildfires from spreading from forest land to the newly acquired private parcels. Non-federal Land Management of the non-federal parcels would become the responsibility of the USFS, and fire and fuels management would be consistent with the respective forest plans. Cumulative Effects The Cave Creek Complex killed many of the trees and older shrubs on the Red Rover parcel; however, the majority of the parcel vegetation is grasses, and thus the parcel experienced low to moderate intensity surface fires that burned quickly. Similar conditions existed on the Ronstadt Tank and Highway parcels, where the Grapevine Fire was primarily grass-and brush-fed, and thus fairly fast burning. Additional wildfires are likely to occur in the reasonable foreseeable future and affect the ASNFs, CNF, TNF, and PNF. Future wildfires could be low intensity and ultimately prove beneficial to the overall ecological condition, or they could be of high severity and result in catastrophic, long-term effects. Future fuels reduction and management projects (e.g., Timber Mesa – Vernon Wildland-Urban Interface Project) would continue to ensure that the risk of fire damage to residential properties, including those resulting from development within the federal parcels proposed for exchange, is minimized or eliminated. No cumulative effects would occur. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Fire and fuels on and in the vicinity of the federal parcels would not be affected by the no action alternative. The federal parcels would continue to be managed in accordance with the respective forest plans. No direct or indirect effects would occur as a result. Non-federal Land Under the no action alternative, the private owners of the non-federal parcels would continue to be responsible for implementation of any fire and fuel treatments during and following development. Firefighting capabilities would be provided to meet requirements of the respective counties. Fire and fuels management in the surrounding forest lands would be the responsibility of the Forest Service. No direct or indirect effects with regards to fire and fuels would occur. Cumulative Effects There are no direct or indirect effects to fire and fuels; therefore, no cumulative effects would occur. Hazardous Materials Affected Environment The federal and non-federal lands proposed for exchange have been examined in accordance with Section 120(h) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Phase I Environmental Site Assessments were completed for the federal and non-federal parcels. These evaluations were conducted via records searches, interviews, and site visits consistent with good commercial or customary practice as set forth in the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Designation E 1527-05. The objective of the environmental site assessments was to evaluate each parcel for recognized environmental conditions (RECs) that indicate an existing release, a past release, or a material threat of a release of any hazardous substance or petroleum product into structures on the properties or into the ground, groundwater, or surface water of the properties. The Phase I Environmental Site Assessments also evaluated each parcel for Issues of Concern (IOCs), a non-ASTM term used to identify an environmental-related issue of interest to the purchaser of the subject site that does not rise to the level of a REC, such as out-of-date permits, or the presence of toxic substances regulated by the Toxic Substances Control Act such as asbestos-containing building materials, lead-based paint, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the potential for radon gas to accumulate inside structures. Federal Land The Phase I Environmental Site Assessment found no evidence of recent or historical RECs associated with the federal parcel (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). Small quantities (i.e., 30 gallons being the largest quantity; the most common quantities range from one to five gallons) of hazardous materials such as gasoline, diesel, oil-based paints are used and stored at both Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). These materials are stored on concrete surfaces (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). Electrical transformers at Camp Grace were clearly marked as non-PCB containing units (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). Transformers elsewhere on the federal parcel were observed to be in good condition with no evidence of stains or leaks (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). The Phase I Environmental Site Assessment also noted the Navopache Electric Cooperative, Inc. Wagon Wheel electrical substation and 40-foot wide 69 kilovolt transmission line on the federal parcel (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). Transformers and other electrical equipment associated with the substation and the transmission line were observed to be in good condition with no evidence of stains or leaks (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). There are several IOCs on the parcel. The Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace buildings were constructed in the 1960s, so it is possible that they may contain lead-based paint and/or asbestos-containing building materials (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). A 30-inch diameter concrete water pipeline built in the 1960s and taken out of service before 2007 crosses part of the parcel (Western Technologies, Inc. 2007). The pipeline is buried 10 to 20 feet below the ground surface. It is unknown whether the concrete pipeline contains asbestos, or what procedures were followed in the final closure of the pipeline west of the irrigation ditch (Western Technologies, Inc. 2007). Only a small portion of the extreme western end of the pipeline was actually closed. The line was capped with a riser installed to put water into the irrigation ditch. The pipeline is owned and operated by the City of Show Low (USDA Forest Service 2008). There are no plans to disturb the pipeline where it is currently buried. Non-federal Land Six RECs were identified during the Environmental Site Assessment conducted at the Mansfield parcel (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009a). Waste rock piles at four former mine sites on the Mansfield parcel were identified as RECs due to their possible effects on water quality (increased turbidity during rainfall and erosion events; acidic runoff) within the Mansfield watershed (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009a). However, these four piles total an estimated 2,900 cubic yards covering approximately one acre of the +/-182.41 acres, with the majority of the material possibly having low concentrations of the sulfide minerals that contribute to acidic runoff (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009a). The former Dixie Mine located about 1/4 mile northwest of the Mansfield parcel was identified as an REC for the Mansfield parcel. There are approximately 8,000 to 10,000 cubic yards of waste rock remaining from former mining activities at the Dixie Mine, which is upgradient from the Mansfield parcel and may be affecting surface and groundwater quality in the Mansfield Watershed, including the Mansfield parcel (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009a). The former Dixie Mine is on Forest Service land. The former Hosey Mine located on Forest Service land about 1 mile west-northwest of the Mansfield parcel was also identified as an REC for the Mansfield parcel. The former Hosey Mine is listed on the Arizona State Hazardous Waste List/Environmental Protection Agency Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Information System (a part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [USEPA] Superfund) (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009a). There are approximately 14,000 cubic yards of waste rock remaining from former activities at the Hosey Mine (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009a). The site was assessed and assigned USEPA ID number AZ 0002001857 and is not listed on the Superfund National Priorities List (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009a; USEPA 2010a, 2014). The non-National Priorities List status for the Hosey Mine is listed as “assessment complete-decision complete” (USEPA 2014). The former Hosey mine was identified as an REC for the Mansfield parcel because the large quantities of waste rock remaining at the Hosey Mine site that may be affecting surface and groundwater within the Mansfield parcel (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009a). Since the Environmental Site Assessment was completed, the landowner has closed the open mine features and filled in shafts on the Mansfield parcel. Waste rock piles have also been reduced in size. As described in the Environmental Site Assessment, there was previously an abandoned cabin of unknown age on the Mansfield parcel. Two IOCs are associated with the cabin: potential lead-based paint and/or asbestos-containing building materials. However, the cabin has been removed from the parcel by the landowner since the Environmental Site Assessment was completed. No RECs or IOCs were found at any of the other non-federal parcels (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009b, 2010, 2011b). Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the proposed action alternative, the federal parcel would be conveyed to private ownership and likely undergo development. Expansion of waste water treatment facilities at the Pinetop-Lakeside Sanitary District would adhere to the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality and USEPA requirements and provisions for solid waste disposal in an approved landfill in order to minimize the risk of impacts regarding hazardous materials. Camp Tatiyee would continue to operate on its designated 80acre parcel; Camp Grace would similarly be given the option to purchase the land where it currently operates and may continue operating. There are small amounts of hazardous materials on the federal parcel (gasoline, paint, etc.) at Camps Tatiyee and Grace. The types and quantities are similar to what would be used by a small landscaping business. As the camps would continue to operate, these types and quantities would continue to be used; as such there would be no change from existing conditions and thus there would be no direct or indirect impacts with respect to hazardous materials. If buildings at either camp are renovated or demolished, the operators would be required to comply with all applicable federal, state of Arizona, and local rules and regulations regarding testing, handling, and disposal of asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. All other development should abide by federal, state of Arizona, and local rules and regulations to minimize risk associated with hazardous materials. The Navopache Electric Cooperative, Inc. would continue to operate its Wagon Wheel electrical substation, the 69 kilovolt transmission line, and the electrical transformers at Camp Tatiyee in accordance with all applicable federal and state regulations regarding the use and disposal of PCBs. Since there are no RECs on the federal lands, and IOCs would be managed according to applicable federal and state regulations, no direct or indirect effects regarding hazardous materials are anticipated. Non-federal Land The only non-federal parcel where the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment identified RECs is the Mansfield parcel, where there is waste rock from past mining activity. There is also potential for surface and groundwater quality on the Mansfield parcel to be adversely affected by runoff from mining waste rock on surrounding NFS land. The DOI Bureau of Land Management and the USFS jointly operate an Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) program to improve the quality of the public lands the two agencies manage (DOI Bureau of Land Management and USDA Forest Service 2007). The AML program implements a risk-based approach to encourage watershed-wide cleanups, and addresses high-risk and high-priority abandoned sites to protect public health and safety (DOI Bureau of Land Management and USDA Forest Service 2007). The waste rock on the Mansfield parcel would be evaluated and assigned a priority for cleanup under the AML program. No other non-federal lands contain RECs associated with past mining or potentially hazardous materials. The evaluation and potential eventual remediation of the waste rock on the Mansfield parcel would result in a positive effect on the local resources. Cumulative Effects Federal Land The only hazardous materials present on the federal parcel are the small quantities used at Camps Tatiyee and Camp Grace. Under the proposed action, the camps would continue to operate and use the same types and quantities of hazardous materials they presently use; thus there would be no cumulative impact with respect to hazardous materials. Given proper testing, management, transportation and disposal of any identified lead-based paint and/or asbestos-containing materials in the Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace buildings, and the unused City of Show Low water pipeline there would be no cumulative hazardous materials impact. Non-federal Land The Phase I Environmental Site Assessment found no RECs or IOCs known on the non-federal lands, except for waste rock from past mining activities and the potential presence of lead-based paint and asbestos containing materials in the abandoned cabin located on the Mansfield parcel. The Mansfield parcel would be evaluated and assigned a priority for cleanup under the AML program. Therefore, the cumulative impacts with regard to hazardous materials would be positive. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the no action alternative, no change would occur to the current use and management of the federal parcels. The types and quantities of hazardous materials used at Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace would continue to be used. If buildings at either camp are renovated or demolished, the operators would be required to comply with all applicable federal, state of Arizona, and local rules and regulations regarding testing, handling, transporting and disposal of asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. The Navopache Electric Cooperative, Inc. would continue to operate its Wagon Wheel electrical substation, the 69 kilovolt transmission line, and the electrical transformers at Camp Tatiyee in accordance with all applicable federal and state regulations regarding the use and disposal of PCBs. Therefore, there would be no direct or indirect hazardous materials impacts. Non-federal Land Under the no action alternative, no change would occur to the current use and management of the non-federal parcels. The Mansfield parcel would not be evaluated for potential cleanup under the AML program. Therefore, there would be a direct and indirect adverse hazardous materials impact. Cumulative Effects Federal Land Under the no action alternative, there would be no change from existing conditions; therefore, there would be no direct or indirect cumulative hazardous materials impact. Non-federal Land Under the no action alternative, there would be no change from existing conditions. The waste mine rock on the Mansfield parcel would not be evaluated for potential cleanup under the AML and would continue to contribute sediments and acidic runoff to the Mansfield watershed. This would be a direct and indirect cumulative adverse hazardous materials impact. Chapter 4. Other Considerations Required Under NEPA Short-term Uses and Long-term Productivity NEPA requires consideration of “the relationship between short-term uses of man’s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity” (40 CFR 1502.16). As declared by the Congress, this includes using all practicable means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated to foster and promote the general welfare, to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans (NEPA Section 101). Conveyance of the federal lands into private ownership is expected to result in no development and only minor changes to existing management on the Camp Tatiyee site within the parcel. The Camp Grace site may similarly be maintained, if the operators elect to exercise the purchase option after the exchange is completed. This would result in little, if any, change in short-term uses or long-term productivity on these sections of the conveyed lands. The future of the remaining sections of the Camp Tatiyee parcel are less clear. Based on current zoning (Open Space), little if any development could occur. However, the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside does include a procedure for a landowner to seek changes in zoning that could allow for future development. If development were to occur on the conveyed federal lands, minimal impacts to the productivity of upland soils from compaction could occur where building foundations or concrete slabs are constructed. Any foreseeable future development on the federal lands would not result in any measurable effects to threatened or endangered plant and animal species or their habitat. The proposed action would preclude development on the non-federal parcels, providing protection to the more sensitive soils and habitats of wetlands, riparian areas and riverine systems. The proposed action affords greater long-term protection to listed species and management indicator species. This would occur as a result of the acquisition of important riparian and wildlife habitat currently located on the non-federal lands. With respect to management indicator species, forest-wide analyses do not indicate any management-induced trends that would be influenced by action or inaction at the scale of the proposed land exchange. Wetlands and floodplains in federal ownership are subject to more stringent management objectives than those in private ownership. Acquisition of the non-federal lands would contribute towards reversing the long-term trend of declining wetland and riparian habitat in the Southwestern Region. No wetlands or floodplains are located on the federal lands therefore, none would leave federal ownership. Unavoidable Adverse Effects Unavoidable adverse effects are expected to occur with implementation of the proposed action. Eight archaeological sites eligible for the NRHP would be adversely affected by the proposed action, through transfer of these resources from public to private ownership. A historic properties treatment plan and memorandum of agreement among the SHPO and the USFS were developed to resolve and mitigate the direct and indirect adverse effects (USFS 2014d; Appendix B). Mitigation measures in the treatment plan include photographic documentation, mapping the sites, conducting surface artifact collections, and data recovery through excavation. Through mitigation, adverse effects to these sites would be resolved. No unavoidable adverse effects are expected to occur as a result of the no action alternative, if no future development occurs. If future development occurs, the potential adverse impacts to various resources is not expected to be significant. The amount of impact, if any, would depend upon the scale, specific location and intensity of future development. The Town of Pinetop-Lakeside rezoning and plat approval process includes environmental review for impacts to water and geological resources, and allows for public review and comment, which may minimize any potential adverse impacts. Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments of Resources Irreversible commitments of resources are those that cannot be regained, such as the extinction of a species, the removal of mined ore, or the destruction of cultural resources. Irretrievable commitments are those that are lost for a period of time such as the temporary loss of timber productivity in forested areas that are kept clear for use as a power line rights-of-way or road. No irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources would occur from the exchange of lands and resulting change in ownership, if land uses remain the same. A change in land use may result in a loss of ponderosa pine forest or the destruction of cultural resources, however, future development is too speculative to estimate impacts. In the case of no action, the non-federal lands remain subject to development. If future development occurs, the change in land use from riparian influenced riverine habitats to residential home sites or other type of development could be considered an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources. Cumulative Effects Cumulative effects associated with the proposed action are detailed for each resource in Chapter 3 for both the proposed action and the no action alternative. Table 4-1 summarizes the cumulative effects of the proposed action in conjunction with the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions for the resources analyzed within this EIS. Table 4-1. Summary of Cumulative Effects Resource Name  Cumulative Impact  Does the Proposed Action Contribute to the Impact?  Is the Cumulative Impact Significant?  Land Use  Change in management of allowable land uses on all parcels involved in the exchange. The change is compounded with multiple other land exchanges in the region.  Yes  Yes-Neutral  Recreation and Public Access  Locally to the federal parcel, a cumulative loss of over 2,065 acres of NFS lands available for public recreation. Statewide, a net gain of over 3,618 acres of NFS lands available for public recreation.  Yes  No  Socioeconomics  Locally to the federal parcel, loss of PILT funding may potentially be offset via private property taxes. Where development is planned, local economic boosts may result via increased employment, property value, and purchase orders. Statewide, loss of property taxes on remote and undeveloped private land would be partially offset by PILT funding.  Yes  No  Plants Fish, and Wildlife  Locally to the federal parcel, there would be a loss of protected habitat used by northern goshawks and potentially used by Mexican spotted owls. Net gain of valuable riparian and sensitive species habitat for the USFS throughout the Region. Fuels treatment projects are anticipated to improve forest health throughout the region.  Yes  Yes-Beneficial  Resource Name  Cumulative Impact  Does the Proposed Action Contribute to the Impact?  Is the Cumulative Impact Significant?  Grazing  Impacts to grazing are limited to the proposed action and the planning efforts to revised LMPs on several of the Region’s forests. The LMP revisions are not expected to have substantial impacts to grazing.  Yes  No  Prime and Unique Farmlands  None of the regional land exchanges propose the conveyance of farmland from the USFS to a private party. LMP revision efforts may improve quality of NFS farmlands.  No  No  Wetlands and Floodplains  The USFS is anticipated to have a net cumulative gain in wetlands and floodplains.

If mitigation is not accomplished, this may be considered a significant, adverse impact. Other Required Disclosures NEPA at 40 CFR 1502.25(a) directs “to the fullest extent possible, agencies shall prepare draft environmental impact statements concurrently with and integrated with other environmental review laws and executive orders.” EO 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations, tasks “each federal agency [to] make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high adverse human health and environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations.” EO 12898, dated 11 February 1994, aims to: (1) focus the attention of federal agencies on the environmental and human health conditions in minority communities and low-income communities with the goal of achieving environmental justice; (2) foster non-discrimination in federal programs that substantially affect human health or the environment; and (3) give minority communities and low-income communities greater opportunities for public participation in, and access to public information on, matters relating to human health and the environment. The EO specifically requires that Native American populations are included in discussions and analysis of potentially affected minority and low-income populations. The USEPA describes environmental justice as the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies (USEPA 2010b). Fair treatment means that no group of people, including racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic, should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences resulting from the execution of federal, state, local, and tribal programs and policies. The goal of fair treatment is not to shift risks among populations but to identify potential disproportionately high and adverse effects and identify alternatives that may mitigate these effects. Federal agencies must provide minority and low-income communities with access to information on matters relating to human health or the environment and opportunities for input in the NEPA process, including input on potential effects and mitigation measures. Tables 3-6 and 3-13 identify race and ethnicity characteristics for the potentially affected areas and Tables 3-8 and 3-15 identify poverty characteristics of the affected areas. Impacts that have been identified throughout this EIS were reviewed to determine those that have the potential to adversely and disproportionately affect minority, low-income and tribal populations. Impacts that were identified as having potential were related to Recreation and Public Access and Cultural Resources. The Recreation and Public Access section identifies an impact that would reduce access to an existing trail in Navajo County. The population of Navajo County has a high proportion of minorities (44.9 percent American Indian) and a high proportion of individuals living below the poverty line (25.8 percent). As such it would be likely that minority and low income populations would be affected by the loss of access. However, the loss of access would be mitigated to be less than significant and the loss of access would affect the entire public, not just minority and low-income populations. Because the impact would be less than significant and affect the entire public, there would be no disproportionate or highly adverse effects and, as such, no impact to environmental justice. The Cultural Resources section identifies potential adverse impacts on tribal historic properties. However, the section indicates that due to mitigations there would be no adverse effects. Since there would be no adverse effects, there would be no impact to environmental justice. Chapter 5.

A decision whether to complete the proposed exchange in whole, or part, or to reject the proposal in its entirety, has not been made. The National Forest System (Federal) lands that are being considered for exchange consist of one tract totalling approximately 344 acres, more or less, located within the corporate boundaries of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside in the Lakeside Ranger District (RD) of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests (ASNFs) in Navajo County, Arizona. The private (non-Federal) lands consist of fourteen separate tracts totaling approximately 1,719 acres, more or less, in the Lakeside RD of the Sitgreaves NF in Navajo County; the Santa Catalina, Douglas, Safford, Nogales, and Sierra Vista RDs of the Coronado NF in Cochise, Graham, Pima, and Santa Cruz Counties; the Bradshaw RD of the Prescott NF in Yavapai County; and the Cave Creek, Pleasant Valley, and Tonto Basin RDs of the Tonto National Forest in Gila and Maricopa Counties, Arizona. A scoping report along with legal descriptions and maps of all tracts are located on the ASNFs internet web site at www.fs.fed.us/r3/asnf/. Click on Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange at the Projects & Plans link. If you do not have access to the internet a hard copy of the documents can be obtained from the Lakeside RD, 2022 W. White Mountain Blvd., Lakeside, AZ 85929, phone: 928-368-5111, or the ASNFs Supervisor's Office, P.O. Box 640, 30 S. Chiricahua Dr., Springerville, AZ 85938, phone: 928-333-4301. The FS is interested in acquiring the non-Federal lands, as they are valuable for wildlife habitat, floodplains area protection, and outdoor recreation. Acquisition of several of the tracts would improve management of and access to adjacent NFS lands.  Blocking up public landownership would result in a more consistent application of resource management objectives and contribute to an overall reduction in re-occurring property boundary identification and landline maintenance costs. Resource management administration would be made more efficient by eliminating numerous land special-use authorizations. The FS proposes to acquire land with floodplains associated with the Rucker, Ronstadt Highway, Ronstadt Tank, Mansfield, Harshaw Creek, and Tonto Creek parcels. The FS does not propose conveying any lands with wetlands or floodplains.  The land exchange proposal is consistent with management direction found in all four national forests’ land and resource management plans. The proposal is currently being considered to determine whether or not it is in the overall public interest and whether it would be beneficial to the NFS and the United States to proceed with an exchange of lands. The environmental analysis will comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1976 since the proposal contains National Forest System lands.  Any or all of the above identified lands may be exchanged provided the overall values are equal. If the values are unequal, either party may equalize the values by making a cash payment not to exceed 25 percent of the value of the lands transferred out of Federal ownership. Persons claiming such properties, having valid objections, or desiring to comment on this proposal must file their claims, objections, or comments in writing with the Forest Supervisor, ATTN: Joe Sitarzewski, Apache-Sitgreaves NFs, P.O. Box 640, 30 S. Chiricahua Dr., Springerville, Arizona 85938, within 45 days after the initial date of publication.

If a decision is made to complete the exchange as proposed, or in part, the decision will be publicized and persons who previously provided comments will be advised and given an opportunity to appeal said decision, at their discretion. ELAINE J.

ACTION: Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. SUMMARY: In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321–4370d, as implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations, 40 CFR Part 1500–1508, the USDA Forest Service, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests (ASNFs) (lead forest), will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on a proposal to transfer one 344.06 acre parcel of Federal land on the ASNFs into private ownership, and 16 parcels totaling 1,719.32 acres of private land into Federal ownership. The land proposed for the transfer to the Forest Service includes one 110.57 acre parcel to the ASNFs; nine parcels totaling 1153.31 acres to the Coronado National Forest (CNF); one 11.15 parcel to the Prescott National Forest (PNF); and five parcels totaling 444.42 acres to the Tonto National Forest (TNF). The proposed land exchange would be between the Lawyer’s Title Company, which holds the private land in trust for the benefit of the Lions Foundation of Arizona (LFA) and BC2 LLC, and the Apache-Sitgreaves, Coronado, Prescott, and Tonto National Forests in Central and Southern Arizona. The EIS will analyze the proposed change of the Federal lands (344.06 ac.) for the non-Federal lands (1,719.32 ac.). The Federal and non-Federal lands proposed for exchange are located in Navajo, Cochise, Pima, Santa Cruz, Graham, Maricopa, Gila, and Yavapai Counties, Arizona. The affected Forest Service units are the Lakeside Ranger District of the ASNFs; Santa Catalina, Nogales, Safford, and Douglas Ranger Districts of the CNF; Bradshaw Ranger District of the PNF; Cave Creek, Tonto Basin, and the Pleasant Valley Ranger Districts in TNF.

There is a need to acquire lands that (1) protect habitat for several threatened, endangered, and sensitive species; (2) facilitate public access to Federal lands; (3) improve wetlands, floodplains, and riparian areas; (4) decrease the complexity of maintaining property boundaries; and (5) improve the efficiency of resource management by focusing the Forests’ funding and staff on consolidated ownerships. The non-Federal lands would provide additional federally managed habitat for wildlife and plant species. The consolidation of public land ownership would result in a reduction in mixed ownership patterns. The elimination of numerous miles of common Federal/ private landline boundaries and controlling land survey corners would contribute to increased management efficiency and a reduction in future administrative costs. Forest Service administration of over a dozen special use permits (SUPs) on the Federal land would no longer be necessary. Possible future residential/subdivision development on the private inholdings would be eliminated. On a Forest Service-wide basis, there could be a net gain of 1,375.26 acres of land that would be available for public outdoor recreation uses. Proposed Action The Forest Service is proposing a land-for-land exchange that would result in federal acquisition of approximately 1,719.32 acres of non- Federal lands in the Coronado National Forest, Prescott National Forest, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, and Tonto National Forest. Approximately 344.06 acres of Federal land would be conveyed within the incorporated town of Pinetop-Lakeside, Arizona from the ASNFs. The conveyance of the Federal land would increase the number of acres of private land within the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside by 344.06 acres while eliminating one of the last isolated Forest Service parcels in the town. The land would continue to be used for existing youth organization camps with the remainder being available for future development within the town of Pinetop-Lakeside in accordance with local zoning ordinances. The proposed exchange would be with LFA and BC2 LLC, through Lawyers Title Company, as Trustee, under authority of the General Exchange Act of March 20, 1922; the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), as amended; and the Federal Land Exchange Facilitation Act of August 20, 1988. The proposed exchange of lands would not require an amendment to the ASNFs Land and Resource Management Plan. Pursuant to the regulations for land exchanges (36 CFR 254.3(f)): ‘‘Lands acquired by exchange that are located within areas having an administrative designation established through the land management planning process shall automatically become part of the area within which they are located, without further action by the Forest Service, and shall be managed in accordance with the laws, rules, and regulations, and land and resource management plan applicable to such area.’’ Background In 1997, the LFA, through its representative, Page Land & Cattle Co., proposed to exchange private land for the National Forest System (Federal) land where their Camp Tatiyee youth organization camp which is authorized by a SUP. LFA proceeded to acquire non-Federal properties in the PNF, ASNFs and TNF and presented the ASNFs with their proposal for the Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange on June 13, 2000. A September 5, 2003 preliminary value analysis concluded that the estimated value of the Federal land exceeded that of the offered non-Federal lands and that LFA would need to acquire additional properties for the proposed exchange to proceed. On December 1, 2005, Page Land & Cattle Co. submitted a revised proposal, which included a number of additional parcels previously associated with the Cote Land Exchange on the CNF. A Value Consultation for the proposed land exchange was completed on May 9, 2007, and is documented in a Feasibility Analysis that was approved by the Acting Director of Lands & Minerals, USDA Forest Service, Southwestern Region, on August 9, 2007. The Value Consultation associated with the feasibility analysis concluded that the proposed land exchange is in compliance with the equal value requirement of the FLPMA, as amended. An Agreement to Initiate the Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange was executed by the Acting Director of Lands & Minerals, USDA Forest Service, Southwestern Region, on October 1, 2007. As required by 36 CFR 254.8, the Notice of Exchange Proposal (NOEP) was published in the Arizona Daily Star, Tucson Citizen, the Tribune, Payson Roundup, Courier, and White Mountain Independent for four consecutive weeks from November 5, 2007 to November 27, 2007. Possible Alternatives A full range of alternatives to the proposed action, including a no-action alternative, will be considered during the environmental analysis and will be discussed in the EIS. The no-action alternative represents no change from the current pattern of land ownership, and it serves as the baseline for the comparison among the action alternatives. Responsible Official The Responsible Official is the Regional Forester, Southwestern Region. The Responsible Official will review all issues, alternatives, and environmental consequences associated with the analysis; consider all public comments and responses; and comply with all policies, regulations, and laws in making a decision regarding the proposed exchange of lands documented in the final EIS for the Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange. The Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 57 / Thursday, March 25, 2010 / Notices 14421 Responsible Official will document his decision and rationale for the decision in a Record of Decision. The Responsible Official’s decision will be subject to public notice, review, comment, and appeal under the Forest Service Regulations for Notice, Comment, and Appeal Procedures for National Forest System projects and Activities at 36 CFR part 215 and 36 CFR part 251. Nature of Decision To Be Made The Forest Service will determine if the lands to be exchanged are desirable, in the public interest, and suitable for inclusion in the National Forest System. Land exchanges are discretionary, voluntary real estate transactions between the Federal and non-Federal parties. The exchange can only be completed after the authorized officer determines that the exchanges meets the requirements at 36 CFR 254.3(b): (2)(i) The resource values and the public objectives served by non-Federal lands and interests to be acquired are equal to or exceed the resource values and public objectives served by the Federal lands to be disposed, and (ii) the intended use of the disposed Federal lands will not substantially conflict with established management objectives on adjacent Federal lands, including Indian Trust Lands. Lands will be exchanged on a value for value basis, based on fair market value appraisals. The appraisal is prepared in accordance with the Uniform Appraisal Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice and the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisition. The appraisal prepared for the land exchange is reviewed by a qualified review appraiser to ensure that it is fair and complies with the appropriate standards. Under the FLPMA, all exchanges must be equal in value. Forest Service regulations at 36 CFR 254.3(c) require that exchanges must be of equal value or equalized pursuant to 36 CFR 254.12 by cash payment after making all reasonable efforts to equalize values by adding or deleting lands. If lands proposed for exchange are not equal in value, either party may make them equal by cash payment not to exceed 25 percent of the Federal land value. A value consultation by the Regional Appraiser on May 9, 2007 concluded that it appears that the exchange is structured with flexibility to comply with the equal value requirement of the FLMPA, as amended. Preliminary Issues An initial scoping letter dated October 30, 2007, was mailed to adjacent landowners, potentially interested parties, and affected special use permit holders who it was believed would have an interest in or be affected by the project. The letter explained that interested parties should access the ASNFs internet web site where they would find a description of the lands being considered for exchange, the legal descriptions of the parcels, and maps displaying their locations. Comments were requested by December 15, 2007. Based upon the comments received, and litigation stemming from other land exchange activities, the Forest Service determined that an environmental assessment would be insufficient for the NEPA process and an EIS would be required. Preliminary issues identified include concerns over the loss of opportunity for the continued use of the National Forest land for wildlife viewing and recreation by residents living in the area adjacent to the Federal parcel and concerns regarding the effect of possible future development of the Federal parcel once conveyed into private ownership. Scoping Process This notice of intent formally initiates the scoping process for this EIS, which guides the development of the EIS. Scoping will include notice in the ASNF’s Quarterly Schedule of Proposed Actions; distribution of letters to individuals, organizations, and agencies who have previously indicated interest in the Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange; communication with Tribal interests; and news releases in the Arizona Republic (the regional newspaper of record), and the newspaper of record each Forest’s newspaper of record: The Arizona Daily Star (Coronado), Daily Courier (Prescott), Arizona Capitol Times (Tonto), and the White Mountain Independent (ASNFs) and to other papers serving areas affected by this proposal: Tucson Citizen, Sierra Vista Herald, Nogales International, Eastern Arizona Courier, East Valley Tribune and Payson Roundup. Any news releases will also be distributed to other local newspapers that serve areas affected by this proposal. A public meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, April 13, 2010, from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the at the mess hall of Camp Tatiyee, 5283 White Mountain Boulevard, Lakeside, Arizona 85929. This meeting and any future public meetings will have a notice of time and location provided to newspapers that serve areas affected by this proposal. The scoping process will include identifying any key issues and previously unknown potential environmental effects of the proposed action. The comment period for the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA publishes the notice of availability in the Federal Register. At that time, copies of the draft EIS will be distributed to interested and affected agencies, organizations, tribes, and members of the public for their review and comment. It is important that those interested in the management of the National Forests participate at that time. Comments received in response to this solicitation, including names and addresses of those who comment, will be considered part of the public record of this proposed action and will be available for public inspection. Comments submitted anonymously will be accepted and considered; however, anonymous comments do not provide standing to appeal any decision made under 36 CFR Part 215 and 36 CFR Part 251. Additionally, pursuant to 7 CFR 1.27(d), any person may request the agency to withhold a submission from the public record by showing how the Freedom of Information (FOIA) permits such confidentiality. Persons requesting such confidentiality should be aware that, under the FOIA, confidentiality may be granted in only very limited circumstances, such as to protect trade secrets. The Forest Service will inform the requester of the agency’s decision regarding the request for confidentiality, and where the request is denied, the agency will return the submission and notify the requester that the comments may be resubmitted with or without name and address. It is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final EIS. To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments on the draft EIS should be as specific as possible. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the NEPA at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points. Dated: March 19, 2010. Chris Knopp, Forest Supervisor. [FR Doc. 2010–6589 Filed 3–24–10; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410–11–P Appendix B: Coordination with Other Public Planning Efforts
