The San Francisco Bay Area Water Emergency Transportation Authority (WETA) is considering improvements to the existing Ferry
Terminal in downtown San Francisco. There are two alternatives: the No Action Alternative and the Action Alternative. The No
Action Alternative maintains the existing Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal gate configuration and circulation areas, including
the function, uses, and design of public spaces within the project area. Increases in passenger and water transit vessel arrivals that could
be accommodated with the existing facilities at the Ferry Terminal would occur as a part of the No Action Alternative. The Action
Alternative, or proposed project, includes expansion and improvement of the Ferry Terminal at the Ferry Building to accommodate
construction of three new gates and overwater berthing facilities, in addition to supportive landside improvements, such as additional
passenger waiting and queuing area, and circulation improvements. The proposed construction is scheduled to commence as early as
2014 and be completed by 2020. The project is proposed to support existing and planned future water transit services operated by
WETA, as well as WETA’s emergency response operations.
The Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report evaluates the potential impacts of implementing the No
Action Alternative and Action Alternative on transportation and circulation; land use and land use planning; parklands and
recreation; Section 4(f) resources; air quality and global climate change; noise and vibration; cultural and paleontological
resources; biological resources; aesthetics and visual resources; hydrology and water quality, hazards and hazardous materials;
geology, soils, and seismicity; energy consumption; utilities and public services; socioeconomics; environmental justice; and
regional growth.

Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

Executive Summary

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION
The San Francisco Bay Area Water Emergency Transportation Authority (WETA) is proposing to expand
berthing capacity at the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal), located at the San
Francisco Ferry Building (Ferry Building), to support existing and future planned water transit services
operated by WETA and WETA’s emergency operations, as detailed in WETA’s Implementation and
Operations Plan (IOP) (WETA, 2003b). The Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project
(or project) would include construction of three new gates and overwater berthing facilities, in addition to
supportive landside improvements, such as additional passenger waiting and queuing areas, circulation
improvements, and other water transit-related amenities. The new gates and other improvements would
be designed to accommodate future planned water transit services between Downtown San Francisco and
Antioch, Berkeley, Martinez, Hercules, Redwood City, Richmond, and Treasure Island, as well as
emergency operation needs.
The Ferry Terminal is in the northeastern section of San Francisco, California, situated at the foot of
Market Street at The Embarcadero. The project area encompasses property managed in the public trust
by the Port of San Francisco (Port) from the south side of Pier 1 to the north side of Pier 14, and from the
Embarcadero Promenade to San Francisco Bay (Figure ES-1). The project area includes the Ferry
Building, the Ferry Plaza, the Agriculture Building, and Pier 2. The project area includes existing water
transit facilities (Gates B, C, D, and E), a variety of commercial uses (retail, dining, and office), and
public open spaces.
WETA and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) have prepared this Environmental Impact
Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR) to address the environmental effects of the proposed
Ferry Terminal improvements. These agencies have prepared this EIS/EIR in accordance with the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, 42 United States Code (USC) Section 4321 et seq.;
the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations for implementing NEPA, 40 Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR), Parts 1500-1508; the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) of 1970,
California Public Resources Code, Section 21000 et seq., as amended; the Guidelines for Implementation
of CEQA, Title 14, California Code of Regulations (CCR), Section 15000 et seq.; and FTA guidelines.
The FTA is the NEPA lead agency, and WETA is the CEQA lead agency.
The proposed project builds on previous planning efforts and projects implemented by WETA and the
Port. WETA adopted its IOP and Program EIR for the IOP in 2003, which planned for a system-wide
expansion of water transit service in the Bay Area. The IOP identified new routes that would be
developed over a 20-year period. The new routes would connect Downtown San Francisco with areas of
the North, East, and South Bay. In addition, in the 1990s, the Port initiated a comprehensive land use
planning process that identified near-term and long-term improvements that should be made to the Ferry
Terminal. As a result, in 2003, the Port completed Phase I of the Downtown Ferry Terminal Project,
which included the construction of Gates B and E. Phase I of the Downtown Ferry Terminal Project also
identified long-term future projects that would continue to improve circulation, public spaces, and water
transit operations at the Ferry Terminal.
The planning efforts undertaken by WETA for this project build on these previous projects and planning
processes, and have been coordinately closely with the Port.

Executive Summary

PURPOSE AND NEED
Purpose of the Project
The purpose of the project is to support existing and future planned water transit services operated by
WETA on San Francisco Bay, as established by WETA in its IOP (WETA, 2003b), and in accordance
with City and County of San Francisco (CCSF) and regional policies to encourage transit use.
Furthermore, the project would address deficiencies in the transportation network that impede water
transit operations, passenger access, and passenger circulation at the Ferry Terminal. The project
objectives would:


Accommodate WETA’s projected increase in water transit ridership and related vessel arrivals and
departures from the Ferry Terminal;
−





Provide a viable alternative mode of transportation that accommodates projected increases in
transbay trips, and helps alleviate congestion over the San Francisco Bay Bridge and through the
San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Transbay Tube;

Address WETA and the Port’s emergency operation needs;
−

Establish a circulation plan and improved signage that provides clear pedestrian routes for vesselto-bus and vessel-to-rail transfers, as well as safe routes for bicycles, emergency vehicles, and
delivery trucks to enter, park, and exit the area;

−

Provide necessary landside improvements, such as designated weather-protected areas for waiting
and queuing, ticket machines and fare collection equipment, improved lighting, and improved
boarding and arrival/departure information to serve water transit passengers and to enhance the
Ferry Terminal as the central hub for water transit services on San Francisco Bay; and

Enhance the area’s public access and open space with design features that create attractive, safe
daytime and nighttime public spaces for both water transit passengers and other users of the Ferry
Building area.

Need for the Proposed Project
Regional Growth and Transbay Capacity Constraints
Between now and 2035, the Bay Area is expected to gain 2 million residents and 1.7 million jobs
(MTC, 2009). Downtown San Francisco will remain one of the primary employment centers of the
region. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) estimates that the Bay Bridge corridor
will have substantial growth in the number of daily person trips, increasing from 590,000 current trips
to 772,000 in 2025; and in vehicular traffic increasing from 300,000 current vehicles per day to
425,000 vehicles per day in 2025 (MTC, 2002). MTC estimates transbay transit ridership will also
follow this growth trend.
Transit currently carries approximately 160,700 BART passengers, 15,200 Alameda-Contra Costa Transit
(AC Transit) bus passengers, and 4,900 water transit passengers between the East Bay and San Francisco
(MTC, 2000). By 2025, BART is expected to carry 254,000 daily riders through the Transbay Tube. AC
Transit is expected to carry 19,800 passengers to and from San Francisco, and water transit services are
expected to carry 7,060 passengers. In total, 36 percent of Bay Bridge corridor trips are expected to be on
transit (MTC, 2002).

FIGURE ES-1

Water Emergency Transportation Authority

Executive Summary

The projected increase in transbay trips will result in the following deficiencies in the transportation
network:





Congestion/travel delay in the I-80/Bay Bridge corridor;
Increased bus and carpool delays;
BART Transbay Tube capacity constraints; and
Inadequate transit service to meet projected Treasure Island demand following redevelopment.

Water Transit Operations, Circulation, and Access Constraints at the San Francisco Ferry
Building
In 2035, the Ferry Terminal is projected to serve approximately 32,000 water transit passengers, an
approximate increase of 300 percent over current ridership levels of approximately 11,200 passengers,
accounting for existing services between San Francisco and Alameda, Oakland, and Vallejo, as well as
future planned water transit services between San Francisco and Antioch, Berkeley, Martinez, Hercules,
Redwood City, Richmond, and Treasure Island (CSI, 2011). The projected ridership increases cannot be
adequately accommodated at the Ferry Terminal because of the following current infrastructure,
circulation, and operating deficiencies:




Insufficient number of gates and berthing facilities to accommodate new water transit service;
Inadequate waiting and circulation area for passengers; and
Lack of clearly designated pedestrian connectivity linkages.

Air Quality Management Issues
Although the San Francisco Bay Area’s air quality has improved in recent years, an increase in population
and vehicle miles driven between now and 2035 is expected to increase particulate matter emissions by
20 percent for particulate matter 2.5 microns in diameter or less (PM2.5), and 29 percent for particulate
matter 10 microns in diameter or less (PM10) (MTC, 2009). The BAAQMD regional performance
objectives call for reductions in daily vehicle miles traveled by 10 percent, PM2.5 emissions by 10 percent,
PM10 emissions by 45 percent, and carbon dioxide emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels (MTC,
2009). Cross-bay water transit service can support Bay Area air quality goals by encouraging a shift from
vehicle to water transit usage. The WETA IOP Program EIR, which analyzed increased regional water
transit service, found that an expanded water transit system would result in a net decrease in nitrous oxide
(an ozone precursor), carbon monoxide, and PM10 (WETA, 2003a).
Disaster Response and Recovery
Water transit provides a viable alternative for transporting people around the region when unexpected and
long-term disruption renders other components of the regional transportation system inoperable.
Disastrous events that have disrupted the transportation system have occurred several times during the
past 25 years. In the event of a disaster, WETA will provide emergency water transportation services
during the response phase, and then restore basic water transit services during the recovery phase of a
disaster, as described in the WETA Transition Plan (WETA, 2009).
According to the San Francisco Bay Area Regional Emergency Coordination Plan, in the event of a major
catastrophe, such as a 7.9 magnitude earthquake on the San Andreas Fault, it is estimated that
approximately 296,200 people from San Francisco County will require mass transportation assistance
within the first 3 days of the event (Cal EMA et al., 2010). In its Preliminary Design Concept Plan,
WETA estimates that additional gates will be needed to accommodate the substantial number of evacuees
in the event of a major catastrophe (ROMA, 2012). In addition to the Golden Gate Ferry gates, five
WETA-operated gates could board 9,000 evacuees per hour. Currently, the two existing WETA gates
have the capacity to board less than half that number of evacuees per hour.

Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

Executive Summary

The limited availability of berthing facilities will be further constrained by the lack of available staging
areas to assemble, queue, and board crowds of evacuees. To accommodate the volume of people
accessing gates during emergencies, the circulation area surrounding the Ferry Building will need to be
expanded with new decking built over open water to Essential Facilities 1 standards.
ALTERNATIVES
The project includes two alternatives: the No Action Alternative, and the Action Alternative under NEPA
guidelines (No Project and Project under the CEQA guidelines).
No Action Alternative
The No Action Alternative maintains the existing Ferry Terminal gate configuration and circulation areas,
including the function, uses, and design of public spaces within the project area. No new gates or
additional boarding capacity would be provided to accommodate new WETA services or the expansion of
existing WETA services as part of the No Action Alternative. Similarly, there would be no
implementation of circulation and boarding improvements to respond to emergency planning
requirements. Increases in passenger and water transit vessel arrivals that could be accommodated with
the existing facilities at the Ferry Terminal would occur as a part of the No Action Alternative.
The Ferry Terminal currently serves approximately 11,200 average weekday passengers on six water
transit routes, with approximately 21 AM peak-period vessel arrivals each weekday. Of this total, the
three routes operated by WETA currently serve approximately 5,100 average weekday passengers, and
account for 14 AM peak-period vessel arrivals, carrying 1,400 AM peak-period passengers each weekday.
Under the No Action Alternative, all Ferry Terminal water transit services would continue to operate as
they currently do, with the AM peak-period travel occurring generally between 6:30 and 9:00 AM, and
PM peak-period travel occurring between 4:00 and 6:30 PM.
As described in WETA’s approved IOP and Program EIR for the IOP, water transit service is planned
to expand on San Francisco Bay (WETA, 2003b). As a part of the No Action Alternative, these new
routes could still be developed. However, because under the No Action Alternative no improvements
would be made at the Ferry Terminal, the No Action Alternative includes a limited expansion of
service (vessel arrivals and/or passengers) that could be reasonably accommodated by the existing
facilities at the Ferry Terminal. The increase in passengers or vessel arrivals could be associated with
expansion of existing services or the addition of new routes, as would be determined by WETA, based
on operational need.
With the existing infrastructure, for the purposes of this EIS/EIR, it is assumed that each gate could
reasonably and safely accommodate a maximum of four to five vessel arrivals per hour during peak
operations. Based on this and historical patterns of vessel capacity and ridership fluctuations throughout
the day, it is assumed that existing infrastructure available to WETA at the Ferry Terminal could
accommodate up to 7,800 passengers per weekday, 2,500 passengers during the AM peak period, 20
vessel arrivals during the AM peak period, and a total of 65 vessel arrivals per weekday. This level of
water transit service could occur under the No Action Alternative.
In addition, as a part of the America’s Cup Project, several of the existing facilities within the project area
will be altered pursuant to the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission’s (BCDC)
Special Area Plan (SAP) amendments adopted in April 2012 (BCDC, 2012). The SAP amendments
require that Pier ½ (and its associated piles) be removed by March 2013. In addition, the SAP

As defined by the California Building Code 2010 and the International Building Code 2009, Essential Facilities are buildings
and other structures that are intended to remain operational in the event of extreme environmental loading from flood, wind,
snow, or earthquakes.

Executive Summary

amendments require that the shed on Pier 2—which currently houses a restaurant—be vacated and
removed by March 2015. 2 As of October 2012, Pier ½ had been removed.
This alternative serves as the baseline against which the environmental effects of the Action Alternative
are measured.
Action Alternative
The Action Alternative is the expansion and improvement of the Ferry Terminal at the Ferry Building to
accommodate the full expansion of water transit service that was described in the IOP. Based on the
existing and new water transit services that would be operated by WETA, ridership on WETA services is
projected to increase from 5,100 to 25,700 passengers per weekday by 2035; total AM peak-period
WETA vessel arrivals are anticipated to increase from 14 to approximately 52 to 57, with approximately
181 total vessel arrivals per weekday.
To accommodate the full expansion of water transit service, the Action Alternative includes construction
of three new gates and overwater berthing facilities, in addition to supportive landside improvements,
such as additional passenger waiting and queuing areas and circulation improvements. Figure ES-2
depicts the project area with the proposed improvements. The proposed project improvements have been
designed to not only meet the purpose and need of WETA’s expansion plans, but also in keeping with the
historical significance of the area and its role as an important public gathering place in the region. The
project has also been designed in close coordination with the Port, and in consideration of the Port’s
objectives for continued improvement of the area.
As described under the No Action Alternative, as a part of the America’s Cup Project, several of the
existing facilities in the project area will be altered. These alterations would be completed prior to
implementation of WETA’s proposed project; therefore, the project improvements described in this
EIS/EIR are those improvements that would be required after demolition of these facilities as a part of the
America’s Cup Project.
The project includes demolition, removal, repair, and replacement of existing facilities, as well as
construction of new facilities in the project area. The Ferry Terminal can generally be divided into the
North Basin (areas north of the Ferry Plaza) and South Basin (areas south of the Ferry Plaza). The project
includes the following elements:


Removal of portions of existing deck and pile construction and fendering (portions would remain as
open water, and other portions would be replaced);



Construction of one new gate and access pier (Gate A) in the North Basin and two new gates (Gates F
and G) in the South Basin; and



Improved passenger boarding areas, amenities, and circulation, including rebuilding a portion of the
marginal wharf in the North Basin; extending the East Bayside Promenade along Gates E, F, and G;
strengthening the South Apron of the Agriculture Building; creating the Embarcadero Plaza; and
installing weather protection canopies for passenger queuing.

The project elements are summarized in Table ES-1. Construction activities would be expected to
commence as early as 2014 and be completed by 2020.

2

Prior to the adoption of these Special Area Plan amendments in April 2012, the Special Area Plan required that Pier ½ and
Pier 2 (including the shed) be removed as a part of the Phase II of the Downtown Ferry Terminal Project.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES
Table ES-2 presents a summary of impacts for the Action Alternative, the corresponding mitigation
measures for each impact, and the NEPA and CEQA impact levels after mitigation. Direct, indirect,
construction, and cumulative impacts were evaluated for each resource area. Direct impacts are the
primary effects that are caused by the project, and occur at the same time and place. For the proposed
project, direct impacts would be the result of development of the physical facility improvements. Indirect
impacts are secondary effects that are reasonably foreseeable and caused by the project, but occur at a
different time or place. For the proposed project, the facility improvements would facilitate an increase in
vessel and passenger use of the Ferry Terminal area; these effects are described as indirect impacts.
Construction impacts are those that would occur only during construction of the project, and would cease
when the project enters into the operation phase. Cumulative impacts occur when two or more individual
effects that, when considered together, are considerable; or that compound or increase other
environmental impacts. A detailed discussion of these impacts and mitigation measures is included in
Chapter 3, Affected Environment, Consequences, and Mitigation.
Impacts of the No Action Alternative are presented in Chapter 3.0 for comparison to those of the Action
Alternative; however, mitigation measures and NEPA and CEQA determinations are not made for
impacts of the No Action Alternative. The only potentially adverse impacts identified for the No Action

the Muni F Market and Wharves in the PM peak hour.

Methods for mitigating impacts are being evaluated. If feasible
mitigation is identified, it will be included in the Final EIS/EIR.

Impact 3.2-3: Potential Impacts to Pedestrian Facilities in Existing

(No. 15A/15B) Intersection Adjustments
WETA will enter into an agreement with SFMTA to modify the
intersection signal timing for The Embarcadero Midblock at the
Ferry Building Southbound and Northbound (No. 15A/15B), to
remove the northbound-southbound movement (No. 9); and
distribute the time to the northbound movement (Turning
Movement No. 2/Turning Movement No. 5) and southbound
movement (Turning Movement No. 10), to allow for longer
crossing times for pedestrians. This adjustment would result in the
LOS for the crosswalk to be improved to LOS D for the respective
AM and PM peak hours, without causing intersection LOS to drop
to an unacceptable level. SFMTA has discretion over the specific
timing adjustments, and the timing of the implementation of any
changes affecting the transportation network in San Francisco.

would result in the LOS for the crosswalk to be improved to
LOS D, without causing a drop in intersection LOS for traffic.
The existing crosswalk at this location is 42 feet in width;
therefore, it would require a 30-foot widening (for a minimum
width of 72 feet). However, there are a number of signs, poles, and
other street furniture located north and south of the crosswalk on
either side of the roadway that could have to be relocated to allow
the crosswalk to be widened. These include:
 Along the western side of The Embarcadero, 2.5 feet north of
the crosswalk, there is a traffic signal; and 15 feet north of the
crosswalk, there is a manhole.
 Along the western side of The Embarcadero, south of the
crosswalk, there is a pedestrian crossing signal 2 feet from the
crosswalk; a newspaper vending box 8 to 16 feet from the
crosswalk; a street light 20 feet from the crosswalk; a “no
parking” sign 24 feet from the crosswalk; and a traffic signal
30 feet from the crosswalk. A tree is located approximately
44 feet south of the crosswalk.
 Along the eastern side The Embarcadero, a traffic signal and
pedestrian call button are located 1 foot north of the crosswalk.
 Along the eastern side The Embarcadero, a pedestrian crossing
signal is located at the southern edge of the crosswalk, a
decorative spherical bollard is 23 feet south of the crosswalk,
and a traffic signal is 32 feet south of the crosswalk.
SFMTA has discretion over the specific adjustments and the timing
of the implementation of any changes affecting the transportation
network in San Francisco, and SFDPW will be required to review
and approve any relocation of manholes.

However, the vessels and the generator would use “ultra-low sulfur
diesel” (ULSD), as required in California, which would minimize odors
that typically result from sulfur dioxide emissions. In addition, the
predominant wind direction in the project area is from the west, which
blows emissions away from sensitive receptors.

Impact 3.6-4: Construction-Related Emissions of ROG, NOX,
PM10, and PM2.5 that Could Exceed Applicable Air Quality
Standards
If construction activities in the North and South Basins overlapped, the
project’s unmitigated ROG, PM10, and PM2.5 construction-related
emissions would not exceed the BAAQMD’s average daily emission
standards for construction activities; however, the project’s unmitigated
construction-related NOX emissions could exceed the BAAQMD
standards. Implementation of Mitigation Measures AQ-1 and AQ-2
would reduce the project’s construction NOX emissions below
BAAQMD’s thresholds.

Mitigation Measure AQ-1: Construction Phasing
WETA will phase construction activities in such a way that onsite
emission-generating construction activities for the North Basin and
South Basin improvements do not overlap.
Mitigation Measure AQ-2: Implement BAAQMDRecommended Best Management Practices
The following BAAQMD-recommended best management
practices will be implemented to reduce exhaust emissions:
 Minimize the idling time of diesel-powered construction
equipment to 2 minutes.
 The contractor will demonstrate at various phases of construction
(e.g., 25 percent, 50 percent, and completion) that the off-road
equipment (more than 50 horsepower) and marine vessels to be
used during construction (i.e., owned, leased, and subcontractor
vehicles) would achieve a project-wide fleet-average 20 percent
NOX reduction, and a 45 percent PM reduction compared to the
most recent CARB fleet average, to the extent feasible.
Acceptable options for reducing emissions include the use of latemodel engines, low-emission diesel products, alternative fuels,
engine retrofit technology, after-treatment products, add-on devices
such as particulate filters, and/or other options that may become
available. The contractor will document efforts taken to achieve
the specified goals, explain why meeting the goals was not
feasible (if applicable), and indicate what emissions reduction
and equipment use goals were achieved.
 Require that all construction equipment, diesel trucks, and
generators be equipped with Best Available Control Technology
for emission reductions of NOX and PM.
 Require that all contractors use equipment that meets CARB’s
most recent certification standard for off-road heavy-duty diesel
engines.

To reduce the effect of noise and vibration on adjacent land uses
and structures, the following measures will be implemented during
construction:
 Within 55 feet of a building (i.e., the Ferry Building, the
Agriculture Building, or Pier 1), vibratory pile driving will be
employed to reduce noise levels at the building to below

ensure that noise levels at the building do not exceed 100 dBA.
If necessary, noise-reducing measures will be employed to
reduce noise levels at the building to below 100 dBA.
 When impact pile driving occurs within 540 feet of the Hotel
Vitale, vibration monitoring will be performed to ensure that the
vibration levels at the hotel do not exceed 75 VdB (the threshold
for annoyance for residential land uses).
 When vibratory pile driving occurs within 315 feet of the Hotel
Vitale, vibration monitoring will be performed to ensure that the
vibration levels at the hotel do not exceed 75 VdB (the threshold

 When pile driving occurs within 290 feet of the Hotel Vitale,
techniques to reduce vibration, such as selection of vibratory
pile driving, will be applied to ensure that vibration levels at the
hotel do not exceed 75 VdB (the threshold for annoyance for
residential land uses).
 To ensure that vibration from construction activities does not

0.3 PPV at the building.
 To ensure that vibration from construction activities does not
result in damage to the Ferry Plaza (Vibration Category I), the
following measures will be applied:
− When impact pile driving occurs within 53 feet of the Ferry
Plaza, vibration will be monitored to ensure that the vibration
levels at the plaza do not exceed 0.5 PPV.
− Within 30 feet of the Ferry Plaza, an alternative method to
impact pile driving will be employed, such as vibratory piledriving construction.
− When vibratory pile driving occurs within 33 feet of the Ferry
Plaza, vibration will be monitored to ensure that the vibration
levels at the plaza do not exceed 0.5 PPV.
− Pile driving will not be implemented within 13 feet of the
Ferry Plaza, unless it can be demonstrated that the activity
will not generate vibration levels that would exceed 0.5 PPV
at the plaza.
 Should the noise and vibration monitoring on site indicate that
levels reach or exceed the thresholds indicated here, all impact work
will cease, and corrective measures or alternative construction
methods will be implemented to minimize the risk to the subject or
structure.

Resources
There are no known archeological resources in the project area of

materials during project activities represents a potential project impact;
however; implementation of Mitigation Measure CUL-1, would reduce
the project’s potential to result in impacts to archaeological resources.

R:\13 WETA\DTFX\Draft 0413\Exec Sum.docx

Mitigation Measure CUL-1: Inadvertent Discovery Measures
To avoid any potential adverse effect on inadvertently discovered
NRHP- and/or CRHR-eligible or unique archaeological resources
as defined in CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5(a)(c), WETA will
distribute an archaeological resource “ALERT” sheet to the project
prime contractor, and to any project subcontractor firms involved
in soil/sediment disturbing activities in the project site. The
“ALERT” sheet will contain sufficient information to allow
contractor personnel to identify conditions that may indicate the
presence of archaeological resources. Prior to undertaking any
soil-disturbing activities (i.e., dredging, pile installation), each
contractor is responsible for ensuring that the “ALERT” sheet is
circulated to all field personnel, including machine operators, field
crew, pile drivers, and supervisory personnel. Should there be any
indication of an archeological resource—including, but not limited
to, encountering fragments of bone, stone tools, midden soils,
structural remains, ship remnants, or historic refuse—during any
soil-disturbing activity of the project, WETA will immediately
suspend any soil-disturbing activities in the vicinity of the
discovery.
In the event of such a discovery, WETA will retain the services of
a qualified archaeological consultant. The archaeological
consultant will advise WETA as to whether the discovery is an
archaeological resource that retains sufficient integrity, and is of
potential scientific/historical/cultural significance. If an
archaeological resource is present, the archaeological consultant
will identify and evaluate the archaeological resource. The
archaeological consultant will make a recommendation to WETA
as to what action or additional measures, if any, are warranted,
including coordination with appropriate agencies.
Measures might include preservation in situ of the archaeological
resource; an archaeological monitoring program; or an
archaeological evaluation program. If an archaeological resource
cannot be avoided by project activities, the archaeologist will
prepare an Archaeological Evaluation Plan (AEP). The AEP will

to WETA for approval. The archaeologist will then conduct an
evaluation consistent with the WETA-approved AEP. The
methods and findings of the evaluation will be presented in an
Archaeological Evaluation and Effects Report, which will be
submitted to WETA for review on completion.
Impact 3.8-2: Disturbance of Human Remains, Including those
Interred Outside of a Formal Cemetery
There are no known human remains in the project APE. The
inadvertent disturbance of human remains during construction
represents a potential project impact; however, implementation of

composed entirely of, or includes, human skeletal remains, in addition
to implementation of Mitigation Measure CUL-1, Inadvertent
Discovery Measures, construction activities will immediately cease
and WETA’s project representative will immediately contact the San
Francisco County coroner to evaluate the remains, following the
procedures and protocols set forth in Section 15064.5 (e)(1) of the
CEQA Guidelines. If the coroner determines that the remains are
Native American, WETA will contact the NAHC, who will appoint a
Most Likely Descendant (MLD), in accordance with Health and
Safety Code Section 7050.5, subdivision (c), and PRC 5097.98 (as
amended by AB 2641). In accordance with PRC 5097.98, WETA and
the Port (as landowner/administrator) will ensure that, according to
generally accepted cultural or archaeological standards or practices,
the immediate vicinity of the Native American human remains is not
damaged or disturbed by further development activity until WETA
and the Port have discussed and conferred with the MLD, as
prescribed in this section (PRC 5097.98), regarding their
recommendations, if applicable, taking into account the possibility of
multiple human remains. WETA, the Port, and the MLD will make all
reasonable efforts to develop an agreement for the treatment, with
appropriate dignity, of human remains and associated or unassociated

the human remains and associated or unassociated funerary objects.
PRC allows 48 hours to reach agreement on these matters. If the
MLD and the other parties do not agree on the reburial method, the
project will follow Section 5097.98(b) of the PRC, which states, “the
landowner or his or her authorized representative will re-inter the
human remains and items associated with Native American burials
with appropriate dignity on the property in a location not subject to
further subsurface disturbance.”
Impact 3.8-3: Cause a Direct Adverse Effect or Impact to Historic
Properties or Resources
Should it be determined that the fendering along Pier 1 requires
replacement, the project could directly affect historic properties or
resources. During the Final Design of the project, the existing
fendering along the southern edge of Pier 1 would be inspected to
determine whether replacement is necessary. Implementation of
Mitigation Measures CUL-3 and CUL-4 require application of
measures during construction to avoid inadvertent damage;
implementation of a response and repair plan, should any inadvertent
damage occur during construction; and replacement of the fendering
along Pier 1, in a manner consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s
Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties, Standards for
Rehabilitation.

R:\13 WETA\DTFX\Draft 0413\Exec Sum.docx

Mitigation Measure CUL-3: Replacement in Accordance with
Secretary of Interior Standards for Rehabilitation
If replacement of the existing pile fendering attached to the
southern side of Pier 1 is deemed necessary, the replacement
work will be conducted in accordance with the Secretary of the
Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties
(NPS, 2001), specifically adhering to the Standards for
Rehabilitation. Project compliance with the Secretary of the
Interior’s Standards and applicable guidelines will ensure that
Pier 1 retains sufficient historic integrity to convey its
significance for listing in the NRHP and CRHR, therefore
avoiding and minimizing the adverse effect or significant impact
potentially caused by this undertaking.
When replacing the pile fendering on the southern side of the
building, in-kind replacement materials will be used to the greatest
extent feasible. The replacement timber pilings will have a
diameter similar to that of the original pilings. The number of
replacement pilings will match the number of pilings being
removed (33), and the new pilings will be spaced similarly to the
originals. The selection of replacement pilings should include
input and review from an architectural historian who meets the
Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards (as
defined in 36 CFR, Part 61). The project’s compliance with the
Standards for Rehabilitation will result in Pier 1 retaining integrity

location. Although overall, the project will result in some
diminished integrity of material, the elements that comprise the
building’s significant form, plan, and design, illustrating its
important historic function and aesthetic value, will be retained;
and the impact would be avoided and minimized.
Mitigation Measure CUL-4: Plan for Protection Against, and
Response to, Inadvertent Damage
Protection and Monitoring to Avoid Effects. To avoid and
minimize adverse effects that would inadvertently cause damage to
historic properties during project construction activities, the project
construction zone will be clearly delineated using orange construction
fencing or other similar suitable materials, and designated as a
restricted area. Mitigation Measure NOISE-3 would also help reduce
this impact.
Response to and Repair of Inadvertent Damage. Should project
actions cause inadvertent damage to historic properties, project work
will cease, and the response plan prepared prior to construction for
repair of damage will be implemented. The plan and response will
include input and review from an architectural historian who meets
the Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards
(as defined in 36 CFR, Part 61). Inadvertent damage to the historic
properties resulting from the project will be repaired in accordance
with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation.
The response plan will include photographic documentation of the
condition of the portions of historic properties prior to project
implementation, to establish the baseline condition for assessing
damage. Prior to implementation, WETA will provide the plans for
any repairs to SHPO for review and comment, to ensure
conformance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation.

In the event that paleontological resources are discovered during
construction, sediment-disturbing activities within 50 feet of the find
will be temporarily halted or diverted until the discovery is examined
by a qualified paleontologist (in accordance with Society of
Vertebrate Paleontology standards). The paleontologist will
document the discovery as needed, evaluate the potential resource,
and assess the significance of the find under the criteria set forth in
CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5. The paleontologist will notify
the appropriate agencies to determine procedures that would be
followed before construction is allowed to resume at the location of
the find. If the project proponent determines that avoidance is not
feasible, the paleontologist will prepare a salvage plan in accordance
with the SVP and CEQA Guidelines for mitigating the effect of the
project on the qualities that make the resource important. The plan
will be submitted to WETA for review and approval prior to
implementation.

Impact 3.8-5: Potential Indirect Effects of Visual or Noise and
Vibration Elements on Historic Properties or Resources
There is potential for the design of the project’s weather protection
canopies to affect the adjacent historic properties within the APE. With
implementation of Mitigation Measure CUL-6, indirect adverse visual
effects from the Final Design of the weather protection canopy element of
the proposed project would be avoided. Additionally, there is the potential
that vibration from construction could indirectly affect the historic
properties or resources in APE. These potential effects would be avoided
by implementing Mitigation Measure NOISE-3.

Mitigation Measure CUL-6: Consultation with Local Agencies
Regarding Final Design of Weather Protection Canopies and
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation
The final design of the weather protection canopies will be
developed in consultation with the Port’s Waterfront Design
Advisory Committee and the San Francisco Historic Preservation
Commission, and consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s
Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties, Standards for
Rehabilitation (NPS, 2001). The basic scale and massing of these
project features is described in Section 6.1, but the details of their
appearance has not been finalized.
Mitigation Measure CUL-6 requires consultation regarding final

any of the historic properties in the Architectural APE or Focused
Architectural APE. The standards for rehabilitation recommend
“designing new exterior additions to historic buildings or adjacent
new construction which is compatible with the historic character of
the site and which preserves the historic relationship between the
building or buildings and the landscape” (NPS 2001, 105). The
guidelines also state that new additions, exterior alterations, or
related new construction should not destroy historic materials,
features, and spatial relationships that characterize the historic
property. The new work should be compatible with the historic
materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to
protect the integrity of the property and its environment. New
additions and adjacent or related new construction should be
undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the
essential form and integrity of the historic property and its
environment would be unimpaired. These guidelines, and others
for historic setting, is and will continue to be incorporated in the
design of the project features at the historic Ferry Building and the
surrounding historic properties. The consultation and application
of the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards would ensure that
historic integrity is retained, and that the properties would remain
eligible for listing in the NRHP and CRHR, therefore avoiding
potential adverse effects.
The final design for the project will include consultation and
review by the Port’s Waterfront Design Advisory Committee and
the San Francisco Historic Preservation Commission. Through the
design review process, the Waterfront Design Advisory Committee
is responsible for ensuring that project improvements comply with
the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Historic Rehabilitation,
and that projects would not adversely affect historic properties or
districts along the waterfront. Given the resources in the project
area, the San Francisco Historic Preservation Commission will be
involved in the design review process. The public is also invited to
participate in the design review process. WETA will submit the

 Only a single impact hammer will be operated at a time; and
 If a mechanical dredge is used, the applicant will use the
smallest possible dredge head to reduce the likelihood of fish
becoming entrained in the mechanical dredge.
WETA plans to conduct all piling installation and dredging
between approved work windows, between June 1 and
November 30, when the likelihood of sensitive fish species being
present in the work area is minimal (LTMS, 1998).
Until Final Design is completed and a contractor is selected,
WETA will not be able to make a final determination as to whether
piling installation or dredging must occur at times other than the
approved work window. In addition, factors beyond WETA’s
control, such as requirements of other agencies or conflicting
timing requirements may prevent WETA from conducting all
piling installation and dredging within the approved work window.
The project sponsors will undertake formal FESA and CESA
consultation with NOAA, NMFS, and CDFW to identify avoidance
and minimization methods that will be implemented to reduce
effects on sensitive marine resources. Methods may include
monitoring by a qualified biologist, and halting of dredging or piledriving activities for a specific period if spawning activity is noted
within the construction area. In addition to the avoidance and
minimization measures identified here, the project sponsors will
comply with additional measures and requirements identified
through consultation with NOAA, NMFS and CDFW.

during pile-driving activities. The plan will include specific
measures to minimize exposure of marine mammals and fish to high
sound levels. At a minimum, avoidance and minimization measures
will meet the following performance standards and include the
following methods:
 Underwater noise levels will be measured during pile-driving
activities to determine the distance at which sound levels do not
exceed injury thresholds for fish (206 dB) or marine mammals
(Level A thresholds [180 dB RMS or 190 dB RMS]).
 A “soft start” technique shall be employed in all pile driving to
give marine mammals an opportunity to vacate the area.
 If an activity produces underwater sound levels that exceed the
injury threshold for fish or marine mammals, work will be
stopped and sound levels will be reduced through noise control
measures such as the installation of NMFS-approved attenuation
devices (e.g., bubble curtains) or modification of construction
methods (such as using cushioning between the hammer and
pile).
 An NMFS-approved biological monitor will monitor the
installation of at least 10 percent of the 24- to 42-inch-diameter
steel piles that will be installed by impact hammer. During
initial impact pile-driving efforts, a default exclusion zone at a
distance of 500 feet from the pile will be monitored for the
presence of marine mammals. The area will be monitored for
30 minutes prior to impact driving. No driving will be
conducted until the area has been free of marine mammal
sightings for 30 minutes. If no marine mammals are sighted,
driving will begin and hydroacoustic monitoring will be
conducted.

project construction would not substantially limit the available habitat
or movement of fish, seabirds, or marine mammals in San Francisco

requirements:
 Hazardous Materials Storage and Disposal. The construction
contractor will be responsible for the proper storage and disposal
of any hazardous materials or wastes in accordance with all
federal, state, and local laws and regulations. This may involve
obtaining permits from the local regulatory agency for the
storage of hazardous materials, and obtaining a Waste

any hazardous wastes generated at the site. The HMMP shall
include requirements for appropriate material storage; spill
control, containment, and cleanup; vehicle and construction
equipment inspections; emergency preparedness; and worker
training.
 Lead and Asbestos Management. Prior to any demolition
activities, a lead-based paint and asbestos survey of the
structures shall be conducted. Based on the results of the
survey, it will be determined if any lead-based paint or asbestos
is present that requires abatement prior to demolition of the
structures. Results of this survey shall be included in the
HMMP. Any abatement required shall be completed in
accordance with all federal, state, and local regulatory
requirements by properly licensed abatement contractors, before
demolition of the structures.
 Wood Waste Management. Procedures for implementation of
DTSC’s Alternative Management Standards for Treated Wood
Waste will be included in the HMMP, including employee
training in waste management, segregation of the wood waste
from other wastes, appropriate storage and labeling, and
transportation to an authorized treated wood waste facility.
 Universal Waste Management. A survey of common items that
are regulated as “universal wastes” by the State of California (e.g.,

Executive Summary

Alternative would result from the facilities at the Ferry Terminal not being upgraded to Essential Facility
Standards, inhibiting the improvement of WETA emergency operations and seismic safety (refer to
Impacts 3.12-4 and 3.13-1) and from pedestrian congestion in the project area that would continue
without the project circulation improvements (refer to Impacts 3.3-1 and 3.4-2).
EVALUATION OF ALTERNATIVES
Under the No Action Alternative, there would be no implementation of facility improvements at the Ferry
Terminal. Therefore, only a small increase in water transit service (i.e., only service that could be
accommodated at the existing two gates that WETA has access to) could be safely accommodated at the
Ferry Terminal over the long term. In addition, in the event of an emergency, WETA vessels deployed
for emergency operations would be required to use the existing two gates at the Ferry Terminal available
to WETA (Gates B and E). Existing Ferry Terminal and Ferry Building areas would be used for staging
of evacuees (e.g., areas along The Embarcadero or the Ferry Plaza), which are not built to Essential
Facilities standards. If areas of the Ferry Terminal not built to Essential Facilities standards fail, or
otherwise cannot be safely accessed, passengers would need to be staged elsewhere, and alternative
access to vessels would need to be provided, potentially hindering evacuation activities.
The Action Alternative would accommodate the full expansion of water transit service outlined in
WETA’s IOP for the San Francisco Bay Area, by constructing three new gates, overwater berthing
facilities, and supportive landslide improvements (such as additional passenger waiting and queuing
areas, and circulation improvements). In addition, improvements constructed under the Action
Alternative would all be constructed to Essential Facilities standards, to ensure that the improved
circulation areas (e.g., the new Embarcadero Plaza) would be available for emergency operations and
evacuee queuing, if necessary.
Although the No Action Alternative would not result in any physical impacts to the environment, it would
not meet the purpose and need of the project; and over the long term, it would not improve alternative
transportation and emergency operations in the Bay Area. The No Action Alternative would not
accommodate the projected increases in transbay water transit trips that would help alleviate congestion
over the Bay Bridge and through the Bay Area Rapid Transit Transbay Tube. Furthermore, the No
Action Alternative would not address WETA and the Port’s emergency operation needs. In addition, the
No Action Alternative would be inconsistent with several of the plans and policies adopted for the Ferry
Terminal area that encourage an expansion in water transit services, and improvements to public access
and open space. Therefore, the No Action Alternative would not be considered an environmentally
preferred/superior alternative over the long term.
The Action Alternative would meet the purpose and need of the project. The only adverse and significant
and unavoidable impacts that would result from implementation of the Action Alternative, in the short or
long term, would be transportation and circulation impacts. All other impacts identified for the Action
Alternative would be negligible, less than significant and not adverse, or less than significant and not
adverse with the implementation of mitigation measures. As described in Section 2.7 of this document,
other alternatives to the project have been previously evaluated. However, these alternatives were found
not to meet the project purpose and need, to not be feasible, to not be consistent with other plans, or to
exceed projected funding. A majority of the adverse impacts that would result from the Action
Alternative would be temporary impacts from construction, which would be outweighed by the long-term
benefits of project implementation.
Therefore, the Action Alternative, as designed and with incorporation of the recommended mitigations, is
considered to be the environmentally preferable/superior alternative.

Executive Summary

COORDINATION AND CONSULTATION
Since late 2010, several types of public and agency participation have occurred as a part of the project
design and the environmental review process pursuant to the requirements of NEPA, CEQA, and 23 USC
139. 23 USC 139 mandates—among other requirements—that the federal lead agency must establish a
plan for coordinating public and agency participation in and comment on the environmental review
process for a project or category of projects. Stakeholders and public agencies, including those with
permitting authority for the project, have been engaged throughout the planning process, as detailed in
Chapter 6, Public and Agency Involvement.
Federal, state, and local agencies that have jurisdiction over resources that could be affected by the
project, or that have technical expertise on an issue relevant to the proposed project, were formally invited
to participate in the environmental review process as either cooperating or participating agencies in the
NEPA process. Table ES-3 summarizes those agencies that accepted invitations to participate in the
NEPA process for the project. The National Marine Fisheries Service accepted FTA’s request to serve as
a cooperating agency pursuant to NEPA, and requested participation in the development of the EIS/EIR
as it relates to the assessment of potential impacts and conservation measures for Endangered Species
Act-listed fish species under the jurisdiction of National Marine Fisheries Service and essential fish
habitat under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.
Additionally, the Port accepted WETA’s request to serve as a responsible agency under CEQA.

PURPOSE AND NEED

1.1

INTRODUCTION

1.0 Purpose and Need

The San Francisco Bay Area Water Emergency Transportation Authority (WETA) is proposing to expand
berthing capacity at the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal), located at the San
Francisco Ferry Building (Ferry Building), to support existing and future planned water transit services
operated by WETA and WETA’s emergency operations, as detailed in WETA’s Implementation and
Operations Plan (IOP) (WETA, 2003b). The Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project
(or project) would include phased construction of three new gates and overwater berthing facilities, in
addition to supportive landside improvements, such as additional passenger waiting and queuing areas,
circulation improvements, and other water transit-related amenities. The new gates and other
improvements would be designed to accommodate future planned water transit services between
Downtown San Francisco and Antioch, Berkeley, Martinez, Hercules, Redwood City, Richmond, and
Treasure Island, as well as emergency operation needs.
WETA and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) have prepared this Environmental Impact Statement/
Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR) to address the environmental effects of the proposed Ferry Terminal
improvements. These agencies have prepared this EIS/EIR in accordance with the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, 42 United States Code Section 4321 et seq.; the Council on Environmental
Quality regulations for implementing NEPA, 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 1500-1508; the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) of 1970, California Public Resources Code, Section 21000 et seq., as
amended; the Guidelines for Implementation of CEQA, Title 14, California Code of Regulations,
Section 15000 et seq.; and FTA guidelines. The FTA is the NEPA lead agency, and WETA is the CEQA lead
agency. The project includes two alternatives: the No Action Alternative and the Action Alternative under
NEPA guidelines (No Project and Project under the CEQA guidelines), as described in detail in Chapter 2.0.

PROJECT LOCATION AND PROJECT AREA MAP

The Ferry Terminal is located in the northeastern section of San Francisco, California situated at the foot
of Market Street at The Embarcadero (see Figure 1-1 for project location and project area). The project
area, surrounding the Ferry Building, encompasses property managed in the public trust by the Port of
San Francisco (Port) from the south side of Pier 1 to the north side of Pier 14 from the Embarcadero
Promenade to San Francisco Bay.
The project area serves as an important public space in San Francisco. It contains a mix of commercial,
office, and retail uses, including the Ferry Building marketplace, and is also an active hub for water
transit. Three water transit services operate from four gates in the project area: Gates B, C, D, and E.
Bounded by San Francisco Bay to the east and downtown to the west, the project area is surrounded by a
mix of open spaces and passive recreation areas such as waterfront walkways, plazas, and public piers.
Although the waterfront has changed substantially over time, the project area and its vicinity are modern
and active, as well as reflective of their history. The project area is located within the boundaries of two
historic districts (the Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District and Embarcadero Historic District), and
individually significant historic structures are located within or adjacent to the project area—the Ferry
Building, the Agriculture Building, and Pier 1.
1.3

PURPOSE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT

The purpose of the project is to support existing and future planned water transit services operated by
WETA on San Francisco Bay, as established by WETA (formerly known as the Water Transit Authority
[WTA]) in its IOP (WETA, 2003b), and in accordance with City and County of San Francisco and
regional policies to encourage transit use. Furthermore, the project would address deficiencies in the
transportation network that impede water transit operations, passenger access, and passenger circulation at
the Ferry Terminal, as described in this chapter. The project objectives include:

PROJECT BACKGROUND

1.4.1

San Francisco Bay Area Water Emergency Transportation Authority

WETA (formerly WTA) is a local agency with multi-county jurisdiction which was created through
Senate Bill 428, enacted in October 1999, to plan and operate new and expanded water transit service and
related ground transportation for the San Francisco Bay Area. In October 2007, Senate Bill 976 replaced
WTA with WETA and expanded WETA’s duties to include the coordination of emergency activities of
all water transportation and related facilities within the San Francisco Bay Area region, except those
provided or owned by the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway, and Transportation District (SB 976, 2007).
WETA’s mission is to design, build, and operate a seamless transit system that responds to the region’s
congestion management needs, develops innovative environmental solutions for vessels, contributes to
economic vitality and improves quality of life.
1.4.2

WETA Planning Efforts

WETA’s IOP presents a strategy to improve San Francisco Bay Area transit service with an
environmentally friendly water transit system (WETA, 2003b). WETA prepared a Program EIR that
addressed the potential environmental impacts and associated mitigation measures resulting from the
expansion of the network of water transit service defined in the IOP (WETA, 2003a). The Program EIR
analyzed the cumulative impacts, at a program level, of the development of additional routes, and
assumed that project-level environmental review would be undertaken for the development of new or
expansion of existing Ferry Terminal facilities to adequately address site-specific issues.
In line with the IOP, WETA is currently undertaking a comprehensive expansion of water transit service
in the San Francisco Bay Area, including:


Improving service on existing water transit routes and adding up to seven future planned routes
(Downtown San Francisco to Antioch, Berkeley, Martinez, Hercules, Redwood City, Richmond, and
Treasure Island);

1.0 Purpose and Need



Delivering new vessels that are ten times cleaner than existing vessels and 85 percent better than the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's emissions standards for 2007 marine engines;



Providing better, more convenient landside connections to water transit services that will enhance
ridership; and



Expanding facilities at the Ferry Terminal to support WETA’s planned expansion of water transit
service on San Francisco Bay.

The planned expansion focuses on delivering new routes and facilities with identifiable funding sources,
such as new bridge toll revenues from Regional Measure 2 (RM-2), local sales tax measures (San
Francisco, Contra Costa and San Mateo counties), federal grants, and fare box revenues. WETA is
expecting to receive RM-2 funds for the proposed improvements at the Ferry Terminal. RM-2 funds are
generated from an initiative approved by voters on March 2, 2004. This initiative earmarks a $1.00
increase in tolls on the region’s seven state-owned toll bridges to address congestion in the transbay
bridge corridors. In addition to RM-2 funding, WETA is requesting assistance to fund the project from
the FTA and from the state of California through Proposition 1B, the Highway Safety, Traffic Reduction,
Air Quality, and Port Security Bond Act of 2006, approved by California voters on November 7, 2006,
authorizing over $19.9 billion in bonds to be issued and sold for highway and transit improvements that
provide mobility improvements in highly traveled or highly congested corridors in all regions of
California.
In 2009, WETA adopted the Emergency Water Transportation System Management Plan, which
established how WETA will use regionalized public and private assets to coordinate emergency water
transportation services on San Francisco Bay when the need arises, and manage the restoration of normal
water transit services. The Plan reflects best emergency management practices drawn from national,
state, and local frameworks and is intended to provide WETA with guidance on the concept of emergency
operations, incident management, pre-emergency planning, response phase, recovery phase, and nonemergency operations (WETA, 2009). The Emergency Water Transportation System Management Plan
and Ferry Terminal emergency staging constraints identified in Section 1.4.4 were considered in
developing the project alternatives.
1.4.3

Current Water Transit Service at the Ferry Terminal

Prior to construction of the San Francisco Bay Bridge and Golden Gate Bridge in the 1930s, the San
Francisco Bay Area’s population was about a quarter of what it is at present. During that time, water
transit services on San Francisco Bay carried 15 times the number of passengers carried today, accounting
for up to 50 million passenger trips per year. At the peak of this era, there were more than 320 ferry
arrivals and departures at the Ferry Building per day (carrying more than 250,000 passengers), connecting
with streetcar arrivals and departures at the Ferry Building approximately every 90 seconds. The opening
of the San Francisco Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge in 1936 and 1937, respectively, along with
mass use of the automobile, eventually rendered the daily commute to San Francisco by water transit
obsolete (Ferry Building, 2010).
Water transit today is a small but growing part of the San Francisco Bay Area’s transportation network.
Although it carries only a fraction of the total San Francisco Bay Area travelers, approximately 3 to
4 million passenger trips per year, water transit plays a meaningful role in reducing congestion and
providing mobility in the key transbay bridge corridors throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. Six
water transit routes currently serve the Ferry Terminal, as shown in Table 1-1. Today, the Ferry Terminal
accommodates approximately 130 weekday arrivals and departures serving more than 10,000 water
transit passengers (MTC, 2007). In addition to supporting water transit services, the Ferry Terminal area
also serves as an important public space in San Francisco.

1.4.4

Project Area History

In 1968, the responsibilities for the San Francisco waterfront, including the project area, were transferred
from the state to the City and County of San Francisco through the Burton Act. As a condition of the
transfer, the state required the City of San Francisco to create a Port Commission that would have the
authority to manage the San Francisco waterfront in the public trust for the citizens of California. The
Port is currently responsible for managing the 7.5 miles of San Francisco Bay shoreline, extending from
Hyde Street Pier in the north to India Basin in the south. The Port's responsibilities include promoting
maritime commerce, navigation, and fisheries; restoring the environment; and providing public recreation.
Although the Port is a part of the City and County of San Francisco, it receives all of its funding through
the management of the lands under its jurisdiction (e.g., through lease payments).
The Port is responsible for any and all land-use improvements in the project area, including those
improvements proposed as a part of the project. The Port has adopted several plans and policies to guide
development along the waterfront, such the Waterfront Land Use Plan and the Waterfront Land Use Plan
Design and Access Element. Compliance with these plans and policies is a part of the Port’s lease
approval and design review processes..

Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

1.0 Purpose and Need

In the 1990s, the Port initiated a comprehensive land use planning process that identified near-term and
long-term improvements that should be made to the Ferry Terminal. The planning process, summarized
in the project’s Concept Design – Stage 1 Final Report (Port, 1994), addressed deficiencies in the
circulation of pedestrians across The Embarcadero and through the Ferry Building, constraints imposed
by previous design modifications of the Ferry Building that obscured wayfinding to the gates, limited
opportunities for public gathering and access to San Francisco Bay, and restricted commercial
development within the building. In response to these deficiencies, the Port embarked on a series of nearterm improvements that had available funding. These improvements were implemented through Phase 1
of the project. During these planning efforts, a variety of design, configuration, and circulation
improvements were considered. They are described in more detail in Chapter 2.0 of this EIS/EIR.
The Port conducted an environmental analysis of the Phase 1 improvements in the San Francisco
Downtown Ferry Terminal Environmental Assessment (NEPA) and Negative Declaration/Initial Study
(CEQA) (SF Planning et al., 1997), and obtained a permit from the San Francisco Bay Conservation and
Development Commission to implement these improvements in 1998 (BCDC, 1998). Construction of
Phase 1 was completed by the Port in 2003, including the construction of new piers to accommodate
Alameda Harbor Bay, Alameda/Oakland, Tiburon, and Vallejo operations in 2003 (Gates B and E). Not
all of the Phase 1 improvements identified and analyzed in the environmental document were constructed
at that time due to funding availability. In addition, the planning process that resulted in the Phase 1
improvements identified long-term future improvements that could be made (Phase 2).
As part of separate initiatives during the same time period, the Port undertook and completed
improvements to the street design and pedestrian crossing of The Embarcadero in front of the Ferry
Building (Harry Bridges Plaza) as part of the Mid-Embarcadero Transportation and Open Space Project
and undertook the historic restoration and adaptive reuse of the Ferry Building. Restoration involved a
public-private collaboration that redeveloped the historic landmark building into a mixed-use property
with a public food market on the ground floor and premier quality office space on the upper floors while
continuing it historic role as a transportation hub (Ferry Building, 2010).
1.4.5

Ferry Building Area Planning and Development Program

Building on the improvements already completed in and around the Ferry Building, the Port is
considering additional improvements to the Ferry Building area as part of a larger planning and
development program for the entire area. This program includes elements of the WETA project (as
described in Chapter 2.0 of this EIS/EIR), as well as other improvements unrelated to the expansion of
water transit service, such as future rehabilitation and reuse of the Agriculture Building, public access and
open space enhancements, development of a comprehensive circulation plan, and coordination with
BART to implement safety improvements needed in project vicinity.
While the WETA project described in this EIS/EIR would contribute to the Port’s larger planning and
development program for the Ferry Building area, WETA and the Port have separate overall
responsibilities and goals relating to improvements in the area. WETA and the Port entered into a
Memorandum of Understanding that establishes each agency’s roles and responsibilities for
improvements in the Ferry Building area and establishes a coordinated planning process for implementing
design and environmental review for projects in the Ferry Building area. The Memorandum of
Understanding defines which elements of the Ferry Building area improvements would be the
responsibility of each agency. WETA would be responsible for the waterside and landside improvements
related to the expansion of water transit service as described in this EIS/EIR. The Port would be
responsible for other elements not related to the expansion of water transit service, such as rehabilitation
and reuse of the Agriculture Building, which would undergo separate environmental review processes
when the Port proposes to implement those projects (WETA, 2010).

NEED FOR THE PROPOSED PROJECT

1.5.1

Regional Growth and Transbay Capacity Constraints

1.0 Purpose and Need

Between now and 2035, the Bay Area is expected to gain 2 million residents and 1.7 million jobs (MTC,
2009). Downtown San Francisco will remain one of the primary employment centers of the region. The
Metropolitan Transportation Commission estimates that the Bay Bridge corridor will have substantial
growth in the number of daily person trips, increasing from 590,000 current trips to 772,000 in 2025, and
in vehicular traffic increasing from 300,000 current vehicles per day to 425,000 vehicles per day in 2025
(MTC, 2002). The Metropolitan Transportation Commission estimates transbay transit ridership will also
follow this growth trend.
Transit currently carries approximately 160,700 BART passengers, 15,200 Alameda Contra Costa Transit
(AC Transit) bus passengers, and 4,900 water transit passengers between the East Bay and San Francisco
(MTC, 2000). By 2025, BART is expected to carry 254,000 daily riders through the Transbay Tube. AC
Transit is expected to carry 19,800 passengers to and from San Francisco, and water transit services are
expected to carry 7,060 passengers. In total, 36 percent of Bay Bridge corridor trips are expected to be on
transit (MTC, 2002).
The projected increased in transbay trips will result in deficiencies in the transportation network as
described below.
Congestion in the I-80/Bay Bridge Corridor

This increase in transbay trips will aggravate travel delay along Interstate 80 (I-80). The California
Department of Transportation’s 2002 Bay Area Freeway Congestion Data indicates that the Eastshore
Freeway currently has a daily delay of 24,550 vehicle hours and 49.0 directional miles of congestion, which
ranks number one for vehicle delay in the regional roadway network. By 2025, the Bay Bridge is expected
to have 73,400 peak-period vehicle hours of delay, extending morning congestion at the Bay Bridge Toll
Plaza from 4 hours to nearly 5 hours (MTC, 2002). The delays on the Bay Bridge and I-80 affect goods
movement, particularly goods traveling to and from the Port of Oakland, as well as auto travel.
Bay Bridge Congestion and Bus Service

AC Transit and carpools are the major alternative means of travel across the Bay Bridge into San
Francisco, and are subject to the traffic delays discussed in the previous paragraph. Installation of highoccupancy vehicle or bus lanes on the Bay Bridge is not currently planned; therefore, increased bus and
carpool delays can be expected through 2025.
BART Transbay Tube Capacity Constraints

BART is expected to accommodate future growth, expected to reach more than 556,000 weekday riders
system wide by 2025 (254,000 of whom would ride through the Transbay Tube), by installing train
control improvements to permit operation at closer headways, and by making other capital investments.
Still, the throughput capacity of the Market Street subway may become constrained due to increased
demand for peak period transbay service over the planning horizon. At that point, substantial capital
investments will have to be made to increase capacity in the Transbay Tube (BART, 2010).
Inadequate Transit Service to Meet Treasure Island Demand

Future transbay capacity for transit and automobiles will also be affected by the proposed redevelopment of
Treasure Island, which will add an estimated 4,600 daily AM peak hour and 6,800 PM peak hour Treasure
Island commuters traveling between Treasure Island and both the East Bay and San Francisco. Of these
weekday peak period trips, 13 percent are expected to be water transit based, 12 percent will be bus based,

Page 1-8

June 2013

Water Emergency Transportation Authority
Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

1.0 Purpose and Need

and the remaining 75 percent are expected to be auto and van based (Fehr & Peers, 2010). The Treasure
Island peak travel demands coincide with the highest volume of traffic on the Bay Bridge. Based on
measures and strategies to handle the travel demand, a significant number of commuters will be reliant on
transit. In terms of transit options, the San Francisco Municipal Railway currently operates three buses to
Treasure Island on Route 108. With the proposed Treasure Island development, expanded San Francisco
Municipal Railway bus service to San Francisco is proposed between the San Francisco Transbay Terminal
and the Treasure Island Transit Hub adjacent to the Treasure Island Ferry Terminal (TICD, 2006). In this
scenario, water transit would supplement bus service and would provide scheduled and emergency service
unimpeded by traffic congestion or disruption on roads and highways or in tunnels.
1.5.2

Water Transit Operations, Circulation and Access Constraints at the San
Francisco Ferry Terminal

In 2035, the Ferry Terminal is projected to serve approximately 32,000 water transit passengers, a
300 percent increase over current ridership levels of approximately 11,200 passengers, accounting for
existing services between San Francisco and Alameda, Oakland, and Vallejo, as well as future planned
water transit services between San Francisco and Antioch, Berkeley, Martinez, Hercules, Redwood City,
Richmond, and Treasure Island (CSI, 2011; CSI, 2012) (see Table 1-2). 1 The projected ridership
increases cannot be adequately accommodated at the Ferry Terminal because of the following current
infrastructure, circulation, and operating deficiencies.
Insufficient Number of Gates and Berthing Facilities to Accommodate New Water Transit Service

Currently the Ferry Terminal has four gates (B, C, D, and E), two of which are used exclusively by
Golden Gate Ferry (C and D). The remaining gates (B and E) to which WETA has access accommodate
14 vessel arrivals per AM peak period (see Table 1-1). The number of AM peak period arrivals for
WETA services 2 is expected to increase to 52 to 57 vessels by 2035 (see Table 1-2). Together, both gates
can safely accommodate only about eight vessel arrivals per hour. Therefore, it would not be feasible to
operate all new services from only the existing gates, because the additional vessel traffic would constrain
the movement of vessels operating into and out of the terminal, increase the risk of accident, and result in
arrival and departure scheduling conflicts (see Figure 1-2).
Inadequate Waiting and Circulation Area for Passengers

Due to expanded water transit service and increased ridership, through-flow and queuing of passengers
accessing the Ferry Terminal is expected to increase by 2035 (see Table 1-2). Passenger waiting and
queuing areas (the existing areas along the Ferry Building promenade and Gates B and E) are not
designed to effectively or safely accommodate this volume of passengers. As shown on Figure 1-3,
certain portions of the existing vessels boarding areas are structurally deficient, and are not expected to
survive a major earthquake (ROMA, 2012). There is a need to upgrade the deck and pile structures in the
Ferry Terminal area to enhance safety, and to ensure that passenger waiting and circulation areas would
not be further restricted, potentially even preventing access to the vessel boarding areas if these structures
should fail. In addition, weather protection and distinct queuing areas for passengers, an objective of the
Phase 1 of the Ferry Terminal planning effort, are not currently provided (see Figure 1-4).

WETA’s ridership model was developed in 2002, and is linked to the regional travel forecasting model maintained by the
Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and to socioeconomic data forecasts published by the Association of Bay Area
Governments. The WETA model was updated in 2011 to include the most recent data available from the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission and the Association of Bay Area Governments for year 2035. The WETA model is documented
in the Draft Final Working Paper Ridership Model Calibration and Validation for the Water Transit Authority, and Draft Final
WETA Model Update and Validation Report, both of which are available from WETA (CSI, 2011; CSI, 2012).
For the purposes of this Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report, the Blue & Gold Fleet service to
Tiburon is included in the totals presented for “Water Emergency Transportation Authority services,” because the Blue &
Gold Fleet service to Tiburon shares Gate B with the Water Emergency Transportation Authority.

1.0 Purpose and Need

Lack of Clearly Designated Pedestrian Connectivity Linkages

Clearly identifiable pedestrian circulation pathways and accompanying wayfinding signage between the
North Basin and South Basin gates and to bus/rail transfer points west of the Ferry Building are lacking.
Existing passenger circulation bottlenecks are created because of the poorly defined pedestrian pathways
and the constrained space along some of those pathways (see Figure 1-5). In some areas of the Ferry
Building, there are conflicts between pedestrian circulation and movement of service delivery vehicles
attempting to access loading areas for the businesses located in the Ferry Building.
1.5.3

Air Quality Management Issues

According to the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, the region is currently in non-compliance
for ozone and particulate matter 2.5 microns in diameter or less (PM2.5) under federal air quality standards
and in non-compliance for ozone, PM2.5, and particulate matter 10 microns in diameter or less (PM10)
under state standards (BAAQMD, 2010). Although the San Francisco Bay Area’s air quality has
improved in recent years, an increase in population and vehicle miles driven between now and 2035 is
expected to increase particulate matter emissions by 20 percent for PM2.5 and 29 percent for PM10 (MTC,
2009). The Bay Area Air Quality Management District regional performance objectives call for
reductions in daily vehicle miles traveled by 10 percent, PM2.5 emissions by 10 percent, PM10 emissions
by 45 percent, and carbon dioxide emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels (MTC, 2009).
Cross-bay water transit service can support San Francisco Bay Area air quality goals by encouraging a
shift from vehicle to water transit usage. The WETA IOP Program EIR, which analyzed increased
regional water transit service, found that an expanded water transit system would result in a net decrease
in nitrous oxide (an ozone precursor), carbon monoxide, and PM10 (WETA, 2003a).
1.5.4

Disaster Response and Recovery

Water transit provides a viable alternative for transporting people around the region when unexpected
and long-term disruption renders other components of the regional transportation system inoperable.
Disastrous events that have disrupted the transportation system have occurred several times during the
past 25 years. For instance, after the Loma Prieta earthquake damaged the San Francisco Bay Bridge,
water transit service using excursion vessels was established to supplement BART service between the
East Bay and San Francisco.
In the event of a disaster, WETA will provide emergency water transportation services during the
response phase, and then restore basic water transit services during the recovery phase of a disaster as
described in the WETA Transition Plan (WETA, 2009). During the response phase, WETA will work to
effectively communicate, coordinate with other agencies, set and meet objectives and timeframes, and
plan its activities by abiding by procedural best practices recognized by local, state, and federal
emergency response organizations.
According to the San Francisco Bay Area Regional Emergency Coordination Plan, in the event of a major
catastrophe, such as a 7.9 magnitude earthquake on the San Andreas Fault, it is estimated that
approximately 296,200 people from San Francisco County will require mass transportation assistance
within the first three days of the event (Cal EMA et al., 2010). In its Preliminary Design Concept Plan,
WETA estimates that additional gates will be needed to accommodate the substantial number of evacuees
in the event of a major catastrophe (ROMA, 2012). In addition to the Golden Gate Ferry gates, five
WETA-operated gates could board 9,000 evacuees per hour. Currently, the two existing WETA gates
have the capacity to board less than half that number of evacuees per hour.

Page 1-17

June 2013

Water Emergency Transportation Authority
Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

1.0 Purpose and Need

The limited availability of berthing facilities will be further constrained by the lack of available staging
areas to assemble, queue, and board crowds of evacuees. Evacuees would be directed into boarding
queues, and as vessels are boarded and depart, subsequent evacuees from The Embarcadero, the adjacent
promenades, or the Ferry Building and other nearby areas would queue to board vessels (ROMA, 2012).
This movement of people attempting to access South Basin gates would be constrained by the open water
(lagoon) south of the Ferry Building. Similarly, the limited circulation area north of the Ferry Building
will impede staging and access to North Basin gates (see Figure 1-6). To accommodate the volume of
people accessing gates during emergencies, the circulation area surrounding the Ferry Building will need
to be expanded with new decking built over open water to Essential Facilities3 standards.
For the recovery phase, WETA will work towards restoration of normal, pre-emergency water transit
services within three days after the disaster. In the event that bridges, highways, and other transportation
facilities become inoperable, WETA may provide additional or expanded service (WETA, 2009).
1.6

PURPOSE OF THE EIS/EIR DOCUMENT

The purpose of the EIS (as required by NEPA) and EIR (as required by CEQA) is to describe, analyze, and
compare the potential environmental impacts of the project alternatives and their implementation. FTA is
the federal lead agency under NEPA, and WETA is the local lead agency under CEQA for the joint NEPA
(EIS)/CEQA (EIR) document. The EIS/EIR analysis is considered as part of the decision-making process.
The EIS/EIR also provides information on the methodologies and assumptions used for the analyses. It
proposes mitigation measures that can minimize the effect of adverse impacts, and may also include
consideration of other decision factors such as costs, technical feasibility, agency statutory mission,
project purpose and need, and study goals and objectives.
When the Draft EIS/EIR is published, agencies and the general public have the opportunity to review and
comment on the Draft EIS/EIR during a formal comment period, which is required for a minimum of
45 days. Public hearings may be held during the comment period. The public comment period begins
upon publication of a Notice of Availability for the Draft EIS/EIR.
During the review period, public comments will be recorded and FTA and WETA will prepare responses
to the comments, which are then incorporated into the Final EIS/EIR. In addition to revisions in the text
that correspond to the comments received, the Final EIS/EIR identifies the lead agency's preferred
alternative and the reasons for selecting this alternative. The release of the Final EIS/EIR is announced
by publishing a Notice of Availability in the Federal Register. A Record of Decision notifies the public
of the alternative that the agency has selected to be carried forward for more detailed engineering and
design and the rationale for that decision. WETA, the local lead agency under CEQA, can certify the EIR
after the Final EIS/EIR is published.

3

As defined by the California Building Code 2010 and International Building Code 2009, Essential Facilities are buildings and
other structures that are intended to remain operational in the event of extreme environmental loading from flood, wind, snow,
or earthquakes.

ALTERNATIVES

The Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project (project) includes two alternatives: the
No Action Alternative, and the Action Alternative under National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
guidelines (No Project and Project under the California Environmental Quality Act [CEQA] guidelines).
These alternatives are described in detail below.
Consistent with the San Francisco Bay Area Water Emergency Transportation Authority (WETA)
Implementation and Operations Plan (IOP) and the Program Environmental Impact Report (EIR) prepared
for the IOP (available at http://watertransit.org/newsInformation/eir.aspx), passenger use of the
Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal) would increase based on the future expansion
of existing services and the implementation of new water transit services (WETA, 2003a; WETA, 2003b).
Total ridership at the Ferry Terminal is projected to increase from approximately 11,200 to 32,150
average weekday passengers, and from 21 to approximately 60 to 68 AM peak-period vessel arrivals by
2035. Of this total, new and existing services provided by WETA are projected to account for 25,700
average weekday passengers and 52 to 57 AM peak-period vessel arrivals at the Ferry Terminal by 2035.
As described in Chapter 1.0, the existing facilities at the Ferry Terminal are inadequate to accommodate
this projected increase in water transit service.
This Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)/EIR addresses facility improvements to the Ferry Terminal
that would accommodate the additional WETA ridership and vessel arrivals anticipated to occur at the
Ferry Terminal by 2035. This document does not address the need for expanded routes and services,
which was planned and analyzed in the IOP and Program EIR for the IOP. In addition, separate
environmental analysis pursuant to NEPA and CEQA will be prepared for each new route, which will
analyze potential impacts at the route origin. Therefore, as described in this EIS/EIR, the No Action
Alternative describes the WETA service that could be accommodated at the existing gates available to
WETA at the Ferry Terminal (Gates B and E), without any changes or improvements. The Action
Alternative describes the project alternative proposed by WETA and the Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) for expanding the Ferry Terminal facilities to accommodate all new and existing WETA services
projected by 2035.
2.1

LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS

In 2003, WETA adopted its IOP, which envisioned the future of water transit in the Bay Area. The IOP
identified new water transit routes that would be developed, and existing services that would be expanded
over a 25-year planning horizon. The Program EIR for the IOP analyzed the potential environmental
consequences of adding new routes and expanding existing services. Since that time, WETA has
progressed with implementing the vision of the IOP and developing new water transit routes. To date,
WETA has completed construction of one new terminal, and is currently developing projects for six new
terminals and water transit routes. Most of the new routes will provide service from East and South Bay
locations to the Ferry Terminal.
One of the new water transit routes would serve the new development proposed at Treasure Island. This
development project, the Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island Redevelopment Plan, which includes
the new water transit service, has undergone a separate environmental review and public involvement
process coordinated by the proposed developer and the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF). The
Draft and Final EIR for the Redevelopment Plan are available via the website: http://www.sfplanning.org.
In conjunction with WETA’s route expansion, the Port of San Francisco (Port) has been developing plans
to improve the Ferry Terminal and the San Francisco Ferry Building (Ferry Building) area as both a
transportation hub and an important public space for the City of San Francisco. After the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake, the Port worked with stakeholders to develop this vision. As described in
R:\13 WETA\DTFX\Draft 0413\2_0 Alternatives.docx

Page 2-1

June 2013

Water Emergency Transportation Authority
Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

2.0 Alternatives

Section 1.4.4, the Port, with the support of its stakeholders, identified a series of near- and long-term
improvements that should be implemented in the Ferry Building area. Some of the improvements were
implemented beginning in 1998 as Phase I of the project.
In 2010, WETA and the Port began working together to implement the remaining improvements
identified for the Ferry Terminal (Phase II). In February 2010, WETA and the Port entered into a
Memorandum of Understanding detailing the goals of the project, and each agency’s roles and
responsibilities. WETA and the FTA are developing the project, as described in this EIS/EIR, in close
cooperation with the Port.
WETA has met extensively with agencies, stakeholders, and community groups to get their input
concerning the preliminary concept design for the project. The preliminary concept design developed by
WETA considered the extensive community input received and was used as the basis for initiating the
environmental review process for the project. Chapter 6.0 details the public and agency coordination
undertaken as a part of the environmental review process for the project.
2.2

NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE

The No Action Alternative maintains the existing Ferry Terminal gate configuration and circulation areas,
including the function, uses, and design of public spaces within the project area. No new gates or
additional boarding capacity would be provided to accommodate new WETA services or the expansion of
existing WETA services as part of the No Action Alternative. Similarly, there would be no
implementation of circulation and boarding improvements to respond to emergency planning
requirements. Increases in passenger and water transit vessel arrivals that could be accommodated with
the existing facilities at the Ferry Terminal would occur as a part of the No Action Alternative.
In addition, as a part of the America’s Cup Project, several of the existing facilities within the project area
will be altered pursuant to the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission’s (BCDC)
Special Area Plan (SAP) amendments adopted in April 2012 (BCDC, 2012). The SAP amendments
require that Pier ½ (and its associated piles) be removed by March 2013. In addition, the SAP
amendments require that the shed on Pier 2—which currently houses a restaurant—be vacated and
removed by March 2015. 1 As of October 2012, Pier ½ had been removed.
This alternative serves as the baseline against which the environmental effects of the Action Alternative
are measured. The impact analysis also includes comparisons to existing conditions, where appropriate.
2.2.1

Existing Water Transit Service on San Francisco Bay

The Ferry Terminal currently serves approximately 11,200 average weekday passengers on six water
transit routes, with approximately 21 AM peak-period vessel arrivals each weekday. Of this total, the
three routes operated by WETA currently serve approximately 5,100 average weekday passengers and
account for 14 AM peak-period vessel arrivals, carrying 1,400 AM peak-period passengers each weekday.
Under the No Action Alternative, all Ferry Terminal water transit services would continue to operate as
they currently do, with the AM peak-period travel occurring generally between 6:30 and 9:00 AM, and
PM peak-period travel occurring between 4:00 and 6:30 PM. All existing routes would continue to
operate from their respective gates, including WETA and Blue & Gold Fleet services at Gates B and E,
and Golden Gate Ferry services at Gates C and D.
Table 1-1 in Chapter 1.0 lists the service providers, and passenger and trip data for each existing route.

1

Prior to the adoption of these Special Area Plan amendments in April 2012, the Special Area Plan required that Pier ½ and
Pier 2 (including the shed) be removed as a part of the Phase II of the Downtown Ferry Terminal Project.

2.2.2

2.0 Alternatives

Limited Expansion of Water Transit Service with Existing Ferry Terminal Facilities

As described in WETA’s approved IOP and Program EIR for the IOP, water transit service is planned to
expand on San Francisco Bay (WETA, 2003b). The expansion includes both increases in passengers and
frequency of existing services (refer to Table 1-2), as well as the development of new water transit routes.
As described in the IOP, the following routes are assumed to be in operation by 2020:








Antioch to San Francisco
Berkeley to San Francisco
Hercules to San Francisco
Martinez to San Francisco
Redwood City to San Francisco
Richmond to San Francisco
Treasure Island to San Francisco

The Program EIR analyzed the cumulative impacts, at a program level, of the development of these
additional routes. As stated in the Program EIR, project-specific environmental assessments will be
conducted for each route to address site-specific issues related to the siting of the new terminals that
would be required for each route at the route’s origin. The destination of each of these new services
would be the Ferry Terminal. Therefore, as a part of the No Project Alternative, these new routes could
still be developed. However, because under the No Action Alternative no improvements would be made
at the Ferry Terminal, the No Action Alternative includes a limited expansion of service (vessel arrivals
and/or passengers) that could be reasonably accommodated by the existing facilities at the Ferry
Terminal. The increase in passengers or vessel arrivals could be associated with expansion of existing
services or the addition of new routes, as would be determined by WETA, based on operational need.
Currently, WETA has access to two gates at the Ferry Terminal: Gate B and Gate E. With the existing
infrastructure, for the purposes of this EIS/EIR, it is assumed that each gate could reasonably and safely
accommodate a maximum of four to five vessel arrivals per hour during peak operations. Based on this
and historical patterns of vessel capacity and ridership fluctuations throughout the day, it is assumed that
existing infrastructure available to WETA at the Ferry Terminal could accommodate up to 7,800
passengers per weekday, 2,500 passengers during the AM peak period, 20 vessel arrivals during the AM
peak period, and a total of 65 vessel arrivals per weekday. This level of water transit service could occur
under the No Action Alternative.
The No Action Alternative retains vehicle circulation and drop-off areas near the Ferry Building, as well
as current circulation patterns for passenger access to the vessel boarding areas. Pedestrian pathways to
boarding locations for San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) bus and streetcar lines and the Amtrak
bus would remain unchanged.
In the event of an emergency, WETA vessels deployed for evacuation purposes would use the existing
two gates at the Ferry Terminal available to WETA (Gates B and E). Existing Ferry Terminal and Ferry
Building areas would be used for staging of evacuees (e.g., areas along The Embarcadero). Should areas
of the Ferry Terminal not built to Essential Facilities standards 2 fail or otherwise cannot be safely
accessed, passengers would need to be staged elsewhere and alternative access to vessels would need to
be provided.

2

As defined by the California Building Code 2010 and the International Building Code 2009, Essential Facilities are buildings
and other structures that are intended to remain operational in the event of extreme environmental loading from flood, wind,
snow, or earthquakes.

ACTION ALTERNATIVE

The Action Alternative is the expansion and improvement of the Ferry Terminal at the Ferry Building to
accommodate the full expansion of water transit service that was described in the IOP, and presented in
Table 1-2. Based on the existing and new water transit services that would be operated by WETA,
ridership on WETA services is projected to increase from 5,100 to 25,700 passengers per weekday by
2035; total AM peak-period WETA vessel arrivals are anticipated to increase from 14 to
approximately 52 to 57, with approximately 181 total vessel arrivals per weekday.
To accommodate the full expansion of water transit service, the Action Alternative includes construction
of three new gates and overwater berthing facilities, in addition to supportive landside improvements,
such as additional passenger waiting and queuing areas and circulation improvements. Figure 2-1 depicts
the project area with the proposed improvements.
The proposed project improvements have been designed to not only meet the purpose and need of
WETA’s expansion plans, but also in keeping with the historical significance of the area and its role as an
important public gathering place in the region. The project has also been designed in close coordination
with the Port, and in consideration of the Port’s objectives for continued improvement of the area,
including expansion of water transit services and preservation of the historic character and three historic
buildings in the project area (the Ferry Building, the Agriculture Building, and Pier 1). The project
elements have been designed to be consistent with the existing character and facilities in the project area
(e.g., the new gates would have the same design as the existing Gates B and E).
The project area encompasses property managed in the public trust by the Port from the south side of
Pier 1 to the north side of Pier 14, and from the Embarcadero Promenade to San Francisco Bay. The
project area includes the Ferry Building, the Ferry Plaza, the Agriculture Building, and Pier 2 (see
Figure 1-1). The project area includes existing water transit facilities (Gates B, C, D, and E), a variety of
commercial uses (retail, dining, and office), and public open spaces.
As described in Section 2.2, No Action Alternative, as a part of the America’s Cup Project, several of the
existing facilities within the project area will be altered. These alterations would be completed prior to
implementation of WETA’s proposed project; therefore, the project improvements described in this
EIS/EIR are those improvements that would be required after demolition of these facilities as a part of the
America’s Cup Project.
The project includes demolition, removal, repair, and replacement of existing facilities, as well as
construction of new facilities in the project area. The Ferry Terminal can generally be divided into the
North Basin (areas north of the Ferry Plaza) and South Basin (areas south of the Ferry Plaza) (see
Figure 2-1). The project includes the following elements:


Removal of portions of existing deck and pile construction and fendering (portions would remain as
open water, and other portions would be replaced);



Construction of one new gate and access pier (Gate A) in the North Basin and two new gates (Gates F
and G) in the South Basin; and



Improved passenger boarding areas, amenities, and circulation, including rebuilding a portion of the
marginal wharf in the North Basin; extending the East Bayside Promenade along Gates E, F, and G;
strengthening the South Apron of the Agriculture Building; creating the Embarcadero Plaza; and
installing weather protection canopies for passenger queuing.

The project elements are described in detail in the following sections and summarized in Table 2-1.

The proposed project would be located at the existing Ferry Terminal, and would not require new or
additional onsite safety and security measures beyond what is described in this section (e.g., locked gates,
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)-accessible ramps, lighting of floats and circulation areas).
Implementation of the proposed project improvements would result in a change in the amount and type of
fill in San Francisco Bay. Table 2-2 summarizes the changes in fill for both the North Basin and South
Basin.
2.3.1

Removal of Existing Facilities

In the South Basin, Pier 2 is approximately 15,200 square feet in area, and consists of deck and pile
structures. 3 Pier 2 is designated for removal in BCDC’s Special Area Plan (BCDC, 2000), and the Port
has determined that the substructure is also in need of repair. Accordingly, as part of the project, the
following structures would be removed in the South Basin, as shown on Figure 2-2:

A restaurant (approximately 6,000 square feet) is currently located on the eastern side of Pier 2, and will be removed as a part
of the America’s Cup Project by March 2015.

Notes:
1
Replacement fill refers to areas where fill was demolished and then rebuilt. Replacement fill is not considered in the calculation of the net change in fill, which
equals the area of new fill less the area of fill demolished. Not all fill removed will be replaced.
2
Net fill is calculated as new fill less the area of fill demolished.
3
Fill in San Francisco Bay is defined as any structure placed in the water column of San Francisco Bay (e.g., piles).
4
For piles that would be removed, it was conservatively assumed all piles are only 24 inches in diameter.
5
For new piles that would support deck structures, a combination of 24-inch and 36-inch piles would be used. For the purposes of this Environmental Impact
Statement/Environmental Impact Report, it was assumed that 75 percent of the piles would be 24 inches in diameter, and 25 percent would be 36 inches in diameter.
6
A portion of the new fill for piles that support pier deck would be considered replacement fill. However, for the purposes of this Environmental Impact
Statement/Environmental Impact Report, the square footage for replacement fill for piles has not been calculated. This would be determined during final project design.
7
Floating Fill is defined as any structure that floats or is moored on the water surface (e.g., gate float)
8
Shadow Fill is defined as any structure placed over the water that casts shadow on the water (e.g., pier deck)
9
A portion of the Gate A Access Pier would replace portions of Pier ½ that were demolished as a part of the America’s Cup Project.
10
In the South Basin, the existing access to Gate E (approximately 4,250 square feet) and an area west of the seawall (approximately 4,500 square feet) would be
resurfaced (refer to Figure 2-4).

Pier 2 would be demolished and removed (including approximately 15,200 square feet of existing
deck structure); and
Approximately 5,300 square feet of the existing deck and piles, west of Pier 2, would be removed so
that the structures can be replaced with a new structure that meets Essential Facilities standards.

2.3.2

Gate Facilities

Three new gates would be constructed, comprising fixed access piers and berthing structures (floats,
gangways, guide piles, dolphin piles [piles with donut-shaped impact resistant foam that rise and fall with
the tides], and fendering). Each of the three gates (Gates A, F, and G) would be built similarly, in the
locations shown on Figure 2-1. Each gate would be designed with an entrance portal—a prominent
doorway providing passenger information and physically separating the berthing structures from the
surrounding area. The entrance portal would also contain doors, which can be secured. The new gates
would match the design of the existing Gates B and E, but with wider door openings and with floats
constructed of concrete or steel.
Gate A Access Pier
Due to its location, Gate A would require the construction of a 30-foot-wide, 265-foot-long pier to
provide access to the berthing facilities. The pier structure would be supported by approximately 40 piles,
each 24 to 36 inches in diameter and spaced 12 to 16 feet apart. 4 The piles would be precast concrete or
steel. The piles would be 135 to 140 feet long, would be driven approximately 125 to 130 feet below
mean lower low water (MLLW) through the mud into the sand layer, and would extend 7.5 to 11 feet
above MLLW. The pier structure would be designed to appropriate weight and loading requirements, and
would be built to meet Essential Facilities standards. The Gate A Access Pier deck would be constructed
on the piles, using a system of beam and flat slab concrete construction, similar to what has been built in
the Ferry Building area. The beam and slab construction would be either precast or cast-in-place concrete
(or a combination of the two), and approximately 2.5 feet thick.
As shown on Figure 2-1, similar access piers would not be required for Gates F and G, because the new
berthing structures for Gates F and G would be connected directly to the East Bayside Promenade. The
East Bayside Promenade is discussed in Section 2.3.3.
Berthing Structures: Float, Gangway, Guide and Dolphin Piles, and Fendering
Berthing structures—consisting of floats, gangways, guide and dolphin piles, and fendering—would be
provided for each new gate. Figure 2-3 depicts a conceptual rendering of the berthing structures. The
concrete or steel floats would be approximately 45 feet wide by 115 feet long. The steel truss gangways
would be approximately 12 to 14 feet wide and 92 feet long. The gangway would be designed to rise and
fall with tidal variations while meeting ADA requirements. The gangway and the float would be
designed with canopies, consistent with the current design of Gates B and E.
Each berthing structure would require guide piles and dolphin piles. As with the piles for the pier
structure, the piles for the berthing structure would all be driven approximately 125 to 130 feet below
MLLW through the mud into the underlying sand layer for support. Each guide pile would be steel,
42 inches in diameter and would extend 18 feet above MLLW. Six guide piles would be required to
secure each concrete float in place. Dolphin piles would be used at each berthing structure to protect
against the collision of vessels with other structures or vessels. The dolphin piles would also be steel,
36 inches in diameter, would extend 20 to 25 feet above MLLW. For Gate A, it is assumed that 10
dolphin piles may be required; for Gates F and G, a total of up to 14 dolphin piles may be installed.

Pile spacing is measured from the center of each pile.

2.0 Alternatives

In addition to the dolphin piles, chock block fendering would be added, where required, to adjacent
structures to protect against collision. The chock block fendering would consist of square 12-inch-wide
pressure-treated wood blocks that are connected along the side of the adjacent pier structure, and
supported by round 14-inch-diameter wood piles that are 64 feet long and placed 10 feet apart. For
Gate A, the existing fendering along the edge of Pier 1 could be removed and replaced with new
fendering. During the final design of the project, the existing fendering along the edge of Pier 1 would be
inspected to determine whether replacement is necessary. For Gates F and G, the existing fendering along
the south edge of the Ferry Plaza and adjacent to Gate E would be maintained. New fendering would be
constructed along the East Bayside Promenade.
2.3.3

Passenger Boarding and Circulation Areas, and Amenities

In addition to providing new water transit gates, the project would improve passenger boarding and
circulation areas in the project area. Figure 2-4 depicts the structural improvements proposed within the
project area. As described in Section 1.5.2, Purpose and Need, improvements are needed because there
are currently circulation bottlenecks and use conflicts between water transit passengers, users of the Ferry
Building, and delivery vehicles.
Table 2-3 summarizes the areas needed for passenger queuing at each gate.

Note: Queuing area assumes 7 to 10 square feet per passenger, and 15 to 20 square feet for passengers with
bicycles (ROMA, 2012).

The improvements described in this section are intended to ensure that water transit passengers for
WETA’s existing and new gates have adequate areas to queue while waiting to board their vessel, without
causing congestion and use conflicts with the other activities in the project area. Additional bike rack
space would be provided in proximity to each of the new gates.
North Basin Marginal Wharf
At the western edge of Gate A, where the new fixed pier connects with the Embarcadero Promenade, an
85-foot-long segment of the marginal wharf would be repaired and strengthened to provide a contiguous
edge between the new Gate A Access Pier and the Ferry Building Area (see Figure 2-4). The northern
portion of the marginal wharf (north of the new Gate A) and a portion of the marginal wharf closest the
Ferry Building (north of the existing Gate B) were both previously improved by the Port. As a part of this
project, the remaining marginal wharf would be repaired and strengthened. The repair work would
involve strengthening the 12 existing piles supporting the deck structure, and the rebuilding of the deck
structure. The rebuilt deck structure would be constructed using beams and slab. The new decking would
be approximately 18 inches above grade to match the grade of the portion of the marginal wharf recently
improved by the Port, and would also include new guardrails.
A conceptual rendering of the North Basin with the project improvements is shown on Figure 2-5.

Embarcadero Plaza, East Bayside Promenade, South Apron of the Agriculture Building
In the South Basin, the following improvements would be made to provide for improved passenger
circulation, as shown on Figure 2-4:




Creation of an Embarcadero Plaza;
Extension of the East Bayside Promenade; and
Improvement of the South Apron of the Agriculture Building.

A new Embarcadero Plaza would be created in the South Basin, forming a new continuous plaza area
between the Agriculture Building and the Ferry Building where there is currently a small open water area.
The new Embarcadero Plaza would be built to meet Essential Facilities standards, because it would be
needed to support queuing and circulation needs for evacuation purposes in the event of an emergency.
The Embarcadero Plaza would require new deck and pile construction to fill an open water area and
replace subgrade structures. The Embarcadero Plaza would be designed to meet ADA-required slopes
and stormwater drainage requirements, and to conform to existing elevations of the Embarcadero
Promenade, Ferry Building, and Gate E. Features and design treatments such as seatwalls, steps, bicycle
racks, planters, and other furnishings would be incorporated into the final design.
To the east and south of the Embarcadero Plaza, the project would expand the East Bayside Promenade
approximately 460 feet in length to provide a 30-foot-wide connection along Gates E, F, and G. The
eastern edge of the Promenade would include a guardrail. The extension of the Promenade would require
installation of piles and new decking.
The construction of the Embarcadero Plaza and East Bayside Promenade would require installation of
approximately 210 piles, each 24 to 36 inches in diameter and 135 to 145 feet in length. As with the pier
structures, the piles would be precast concrete or steel. The new deck would be concrete, either precast or
cast in place (or a combination of the two), and approximately 2.5 feet thick.
The South Apron of the Agriculture Building would be upgraded to temporarily support access for
construction and improve passenger circulation. The improvements would include construction of steps
and an ADA-accessible ramp to meet the grade of the improved East Bayside Promenade, as well as a
guard rail along its edge. It is anticipated that the South Apron would be fully replaced and rebuilt when
the Agriculture Building eventually undergoes rehabilitation and renovation as a separate project.
A conceptual rendering of the South Basin with the project improvements is shown on Figure 2-6.
Weather Protection Canopies
In the North Basin, a weather protection canopy structure would be constructed to span the length of the
new Gate A Access Pier, as shown on Figure 2-5. The structure would provide weather protection and
information for queuing and waiting passengers. The weather protection canopy structures would be
approximately 20 feet wide, 200 feet long, 18 to 20 feet high, and constructed of steel, glass, and could
include photovoltaic cells. Features of the weather protection canopy structure would include lighting,
passenger information, and benches. A weather protection canopy structure, similar in design to Gate A,
would also be constructed along the north edge of the Ferry Building to provide weather protection for
passengers queuing at the existing Gate B.
In the South Basin, a similar water protection canopy structure would be constructed along the East
Bayside Promenade, perpendicular to Gates E, F, and G, as shown on Figure 2-6. This canopy would be
approximately 420 feet long and 24 feet wide.

Circulation Improvements

The project would also include improvements to circulation in the Ferry Building area.
In the North Basin, the canopy installed for Gate B would serve to organize the queuing of passengers
waiting to board a vessel along the north railing, allowing other users of the Ferry Building area to pass
through that area unimpeded.
In the South Basin, the East Bayside Promenade and associated canopy would also serve to organize
passenger queuing and reduce use conflicts. The creation of the Embarcadero Plaza would greatly enhance
passenger circulation to Gates E, F, and G, allowing free movement, and eliminating the current pedestrian
bottlenecks and use conflicts at the southeastern corner of the Ferry Building. Figure 2-7 depicts the paths
of anticipated pedestrian circulation through the project area. Because the project would improve pedestrian
flow, pedestrian congestion in the fire lane would be reduced, ensuring that emergency access is maintained.
The project would change pedestrian circulation patterns in the project area; however, vehicular access
would remain unchanged. Delivery trucks and emergency and maintenance vehicles would maintain their
current access to the Ferry Plaza area, south of the Ferry Building. The project would not affect the Ferry
Plaza function or access. All project improvements would occur within areas directly controlled by the
Port, and would not affect, encroach upon, or modify any property or access to property under the control
of other entities, including rights-of-way in the project area. The improvements along the northern edge
of the Ferry Building would be located within an existing maintenance easement for the Ferry Building
held by Equity Office Partners (the leaseholder for the Ferry Building); responsibility for maintenance of
the new facilities would be set forth in a Site Maintenance Plan developed by the Port and WETA in
coordination with Equity Office Partners; refer to Section 2.3.6, Site Maintenance.
In addition to the physical changes relating to circulation around the Ferry Terminal, the project would include
passenger wayfinding and information signage at various places throughout the project area, providing clear
information for passengers arriving at and departing from Downtown San Francisco. The wayfinding signage
program would also be designed to provide information for passengers arriving in San Francisco regarding the
location of other transit links (i.e., Bay Area Rapid Transit, Muni, or Amtrak). Wayfinding signage would also
include directions for cyclists to walk on the water side of The Embarcadero, to improve safety and reduce
conflicts. The future water transit services would operate in accordance with the Transit Transfer Agreements
in place between WETA and the other transit providers at the time of operation.
2.3.5

Design Considerations

The following elements would also be incorporated into the project design.
Sea Level Rise
The ground floor of the Ferry Building is built to an approximate elevation of 11.8 feet above MLLW.
This elevation could accommodate approximately 2.5 feet of anticipated sea level rise above the still
water level 5 of 9.2 feet resulting from a 100-year storm event, should that event occur in the near future
(Moffatt & Nichol, 2012). The still water level for the 100-year storm, should it occur in 2050, is
estimated to be 10.5 feet (MLLW), taking into account a predicted sea level rise of 16 inches by 2050.
Gates B and E are built to 11.4 feet and 11.8 feet above MLLW, respectively. The new gates would be
built at 13 to 13.5 feet above MLLW, which would accommodate approximately 3 to 4 feet of anticipated
sea level rise above a 100-year storm event of 9.2 to 10.5 feet (MLLW), should such an event occur
during the 50-year design life of the new gates, and would conform to the existing elevations of the
project area to meet drainage and ADA accessibility requirements.
5

The still water level is the water level that includes tides and storm surge. The still water level does not include waves and wave run-up.

Stormwater Management
Stormwater runoff in the project area currently drains directly to San Francisco Bay. As a part of project
final design, WETA would develop a stormwater management plan, in compliance with CCSF and the
Port’s stormwater management guidelines. The preliminary project design for new construction includes
several bioretention planters that would filter stormwater before it enters San Francisco Bay. Bioretention
planters or media filters could be used to filter stormwater. The decision on the specific type, design, and
location of stormwater filters within the project area would be determined during final design in
coordination with the Port and the permitting agencies.
For the purposes of this EIS/EIR, both types of treatment are described and will be considered in the
analysis of the project. Bioretention planters—each approximately 3 feet in width and 3 feet in depth, and
composed of 1½ feet of bioretention soil mix and 1 foot of drainage rock—would provide for ½ foot of
ponding. Planters would be placed so that their bottoms are above the highest estimated tide. Planters
could be located along the south side of the new Gate A Access Pier to capture stormwater from the new
pier, and along the East Bayside Promenade to capture runoff from the new promenade.
The Embarcadero Plaza would be designed to drain predominantly to the west (to conform to the grade
changes in the project area). Along the northern and western edges of the plaza area, a seismic joint would
also be required. This joint would be designed to allow seismic movement and could also be designed to
convey water for stormwater treatment to a media filter (sand filter). Alternatively, a landscaped stormwater
bioretention and water quality treatment area adjacent to the promenade and the Pier 14 breakwater could be
installed to treat stormwater from the Embarcadero Plaza before it enters San Francisco Bay.
Green Building
The project would incorporate green building approaches to the design of the new facilities in several key
ways. It may be constructed as a zero net energy project, which would be achieved through the use of
photovoltaic cells incorporated into the canopies at Gates A, B, E, F, and G (see the Lighting and Utilities
subsection of Section 2.3.6, Operating Elements). In addition, the project is designed in response to state,
regional, and local standards for stormwater management and water quality, and would also include
sustainable construction materials and methods, as required by the San Francisco Green Building
Ordinance, Chapter 13 of the San Francisco Building Code.
Architectural Considerations
The preliminary design of the project was developed in coordination with the Port, and in consideration of
the input of various interested parties (community groups, businesses in the project area, and agencies
with jurisdiction in the project area). As discussed previously, the project area serves as an important
public space in San Francisco. The project’s location between San Francisco Bay and the Downtown
urban core and within an area with historic significance were all considered in the project design, to
develop a design that not only met WETA’s objectives but also blended into and complemented the
context of the site. Details regarding the final design of the proposed project (e.g., colors, textures, and
finishes) would be developed through the design review process (refer to Section 2.6).
2.3.6

Operating Elements

As described in Chapter 1.0 and Table 1-2, new WETA services are anticipated to begin operations
between 2015 and 2020. This section describes elements of the proposed project’s operation, including
implementation phasing and vessel characteristics, and information on the navigation, dredging and
lighting, and utility requirements for the new gates. Refer to Table 1-2 for service frequencies and future
year ridership projections for the new and existing WETA services.

WETA Implementation Plan for San Francisco Ferry Terminal Service
WETA has developed an implementation plan for operating its new and existing services at the Ferry
Terminal. The plan describes the services that would be operated at each gate and confirms that
adequate berthing and circulation capacity would be provided. Anticipated gate locations were
determined for each service based on projected ridership, service frequency, queuing and boarding
needs, navigational concerns, and dredging requirements. Anticipated service start dates were also
considered in determining gate location for each service, in order to accommodate a strategy for phased
construction of the project.
In the North Basin, WETA plans to operate the existing Vallejo service and new services to Berkeley and
Richmond at the existing Gate B and new Gate A. It is also assumed that Blue & Gold Fleet would
continue to operate its Tiburon service in the North Basin. Under this scenario, Gates A and B would
support a projected total of 6,400 daily passengers, 2,500 AM peak-period passengers, and 19 to 20 AM
peak-period vessel arrivals. The Berkeley and Richmond services could begin operations as early as
2015, at which point the proposed North Basin improvements would be required. In the long term, the
North Basin can also accommodate other North Bay routes such as Hercules, Antioch, and Martinez,
supporting a projected total of 8,000 daily passengers by 2035.
In the South Basin, WETA plans to operate the existing Alameda/Oakland and Alameda Harbor Bay
services from the new Gate F, and new service to Treasure Island from the existing Gate E. In the long
term, Gate F would accommodate a projected total of 6,700 daily passengers, 2,000 AM peak-period
passengers, and 15 AM peak vessel arrivals for the Alameda/Oakland and Alameda Harbor services by
2035. Gate E would accommodate 10,750 daily passengers, 2,400 AM peak-period passengers, and 10
AM peak-period arrivals for the Treasure Island service at build-out. Gate G would accommodate the
Redwood City services and provide spare berthing capacity to accommodate emergency evacuations,
guest or visiting vessels, layover berthing, and the ability to maintain operations should an existing berth
be taken out of service for maintenance or repair. In addition, Gate G could serve other Central or North
Bay routes, as operational needs require. The services that would be accommodated in the South Basin
are anticipated to begin operations between 2017 and 2020, at which point the South Basin improvements
would be required.
As described, based on current planning and operating assumptions, WETA would not require all three
new gates (Gates A, F, and G) to support existing and new services until 2020. As a result, WETA is
planning that project construction would be phased. The first phase would involve construction of Gate A
and all related improvements in the North Basin, as the initial expansion services developed by WETA
(Berkeley and Richmond routes) would be operated in the North Basin. The second phase would include
construction of Gates F and G, as well as other related improvements in the South Basin. This work
could commence as early as 2017 to support operations of the Treasure Island service. If necessary,
WETA could begin construction of some North and South Basin improvements simultaneously. Refer to
Section 2.4.6 for more information on the construction schedule.
While certain gate locations have been assumed for particular services, the project would be designed to
ensure maximum operational and implementation flexibility. For instance, the project would include
standardized berthing facilities at each new gate that would be capable of accommodating all WETA
vessel types, thus allowing WETA to interchangeably operate any service from any gate, as conditions or
phased construction of the project requires.
The project improvements would not require operational staff to be located at the Ferry Terminal. All
current and future WETA vessels will be stocked and serviced at other terminal locations. Vessel crews
would also board in the outlying terminal locations.

The vessels for WETA’s services use U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and California
Air Resources Board Tier 2–compliant clean diesel engines, which emit approximately 25 to 30 percent
less reactive organic gas, oxides of nitrogen (NOX), and particulate matter less than 10 microns in
diameter (PM10) than current diesel engines. In addition, add-on control devices such as selective
catalytic reduction and particulate traps would further reduce NOX and PM10 emissions to 10 percent and
5 percent, respectively, of U.S. EPA Tier 2 levels. The development of electrically powered vessel
technology has not reached the stage where it has been proven that such vessels can practically and costeffectively provide service on commuter routes. WETA will continue to evaluate technologies that would
further reduce emissions.
Vessel Navigation and Berthing
To ensure safe navigation in and around the Ferry Terminal for existing and new water transit services,
vessel routes would be managed to avoid cross traffic. Generally, the North Basin (Gates A and B) would
be used by WETA for routes to and from the northern portion of San Francisco Bay (Vallejo, Tiburon,
Berkeley, Richmond, Hercules, Martinez, and Antioch). The South Basin would be used for WETA
routes originating in the central and southern portion of San Francisco Bay (Alameda/Oakland, Alameda
Harbor Bay, Treasure Island, and Redwood City). The proposed facilities would not impede the ability of
other users in the project area (e.g., Golden Gate Transit [GGT], the Bay Area Rapid Transit [BART], or
emergency responders) to access their facilities from the water side.
Vessel navigation would be planned and carried out in accordance with U.S. Coast Guard notification,
regulations and guidance pertaining to safety. WETA would provide the U.S. Coast Guard with
information pertaining to project construction and operations that could impact navigation. The
U.S. Coast Guard issues “Notices to Mariners,” relating information to the public on potential navigation
issues (e.g., a construction project in the water).
Maintenance Dredging Requirements
Based on observed patterns of sediment accumulation in the Ferry Terminal area, significant sediment
accumulation would not be expected, because regular maintenance dredging is not currently required to
maintain operations at existing Gates B and E. However, some dredging would likely be required on a
regular maintenance cycle beneath the floats at Gates F and G, due to their proximity to the Pier 14
breakwater. It is expected that this minor maintenance dredging would be required at Gates F and G
every 3 to 4 years, and would require removal of approximately 5,000 to 10,000 cubic yards of material.
It is not anticipated that a regular maintenance cycle of dredging would be required at Gate A.

Dredging and disposal of dredged materials would be conducted in cooperation with the San Francisco
Dredged Material Management Office, to comply with the requirements of the Dredging – Dredge Material
Reuse/Disposal permit that would be issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Requirements would
include development of a sampling plan, sediment characterization, and a sediment removal plan; and disposal
in accordance with the Long-Term Management Strategy for San Francisco Bay to ensure beneficial reuse, as
appropriate.
Lighting and Utility Requirements
Each berthing facility would be designed with lighting similar to what is used on the floats and gangways
at Gate B and Gate E—internal lighting fixtures that project light onto the roof of the existing canopies,
creating a glow that produces enough light for pedestrian safety and security. Lighting integrated with the
new canopy design would be installed along the public circulation and access areas. Some additional
pedestrian-scale lighting would also be provided within the Embarcadero Plaza. The lighting would be
similar in fixture size and light levels to what is currently used in the Ferry Building area.
The total energy requirements for the additional lighting, communications, security, and hydraulic ramps
would be approximately 140,000 kilowatt hours per year (ROMA, 2012). To offset this demand, the
weather protection canopies constructed along the Gate A Access Pier, Gate B queuing area, and
perpendicular to Gates E, F, and G could be designed with photovoltaic cells. The energy generated from
the photovoltaics would be expected to exceed the energy demand for the project lighting.
Approximately 200,000 kilowatt hours could be generated on site. The preliminary design of the project
improvements includes the photovoltaic cells. The decision on whether the photovoltaic cells would be
constructed would be made during the project’s final design phase, based partly on public and agency
input received on the EIS/EIR.
Emergency power would be required onsite and would be provided by a centrally located generator
serving the Port and WETA facilities. The exact size and location of the generator would be determined
in consultation with the Port.
In addition, a small amount of potable water would be required at each gate and would be provided by
CCSF.
Site Maintenance
WETA and the Port would develop a Site Maintenance Plan prior to project initiation. The Plan would
designate responsibility and a schedule for regular maintenance and cleaning of the new facilities (e.g.,
canopies), as well as general site maintenance activities (e.g., wash-down; litter removal and trash receptacle
management; lighting and landscape management). For any new facilities along the northern edge of the Ferry
Building, the Site Maintenance Plan would also be coordinated with Equity Office Partners, who currently
have maintenance responsibilities in that area through their lease and management of the Ferry Building.
2.3.7

Emergency Planning

Along with the project goal of expanding and improving water transit facilities to meet existing and
projected ridership demand for commuter services, the project would also improve facilities that would
support emergency operations when unexpected and long-term disruption renders other components of
the regional transportation system inoperable.
WETA’s emergency planning includes developing scenarios for evacuation. For a large evacuation,
WETA could operate up to six 299-passenger vessels per hour from each of its gates. Therefore, the
existing and new gates (Gates A, B, E, F, and G) would have a total emergency evacuation capacity of up
to 9,000 passengers per hour.

The passengers would be queued at WETA’s existing and new gates, as well as in the circulation areas
that would be created in the North and South Basin as a part of the project. In the North Basin,
approximately 12,000 square feet built to Essential Facilities standards would be available for passenger
staging. In the South Basin, a total of approximately 38,100 square feet built to Essential Facilities
standards would be available for emergency response and passenger staging (approximately
26,500 square feet in the Embarcadero Plaza, and 11,600 square feet in the East Bayside Promenade).
2.4

CONSTRUCTION METHODS

This section describes the methods that would be used for demolition, construction of piers and berthing
structures, and circulation improvements. Construction activities would commence as early as 2014. In
addition, this section describes the construction staging, equipment staffing, and schedule. The
information provided is based on the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Design Concept Plan
(ROMA, 2012). During final design, additional construction method detail would be developed related to
all construction aspects.
General best management practices for pollution prevention and construction management would be
employed during construction. For example, best management practices would include activities such as
maintaining a clean and orderly construction site, and erecting wayfinding signage to assist water transit
passengers and other users of the project area in navigating the project area. In addition, WETA would
notify residents and businesses near the project area of planned construction, and would establish a point
of contact for public questions or concerns.
2.4.1

Demolition Methods, Disposal, and Duration

Demolition of existing deck and pile structures, as described in Section 2.2, would be conducted from
barges. Two barges would be required, one for materials storage and one outfitted with demolition
equipment (crane, clamshell bucket for pulling of piles, and excavator for removal of the deck). Diesel
power tug boats would bring the barges to the project area, where they would be anchored.
Piles would be removed by either cutting them off below the mud line or pulling the pile. The demolition
waste from these activities would be disposed of at the nearest waste and recycling facility. Piles that
have been treated with creosote, or that contain other potentially hazardous substances, would be handled
properly and disposed of at a facility permitted to handle hazardous waste.
It is estimated that demolition activities would generate approximately 4,720 cubic yards of waste.
Demolition activities in the South Basin would take approximately 2 months. Demolition methods are
summarized in Table 2-5.

Duration

4 months for structural work; 5 months for surface improvements

The structural deck would be constructed on top of the piles. Rebar cages for the pile connections and
concrete would be delivered by truck and installed on the piles at the site. The concrete deck would be
precast, cast-in-place, or a combination of both methods. If a precast deck is used, the precast segments
would be delivered on barges and placed on steel falsework. A cast-in-place deck would require
formwork as well as falsework, and more extensive concrete delivery by truck during construction.
A topping slab would be installed on the structural deck. It would be composed of a concrete mix of an
architectural quality similar to that in the area of the Ferry Building. The passenger facilities, amenities,
and public space improvements—such as the entrance portal, weather protection canopy structures,
lighting, guardrails, and furnishings—would be surface-mounted on the access pier after the new
construction is complete. The weather protection canopy and entrance portal would be constructed off
site, delivered to the site, craned into place by barge, and assembled on site. The glazing materials,
cladding materials, unit pavers, guardrails, and furnishings would be delivered to the site via truck and
assembled on site. Once completed, the structural pier for Gate A would be used for material storage and
for construction staging, in addition to material and construction barges.
The weather protection canopy structure for Gate B would be constructed in the same manner as
described above for the Gate A weather protection canopy structure.
Berthing Structures
The berthing structures for Gates A, F, and G consist of concrete or steel floats, steel gangways, guide
piles, and dolphin piles. The berthing structures would be fabricated off site and floated to the project

Embarcadero Plaza, East Bayside Promenade, South Apron of the Agriculture Building
A new Embarcadero Plaza and East Bayside Promenade would be constructed in the South Basin. These
new deck and pile areas would use the methods and materials described above for the Gate A pier
structure. The piles would be either precast concrete or steel, and the decking would be either cast in
place or precast.
In the South Basin, the South Apron of the Agriculture Building would also be repaired and strengthened.
Work would include installation of elements such as new railing, ramps, and steps.
The passenger facilities, amenities, and public space improvements—such as the entrance portals, canopy
structures, lighting, guardrails, and furnishings—would be surface-mounted on the pier structures after

the Agriculture Building.

2.4.3

Dredging Requirements

The side-loading vessels that would be used at Gates A, F, and G (see Section 2.3.5 for more information
on the vessel characteristics) would require a depth of 10 feet below MLLW on the approach and in the
berthing area. The floats would require water depth of 12 feet below MLLW. The most recent available
bathymetry survey data for the Ferry Terminal basin shows that existing depths in the berthing areas
range from between 8 and 10 feet below MLLW at Gates F and G, and between 7 and 10 feet below
MLLW at Gate A (Moffatt & Nichol, 2012).

The expected dredging volumes are presented in Table 2-10. These estimates are based on dredging the
approach areas to 12 feet below MLLW for Gates A, F, and G, and over-dredging by 2 feet, which is the
industry practice. Figure 2-8 depicts the area that would be dredged for each gate. The dredging for Gates A
would take approximately 1 month, and the dredging for Gates F and G would take approximately 2 months.

Dredging and disposal of dredged materials would be conducted in cooperation with the San Francisco
Dredged Material Management Office, to comply with the requirements of the Dredging – Dredge
Material Reuse/Disposal permit that would be issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Requirements would include development of a sampling plan, sediment characterization, a sediment
removal plan, and disposal in accordance with the Long-Term Management Strategy for San Francisco
Bay to ensure beneficial reuse, as appropriate.
2.4.4

Construction Utility Requirements

Night work is not anticipated, so minimal lighting, if any, would be required. Onsite power could be
provided by the Port during construction. Generators for equipment operation could also be required, and
would be located on the construction barges and on the landside structural improvements when
completed.
2.4.5

Construction Staging

Figure 2-9 depicts the areas within the project area that would be affected by construction activities,
including demolition, construction of project elements, material and equipment storage, and staging.
Construction staging would be located within areas managed by the Port that are not within other lease
boundaries.
As discussed above, due to the lack of potential landside construction staging and access areas in the
Ferry Building area, the majority of demolition and construction would be staged and conducted from
barges. The barges would be approximately 60 feet by 130 feet, and the number of barges required would
vary by the stage of construction, as described for each element below. Two types of barges would be
used: equipment barges and material barges. The equipment barges are outfitted with large cranes and
other types of equipment (e.g., clamshell dredge, excavator) that operate from the barge. The barges are
towed into place by diesel powered tugboats and anchored where needed. Tugboats would also be
required to move the barge as necessary during construction. Barges and construction equipment to be
used in the water would be sourced from areas within San Francisco Bay.
Once completed, the Gate A access pier and the Embarcadero Plaza would be used for staging of
equipment, materials, and supplies during construction of the following project elements:

Extending utilities;
Placement of gate and canopy structures, including cladding of gate and glazing of canopy;
Topping slab; and
Placement of ticket machines, railings, lighting, signage, and bioretention planters.

Two or three vehicle parking spaces could be provided on site during construction within the areas shown
on Figure 2-9 as the construction zone. No other landside staging area would be required for project
demolition or construction.
For concrete and other materials delivered by truck, the curbside areas between the Ferry Building and
Pier 1 and between the Ferry Building and the Agriculture Building would be used.
The existing water transit and retail/commercial services at the Ferry Terminal would remain open and
operational during construction. Ingress and egress to the existing gates and businesses would be
maintained during construction, along with access to other facilities on the Ferry Plaza. Appropriate
wayfinding signage would be posted as necessary. Existing vehicular access for the fire lane would be
maintained. Additionally, BART’s evacuation route on the Ferry Plaza would be maintained during
construction. The construction zone would not block or prevent passage along The Embarcadero. A
detailed construction staging plan would be developed during final design that would delineate clear
routes for existing water transit passengers and users of the Ferry Building.
2.4.6

General Construction Schedule

Construction would be conducted in accordance with CCSF Construction Ordinance, 7:00 AM to
8:00 PM, 7 days a week. The construction schedule would be dependent on several variables: what type
of piles and construction methods would be used for the decking (i.e., cast in place or precast); and the
schedule under which the new services become operational. For the purposes of this Draft EIS/EIR, it is
assumed that improvements in the North Basin could be constructed simultaneously with the
improvements in the South Basin. Refer to Section 2.3.6 for more detail on project phasing
considerations.
The improvements in the North Basin could be constructed within 14 months, as shown on Figure 2-10;
many of the construction activities (dredging, Gate A Pier construction, Gate A berthing structure
installation, Marginal Wharf Repair, Gate A and Gate B canopy installation, and site finishing work)
would overlap. In the South Basin, construction could be completed within 24 months. Several phases of
the South Basin construction (demolition, dredging, construction of Embarcadero Plaza, South Apron of
the Agriculture Building improvements, construction of the East Bayside Promenade, installation of the
berthing structures, installation of the canopies, and site finishing work) would also overlap.
2.4.7

Construction Deliveries and Staffing

Materials and equipment would be delivered both by barge and by truck. Piles, precast decking, steel
frame access gates, steel canopies, steel beams, and temporary falsework would also be delivered to the
site by barge. Trucks would be required for delivery of concrete, timber framing and falsework, granite
paving, glazing for canopies, lighting, signage, ticket machines, benches, plumbing, and other supplies.
The majority of deliveries by truck would be for delivery of the concrete. In the North Basin,
approximately 77 trucks would be required for concrete delivery, and 200 truckloads of concrete would
be needed for South Basin construction activities.
The workforce required on site for demolition and construction activities would vary depending on the
type of activity. In addition, supervisory staff may only visit the site periodically or briefly. The

maximum workforce required for any phase of work would be approximately 25 people; some phases are
likely to require far fewer people on site (e.g., dredging would require 4 to 6 people). It is assumed that
the majority of the workforce would arrive by transit or car pool. Two or three parking spaces could be
provided on site in areas within the construction zone depicted on Figure 2-9. Others arriving via vehicle
would use nearby parking garages and lots.
2.5

CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS

Capital cost estimates for the proposed project were developed by ROMA Design Group. The cost
estimates reflect the conceptual nature of the engineering and should not be construed as an accurate
estimate of capital costs. Additional costs for anticipated project management, construction management,
legal, and other miscellaneous costs were projected by WETA. Total capital costs for the proposed
project are estimated to be approximately $120 million to design and construct both the North and South
Basin improvements proposed under the Action Alternative. This estimate does not include costs for
mitigation measures that may arise from the environmental review and permitting process.
The proposed project would be funded with a combination of local, regional, state, and federal sources.
To date, WETA has secured $37,950,000 through Regional Measure 2, Proposition 1B, and federal fund
sources to design and construct the proposed North Basin improvements. WETA plans to secure the
$82,999,000 in additional funds required to complete the project, including design and construction of the
proposed South Basin improvements, from the following sources: through Proposition 1B California
Transit Security Grant Program – Regional Public Waterborne Transit funds; Federal Section 5309 Bus
and Bus Facilities Allocations – Ferry Boat, and other potential future federal sources. Table 2-11
presents the conceptual cost estimate and funding sources by project phase.
Operating and maintenance costs for facilities licensed by WETA are currently funded through docking
fees transferred from WETA to the Port of San Francisco for use of the Ferry Terminal per a licensing
agreement. Recent annual docking fees for the Alameda-Oakland service were under $50,000 annually.
Allocation of future operations and maintenance costs, including capital rehabilitation, are subject to
future agreement between WETA and the Port of San Francisco setting forth terms and conditions of
lease/licensing agreement for new facilities. Current operating and maintenance costs for WETA
facilities at the Ferry Terminal are funded with Regional Measure 2 appropriations, farebox revenue, and
other local funding sources available to support existing WETA services. Any additional operating and
maintenance costs required to support the WETA expansion project would be funded through similar
funding sources available to future WETA services operating at the Ferry Terminal.
2.6

AGENCY APPROVALS REQUIRED

FTA, as the federal lead agency under NEPA, would issue the Record of Decision for the project as the
final project approval in the NEPA process. Similarly, WETA, as the local lead agency subject to CEQA,
would certify the EIR as the final project approval in the CEQA process. Additionally, other agencies
have jurisdiction over the project area or resources that the project could potentially impact. The
following major permits and approvals would also be required:


Port/CCSF – Approval of WETA’s long-term lease for modifications to existing and construction of
new facilities within their jurisdiction. Final design of the project would also go through the Port’s
design review process. The Waterfront Design Advisory Committee is responsible for design and
architectural review of major Port projects. This design review process would also be coordinated
with other agencies with jurisdiction over and expertise in areas along the waterfront, including
BCDC and, given the historic resources within the project area, the San Francisco Historic
Preservation Commission. The public is invited to participate in the design review process. The Port
would also issue the building permit.

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED

The CEQA Guidelines (Section 15126.6) require that an EIR “describe a range of reasonable alternatives
to the project, or to the location of the project, which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of
the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects.” Every conceivable
alternative does not need to be considered, but a reasonable range of potentially feasible alternatives
should be considered to foster informed decision making and public participation. The lead agency is
responsible for selecting the range of alternatives. CEQA Guidelines also state that if the lead agency
deems that an alternative to the location of the project is not feasible, then the reasons for this
determination must be clearly described in the EIR (CEQA Guidelines §15126.6[f]).
FTA’s NEPA Guidelines also state that “the draft EIS shall evaluate all reasonable alternatives to the
action and discuss the reasons why other alternatives, which may have been considered, were eliminated
from detailed study” (§ 771.123[c]).
Many alternatives to the Action Alternative were considered through the planning phases for the project.
Some of the alternatives considered were evaluated during the planning of Phase I in 1999-2000.
Figure 2-11 depicts the vision developed for the Ferry Terminal that was developed in Phase I as a result
of substantial evaluation, agency, and public input. WETA considered additional alternatives while
developing the preliminary design concept plan for the project. The following sections describe the
alternatives that have been previously evaluated.
2.7.1

Alternative Locations

The Ferry Terminal is centrally located and adjacent to the City’s Downtown hub of transit services (e.g.,
Bay Area Rapid Transit and Muni). This is the historic location of water transit service in San Francisco
because of its proximity to both employment centers downtown and open water channels in San Francisco
Bay. Development of expanded water transit service in another location (i.e., at another pier along the
waterfront north or south of the Ferry Terminal) would require substantially more improvements to both
the landside (e.g., development of transit connections or shuttle services, demolition/reconstruction of pier
sheds) and water side (e.g., more dredging) than are proposed for this project, increasing the potential for
environmental impacts. Development and expansion of water transit service at the Ferry Terminal is

2.0 Alternatives

consistent with CCSF’s and BCDC’s vision and plan for waterfront development, and is the culmination
of decades of waterfront and transit planning. Therefore, consideration of alternative locations would not
meet the purpose and need for the project and would not be considered feasible.
2.7.2

Berthing Facility Design Options

In Phase I, the Port considered two different berthing facility designs: 1) fixed, currently used by Golden
Gate Ferry and requiring hydraulic ramps to adjust for tidal variation, and 2) floating, requiring a
gangway and float that can more readily accommodate the diversity of vessels and adjust for tidal
variations. The Port selected the floating configuration to provide greater flexibility in accommodating
tidal variation and seawall height, and interfacing with the diverse types of vessels in the Bay Area fleet.
WETA is also using the floating configuration at its other facilities. The floating berthing structure better
meets the project objectives and reduces the environmental impacts associated with hydraulic ramps (e.g.,
use of energy and hydraulic fluids).
During the initial planning phases of the project, WETA considered an additional phase, Phase III, of
improvements at the Ferry Terminal. Phase III, referred to as the Bow Loading Design Option, was
described in the materials presented to the public during the scoping process for the EIS/EIR. Phase III
involved the replacement of Gate E with a berthing facility that could accommodate two bow loading
vessels that would be used for the service to Treasure Island. Phase III would have been implemented in
2030, once the new development on Treasure Island was fully built-out and ridership demand required the
use of larger vessels. The bow loading vessels were considered by the Treasure Island Development
Authority as one option to serve riders at full build-out. Upon further consideration, and in coordination
with the Treasure Island Development Authority, this option was removed from consideration at this
time. Future ridership projections, as shown in Table 1-2, can be served with side-loading vessels, as
described in Action Alternative. It is considered speculative at this time to include the potential future
expansion of water transit service to Treasure Island using bow loading vessels.
2.7.3

Berthing Configuration Options

In Phase I, the Port considered a variety of berthing configurations. Options considered included
expanding the gate configuration primarily in the North Basin, rebuilding Pier ½ to provide access to the
new berths, and establishing new berths in both the North Basin and South Basin. The Port elected to
develop new gates in both the North and South Basins, because it minimized crossover operations of
vessels and provided greater flexibility for future water transit service expansion. The concept developed
in Phase I included two new gates in the North Basin (Gates A and B) and three new gates in the South
Basin (Gates E, F, and G). Gates B and E were constructed in Phase I.
During the initial planning of Phase II, WETA evaluated whether three new gates would be needed to
support new and existing services, as was envisioned in Phase I. Based on the projected ridership and
operations schedule, WETA confirmed, as described in Section 2.3, that three new gates would be
required meet their objectives. The construction of three new gates also provides additional operational
flexibility; a limited amount of potential spare berthing capacity to accommodate emergency evacuation,
guest, or visiting vessels; layover berthing; and the ability to maintain operations should an existing berth
be taken out of service for maintenance or repair.
Use of Gates C and D for WETA’s expanded operations was not considered as a viable alternative,
because these gates are used by GGT under an agreement with the Port of San Francisco; and Gates C
and D do not have adequate capacity to accommodate both GGT’s and WETA’s services. Additionally,
Gates C and D are fixed berthing structures and are not configured for use by WETA’s vessels.

2.0 Alternatives

Bus/Taxi/Auto Drop-Off Options

To relieve traffic congestion, the Port has considered a variety of approaches to include additional dropoff areas at the Ferry Building. Options evaluated during Phase I included: 1) expanding the drop-off
area in front of the Ferry Building; 2) creating a drop-off area to the north along Pier ½; 3) creating a
drop-off area to the south of the Agriculture Building; 4) rebuilding Pier ½ for a drop-off area; 5) filling
in the open water area south of the Ferry Building for a drop-off area; and 6) locating bus drop-offs on the
Ferry Plaza behind the Ferry Building. None of these options were deemed consistent with the San
Francisco Bay Plan. As a result, development of additional drop-off options were not pursued and only
curbside drop-off was retained and implemented.
2.7.5

Passenger Amenities – Queuing, Waiting, and Weather Protection Options

The Port conducted passenger and operator surveys and determined that a specialized facility with
centralized passenger waiting areas was not desirable, based on the behavior of commuter passengers
(who tend queue in front of the gate just before departure), the decentralized on-board ticketing process,
and the small size of vessels. Instead, several options were considered in Phase I for a covered arcade
along San Francisco Bay, or canopy extensions from the Ferry Building. These options were not
implemented in Phase I due to funding limitations at the time.
During planning of Phase II, WETA considered development of passenger boarding and circulation areas
that did not include the new deck and pile construction that would cover the existing open water area in
the South Basin. This option was removed from consideration because it would not meet several project
objectives. Reconstruction of the proposed Embarcadero Plaza as an Essential Facility would provide a
critical area for passenger staging and queuing in the event of an emergency evacuation. Additionally,
filling the South Basin open water area would provide an area for construction staging, thereby
minimizing disruption to the existing Ferry Building area businesses and users. Lastly, the creation of the
Embarcadero Plaza would improve passenger circulation in the Ferry Building area, addressing existing
circulation constraints that would become more significant as new water transit routes are implemented in
the Ferry Building area.
2.7.6

Additional Circulation Areas

Preliminary concepts of Phase II included expansion of the Bayside Promenade from the northeast corner
of the Ferry Building to Pier 1, creating a large continuous platform in the North Basin. This option is not
necessary to serve passenger queuing and access to the new gates, and would have resulted in a greater
amount of fill in San Francisco Bay. Therefore, this option was removed from consideration.
During planning of Phase II, WETA also considered concept design of a longer Gate A Access Pier. This
option would have resulted in a greater amount of fill in San Francisco Bay and would not present any
appreciable public access or operational benefit related to vessel berthing. Therefore, this option was
removed from consideration.
The replacement of the South Apron of the Agriculture Building was also considered during the
preliminary design of Phase II. Although replacement of the South Apron of the Agriculture Building
will eventually be required due to its condition and low elevation, it was determined that the full
replacement of this apron was not required to meet project circulation and emergency transportation
needs. Temporary repair of the apron, as described in Section 2.3, allows this area to be used during
construction and also to temporarily support passenger circulation. Additional repair work, at this time, is
not necessary to support water transit operations in the Ferry Building area.

INTRODUCTION

This chapter describes the existing setting of the project area; the federal, state, and local regulatory
framework applicable to implementation of the No Action Alternative and the proposed project; and the
impacts associated with the alternatives, including applicable mitigation to reduce potential impacts.
The following resources were considered, but were not addressed in the detailed impact analysis, because
the resources were not present in the project area: agricultural lands and forest resources, Section 6(f)
resources, and Indian trust assets. The resources discussed in the sections that follow are:

Safety and Security is not addressed separately and in detail in this chapter because the proposed project
would be located at the existing Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal), and would
not require new or additional onsite safety and security measures beyond what is described for the project
in Chapter 2 (e.g., locked gates, Americans with Disabilities Act-accessible ramps, and lighting of floats
and circulation areas). The potential for the project to affect police and fire service is evaluated in
Section 3.15, Utilities and Public Services. In addition, a discussion of emergency access is included in
Section 3.2, Transportation and Circulation.
As discussed in Chapter 2, this Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR)
evaluates the impacts associated with the facility improvements to the Ferry Terminal that are needed to
accommodate the additional Water Emergency Transportation Authority (WETA) ridership and vessel
arrivals at the Ferry Terminal. The impacts associated with the facility improvements are addressed in
each section under the Direct Impacts section. Because the facility improvements would allow vessel
traffic to increase at the Ferry Terminal, impacts associated with the increase in vessel and passenger
traffic at the Ferry Terminal are addressed in each section under Indirect Impacts.
The impacts associated with WETA’s planned expansion of water transit routes and services were
analyzed in WETA’s Implementation and Operations Plan and the Program EIR for the Implementation
and Operations Plan (WETA 2003b; WETA, 2003a), and therefore are not assessed in this EIS/EIR. This
EIS/EIR analyzes—at a project level—the site-specific impacts of improvements to the Ferry Terminal,
and impacts associated with the increase in vessels while they use and/or are docked at the Ferry
Terminal.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

For each resource section, the analysis is presented as follows:
1. Under “Introduction to the Analysis,” a brief summary is provided of the project’s impacts, and of
any mitigation measures recommended to reduce impacts.
2. Under “Affected Environment,” the existing environmental setting is described, followed by the
regulatory setting for the project study area and project area. For some resource areas, a study area
has been defined and considered in the analysis that is larger than the project area. The study area, if
applicable, is defined in each section, and varies based on the resource being considered.
3. Under “Impact Evaluation,” there is a discussion of the scope considered in the analysis; the approach
to the analysis; and those areas where neither alternative would have an impact, and which are
therefore not discussed in more detail in that section. Direct, indirect, construction, and cumulative
impacts are then analyzed.
4. Under “Mitigation Measures,” a full description is provided of the mitigation measures that are
recommended or required to reduce project impacts for that resource area.
This EIS/EIR has been prepared pursuant to the requirements of both the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The differences between the
guidelines for CEQA and NEPA have been captured in this EIS/EIR. For CEQA, the checklist
(Appendix G of the CEQA guidelines) that describes thresholds for determining significance for
environmental topics was used. However, because this EIS/EIR is a combined CEQA and NEPA
document, and since CEQA and NEPA use the term “significant” differently, consideration has also been
given to the definition of significance that is appropriate for NEPA evaluation. Pursuant to the Council
on Environmental Quality NEPA regulations (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Sections
1500-1508), the significance of project effects is evaluated in consideration of the effects’ context,
intensity, and duration. CEQA also requires identification of and mitigation for significant adverse
impacts in an EIR; while under NEPA, measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate effects are considered
for all of the adverse impacts of a project, regardless of significance. Another difference between CEQA
and NEPA is that CEQA primarily considers impacts to the physical environmental, while NEPA
includes impacts to the human environment, such as socioeconomic impacts and environmental justice.
This EIS/EIR has been prepared in compliance with the more stringent or complete requirements, whether
they are federal or state. Where possible, criteria are based on state or federal standards. For example, air
quality criteria, or thresholds, are based on the state and federal ambient air quality standards; noise
thresholds are likewise based on criteria defined by the Federal Transit Administration. In other cases,
such as visual resources, the analysis is based on professional standards.
Direct, indirect, construction, or cumulative impacts were evaluated. Direct impacts are the primary
effects that are caused by the project, and occur at the same time and place. For the proposed project,
direct impacts would be the result of development of the physical facility improvements. Indirect impacts
are secondary effects that are reasonably foreseeable and caused by the project, but occur at a different
time or place. For the proposed project, the facility improvements would facilitate an increase in vessel
and passenger use of the Ferry Terminal area; these effects are described as indirect impacts. Temporary
construction impacts are those that would occur only during construction of the project, and would cease
when the project enters into the operation phase. Cumulative impacts occur when two or more individual
effects that, when considered together, are considerable; or that compound or increase other
environmental impacts (see below for further discussion of cumulative projects).
Impacts analyzed pursuant to CEQA have been classified as having no impact, a less-than-significant
impact, a less-than-significant impact with mitigation, or a potentially significant impact. Impacts
analyzed pursuant to NEPA have been classified as adverse or beneficial, and in terms of their context,

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

intensity, and duration. Context refers to the geographic area (spatial extent) of impact, which varies with
the physical setting of the activity and the nature of the resource being analyzed. Intensity refers to the
severity of the impact; evaluation of the intensity of an impact considers the sensitivity of the resource,
and other factors.
For impacts determined under NEPA to be adverse, avoidance or mitigation measures are identified to
reduce the project’s impacts. Similarly, for the CEQA analysis, mitigation was identified to reduce an
impact to less than significant. Where mitigation would not reduce an impact to less than significant, the
impact was identified as significant and unavoidable.
The discussion of cumulative impacts provides an analysis of cumulative impacts of the project, taken
together with other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects producing related impacts.
The goal of this analysis is twofold: first, to determine whether the overall long-term impacts of all such
projects would be cumulatively significant; and second, to determine whether the project itself would
cause a “cumulatively considerable” incremental contribution to any such cumulatively significant
impacts. To determine whether the overall long-term impacts of all such projects would be cumulatively
significant, the analysis generally considers: (1) the area in which effects of the proposed project will be
felt; (2) the impacts from the proposed project that are expected in the area; (3) other past, proposed, and
reasonably foreseeable projects that have had or are expected to have impacts in the same area; (4) the
impacts or expected impacts from these other projects; and (5) the overall impact that can be expected if
the individual impacts from each project are allowed to accumulate. “Cumulative impacts” refers to two
or more individual effects that, when considered together, are considerable; or that compound or increase
other environmental impacts (CEQA Section 15355). Cumulative impacts can result from individually
minor but collectively significant impacts taking place over time (40 Code of Federal
Regulations 1508.7). If the analysis determines that there is the potential for the proposed project, taken
together with other past, present, and reasonable foreseeable future projects, to result in a significant or
adverse cumulative impact, the analysis then determines whether the project’s incremental contribution to
any significant cumulative impact is itself significant (i.e., “cumulatively considerable”).
Table 3.1-1 and Figure 3.1-1 illustrate the other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects
considered in the cumulative analysis for the proposed project. This list includes projects that are likely
to result in similar impacts as the proposed project. The list of projects generally includes those in close
proximity to the proposed project area (i.e., those which could result in overlapping impacts, such as
transportation and circulation; land use and land use planning; parklands and recreation; noise and
vibration; aesthetics and visual resources; or utilities and public services), or other projects along San
Francisco Bay that could result in overlapping impacts to resources such as biological resources,
hydrology, and water quality. Where applicable for specific resource areas, additional projects or other
methods for assessing cumulative impacts may have been considered, as described and noted in that
section (e.g., transportation and circulation and air quality).
Additional information on each project can be obtained from the source cited in the table.

TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION

3.2.1

Introduction to the Analysis

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

This analysis provides an evaluation of transportation and circulation issues resulting from the
implementation of the project. The information is based on current traffic volumes and traffic demand
models, and transit ridership data and transit demand models, provided by the Water Emergency
Transportation Authority (WETA), the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) and
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART). The transportation analysis for the project was prepared according to
the guidelines and methods used by the San Francisco Planning Department to evaluate transportation
impacts. A separate, more detailed Transportation Impact Study has been prepared for the San Francisco
Planning Department, and is available from WETA. Potential impacts to intersections, transit, pedestrian,
and bicycle facilities in the vicinity of the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal)
were evaluated following the San Francisco Planning Department’s standards, methodologies, and
significance criteria.
As detailed in this section, the analysis indicates that an increase in WETA water transit passengers using
transit in the study area could significantly and adversely affect San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni)
F Market and Wharves operations. The analysis also indicates that increases in pedestrian circulation in
the study area resulting from implementation of the project could result in adverse impacts to two
crosswalk levels of service in the study area. Mitigation measures have been identified that would reduce
some of these potential impacts; however, impacts would remain adverse and would be considered
significant and unavoidable.
3.2.2

Affected Environment

This section describes the existing conditions that were used in the evaluation of the potential
transportation impacts associated with the expansion of water transit services at the Ferry Terminal. A
separate, more detailed, technical study was also prepared to support this analysis—the Transportation
Impact Study, available from WETA—which includes additional detail on the existing transportation and
circulation conditions, as well as model runs, as noted below (WETA, 2013).
Project Site Setting
The geographic extent of the study area for the transportation analysis was determined in cooperation
with the San Francisco Planning Department. Located at the eastern terminus of Market Street at The
Embarcadero, the Ferry Terminal is within Superdistrict 1 1 of the regional travel modeling system. It is
also within the City and County of San Francisco’s (CCSF’s) Northeast Waterfront Area Plan and is part
of the San Francisco Ferry Building (Ferry Building) Subarea. The Ferry Building and the project area
are the center of the study area for transportation and circulation, which is bounded by Davis Street,
Washington Street, The Embarcadero, Howard Street, and Beale Street, as shown on Figure 3.2-1.
Serving as the main water transit hub for San Francisco, the Ferry Terminal currently operates with four
functional gates. These gates accommodate six water transit routes that provide regular service between
the Ferry Terminal and terminals in Alameda, Larkspur, Oakland, Sausalito, Tiburon, and Vallejo. On a
typical weekday, more than 10,000 passengers pass through the Ferry Terminal via more than 130 arrivals
and departures.
The Ferry Terminal borders the Financial District and South of Market Areas, and is walkable or bikeable
from both neighborhoods. The Ferry Building also serves as a market place for a number of businesses.
A farmer’s market is held on Tuesdays and Thursdays at the western edge of the Ferry Building, along
1

Superdistricts are based on the travel analysis zones established by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission.
Superdistricts are aggregations of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission’s 1099 Regional Travel Analysis Zone (1/99).

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

The Embarcadero. On Saturdays, the farmer’s market also extends to the Ferry Plaza east of the Ferry
Building.
Roadway Network
CCSF identifies several types of roadway networks, including the Congestion Management Program
network, the Metropolitan Transportation System network, Transit Preferential Streets, Better Streets
Plan, and Citywide Pedestrian Network. The General Plan provides a detailed description of these
regional and local access roadway networks, as they relate to the study area; this description is included in
the Transportation Impact Study, and summarized below. The site location and local roadway network
are shown on Figure 3.2-1.
Regional Access
Regional vehicular access to the area is provided by Interstate 80 (I-80) to the south. I-80 is an eight-lane
freeway that runs in the east-west direction 0.5 mile southeast of the project site. In the vicinity of the
project site, I-80 is the major roadway connector between San Francisco and the East Bay via the San
Francisco Bay Bridge. Access to the project site from westbound or eastbound I-80 is via Folsom Street
or Fremont Street ramps, or the Harrison Street or First Street ramps.
Local Access
The local streets in the project area include Washington Street, Clay Street, Sacramento Street, California
Street, Market Street, Mission Street, Howard Street, The Embarcadero, Steuart Street, Spear Street, Main
Street, Beale Street, Drumm Street, and Davis Street. These streets generally include sidewalks on both
sides, metered parking, and signalized intersections. In addition, many of the study area local streets
include bicycle lanes, as described below under Bicycle Conditions.
Intersection Operating Conditions
Weekday AM and PM peak hour intersection turning movement, bicycle, and pedestrian volumes for the
19 study intersections shown on Figure 3.2-1 were collected on Wednesday, May 18, 2011, and
Thursday, May 19, 2011. Site visits were conducted during the week of May 16, 2011, to confirm lane
geometries and traffic operations at study intersections. Additionally, site visits were used to observe and
document existing bicycle and pedestrian movements and facilities. Data collected are available in the
Transportation Impact Study (WETA, 2013).

Intersection turning movement counts have been conducted at the 19 study intersections during the
weekday AM peak (7:00 to 9:00 AM), and weekday PM peak (4:00 to 6:00 PM). The intersection counts
were manually recorded in 15-minute increments.
Lane geometries for each intersection are presented on Figure 3.2-2, and the Existing Conditions traffic
volumes are presented on Figure 3.2-3.
Level of Service Definition
A Level of Service (LOS) evaluation is a qualitative description of an intersection performance based on
the average delay per vehicle experienced during peak travel periods. LOS can range from “A”
representing free-flow conditions, to “F” representing congested conditions with long delays. LOS A
through D are considered excellent to satisfactory operating conditions, LOS E undesirable, and LOS F
represents unacceptable conditions, at or above capacity. The LOS descriptions considering vehicle delay
for signalized intersections are provided in Table 3.2-1, on the following page.
Intersections were evaluated for the weekday AM and PM peak hour of the AM and PM peak period, using the
2000 Highway Capacity Manual operations methodology in the Synchro analysis software. For signalized
intersections, this methodology determines the capacity of each lane group approaching the intersection. The
LOS is then based on average delay (in seconds per vehicle) for the movements within the intersection. In
June 2011, signal timing reports were obtained from SFMTA for all of the study intersections, to ensure that
signal phasing and timing used in the analysis represented existing field conditions.
In San Francisco, LOS A through D is considered satisfactory for signalized intersections, and LOS E and F
are considered unsatisfactory operating conditions. The AM peak hour is the highest one-hour traffic volume
between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM, while the PM peak hour is the highest 1-hour traffic volume between
4:00 PM and 6:00 PM. LOS calculations were performed at 19 intersections for the weekday PM peak hour.
Table 3.2-2 (following Figures 3.2-2 and 3.2-3) summarizes the results of the intersection LOS for the
existing weekday AM and PM Peak-Hour conditions. Based on the LOS results for existing conditions,
nearly all of the intersections operate at LOS D or better during both the AM and PM peak hours. Only
one intersection operates lower than LOS D. The intersection of Spear Street and Mission Street (No. 9)
operates at LOS C in the AM peak hour, and LOS E in the PM peak hour.
The intersection of Steuart Street and Market Street is unsignalized and uncontrolled, and therefore was
not analyzed from a quantitative standpoint. Qualitatively speaking, the conflicts between eastbound
vehicles turning right, northbound vehicles turning left, and pedestrians using the intersection crosswalks
have been detected in the existing field observations, and are described further in Intersection Pedestrian
Conditions, below. The intersection does not experience a large number of vehicles, with 212 and 250
total in the respective AM and PM peak hours. Vehicle, bicycle, and transit vehicle speeds through this
intersection were observed to be slower due to the 90 degree angle of the two-legged intersection.
Conflicts between various modes of transportation were observed, but only occurred on rare occasions
due to the slower vehicle speeds and wide crosswalks.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Transit Network
The project site is well served by public transit, with local and regional transit service within walking
distance. Local service is provided by Muni bus and light rail. Nearby regional service to the East Bay
and south of San Francisco is provided by Alameda-Contra Costa County Transit Authority (AC Transit),
Amtrak, BART, and WETA. Service to and from the South Bay/Peninsula is provided by San Mateo
County Transit District (SamTrans) and Caltrain, and service to and from the North Bay is provided by
Blue & Gold Fleet, and Golden Gate Transit buses and ferries. The project site is approximately
0.20 mile northeast of the BART/Muni Embarcadero Station.
Figure 3.2-4 shows the local transit network in the study area.
Consistent with the San Francisco Planning Department’s guidelines for transit analysis, the ridership and
capacity of lines and services is presented for the peak direction of travel. Accordingly, impacts are also
analyzed for services in the peak direction of travel (see Section 3.2.3).
San Francisco Municipal Railway Service
Muni provides transit service within San Francisco. Service options include bus (both diesel and electric
trolley), light rail (Muni Metro), cable car, and electric streetcar lines. The transit study area includes the
following Muni service: 2 Clement, 6 Parnassus, 9 San Bruno, 9L San Bruno Limited, 14 Mission,
14L Mission Limited, 14X Mission Express, 21 Hayes, 30X Marina Express, 31 Balboa, 41 Union, 80X
Gateway Express, 81X Caltrain Express, and 82X Levi Plaza Express bus lines as well as the J Church,
K Ingleside, L Taraval, M Ocean View, N Judah, and T Third Street light rail lines and the F Market and
Wharves streetcar line, which operate along Market Street (SFMTA, 2011).
The fifteen Muni bus lines in the study area are described in detail in Table 3.2-3. All of the Muni bus
lines in the study area accommodate bicycles and wheelchairs.
All of the Muni Metro lines are in the study area (F, J, K, L, M, N, and T) and are described in
Table 3.2-4. Each line has a below-grade access at the Embarcadero Station at Drumm Street and Market
Street, approximately 0.20 mile from the Ferry Terminal.
Table 3.2-5 presents the percent utilization for the Muni lines that serve the project area during the AM
and PM peak periods. Four Muni lines—the K Ingleside, the L Taraval, the T Third Street, and the
N Judah—currently operate with overcrowded conditions (more than 85 percent of capacity used) in the
inbound direction during the AM peak hour. Five Muni lines—the J Church, the K Ingleside, the
L Taraval, the T Third Street, and the N Judah—currently operate with overcrowded conditions (more
than 85 percent of capacity used) in the outbound direction during the PM peak hour. Tables 3.2-3
through 3.2-5 are on the pages following Figure 3.2-4.
Regional Transit Service
Regional transit providers that serve San Francisco are described below and considered in this analysis.
Amtrak, BART, Blue & Gold Fleet, Golden Gate Transit, and WETA also all have stops/terminals in the
study area. AC Transit, Caltrain, and SamTrans each have stops/terminals in the nearby vicinity of the
study area.
Alameda-Contra Costa County Transit District
AC Transit operates bus service in western Alameda and Contra Costa counties, as well as routes to San
Francisco and San Mateo counties. AC Transit operates 27 “Transbay” bus routes between the East Bay

and the Temporary Transbay Terminal at Howard Street and Main Street. The Temporary Transbay
Terminal is approximately 0.5 mile from the project site, and accommodates all Transbay AC Transit buses
that stop in San Francisco during the AM and PM commute periods. The Temporary Transbay Terminal is
near many major San Francisco Muni routes, either at the terminal or on and near Market Street. Most
AC Transit Transbay service is provided only during commute periods, with headways between buses of
approximately 15 to 20 minutes, carrying between 1,600 and 2,500 passengers during the peak hour.
Amtrak
California Thruway Motorcoaches operates the Amtrak Thruway coaches. The California Thruway
Motorcoaches connect with the Ferry Terminal—stopping in front of the Ferry Terminal—and the
Emeryville Amtrak station, which services the California Zephyr, Capitol Corridor, Coast Starlight, and
San Joaquin routes.
Bay Area Rapid Transit
BART operates a regional rail transit system between the East Bay (from Pittsburg/Bay Point, Richmond,
Dublin/Pleasanton and Fremont) and San Francisco, and between San Mateo County (from
Millbrae/SFO) and San Francisco, with 5 lines and 43 stations through San Francisco, Alameda, Contra
Costa, and San Mateo counties. The five lines provide regular service between 4:00 AM and midnight,
with trains for each line arriving every 15 to 20 minutes. During the weekday PM peak period, headways
are generally 5 to 15 minutes for each line. BART also provides additional service in the form of longer
trains, shorter headways, and longer operating hours for special events such as New Year’s Eve, the
Fourth of July, Pride Weekend, and Memorial Day weekend.
Within downtown San Francisco, BART operates underground below Market Street. In the vicinity of
the project site, the nearest BART station is the Embarcadero Station, approximately 0.20 mile northeast
of the project site. Between October 2011 and December 2011, the average weekday exits at this station
were 35,106 riders. Four lines run through the wheelchair-accessible Embarcadero Station. Bikes are
allowed on BART, but only outside of the AM and PM peak-direction commute hour, which are
approximately between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM and 4:30 PM and 6:45 PM, respectively.
Blue & Gold Fleet
The Tiburon Ferry is operated by Blue & Gold Fleet and offers services to Tiburon from two locations
(Pier 39 and the Ferry Terminal). In addition, they offer multiple boat tours in and around San Francisco
Bay. The Tiburon Ferry has a seasonal schedule. It arrives up to four times during each peak period.
Caltrain (Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board)
Caltrain provides passenger rail service on the Peninsula between downtown San Francisco and
downtown San Jose, with stops in several communities in San Mateo County and Santa Clara County.
Within San Francisco, Caltrain terminates at Fourth/King Station in the South of Market neighborhood,
which is the nearest station to the project site. The Fourth/King station is accessible via Muni routes from
the project site (N Judah and T Third Street). Caltrain service headways during the AM and PM peak
periods are between 6 and 23 minutes, depending on the type of service. Caltrain service to San
Francisco carries between 575 and 700 passengers during the peak hour.
Golden Gate Transit
The Golden Gate Bridge, Highway, and Transportation District operates Golden Gate Transit, providing
bus and water transit service between the North Bay (Marin and Sonoma counties) and San Francisco.
Golden Gate Transit operates six basic bus routes serving the Temporary Transbay Terminal, one limitedR:\13 WETA\DTFX\Draft 0413\3_2_Trans.docx

Consequences, and Mitigation

stop service route, 17 routes serving the Financial District, and three routes serving the Civic Center.
Basic bus routes operate at regular intervals of 15 to 90 minutes, depending on the time and day of the
week. The Golden Gate Transit bus service carries approximately 1,500 riders to and from San Francisco
during the peak commute hour.
Golden Gate Transit also operates water transit service between Larkspur and Sausalito in the North Bay
and the Ferry Terminal during the morning and evening commute periods. The Larkspur service operates
at a peak period headway of 30 to 45 minutes. The Sausalito service operates at a peak period headway
of 70 minutes. The Golden Gate Transit water transit service currently carries 6,945 per weekday.
San Mateo County Transit District
SamTrans operates bus service in San Mateo County, with select routes providing transit service outside
of the County. SamTrans Routes KX, 292, 391, and 397 serve downtown San Francisco providing
connections to San Mateo County destinations. In general, SamTrans service to downtown San Francisco
operates along Mission Street to the Temporary Transbay Terminal at Howard Street and Beale Street,
approximately 0.5 mile from the project site. SamTrans buses to San Francisco carry approximately
2,000 passengers during the peak commute hour. These buses operate with headways between 10 and
60 minutes during the AM and PM peak hours.
Water Emergency Transportation Authority
WETA operates three water transit services from the Ferry Terminal. The Alameda/Oakland Ferry is a
publicly funded water transit service that connects the Ferry Terminal to Oakland and Alameda. It arrives
at the Ferry Terminal three times during each peak period (i.e., 65-minute headway). Harbor Bay Ferry
connects Harbor Bay Isle to San Francisco. It arrives at the Ferry Terminal three times during each peak
period (i.e., 60-minute headway). The Baylink Ferry is operated by WETA and connects the Ferry
Terminal with Vallejo (i.e., 25- to 60-minute headway). It arrives four times during each peak period.
WETA water transit service currently carries 4,490 passengers per weekday. WETA also operates the
Baylink Express bus (Route 200) between Vallejo and the Ferry Terminal 7 days a week. Each weekday,
the Route 200 Express Bus runs five buses between 5:00 AM and 7:20 AM from Vallejo to San
Francisco; and four buses between 4:00 PM and 6:20 PM from San Francisco to Vallejo.
Muni Screenline Analyses
The screenline analysis assumes that there are certain directions of travel within San Francisco that are served
by groupings of transit lines. Under the screenline analysis, it is assumed that someone traveling to a certain
area of San Francisco will choose one of the transit lines in that direction. Additionally, if the primary transit
line is overloaded, the transit rider can choose an alternative transit line that travels across the same screenline.
Muni considers four screenlines that divide San Francisco, which are useful in determining the magnitude of
transit-related capacity and demand to or from downtown San Francisco to other areas of the City. The four
screenlines include trips to and from northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest San Francisco. Each
screenline is divided further into corridors, such as Kearny/Stockton, Geary, Mission, or Haight/Noriega.
Capacity utilization is determined for each screenline to determine the availability of space for transit riders.
Table 3.2-6 (on the following page) lists the Muni screenline groupings, and Table 3.2-7 (on the second
page following) details the ridership, capacity, and utilization for the screenlines. Ridership for the peak
direction of travel 2 and maximum load point for each of the analyzed transit lines has been provided by

2

For individual transit lines, Muni screenlines, and regional screenlines, the peak direction of travel is considered (i.e., inbound
towards downtown San Francisco in the morning and outbound in the afternoon). The peak direction represents the time when
the transit service is most crowded and most likely to be affected by additional passengers.

Muni. For Muni transit lines, operating at over 85 percent is considered overcrowded. As shown in
Table 3.2-7, all corridor screenlines operate below the 85 percent threshold for transit vehicle loads,
except for subway lines crossing the southwest screenline, which operate at 86 percent capacity during the
AM peak hour, and 87 percent capacity during the PM peak hour.
Regional Screenline Analysis
AC Transit, BART, Caltrain, Golden Gate Transit, SamTrans, and WETA (water transit service) all
provide regional transit service to and from downtown San Francisco. These agencies provide transit
service to the East Bay, North Bay, and South Bay. For the purpose of this analysis, the ridership and
capacity for these three screenlines are presented for the peak direction of travel, which corresponds with
the evening commute in the outbound direction from downtown San Francisco to the region.
For the regional screenline analysis, regional transit is considered overcrowded if it operates at more than
100 percent utilization. As shown in Table 3.2-8, AC Transit, BART Caltrain, Golden Gate Transit,
SamTrans, and WETA water transit service all operate under 100 percent utilization.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Pedestrian Conditions
This section evaluates the pedestrian conditions in the Ferry Terminal, and at the 19 pedestrian study
intersections and 10 study crosswalks in the study area, for the AM and PM peak hours.
Ferry Terminal Pedestrian Conditions
Based on AM weekday observations, water transit–related pedestrian platoons formed after debarking.
Pedestrian paths from the debarking area to The Embarcadero differed, depending on the gate where the
vessel docked. Pedestrians debarking at Gate B, the northernmost gate, tended to stay along the northern
perimeter outside of the Ferry Building, although a small proportion of pedestrians did enter the Ferry
Building. Water transit passengers debarking at the Golden Gate Ferries Gates C and D generally passed
through the Ferry Plaza to the center aisle of the Ferry Building to reach The Embarcadero and Justin
Herman Plaza or Market Street. Some pedestrians were observed walking along the southern perimeter of
the Ferry Building into the South of Market District. Passengers debarking from Gate E were mainly
observed walking along the southern perimeter of the Ferry Building to The Embarcadero. A small
number of passengers from Gate E passed through the Ferry Building to The Embarcadero.
During the weekday PM peak period, observed pedestrians were generally visiting the Ferry Building
after work either as a destination or to board water transit services. Pedestrian queues were observed at
Justin Herman Plaza waiting to cross The Embarcadero. Pedestrian hot spots were also observed along
the central corridor of the Ferry Building, the southern perimeter of the Ferry Building, and south of the
Ferry Building east of Mission Street and The Embarcadero.
The water transit passengers using Gates B and E generally were not observed using or passing through
the Ferry Plaza, which is to the east of the Ferry Building. As noted, the water transit passengers
observed traversing the Ferry Plaza were accessing Golden Gate Transit’s Gates C and D.
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, the farmer’s market, along the western side of the Ferry Building, is open
between 10 AM and 2 PM. Pedestrian spaces along the front of the building were slightly congested,
with less available walking space, but they were still navigable. During these periods, patrons used the
Ferry Building more for recreational or leisure purposes, spending time at the farmer’s market, or
shopping inside the building itself. This was in contrast to the AM and PM peak periods, when the
pedestrians stopped for a short purchase or used the Ferry Building as a passage between the water transit
gates and The Embarcadero.
During weekdays, space for pedestrians in and around the Ferry Building was adequate and the overall
pedestrian experience is free-flowing and open. In general, there was ample capacity along the central
corridor and external perimeter of the Ferry Building during the weekday AM and PM peak periods.
Overall, the interior walkways of the Ferry Building provided an appropriate level of capacity for a
comfortable pedestrian experience. The increase of patrons related to the farmer’s market still allowed
pedestrians to walk somewhat freely between shops. The exterior walkways were very crowded because
of the increase in pedestrian activity, and because space ordinarily used as walkways was occupied by
farmer’s market merchants. During the farmer’s market, the area was very congested, and traveling
between the front and rear of the Ferry Building was hindered.
Adjacent Sidewalk and Pedestrian Crosswalk Conditions
Adjacent to the Ferry Building along The Embarcadero, sidewalks are between 35 and 55 feet wide. The
crosswalks across The Embarcadero are signalized, Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant, and also
have pedestrian signals and call buttons. The crosswalks are striped; however, the paint is worn on
several of the crosswalks.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Based on field observations, pedestrian volumes were observed to be higher along the eastern side of The
Embarcadero, where both commercial and recreational uses are present. This stretch of The Embarcadero
was also observed to serve as a recreation area, with cyclists, runners, and walkers all sharing the
sidewalk. Pedestrian volumes were observed to be the highest in front of the Ferry Building. The
intersection at The Embarcadero and the Ferry Building was observed to be crowded with pedestrians
accessing the Ferry Terminal, Ferry Building, and transit services. The pedestrian traffic extended across
The Embarcadero to Justin Herman Plaza, and Market Street. The intersection at The Embarcadero near
the northern end of the Ferry Building was observed to have fewer pedestrians, but was still crowded.
Intersection Crosswalk Pedestrian Conditions
Pedestrian crosswalk volumes were collected at the same study intersections shown on Figure 3.2-1 for
the respective AM and PM peak hours. The greatest amount of pedestrian traffic is centered at the
intersections of Drumm Street and California Street (No. 4), Spear Street and Mission Street (No. 9),
Spear Street and Howard Street (No. 10), and The Embarcadero and Market Street Southbound and
Northbound (No. 16/17) during the AM peak hour; and Drumm Street and California Street (No. 4),
Spear Street and Mission Street (No. 9), Drumm Street and Sacramento Street (No. 3), and The
Embarcadero and Market Street Southbound and Northbound (No. 16/17) during the PM peak hour.
The intersection of Steuart Street and Market Street is unsignalized and uncontrolled, and therefore was
not analyzed from a quantitative standpoint. Qualitatively speaking, conflicts between eastbound vehicles
turning right, northbound vehicles turning left, pedestrians using the intersection crosswalks, and bicycles
have been detected in the field observations. However, the intersection does not experience a large
number of vehicles, and vehicle speeds were observed to be slower due to the 90-degree angle of the
intersection. Additionally, the intersection accommodates several Muni bus routes, and the F Market and
Wharves Muni metro line. Furthermore, the northern and eastern sides of the intersection are used as
parking spaces by merchants selling items on Justin Herman Plaza. Bicycles are present in the
intersection as well.

values.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Using the intersection pedestrian crosswalk data, crosswalk LOS analyses have been completed at ten of
the 19 study intersections at crosswalks crossing The Embarcadero. These crosswalks were selected to be
analyzed because they are those most likely to be impacted by the project, and would experience the
greatest numbers of project-related pedestrians. As shown in Table 3.2-10, all of the analyzed crosswalks
operate at LOS A, B, C, or D, and are therefore acceptable.

Bicycle Conditions
Three classes of bikeways exist within San Francisco: Class I, Class II, and Class III facilities. 3 Class I
bicycle paths provide a completely separated right-of-way for the exclusive use of bicycles and
pedestrians, with cross flow by motorists minimized. Class II bicycle lanes provide a striped lane on a
street or highway. Class III bikeways are signed bicycle routes that provide for shared use with motor
vehicle traffic.4 Class III bicycle routes generally have striping or signage indicating a shared roadway
for bicycle and vehicles. The bicycle study area and the bicycle routes in the study area are shown on
Figure 3.2-5.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Segments of these three bicycle routes (Route 5, 30, and 50) are designated as Class II or Class III
bikeways in the study area. In general, these nearest bikeways are striped bicycle lanes with directional
signage (as part of the Bike Route system).The Bicycle Route 5 runs from Third Street at King Street in
the South of Market Area, to North Point at The Embarcadero in the North Beach Area. Bicycle Route 5
is a Class II facility along The Embarcadero between North Point and Second Street. In the study area,
Bicycle Route 5 runs in both directions along The Embarcadero adjacent to the project site. This bicycle
route provides a lane of travel separate from the vehicle traffic, allowing it to be used by recreational and
commuter bicyclists on a regular basis.
Bicycle Route 30 runs from The Embarcadero at Howard Street in the South of Market Area, to The
Great Highway and John F. Kennedy at Ocean Beach. In the study area, Bicycle Route 30 is a Class III
bicycle lane. It follows Howard Street in the westbound direction, and ends at The Embarcadero.
Bicycle Route 50 runs from The Embarcadero at Mission Street in the downtown area, to The Great
Highway at Sloat Boulevard at Ocean Beach. In the study area, the route is a Class III facility, and
continues along Market Street until Steuart Street, follows Steuart Street one block to Mission Street, and
then follows Mission Street until ending at The Embarcadero.
Table 3.2-11 (on the page following Figure 3.2-5) shows the bicycle volume totals at the study intersection
for the AM and PM peak hours. During the AM and PM peak hours, bicycle activity is heaviest at the
intersections of The Embarcadero and Howard Street; The Embarcadero and Washington Street; and The
Embarcadero and Mission Street East. Garages with bicycle parking are at the intersections of Steuart Street
and Clay Street, and in the blocks bordered by Mission Street, Steuart Street, Folsom Street, and Main
Street. In addition, several employer-provided bicycle parking options exist in office buildings in the study
area. There is a bicycle station at the BART/Muni Embarcadero Station. In the project area, along the
Embarcadero Promenade, there are several bicycle racks. During very busy times at the Ferry Building,
bicycles have also been observed locked to railings in the project area.
Parking and Loading Conditions
On-street parking capacity exists on most streets in the study area. All the on-street parking is metered.
A significant amount of off-street parking exists around the study area, with many of the office buildings
surrounding the study area having public parking spaces. In addition, some vacant lots have been
converted to fee-based parking spaces. Immediately outside of the Ferry Building, along the eastern side
of The Embarcadero, there are two 220-foot white zones. The northernmost of these two white loading
zones, which can accommodate up to 11 vehicles, functions as valet parking operated by ACE Parking
Management. Parking here can be validated for Ferry Building patrons. The southern white zone is used
for freight deliveries for retail in the Ferry Building, discussed below.
In addition, there is limited parking located in the project area near the Agriculture Building and the
restaurant on Pier 2. The parking spaces near the Agriculture Building and the restaurant on Pier 2 serve
as valet parking spaces for the restaurant on Pier 2.
Amtrak Thruway motorcoach stops are located slightly south of the Ferry Building, and can
accommodate two buses at the same time. Similarly, a bus stop for the WETA Baylink bus is slightly
north of the Ferry Building and can accommodate one bus.
Currently, loading facilities are limited in the project area. Freight deliveries for Ferry Building tenants
are permitted from the Ferry Plaza via a driveway just south of the Ferry Building that connects the Ferry
Plaza and The Embarcadero. Freight deliveries are also accommodated curb-side along the eastern side
of The Embarcadero at the southern white zone. There are no legal passenger pick-up or drop-off zones
adjacent to the Ferry Terminal along the Embarcadero.

When the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market is in operation, related truck loading and parking activity takes
place along The Embarcadero, and along the driveway just south of the Ferry Building that connects the
Ferry Plaza and The Embarcadero.
The Ferry Plaza is also used by BART to provide access, parking, loading, and staging for its required
regular maintenance and operations activities related to its facilities located on the Ferry Plaza.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Multimodal Circulation near the Ferry Terminal
The area of The Embarcadero in front of the Ferry Building has been observed to experience a number of
transportation and circulation conflicts due to the variety of activities in this area. With bus stops, valet
parking, passenger and loading vehicle activity, bicycle routes, and heavy pedestrian traffic, there have
been conflicts and congestion observed between pedestrians, vehicles, and bicyclists along The
Embarcadero in front of the Ferry Terminal. Bicycle Route 5 and the Embarcadero Promenade (part of
the San Francisco Bay Trail) run along The Embarcadero in front of the Ferry Terminal. Along the
Embarcadero Promenade, bicycles are permitted to use either the sidewalk or the adjacent bike lane.
Vehicles picking up or dropping off in front of the Ferry Building (e.g., deliveries or using valet) must
maneuver from the vehicle moving lanes, across the bicycle lane, and to the curbside. Based on field
observations, this movement creates conflicts between vehicles and bicyclists. Parked vehicles have been
observed double-parked in the bicycle lane, creating other sources of vehicle-cyclist conflict. Vehiclevehicle conflicts have also been observed as a result of maneuvering between moving lanes and the
curbside, and double-parked vehicles have been observed restricting northbound vehicle travel lanes.
Pedestrian-cyclist conflicts are also present due to bicyclists riding on The Embarcadero sidewalk.
Conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians near the gates have also been observed on days when the
farmer’s market is operating.
Emergency Access and Use
Emergency vehicle access at the project area is available along The Embarcadero curbside. Emergency
vehicles would primarily access the project area from Mission and Howard streets, approaching the
project area along the northbound lane of The Embarcadero. In addition, there are two curb cuts and
driveways south of the Ferry Building that provide emergency vehicle access to the eastern side of the
Ferry Building and the facilities located on the Ferry Plaza (Gates C and D, the Carnelian by the Bay, and
BART facilities). The driveway just south of the Ferry Building also serves as a fire lane. Two
additional curb cuts and emergency vehicle access points are north of the Ferry Building.
BART has evacuation facilities on the Ferry Plaza; in the case of an emergency in the Transbay tube,
passengers would be evacuated to the Ferry Plaza.
The San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) provides fire protection and emergency medical services for
the residents, visitors, and workers of San Francisco. This includes property under the jurisdiction of the
Port of San Francisco (Port), including the project area. The following SFFD stations provide the first
response for fire suppression, rescue, and emergency medical service in the project area:





Station 1 at 676 Howard Street at Third Street;
Station 2 at 1340 Powell Street at Broadway;
Station 13 at 530 Sansome Street at Washington Street; and
Station 35 at Pier 22½, Harrison, and The Embarcadero (this station has fireboats and responds to inwater emergencies).

The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) assists the SFFD in the event of emergencies on water vessels or along the
waterfront. Per the USCG’s Sector San Francisco Marine Firefighting Contingency Plan (USCG, 2008),
the USCG’s Captain of the Port for the San Francisco sector works with the port authorities and local
governments within their area of jurisdiction to maintain current and effective contingency plans.
Emergency vessels can access the facilities in the project area (water transit gates, BART facilities,
restaurants, and the Agriculture Building) from the water side of the project area, if necessary.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Regulatory Setting
Water Emergency Transportation Authority
WETA was established by State Bill 976 in 2007 to replace the San Francisco Bay Water Transit
Authority, which was created in 1999. WETA has been authorized by the State of California to oversee
and operate a public water transit system within the Bay Area. WETA created and adopted an Emergency
Water Transportation System Management Plan for the Bay Area in 2009. This plan integrates and
complements the emergency plans of other agencies, to ensure mobility within the Bay Area following a
major disaster.
Planning Department of the City and County of San Francisco
The CCSF Planning Department has published Transportation Impact Analysis Guidelines for
Environmental Review to guide preparation of transportation impact analysis for environmental
evaluation. These guidelines provide significance criteria for analyzing the impact of a project on traffic,
Muni transit, regional transit, parking, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, freight loading and service, and
passenger loading zones.
San Francisco Bay Trail Plan
The San Francisco Bay Trail Plan is a project of the Association of Bay Area Governments and aims to
provide a bicycle and pedestrian trail around the shoreline of San Francisco Bay. Currently, 310 miles of
the proposed 500-mile tail have been developed for bicycling and hiking, including the portion of the San
Francisco Bay Train in the project area.
San Francisco General Plan
The Transportation Element of the San Francisco General Plan is composed of nine sections that define
and relate the components of the city’s transportation system. The nine sections include: General,
Regional Transportation, Congestion Management, Vehicle Circulation, Transit, Pedestrians, Bicycles,
Citywide Parking, and Goods Movement. Included in the Transportation Element of the San Francisco
General Plan is reference to the “Transit First” Policy adopted by CCSF in 1973.
San Francisco Transit First Policy
The San Francisco’s Transit First Policy was first adopted by the Board of Supervisors in 1973 and
incorporated into the City Charter in 1998 by the voters of San Francisco. The motivation behind the
Transit First Policy is to ensure the City’s commitment to give priority to alternative modes of
transportation over the personal vehicle, through a set of defined principles. These principles include the
following:
1. To ensure quality of life and economic health in San Francisco, the primary objective of the
transportation system must be the safe and efficient movement of people and goods.
2. Public transit, including taxis and vanpools, is an economically and environmentally sound alternative
to transportation by individual automobile. Within San Francisco, travel by public transit, by bicycle,
and on foot must be an attractive alternative to travel by private automobile.
3. Decisions regarding the use of limited public street and sidewalk space shall encourage the use of
public rights-of-way by pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transit, and shall strive to reduce traffic and
improve public health and safety.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

4. Transit priority improvements, such as designated transit lanes and streets and improved
signalization, shall be made to expedite the movement of public transit vehicles (including taxis and
vanpools) and to improve pedestrian safety.
5. Pedestrian areas shall be enhanced wherever possible to improve the safety and comfort of
pedestrians and to encourage travel by foot.
6. Bicycling shall be promoted by encouraging safe streets for riding, convenient access to transit,
bicycle lanes, and secure bicycle parking.
7. Parking policies for areas well served by public transit shall be designed to encourage travel by public
transit and alternative transportation.
8. New transportation investment should be allocated to meet the demand for public transit generated by
new public and private commercial and residential developments.
9. The ability of CCSF to reduce traffic congestion depends on the adequacy of regional public
transportation. CCSF shall promote the use of regional mass transit and the continued development
of an integrated, reliable, regional public transportation system.
10. CCSF shall encourage innovative solutions to meet public transportation needs wherever possible and
where the provision of such service will not adversely affect the service provided by Muni. (Added
November 1999).
Better Streets Plan
The Better Streets Plan is an effort by the CCSF to design a street system to promote citizen needs for the
use and enjoyment of public spaces for all. Similar to the Transit First Policy, the Better Streets Plan
prioritizes walking, bicycling, transit, and the use of streets as public spaces for all. The Better Streets
Plan focuses on streetscape design, traffic calming measures, and best practice models to ensure multimodal safety with emphasis on pedestrian well-being.
San Francisco Bicycle Plan
The San Francisco Bike Plan, approved in June 2009, includes minor changes to the existing facilities
near the project. Improvements, including markings, signage, and facilities are considered treatments
necessary to improve conditions for bicycle use.
3.2.3

Impact Evaluation

Because the project is located within the jurisdiction of CCSF, the San Francisco Planning Department’s
guidance and analysis criteria have been applied to the proposed project. The criteria that the Planning
Department uses to evaluate transportation impacts associated with a proposed project are listed below.
The analysis considered whether the project would:


Cause the signalized intersection LOS to deteriorate from LOS D or better to LOS E or F, or from
LOS E to LOS F, which would be considered significant. The operational impacts on unsignalized
intersections are considered potentially significant if project-related traffic causes the LOS at the
worst approach to deteriorate from LOS D or better to LOS E or F, and California Department of
Transportation signal warrants would be met, or would cause California Department of
Transportation signal warrants to be met when the worst approach is already operating at LOS E or F.
The project may result in significant adverse impacts at intersections that operate at LOS E or F under
existing conditions, depending on the magnitude of the project’s contribution to the worsening of the
average delay per vehicle. In addition, the project would have a significant adverse impact if it would

June 2013

Water Emergency Transportation Authority
Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

cause major traffic hazards or contribute considerably to cumulative traffic increases that would cause
LOSs to deteriorate to unacceptable levels.


Cause a substantial increase in transit demand (Muni, BART, AC Transit, water transit service,
Golden Gate Transit Bus, Caltrain, and SamTrans) that could not be accommodated by adjacent
transit capacity, resulting in unacceptable levels of transit service. Specifically, with the Muni and
regional transit screenline analyses, the project would have a significant effect on the transit
provider if project-related transit trips would cause the capacity utilization standard to be exceeded
during the PM peak hour. Additionally, the project would have a significant effect on the
environment if it causes increases in delays or operating costs substantial enough that significant
adverse impacts in transit-service levels result. For transit services, impacts in the peak direction of
travel are considered (e.g., generally inbound to downtown San Francisco in the morning and
outbound in the afternoon).



Result in substantial overcrowding on public sidewalks, create potentially hazardous conditions for
pedestrians, or otherwise interfere with pedestrian accessibility to the site and adjoining areas.



Create potentially hazardous conditions for bicyclists, or otherwise substantially interfere with bicycle
accessibility to the site and adjoining areas.



Result, during the peak hour of freight-related loading activities, in a freight-related loading demand
that could not be accommodated within proposed onsite loading facilities or within convenient onstreet loading zones, and created potentially hazardous conditions or significant delays affecting
traffic, transit, bicycle, or pedestrians.



Hinder emergency vehicle access.



Result in any of the above-described conditions for its construction-related impacts.

There are currently pullouts located in front of the Ferry Building on The Embarcadero, as well as a space
on the Ferry Plaza behind the Ferry Building, which are used for freight loading activities for Ferry
Building tenants, Golden Gate Transit, Carnelian by the Bay, and BART facility operators. The proposed
improvements (including construction activities) would not temporarily or permanently remove, modify,
or block access to the existing loading areas. The proposed project would also not be expected to increase
freight-loading operations. Therefore, the project would have no impact on freight-loading activities or
existing loading areas in the project area.
Emergency access to the back of the Ferry Building and Ferry Plaza area is available via two driveways
between the Ferry Building and the Agriculture Building. Two additional access points are north of the
Ferry Building. Emergency vehicles may also park along the curb to access the Ferry Building. In
addition, emergency vessels may access the site from the water side. The proposed improvements
(including construction activities) would not temporarily or permanently remove, modify, or block access
to these locations. The proposed project would improve pedestrian circulation areas. It would also
include wayfinding signage at the Ferry Terminal that would improve pedestrian flow, enabling
emergency site access, like the fire lane, to remain clear and accessible in the event of an emergency.
Therefore, the project would have no impact on emergency vehicle access.
As described in Section 3.1, the impacts associated with WETA’s planned expansion of water transit
routes and services were analyzed in the Program Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the
Implementation and Operations Plan (WETA, 2003a), and therefore are not assessed in this
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)/EIR. This EIS/EIR analyzes—at a project level—the site-specific
impacts of improvements to the Ferry Terminal, and impacts associated with the increase in vessels and
additional passengers while they use and/or are docked at the Ferry Terminal. The Program EIR analyzed

Page 3.2-37

June 2013

Water Emergency Transportation Authority
Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

the impacts to navigation associated with the regional and cumulative increase in water transit vessels
operations on San Francisco Bay. The Program EIR analysis concluded that increases in vessel traffic
have the potential to increase conflicts with other commercial and recreational users of San Francisco
Bay. These impacts would be reduced substantially through the implementation of a number of best
management practices that should be considered in new terminal design and vessel operations. Refer to
the Program EIR for additional information.
Chapter 2.0 of the EIS/EIR describes the navigation safety practices that have been incorporated into the
proposed project. Section 3.4, Parklands and Recreation, assesses the potential for site-specific
recreational impacts at the Ferry Terminal.
Conditions for Analysis
Person trips could potentially be generated by the project in two different ways: construction period
trips and additional future passenger water transit ridership that would be accommodated by the facility
improvements. Construction period trips are analyzed under Construction Impacts, below. No
additional employees or services would be required during operation. All current and future WETA
vessels would be stocked and serviced at other terminal locations. Vessel crews would also board in
the outlying terminal locations. Therefore, there would be no additional person trips generated by
project operation.
Because the facility improvements would accommodate an increase in water transit service and therefore
the number of passengers coming through the Ferry Terminal, the impact of the additional water transit
ridership is evaluated in this EIS/EIR under Indirect Impacts. The new gates would be constructed by
2020, and the operational ridership estimates are for 2035. The analysis takes into consideration the
WETA ridership capacity available without the project; the growth of non-WETA water transit services at
the Ferry Terminal; and project-related ridership growth that could result from the expansion of facilities.
These considerations led to the development of three scenarios for evaluation: the Existing Conditions
Plus Project, 5 Future (2035) with the No Project Alternative, and Future (2035) Plus Project. Consistent
with the CCSF guidelines, to assess the incremental effects of the project, the circulation conditions in the
Existing Conditions Plus Project were compared to the Existing Setting (Impacts 3.2-1 through 3.2-4). In
addition, to assess the cumulative impacts of the incremental effects of the project (Impacts 3.2-6
through 3.2-9), the circulation conditions in the Future (2035) Plus Project were compared to the
circulation conditions as they would be under the Future (2035) with the No Project Alternative. The
following describes the ridership forecasts, person trip increments, and other planned network changes
that would apply for each condition for analysis.
Existing Conditions Plus Project – Ridership Forecast, Mode Split, and Distribution
For the Existing Conditions Plus Project, it is assumed that changes that would result from the
implementation of the proposed project would be made to the transportation network as it exists today.
This condition also assumes that all projected future ridership for 2035 would occur in the Existing
Condition. For the transportation network, the existing roadway, transit, pedestrian, and bicycle
conditions described in Section 3.2.2 are assumed.
As described in Section 2.3 of this EIS/EIR, the proposed project is the expansion and improvement of
the Ferry Terminal, needed to accommodate the full expansion of water transit service that was described
in WETA’s Implementation and Operations Plan, and in Table 1-2 of this EIS/EIR.

Pursuant to rulings in two recent CEQA cases (Sunnyvale West Neighborhood Assoc. v. City of Sunnyvale City Council [6th
Dist. 2010] 190 Cal.App.4th 1351 and Pfeiffer v. City of Sunnyvale City Council [6th Dist. 2011]), the project’s anticipated
effects on the transportation and circulation network were assessed on both the existing transportation network and the
transportation network that would be expected to exist at the time the project is fully operational (e.g., Future [2035]).

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

With the proposed facility improvements, the Ferry Terminal could accommodate the full expansion of
future water transit services expected to serve the Ferry Terminal. This would result in an increase in
passengers using WETA services, as shown in Table 3.2-12. The AM peak period for WETA services
is from 6:30 AM to 9:00 PM, and the ridership projections include passengers both arriving and
departing from the Ferry Terminal. During the AM peak period, 96 percent of passengers would be
arriving at the Ferry Terminal via inbound water transit services, and 4 percent would be arriving at the
Ferry Terminal from San Francisco to depart using outbound water transit services to the East Bay,
North Bay, South Bay, or Treasure Island. The PM peak period is from 4:00 PM to 6:30 PM, and the
percentage of passengers arriving and departing from the Ferry Terminal in the PM peak period would
be reversed from the AM peak period; that is, 96 percent of passengers would be arriving at the Ferry
Terminal from San Francisco to depart using outbound water transit services, and 4 percent would be
arriving at the Ferry Terminal via inbound water transit services from the East Bay, North Bay, South
Bay, or Treasure Island.

Peak-hour estimates for all services except Treasure Island were assumed to be 66.64 percent of the peak-period ridership. This was
based on actual ridership counts on existing WETA services conducted in May 2010. For Treasure Island service, the peak-hour
ridership estimates were from the Environmental Impact Report for the Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island Redevelopment
Plan. The peak period and daily ridership for Treasure Island were then estimated based on the peak-hour estimate.

The proposed project would not affect Golden Gate Transit Ferry service. For the Existing Conditions Plus Project, it is
assumed that Golden Gate Transit service would operate with the number of passengers and arrivals as it does currently.
WETA = Water Emergency Transportation Authority

As shown in Table 3.2-12, 11,176 passengers currently arrive at the Ferry Terminal on a daily basis. With the
implementation of the proposed project, total ridership would increase by 184 percent, to 31,771 passengers
per weekday. Of this total, 25,714 passengers would be using WETA services. Total ridership during the AM
peak hour would increase 190 percent, from 1,879 passengers to 5,456 passengers. Similarly, total ridership
during the PM peak hour would increase 197 percent, from 1,998 to 5,936 passengers.
A combination of the WETA ridership model and ridership surveys conducted in 2011 were used to develop
site-specific estimates of transportation mode splits for this project. The detailed methodology is available
in the Transportation Impact Study (WETA, 2013). Table 3.2-13 (on the following page) provides the
transportation mode splits for new WETA passengers within San Francisco, based on the travel demand
model and ridership surveys.

Note:
The WETA ridership model grouped walking and biking in one category; i.e., nonmotorized.
The ratio of walkers to bicyclists was estimated at 91 percent to 9 percent, based on passenger
survey data collected in 2011 for WETA water transit services into the Ferry Terminal.
The mode split percentages represent the mode split for the increment of additional water transit
passengers from the proposed project (not the total mode split for water transit passengers).
WETA = Water Emergency Transportation Authority

No auto access or egress trips are expected to be generated in San Francisco by the project; however, WETA
passengers may occasionally be dropped off at or picked up from the Ferry Terminal by taxis or other vehicles.
There are currently no legal pick-up or drop-off zones adjacent to the Ferry Terminal along The Embarcadero.
Vehicles, including taxis, would have to stop illegally or use designated taxi stands, which are located at some
distance from the Ferry Terminal (e.g., on Market Street). Illegal pick-ups and drop-offs in front of the Ferry
Terminal may continue in the future, but the number of vehicle trips is expected to remain small—10 to 30
trips or fewer during the AM and PM peak hours—if the curbside restrictions continue to be strictly enforced.
The WETA model and ridership surveys also provide origin and destination information within San Francisco.
As shown in Table 3.2-14, the trip distribution would result in 92.0 percent trips to Superdistrict 1; 2.6 percent
to Superdistrict 2; 2.3 percent to Superdistrict 3; and 3.1 percent to Superdistrict 4.

Future (2035) with the No Project Alternative – Ridership Forecast
For the Future (2035) with the No Project Alternative, it is assumed that no new gates or additional
boarding capacity would be provided to accommodate new WETA services, or the expansion of existing
WETA services. Only increases in passenger and water transit vessel arrivals that could be
accommodated with the existing facilities at the Ferry Terminal (i.e., at existing Gate B and Gate E)
would occur as a part of the Future (2035) with the No Project Alternative. The existing infrastructure
available to WETA at the Ferry Terminal could accommodate up to 7,800 WETA passengers per
weekday; 2,339 passengers during the AM peak period, and 2,641 passengers during the PM peak period.
This would represent a 61 percent increase in daily ridership, and a 69 percent increase in ridership for
both the AM and PM peak periods. A total of 65 WETA vessels would arrive on a daily basis, with 20
vessels arriving during each of the AM and PM peak periods.
The Future (2035) with the No Project Alternative includes the projected WETA ridership in 2035 under
the No Project Alternative, as well as those changes in the transportation system that would be expected
to be in place for Future (2035) Conditions. Therefore, Future (2035) with the No Project Alternative
would also include the forecasted increases in the Golden Gate water transit service at the Ferry Terminal
described in Table 3.2-15.

Future (2035) Plus Project – Ridership Forecast, Mode Split, and Distribution
The Future (2035) Plus Project condition describes the transportation system as it would be expected in
2035, including the projected increase in Golden Gate Transit ridership, as detailed in the Future (2035)
with the No Project Alternative description above. It also includes the changes that would result from the
implementation of the proposed project (as also described for the Existing Conditions Plus Project,
above). Table 3.2-16 summarizes the water transit ridership that would be expected under this condition.

Notes:
1
Peak-hour estimates for all services except Treasure Island were assumed to be 66.64 percent of the peak-period ridership. This
was based on actual ridership counts on existing WETA services conducted in May 2010. For Treasure Island service, the peakhour ridership estimates were from the Environmental Impact Report for the Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island
Redevelopment Plan. The peak-period and daily ridership for this route were then estimated based on the peak-hour estimate.
2
Totals for WETA service includes all services that operate from Gate B and Gate E. This includes the service operated by
WETA, as well as the Blue & Gold Fleet Service to Tiburon.

The proposed project would not affect Golden Gate Transit Ferry service. The projected increases in Golden Gate Transit
are those projected to occur independent of the proposed project.

Reasonably Foreseeable Projects Considered in the Cumulative Impact Analysis (i.e.,
Future 2035 Analysis)
Future traffic volumes have been derived from the San Francisco County Transportation Authority
countywide travel demand forecasting model. The San Francisco County Transportation Authority model
takes into account projected growth in housing, employment, and infrastructure improvements for San
Francisco and the nine-county Bay Area. To describe potential future changes to the study area roadway
network, the Northeast Waterfront Area Plan of the San Francisco General Plan is referenced where
applicable.

Note:
The WETA ridership model grouped walking and biking in one category; i.e., nonmotorized. The ratio of
walkers to bicyclists was estimated at 91 percent to 9 percent, based on passenger survey data collected in
2011 for WETA water transit services into the Ferry Terminal.
The mode split percentages represent the mode split for the increment of additional water transit
passengers from the proposed project (not the total mode split for water transit passengers).
WETA = Water Emergency Transportation Authority

In the project area, programmed or planned transportation facility improvements that would be expected to
affect the transportation and circulation network in 2035 include the implementation of the Transit
Effectiveness Project (TEP), the San Francisco Bicycle Plan, BART’s Ferry Plaza Barrier Project, the New
Transbay Terminal, development of the Muni E-Embarcadero, and the Transit Center District Plan (TCDP)
Public Realm Program. These projects are intended to improve the safety of transportation facilities, and may
affect circulation, transit, pedestrian, bicycle, and traffic conditions in the study area. Affected corridors and
streets would include Market Street, Mission Street, The Embarcadero, Steuart Street, and Spear Street.
Transit Effectiveness Project. TEP is a planning effort between the SFMTA and CCSF’s Controller’s Office
that reviews and evaluates San Francisco’s public transportation system, and provides recommendations to
make Muni service reliable, efficient, and quicker. Initial planning documents and findings were presented in
October 2008. An Implementation Strategy was developed in 2011, and reflects an update to the findings
from 2008, because some of the recommendations were implemented between December 2009 and September
2010. The TEP includes the following changes to transit services in the study area:


The proposed frequencies for the 1 California line would be 6 to 7 minutes during peak demand,
5 minutes during midday, and 12 minutes in the evening east of Presidio Avenue.



The 2 Clement line would add supplemental trolley coach service between downtown and Presidio to
maintain trunk service on Sutter, replacing the discontinued 3 Jackson. Although current frequencies
are 12 minutes during the peak and 20 minutes during midday, the proposed frequencies east of Market
Street would be 10 minutes during the peak demands, and 20 minutes during midday and in the evening.



The 14 Mission would use motor coaches, and the limited-stop service would use trolley coaches. No
route changes are proposed for the 14 Mission/14L Mission Limited. Service hours would be
expanded for the 14L Mission Limited to operate from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM. Mission Street would
have more frequent service at all times during the day, provided by all-day local and limited-stop
service (14L and 49L). Limited-stop service on the 14L would be changed from the current
frequency of 9 to 10 minutes all day, to 7 to 8 minutes during peak hours, 9 minutes midday, and
15 minutes (7 to 8 minutes when combined with 49L) during the evening.



The frequency of service for the 21 Hayes during peak hours would increase from 9 to 8 minutes.



The frequency of service for the 31 Balboa during the PM peak hours would increase from 14 to
12 minutes.

Consequences, and Mitigation



The frequency of service for the 41 Union during peak hours would increase from 8 to 7 minutes.



The frequency of service for the 82X Levi Plaza Express during the PM peak hours would decrease
from 12 to 15 minutes.



The frequency for the F Market and Wharves would decrease to 10 minutes during the evening.



More frequent service for the N Judah during peak hours to increase capacity and reduce crowding
would change the current frequencies of 7 minutes during peaks, 10 minutes midday, and 10 minutes
in the evening to 6 minutes during peaks, and 10 minutes midday and in the evening.

San Francisco Bicycle Plan. The San Francisco Bicycle Plan, approved in June 2009, proposes minor
changes to the existing facilities on Mission Street between The Embarcadero and Steuart Street, and
Steuart Street between Market Street and Mission Street (SFMTA, 2009). Minor improvements,
including markings, signage, and facilities, are considered treatments necessary to improve conditions for
bicycle use, and are not specified in more detail by route in the Bicycle Plan. Additionally, the Bicycle
Plan identifies one near-term bicycle improvement (Project 2-9) along Howard Street. A bicycle lane
along Howard Street between The Embarcadero and Fremont Street would be constructed by 2014.
E Embarcadero. Muni also has plans to implement a new transit line: E Embarcadero. This line would
operate between the Fourth and King Station, and ultimately terminate in Fort Mason. In the project area,
the E Embarcadero would share tracks and stations with the N Judah and T Third Street south of Market
Street, and the F Market and Wharves north of Market Street. The expected future capacity of this line is
280 passengers during the AM and PM peak hours.
BART Ferry Plaza Physical Barrier Project. As described in Table 3.1-1, BART is implementing a
project that involves the installation of physical barriers on the Ferry Plaza to protect BART’s facilities.
The barriers would be expected to affect pedestrian and vehicular circulation on the Ferry Plaza, and
would require the relocation and/or removal of concrete planters on the Ferry Plaza.
New Transbay Terminal and Transit Center District Plan. The new Transbay Terminal, currently
under construction, would serve as the new bus hub for service in San Francisco and to the East Bay,
North Bay, Peninsula, and South Bay for AC Transit, Golden Gate Transit, Greyhound Bus Lines,
SamTrans, and Muni.
The goal of the TCDP is to shape the area surrounding the new Transbay Terminal to maximize land use
density and create a public realm that would accommodate the increase of the transportation network in
the area. The TCDP has a recommended Public Realm Plan that comprises a comprehensive series of
changes to the transportation network surrounding the Transit Center. These changes include
modifications to the roadway, transit, pedestrian, and bicycle networks, as well as loading and parking
changes. Given the proximity of the TCDP to the transportation study area, some of these plans are in the
study area for the project.
In terms of roadway changes, one lane of eastbound travel would be removed along Howard Street
between Fremont Street and Main Street. Along Beale Street, one southbound travel lane between
Market Street and Folsom Street would be removed, and one northbound travel lane between Folsom
Street and Market Street along Main Street would be removed. Two-way traffic along Spear Street
between Market Street and Folsom Street would occur through the conversion of one southbound travel
lane to a northbound travel lane. Also, a new alley segment of Tehama Street would be constructed
between Beale Street and Main Street.
The Public Realm Plan would extend the Mission Street transit-only lane from Beale Street to Main
Street, and a new transit-only lane would be provided southbound on Beale Street between Market Street

and approximately Natoma Street. The future Transbay Transit Center would include a ground floor Bus
Plaza, which buses would enter from Beale Street.
Sidewalks would be widened along Mission Street, Howard Street, Beale Street, Main Street, and Spear
Street by removing on-street parking lanes and/or travel lanes. Construction of mid-block pedestrian
crossings would be implemented at the intersections of Beale Street and Natoma Street, and Main Street
and Natoma Street. Bulb-outs would be constructed at various intersections, including those along Main
Street, Spear Street, and Howard Street, to reduce crossing times and distances.
The Public Realm Plan would modify the bicycle network, and improve safety through the creation of
two-way traffic on currently one-way streets. A reduction in travel lanes would be implemented along
roadways with bicycle facilities, including Howard Street.
On-street commercial loading spaces along Mission Street would be consolidated into 50- to 100-footlong loading “pockets” or “turn-outs,” similar to those along Market Street. On-street parking would be
reduced or eliminated on Mission Street between Third Street and Main Street (both sides); Howard
Street between Third Street and Main Street (one side only, varies by block); and Beale Street between
Market Street and Folsom Street (west side between Market Street and Mission Street, both sides between
Mission Street and Howard Street).
Direct Impacts
No modifications would be constructed at the Ferry Terminal under the No Action Alternative.
Therefore, the circulation network would not be directly affected.
All facility improvements would be constructed to the east of The Embarcadero, and would not directly
affect the circulation network. All project improvements would occur in areas directly controlled by the
Port, and would not affect, encroach upon, or modify any property or access to property under the control
of other entities, including transportation easements or rights-of-way. Because no additional employees
or services would be required at the Ferry Terminal during project operation, and because vessel crews
would board in the outlying terminal locations, no new vehicle or personnel trips would be required for
the operation of the improved facilities. Therefore, the project would not result in any direct impacts to
transportation and circulation networks, other than improving regional transit capacity.
The facility improvements would facilitate an increase in water transit service at the Ferry Terminal,
thereby increasing passenger use of the transportation and circulation network arriving and departing
from the Ferry Terminal. The effects of the increase in passengers are discussed below under Indirect and
Cumulative Impacts.
Indirect Impacts
Impact 3.2-1: Potential Traffic Impacts to Study Area Intersections in Existing Conditions
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative in existing conditions, there would be no changes to water transit service
or the Ferry Terminal facility from what currently exists. Therefore, there would be no impacts from the
No Action Alternative.
Action Alternative
The project would not generate any inbound or outbound vehicle trips. The only effects to traffic would
be from increased pedestrian and bicycle traffic, which could interfere with vehicle traffic turning

Consequences, and Mitigation

movements. According to CCSF guidelines, a decrease in intersection LOS for a signalized intersection
from D to E, or from E to F, would be considered significant.
As detailed in the Transportation Impact Study, the additional pedestrian and bicycle traffic results in
relatively small changes in the average delay per vehicle at the study intersections during the AM peak
hour, when compared to the Existing Condition. The majority of intersections are unaffected, and all
intersections experience less than a 6-second increase in average delay. Only one intersection
experiences a drop in LOS, going from LOS B to LOS C.
Similarly, during the PM peak hour, the additional pedestrian and bicycle traffic also results in relatively
small changes in the average delay per vehicle at the study intersections, when compared to the Existing
Condition. As with the AM peak, the majority of intersections are unaffected. All intersections
experience less than a 3-second increase in average delay. The intersection at Spear Street and Mission
Street would continue to operate at LOS E for Existing Conditions Plus Project.
The intersection of Steuart Street and Market Street is unsignalized and uncontrolled. Because the project
would not add any vehicle trips to the roadway network, the number of vehicles traveling through this
intersection would not increase. The project would add approximately 1,489 pedestrians to the northbound
approach crosswalk, which could have some impact on intersection LOS for vehicular traffic. This
crosswalk is approximately 42 feet wide, however, and would be expected to accommodate the increase in
pedestrians without an adverse or significant impact on LOS, as detailed in the pedestrian analysis section.
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Determination. Increases in pedestrian and bicycle
volumes associated with the project under Existing Conditions would result in only minor increases to
traffic delay for the study intersections, which would not be adverse.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Determination. Increases in pedestrian and bicycle
volumes associated with the project under Existing Conditions would result in only minor increases to
traffic delay for the study intersections, resulting in a less-than-significant impact.
Impact 3.2-2: Potential Impacts to Transit in Existing Conditions
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative in existing conditions, there would be no changes to water transit service
or the Ferry Terminal facility from what currently exists. Therefore, there would be no impacts from the
No Action Alternative.
Action Alternative
As shown in Table 3.2-13, it is estimated that 1,320 AM peak-hour and 1,435 PM peak-hour transit trips
would be generated. The project would generate approximately 1,267 arriving and 53 departing transit trips
during the AM peak hour, and 58 arriving and 1,377 departing transit trips during the PM peak hour.
Transit trips to and from the project would likely use the nearby Muni bus and rail lines for local trips, and
the regional lines such as BART (potentially with transfers to/from Muni) for trips outside San Francisco.
As described in Section 3.2.2, for local and regional screenline analyses, only additional trips in the peak
direction of travel (e.g., inbound toward downtown in the morning and outbound in the afternoon) were
analyzed, because those trips are most likely to affect transit operations. From the results of the model and
ridership surveys, approximately 191 weekday AM peak-hour inbound trips and 209 weekday PM peakhour outbound trips would be added to the Muni screenlines. For regional screenlines, 18 inbound trips
would be added in the AM peak hour and 20 outbound trips would be added in the PM peak hour.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

According to CCSF guidelines, an increase in utilization for a transit line or screenline that results in the
transit service operating over the capacity utilization standard (i.e., 85 percent for Muni and 100 percent
for regional screenlines) would be considered significant. In addition, if a transit line (or screenline) is
already operating over capacity standard (i.e., 85 percent for Muni and 100 percent for regional
screenlines), and the project adds more than 5 percent of the total projected riders with the project, the
project’s impact would be considered significant.
Local Transit
As detailed in the Transportation Impact Study, for the Existing Conditions Plus Project, the additional
transit demand from the project would not increase utilization of any Muni screenline or individual line
beyond the 85 percent capacity utilization standard.
During the AM peak hour, 1,101 Muni trips would be added; however, only 191 of these trips would be
in the peak direction. During the PM peak hour, 1,196 Muni trips would be added; however, only 209 of
these trips would be in the peak direction. The maximum number of passengers that would be added to
any of the transit corridors analyzed would be 77. The northeast, northwest, and southeast screenlines
currently operate at between 50 and 67 percent capacity, and the increase in ridership from the proposed
project would only increase the percent utilization by 1 to 4 percent in the peak direction of travel.
During the AM and PM peak hours, the subway lines serving the southwest screenline currently operate
above the 85 percent capacity utilization standard. Most of the water transit passengers are arriving at the
Ferry Terminal and using transit in the nonpeak direction (i.e., outbound during the AM peak hour and
inbound during the PM peak hour). The project would add only 14 trips to the overcrowded subway lines in
the southwest corridor during the AM peak hour in the peak direction (i.e., inbound), and 15 trips during the
PM peak hour in the peak direction of travel (i.e., outbound). This represents 0.3 percent of the total
ridership, which is less than the project contribution threshold of 5 percent. Therefore, although the
proposed project would add 191 trips in the AM peak hour and 209 trips in the PM peak hour to the Muni
screenlines, the transit-related trips would not significantly contribute to overutilization of Muni screenlines.
In addition, the project’s expected increase in ridership and utilization of individual Muni lines for Existing
Conditions Plus Project for AM and PM peak hour and direction of travel was analyzed (refer to Table 3.2-18,
on the following page). During the AM peak hour, four Muni lines—the K Ingleside, the L Taraval, the
T Third Street, and the N Judah—currently operate with over 85 percent of capacity used in the inbound
direction under Existing Conditions. The project would add only seven passengers to the K Ingleside line, two
passengers to the L Taraval line, 14 passengers to the T Third Street line, and two passengers to the N Judah
line in the inbound direction. The passengers added by the project would represents between 0.1 and
1.9 percent of total ridership for these lines, less than the project contribution threshold of 5 percent.
During the PM peak hour, six Muni lines—the F Market and Wharves, the J Church, the K Ingleside, the
L Taraval, the T Third Street, and the N Judah—currently operate with more than 85 percent of capacity
used in the outbound direction. The project would add only three passengers to the J Church line, eight
passengers to the K Ingleside line, two passengers to the L Taraval line, 16 passengers to the T Third
Street line, and three passengers to the N Judah line in the outbound direction. The passengers added by
the project would represents between 0.1 and 2.1 percent of total ridership in the peak direction of travel
for these lines, less than the project contribution threshold of 5 percent.
For the F Market and Wharves, when the full WETA ridership—projected for 2035—occurs, the project
would add 71 passengers in the PM peak hour in the peak direction (i.e., southbound along The
Embarcadero). This represents 9.0 percent of the total F Market and Wharves ridership, exceeding the
project contribution threshold of 5 percent.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

WETA is assessing several options to reduce potential impacts to the F Market and Wharves however, it
is currently unknown if these measures are feasible and whether they would fully mitigate the impacts to
the F Market and Wharves. Therefore for the purposes of the EIS/EIR, impacts to the F Market and
Wharves would still be considered significant and adverse.
WETA passenger service is expected to occur gradually and over a 20-year period (i.e., between 2015 and
2035) and the operation Muni transit along the Embarcadero could also substantially change during that
period should the E Embarcadero line be developed. Therefore, WETA is considering several methods
by which to reduce the impact WETA’s riders could have on the operation of the F Market and Wharves.
WETA will evaluate the feasibility of the following methods of mitigating the impact; and, based on the
results of that evaluation, will mitigate the impact to the extent feasible.


Entering into an agreement with SFMTA for financial compensation, proportionate to the anticipated
impacts, for WETA’s fair share of operational improvements along the F Market and Wharves corridor.



Implementation of a shuttle service between the Ferry Terminal and areas north along the
Embarcadero during the PM peak hour to reduce demand for the F Market and Wharves when it
operates over capacity.



Monitoring of actual WETA ridership, transit use, and Muni capacity. The monitoring results would
be reported to SFMTA, and if they show that ridership from the project has the potential to exceed the
capacity utilization standard, WETA will implement such other mitigation methods as may be
appropriate at that time, such as financial compensation or a shuttle service.



Other methods as agreed to by the parties involved (WETA, SFMTA, and the Port).

Each of these mitigation methods is currently being evaluated and, if feasible mitigation is identified, it
will be included in the Final EIS/EIR.
Regional Screenline Analysis
The ridership, capacity, and utilization for the regional screenline groupings for the Existing Conditions
and the Existing Conditions Plus Project were analyzed. As with Muni screenlines, only additional trips
in the peak direction of travel are included.
During the AM peak hour, none of the screenlines are over-utilized. The project would add water transit
riders to the East Bay screenline; however, even with the addition of these riders, the East Bay screenline
would operate at 79 percent capacity. The project would add 219 BART trips; however, only 18 of these
trips would be in the peak direction for the South Bay screenline, which would operate at 65 percent
capacity with these additional trips. The project would not add any trips to the North Bay screenline.
During the PM peak hour, none of the screenlines are over-utilized. The project would add water transit riders
to the East Bay screenline (on WETA services); however, even with the addition of these riders, the East Bay
screenline would operate at 91 percent capacity. The project would add 238 BART trips; however, only 20 of
these trips would be in the peak direction for the South Bay screenline. These BART trips originate from the
Peninsula, and would be arriving at the Ferry Terminal to travel to the North Bay or East Bay. The inclusion
of project-related trips on BART would result in PM peak-hour utilization of 61 percent for the South Bay
regional screenline. The project would not add any trips to the North Bay screenline.
Due to the existing regional transit travel patterns and the proximity of the Embarcadero Station to the
Ferry Terminal, no other regional transit providers (AC Transit, Caltrain, Golden Gate Transit Bus, or
SamTrans) would experience any project-related ridership increase.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

BART also provides additional service in the form of longer trains, shorter headways, and longer
operating hours for special events such as New Year’s Eve, the Fourth of July, Pride Weekend, and
Memorial Day weekend. These special events generally occur during off-peak commute hours for water
transit services, or during weekends or holidays when the water transit commute demand is not present.
Therefore, WETA’s commute-based ridership would be unlikely to affect special event service.
The project’s regional transit trips would not cause additional regional transit services to operate under
overcrowded conditions. Furthermore, the project would not hinder transit operations, nor cause
overcrowding on regional transit providers. In fact, the project would expand the options and capacity of
regional public transportation. In particular, the project would result in more transit options between the
East Bay, Treasure Island, and San Francisco.
NEPA Determination. Increases in transit demand associated with the project under Existing Conditions
would result in an increase to local and regional transit volumes. The only increase that would be adverse
would be the addition of riders to the F Market and Wharves in the PM peak hour, when WETA’s full
projected ridership occurs. WETA is committed to mitigating this impact to the extent feasible.
However, because the feasibility of mitigation is still being evaluated, the project’s impact on the
operation of the F Market and Wharves would remain adverse.
CEQA Determination. Increases in transit demand associated with the project under Existing
Conditions would result in a minor increase to local and regional transit volumes. The only increase that
would be potentially significant would be the addition of riders to the F Market and Wharves in the PM
peak hour, when WETA’s full projected ridership occurs. WETA is committed to mitigating this impact
to the extent feasible. However, because the feasibility of mitigation is still being evaluated, the project’s
impact on the operation of the F Market and Wharves would remain significant and unavoidable.
Impact 3.2-3: Potential Impacts to Pedestrian Facilities in Existing Conditions
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative in existing conditions, there would be no changes to water transit service
or the Ferry Terminal facility from what currently exists. Therefore, there would be no impacts from the
No Action Alternative.
Action Alternative
The project would accommodate an increase in the capacity of the water transit system, which would
therefore increase the number of passengers arriving to and departing from the Ferry Terminal. As shown
in Table 3.2-13, the majority of passengers would arrive at and depart from the Ferry Terminal by
walking. Pedestrian trips to and from the project site would include walking trips, and linked trips to and
from local and regional transit stops.
According to CCSF guidelines, causing substantial overcrowding on sidewalks or potentially hazardous
conditions for pedestrians would be considered significant. For this analysis, the degradation of the LOS
for pedestrian crossing facilities from D to E, or from E to F, would be considered an adverse and
significant impact.
The greatest amount of pedestrian crosswalk traffic, as detailed in the Transportation Impact Study, is
centered at the intersections of Drumm Street and California Street (No. 4), Drumm Street/Main Street
and Market Street (No. 5), Spear Street and Market Street (No. 8), and The Embarcadero and Market
Street Northbound and Southbound (No. 16/17) during the AM peak hour; and Drumm Street/Main Street
and Market Street (No. 5), Spear Street and Market Street (No. 8), and The Embarcadero and Market
Street Northbound and Southbound (No. 16/17) during the PM peak hour.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

The crosswalks at The Embarcadero and Market Street Northbound (No. 16) and The Embarcadero and
Market Street Southbound (No. 17) would have the greatest increase in the number of project-related
pedestrians (1,757 and 1,704 pedestrians, respectively). The number of project-related pedestrians for
these two crosswalks is considerably higher than others because they provide a direct path from the Ferry
Terminal and Ferry Building to the F Market and Wharves Muni Metro line stop on Justin Herman Plaza;
the BART/Muni Embarcadero Station; and Market Street.
Pedestrians would access the Ferry Terminal by either crossing The Embarcadero at one of nine study
intersection crosswalks (No. 14 through No. 19B), or by entering the study area on the sidewalk along the
eastern side of The Embarcadero. The resulting LOSs for the ten intersections most impacted by the project
are given in Table 3.2-19. Compared to the Existing Conditions, the LOS for the crosswalks at intersections
15A, 15B, and 17 drop from LOS A to LOS F during the AM and PM peak hours, due to the narrow widths of
these crosswalks. This would be an adverse and potentially significant impact.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

It should be noted that although The Embarcadero and Market Street Northbound and The Embarcadero
and Market Street Southbound crosswalks generally experience the same number of pedestrians, they
would operate with LOS C and LOS F, respectively. This is attributed to the differences in crosswalk
width. Although The Embarcadero and Market Street Northbound crosswalk is approximately 83 feet
wide, The Embarcadero and Market Street Southbound crosswalk is approximately 38 feet wide, less than
half the width. Because crosswalk LOS is measured as square feet per pedestrian, there is a clear
difference in LOS even though the two crosswalks accommodate similar numbers of pedestrians.
The increase in passengers may result in more frequent temporary congestion of pedestrian traffic near the
Ferry Terminal. Based on the observations of water transit passenger circulation at the Ferry Terminal
described in the Pedestrian Conditions subsection of Section 3.2.2, Affected Environment, water transit
passengers using the existing Gates B and E as well as new Gates A, F, and G, would not be expected to
pass through the Ferry Plaza area; instead, water transit passengers traveling between the Ferry Terminal
and origins and destinations in San Francisco would add to the pedestrian demand along the northern and
southern perimeters of and within the Ferry Building area. The proposed project circulation improvements
in the North and South Basin would improve pedestrian circulation on site, reducing bottlenecks, and the
potential that pedestrian flow would be concentrated along the driveway at the southern end of the Ferry
Building that also serves as a fire lane. The creation of the Embarcadero Plaza in the South Basin would
also allow water transit passengers accessing Gates E, F, and G easier access to the gates, without interfering
with Ferry Building patrons or water transit passengers accessing Gates C and D, and reducing crossflow.
At the main entrance of the Ferry Building, potential pedestrian traffic congestion may still be increased
because water transit passengers traveling to and from the Ferry Terminal would meet people using the
Embarcadero Promenade, where cross-flows of pedestrians would meet.
Farther from the Ferry Terminal, pedestrian vehicle, and/or bicycle traffic congestion may occur at
crosswalks across The Embarcadero near the Ferry Building, and at curb cuts along the Embarcadero
Promenade as the volume of pedestrian activity increases in the area. Near the Ferry Terminal, these
locations would include curb cuts at the intersection of The Embarcadero and Washington Street near
Pier 1; at The Embarcadero Midblock at the Ferry Building Northbound; near The Embarcadero and
Market Street Northbound; near the southern side of the Ferry Building at the F Market and Wharves turn
onto The Embarcadero; near The Embarcadero and Mission Street; and at The Embarcadero and Howard
Street. However, pedestrian and crosswalk analysis indicates that the project-related pedestrian increases
would only result in a potentially adverse and significant impact at two intersections, as discussed above.
As mentioned in the intersection analysis section, the increase of pedestrians at the unsignalized and
uncontrolled intersection of Steuart Street and Market Street could be accommodated within the existing
crosswalk area.
Additionally, as a part of the proposed project, pedestrian circulation improvements would be constructed
in both the North Basin (north of the Ferry Building) and the South Basin (south of the Ferry Building),
including improvements of the marginal wharf in the North Basin, creation of the Embarcadero Plaza and
East Bayside Promenade in the South Basin, and repairs and improvements to the South Apron of the
Agriculture Building, all of which would be Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant.
For the two crosswalks in the Existing Conditions Plus Project that would be potentially adversely and
significantly impacted (The Embarcadero Midblock at the Ferry Building Southbound and Northbound
[No. 15A/15B] and The Embarcadero and Market Street Southbound [No. 17]), mitigation measures
could reduce project impacts. For The Embarcadero Midblock at the Ferry Building Southbound and
Northbound (No. 15A/15B), Mitigation Measure TRANS-1 requires that WETA enter into an agreement
with SFMTA to modify the pedestrian crosswalk timing, which would improve pedestrian flow without
resulting in a drop in intersection LOS. For The Embarcadero and Market Street Southbound (No. 17),
Mitigation Measure TRANS-2 requires that WETA enter into an agreement with SFMTA to widen the
crosswalk to 72 feet, which would improve pedestrian flow. Both of these mitigation measures are

Consequences, and Mitigation

discussed in more detail Section 3.2.4, Mitigation Measures. Implementation of these measures could
reduce the potential impacts at these crosswalks to a not adverse and less-than-significant level.
However, SFMTA and the San Francisco Department of Public Works (SFDPW) would need to examine
the signal timing progression, pedestrian crossing time requirements, and plans for crosswalk widening in
greater detail prior to implementation of the mitigation measures, to determine if the impacts would be
fully mitigated. Due to this uncertainty, for the purposes of the EIS/EIR, these impacts would still be
considered significant and adverse.
NEPA Determination. Increases in pedestrian circulation associated with the project under Existing
Conditions would result in substantial overcrowding for three study area crosswalks, resulting in a potentially
adverse impact. Preliminary analysis indicates that Mitigation Measures TRANS-1 and TRANS-2 could
reduce the potential impacts. However, SFMTA and SFDPW would need to examine the signal timing
progression, pedestrian crossing time requirements, and plans for crosswalk widening in greater detail prior to
implementation of the mitigation measures, to determine if the impacts would be fully mitigated. Due to this
uncertainty, for the purposes of the EIS/EIR, these impacts would be considered adverse.
CEQA Determination. Increases in pedestrian circulation associated with the project under Existing
Conditions would result in substantial overcrowding for three study area crosswalks, resulting in a
potentially significant impact. Preliminary analysis indicates that Mitigation Measures TRANS-1
and TRANS-2 would reduce the potential impacts to a less-than-significant level. However, SFMTA and
SFDPW would need to examine the signal timing progression, pedestrian crossing time requirements, and
plans for crosswalk widening in greater detail prior to implementation of the mitigation measures, to
determine if the impacts would be fully mitigated. Due to this uncertainty, for the purposes of the
EIS/EIR, these impacts would be considered significant and unavoidable.
Impact 3.2-4: Potential Impacts to Bicycle Facilities in Existing Conditions
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative in existing conditions, there would be no changes to water transit service
or the Ferry Terminal facility from what currently exists. Therefore, there would be no impacts from the
No Action Alternative.
Action Alternative
The project would accommodate an increase in the capacity of the water transit system, and therefore the
number of passengers approaching and leaving the Ferry Terminal. As shown in Table 3.2-13,
6.4 percent of these passengers would arrive and depart from the Ferry Terminal by bicycling. Like
pedestrians, bicyclists would access the Ferry Terminal by either crossing The Embarcadero at one of
nine study intersections (No. 14 through No. 19B), or by entering the study area on the sidewalk along the
eastern side of The Embarcadero. Bicyclists would be expected to continue to use existing bicycle lanes
and routes in the study area. The project would add large bicycle volumes relative to the existing volume
at some intersections. However, the project would add fewer than 48 bicyclists in the AM peak hour, and
fewer than 54 bicyclists in the PM peak hour to the intersections in the study area. In addition, as noted
previously, a mix of bicycles, pedestrians, and automobiles is present along the Embarcadero Promenade
and roadway, and the implementation of the project would increase the numbers of pedestrians and
bicyclists to this already congested area, potentially increasing curbside congestion.
The project would also improve bicycle circulation and facilities in the area through the construction of
circulation improvements (e.g., creation of the Embarcadero Promenade and East Bayside Promenade)
that would substantially increase the space available for pedestrian and bicycle circulation in the Ferry
Building area, and would include additional bicycle racks as well. In addition, the project includes a
wayfinding signage program to be coordinated with the Port that would encourage bicyclists to walk

bicycles across the fire lane/driveway on the southern end of the Ferry Building, and while near the Ferry
Terminal. Installing signage encouraging bicyclists to walk bicycles until they are safe to ride would help
to reduce the number of pedestrian-bicycle conflicts. The new WETA vessels also include greater bicycle
storage capacity onboard, which would allow more commuters to bring their bicycles on board, as they
desire, further enhancing regional bicycle commuting access.
Overall, the project would not cause potentially hazardous conditions for bicyclists, or substantially
interfere with bicycle accessibility.
NEPA Determination. Overall, the project would not cause potentially hazardous conditions for
bicyclists, or substantially interfere with bicycle accessibility. Therefore, the project would not have an
adverse impact on bicycle facilities and bicycle travel in the vicinity of the project site.
CEQA Determination. Overall, the project would not cause potentially hazardous conditions for
bicyclists, or substantially interfere with bicycle accessibility. Therefore, the project would have a lessthan-significant impact on bicycle facilities and bicycle travel in the vicinity of the project site.
Construction Impacts
The No Action Alternative would not result in any physical changes to the Ferry Terminal, and no
construction activities would be required. Therefore, there would be no construction impacts to
transportation and circulation.
Impact 3.2-5: Potential Impact of Construction-Related Activities on Transportation and
Circulation
Construction is estimated to take a maximum of 3.5 years, and typical hours of construction would be on
weekdays and weekends between 7:00 AM and 8:00 PM. Most of the fabrication of materials for
construction (e.g., new gates, floats, and piles) would take place off site and delivered to the project site
primarily via barges. Staging and loading activities would generally occur on site. The majority of
construction staging would be conducted from barges in the project area to reduce conflicts with the
traffic lanes, parking areas, and sidewalks near the project area. As shown on Figure 2-9, only a portion
of the project area would be used for construction activities. Construction activities would not encroach
on or block access to the Ferry Plaza, the Ferry Building, or Embarcadero Promenade. The existing fire
lane/driveway south of the Ferry Building would not be obstructed during construction, allowing the other
businesses and entities in the project area (i.e., Ferry Building tenants, Carnelian by the Bay, Golden Gate
Transit, BART) to continue their normal operations during construction.
In the event that a temporary traffic lane, parking lane, or sidewalk closure would be necessary for
concrete deliveries—by truck, for example—the closure would be coordinated and reviewed by SFMTA
to lessen the effects of the construction-related activities. All traffic-lane closures and sidewalk closures
are subject to review and approval by SFDPW and the Transportation Advisory Staff Committee.
Signage with directions to the offices and businesses in the project area would be provided, if necessary,
to ensure that effects on normal business operations would be minimized. Also, the project contractor
would have to coordinate with the Street Operations and Special Events Office at Muni to coordinate the
schedule of construction activities and to decrease any potential impacts construction activities may have
on transit services. Regular communication between the project sponsor, WETA, and CCSF would
ensure that transportation disruptions during the construction phase would be kept at a minimum.
Truck deliveries would vary depending on the construction activity taking place, as described in
Section 2.4.7, Construction Deliveries and Staffing. During the peak construction activities, it is assumed
that up to 15 to 20 trucks would access the site daily to make for concrete deliveries—for example, for
South Basin circulation improvements. It is estimated that the construction trucks would use nearby

Consequences, and Mitigation

U.S. Highway 101 and I-80 to reach available disposal sites.
The primary route to reach
U.S. Highway 101 and I-80 would include The Embarcadero, Howard Street, Folsom Street, First Street,
Fourth Street, and Fifth Street. Truck staging, loading activities, and unloading activities would generally
occur on site. The presence of construction trucks would result in the temporary decrease in roadway
capacities due to the slower speeds and wider turning radii of construction trucks, and may affect
vehicular and transit operations during this time; however, the construction phase and presence of
construction trucks would be temporary and intermittent.
Between 4 and 25 construction workers would be assigned to tasks at the project site on a daily basis,
depending on the construction activity taking place, as described in Section 2.4.7, Construction Deliveries
and Staffing. It is expected that most construction workers would use public transit to access the project
site; however, two or three parking spaces would be provided on site within the construction zone. Any
other parking demand, which would be minimal, would be accommodated via nearby parking garages and
lots. Meter parking and residential parking zones near the project site would preclude all-day on-street
parking by construction workers in residential areas or immediately adjacent to the project area. The
available parking supply would be able to accommodate the daily number of construction workers.
Therefore, impacts to the transportation and circulation network would not be adverse, and would be less
than significant.
However, to further reduce the potential temporary disruptions to transportation and circulation,
consistent with construction management best practices, WETA will implement Mitigation
Measure TRANS-3, Construction Circulation Management. WETA will meet with the Traffic
Engineering Division of SFMTA, the SFFD, Muni, and the San Francisco Planning Department to
determine the best methods and avoidance measures to minimize traffic congestion and potential negative
effects to pedestrian or bicycle circulation in the project area during construction of the proposed project.
Additional avoidance measures that could be implemented include encouraging carpooling and transit use
for construction workers, managing construction traffic on Mission Street to avoid peak-period
congestion, informing the public of construction schedules and activities, and posting of wayfinding
signage in the project area for pedestrians and bicycles.
NEPA Determination. Project construction would not have an adverse impact on transportation and
circulation. However, WETA would implement Mitigation Measure TRANS-3 to further reduce the
potential temporary disruptions to transportation and circulation.
CEQA Determination. Project construction would have a less-than-significant impact on transportation
and circulation. However, WETA would implement Mitigation Measure TRANS-3 to further reduce the
potential temporary disruptions to transportation and circulation.
Cumulative Impacts
Impact 3.2-6: Potential Cumulative Traffic Impacts to Study Area Intersections in Future
(2035) Conditions
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative (i.e., Future [2035] with the No Project Alternative), no new gates or
additional boarding capacity would be provided to accommodate new WETA services, or the expansion of
existing WETA services. Only increases in passenger and water transit vessel arrivals that could be
accommodated with the existing facilities at the Ferry Terminal (i.e., at existing Gate B and Gate E) would
occur as a part of the Future (2035) with the No Project Alternative. The existing infrastructure available to
WETA at the Ferry Terminal could accommodate up to 7,800 WETA passengers per weekday; 2,339
passengers during the AM peak period, and 2,641 passengers during the PM peak period. For the purposes

Consequences, and Mitigation

of assessing the project’s potential impacts in 2035, the Future (2035) Plus Project is compared to the Future
(2035) with the No Project Alternative (and analyzed below under the Action Alternative). This comparison
most accurately assesses the project’s effects on the traffic, pedestrian, transit, and bicycle circulation, and
enables an evaluation of the project’s incremental effect on future conditions.
Action Alternative
Similar to the Existing Conditions Plus Project, LOS calculations were performed at the 19 study
intersections for the weekday AM and PM peak hours for the Future (2035) Plus Project Condition, as
detailed in the Transportation Impact Study. Figure 3.2-6 illustrates the traffic volumes for the study
intersections expected in 2035. The project would not generate any vehicle trips during either peak hour,
but an intersection LOS analysis has been completed to analyze the effect of pedestrians and bicycle
traffic on intersection operations.
As detailed in the Transportation Impact Study, the project-related additional pedestrian and bicycle
traffic results in relatively small changes during the AM peak hour in the average delay per vehicle at the
study intersections, when compared to the Future (2035) with the No Project Alternative. The majority of
intersections are unaffected, and all intersections experience less than a 7-second increase in average
delay. Only one intersection (Drumm Street and Clay Street [No. 2]) experiences a drop in LOS, going
from LOS B to LOS C. The intersection at The Embarcadero and Howard Street (No. 19) has an LOS E
for Future (2035) Plus Project; however, the increased pedestrian and bicycle volumes due to the project
do not result in a change in the expected delay, or a degradation of LOS.
For the PM peak hour, the additional pedestrian and bicycle traffic also results in relatively small changes
in the average delay per vehicle at the study intersections, when compared to Future (2035) with the No
Project Alternative. As with the AM peak, the majority of intersections are unaffected. All intersections
experience less than a 3-second increase in average delay.
As mentioned previously, the intersection of Steuart Street and Market Street is unsignalized and
uncontrolled, and cannot be analyzed from a quantitative standpoint. Because the project would not add
any vehicle trips to the roadway network, the number of vehicles traveling through this intersection would
not increase. The project would add approximately 1,338 pedestrians to the northbound approach
crosswalk, but this crosswalk is approximately 42 feet wide and would be expected to accommodate the
increase in pedestrians from an LOS standpoint, as detailed in the pedestrian analysis section.
Increases in pedestrian and bicycle volumes associated with the project under Future (2035) Plus Project
would result in only minor increases to traffic delay at study area intersections.
NEPA Determination. Increases in pedestrian and bicycle volumes associated with the project under
Future (2035) Conditions would result in only minor increases to traffic delay for the study intersections,
which would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. Increases in pedestrian and bicycle volumes associated with the project under
Future (2035) Conditions would result in only minor increases to traffic delay for the study intersections,
resulting in a less-than-significant impact.
Impact 3.2-7: Potential Cumulative Impacts to Transit in Future (2035) Conditions

Under the No Action Alternative (i.e., Future [2035] with the No Project Alternative), no new gates or
additional boarding capacity would be provided to accommodate new WETA services, or the expansion

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

of existing WETA services. Only increases in passenger and water transit vessel arrivals that could be
accommodated with the existing facilities at the Ferry Terminal (i.e., at existing Gate B and Gate E) would
occur as a part of the Future (2035) with the No Project Alternative. The existing infrastructure available to
WETA at the Ferry Terminal could accommodate up to 7,800 WETA passengers per weekday; 2,339
passengers during the AM peak period, and 2,641 passengers during the PM peak period. For the purposes
of assessing the project’s potential impacts in 2035, the Future (2035) Plus Project is compared to the Future
(2035) with the No Project Alternative (and analyzed below under the Action Alternative). This comparison
most accurately assesses the project’s effects on the traffic, pedestrian, transit, and bicycle circulation, and
enables an evaluation of the project’s incremental effect on future conditions.
Action Alternative
As with the Existing Conditions analysis, an increase in utilization for a transit line or screenline that results in
the transit service operating over the capacity utilization standard (i.e., 85 percent for Muni and 100 percent for
regional screenlines) for the Future (2035) Plus Project Condition would be considered adverse and significant.
In addition, if a transit line (or screenline) is already operating over capacity standard (i.e., 85 percent for Muni
and 100 percent for regional screenlines), and the project adds more than 5 percent of the total projected riders
with the project, the project’s impact would be considered adverse and significant. For local and regional
screenline analysis, only additional trips in the peak direction of travel were considered.
Local Transit
As detailed in the Transportation Impact Study, for the Future (2035) Plus Project, the additional transit
demand from the project would not increase utilization of any Muni screenline or individual line beyond
the 85 percent capacity utilization standard. During the AM peak hour, 1,059 Muni trips would be added;
however, only 198 of these trips would be in the peak direction. During the PM peak hour, 1,145 Muni
trips would be added; however, only 218 of these trips would be in the peak direction. The maximum
number of passengers that would be added to any of the transit corridors analyzed would be 26 passengers
(added to the Kearny/Stockton Transit Corridor). The maximum number of passengers that would be
added to any of the screenlines analyzed would be 120 passengers (added to the Northeast Screenline).
During the AM and PM peak hours, several of the screenlines and transit corridors would operate above
85 percent utilization even without implementation of the project. However, the project’s incremental
contribution to these already overcrowded screenlines and transit corridors would be less than 4 percent—
below the 5 percent increase threshold.
As shown on Table 3.2-20 (on the following page), several individual Muni lines would also be expected
to operate above the 85 percent utilization standard in the peak direction of travel during both the AM
peak hour and PM peak hour, even without implementation of the project.
In the AM peak hour, six Muni lines would operate over capacity, even without implementation of the
proposed project. However, the project would add only a small number of trips to these lines (fewer than
13 passengers). The project-related increase in demand to these lines would be between 0.09 percent and
1.3 percent, less than the 5 percent project-related increase-in-demand threshold.
In the PM Peak Hour, nine Muni lines would operate over capacity, even without implementation of the
proposed project. However, the project-related increase in demand for these lines would be between
0.08 percent and 4.9 percent, less than the 5 percent project-related increase-in-demand threshold.
Therefore, although the project would result in an additional 198 Muni trips in the peak direction in the
AM peak hour and 218 Muni trips in the PM peak hour in the peak direction of travel, the transit-related
trips would not significantly contribute to overutilization of Muni services.

Bolded text indicates that the transit line would operate above 85 percent capacity used, Muni’s threshold. This does not necessarily
indicate that the project has a significant or adverse impact on the transit line.
The 2035 baseline capacities and ridership have been projected based on the existing and 2035 screenline numbers provided by SFMTA. The
ridership increment from the project is based on estimates of transit access or egress for project-generated water transit passengers, based on
the WETA model and ridership survey estimates. The percent changes between the existing and 2035 screenline numbers were applied to
individual transit line numbers based on the respective screenline in which each individual line is grouped.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Regional Screenline Analysis
The ridership, capacity, and utilization for the regional screenline groupings for Future (2035) Plus
Project Conditions were analyzed. As with Muni screenlines, only additional trips in the peak direction
of travel are included.
During the AM peak hour, the East Bay and North Bay inbound screenlines are over-utilized, operating at
127 percent and 121 percent capacity, respectively. The only trips that would be added to the East Bay
screenline during the AM peak hour would be water transit trips on WETA service. The project would
not add any trips to the North Bay screenline during the AM peak hour. The project would add 16 South
Bay BART trips during the AM peak hour in the peak direction. With these trips, the South Bay
screenline would operate at 64 percent utilization, and the additional trips associated with the project
would result in less than a 5 percent increase of the overall AM peak-hour demand.
During the PM peak hour, East Bay and North Bay outbound screenlines are overutilized, operating at
104 percent and 126 percent capacity, respectively. The only trips that would be added to the East Bay
screenline during the PM peak hour would be water transit trips on WETA service. The project would
not add any trips to the North Bay screenline during the PM peak hour. The project would add 18 South
Bay BART trips during the PM peak hour in the peak direction. With these trips, the South Bay
screenline would operate at 55 percent utilization, and the additional trips associated with the project
would result in less than a 5 percent increase in overall PM peak-hour demand.
As described under Impact 3.2-2, WETA’s commute-based ridership would also be unlikely to affect
BART’s special event service, which generally occurs after hours and on weekends.
NEPA Determination. Increases in transit demand associated with the project under Future (2035)
Conditions would result in increases to local and regional transit volumes. However, all increases would
be below the thresholds of significance, and therefore would not adversely affect transit services.
CEQA Determination. Increases in transit demand associated with the project under Future (2035)
Conditions would result in a minor increase to local and regional transit volumes. All increases would be
below the thresholds of significance, resulting in a less-than-significant impact to transit services.
Impact 3.2-8: Potential Cumulative Impacts to Pedestrian Facilities in Future (2035)
Conditions
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative (i.e., Future [2035] with the No Project Alternative), no new gates or
additional boarding capacity would be provided to accommodate new WETA services, or the expansion of
existing WETA services. Only increases in passenger and water transit vessel arrivals that could be
accommodated with the existing facilities at the Ferry Terminal (i.e., at existing Gate B and Gate E) would
occur as a part of the Future (2035) with the No Project Alternative. The existing infrastructure available to
WETA at the Ferry Terminal could accommodate up to 7,800 WETA passengers per weekday; 2,339
passengers during the AM peak period, and 2,641 passengers during the PM peak period. For the purposes
of assessing the project’s potential impacts in 2035, the Future (2035) Plus Project is compared to the Future
(2035) with the No Project Alternative (and analyzed below under the Action Alternative). This comparison
most accurately assesses the project’s effects on the traffic, pedestrian, transit, and bicycle circulation, and
enables an evaluation of the project’s incremental effect on future conditions.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Midblock at the Ferry Building Southbound and Northbound (No. 15A/15B) to drop to LOS F during the
AM and PM peak hours, an adverse and potentially significant impact.
As mentioned in the intersection analysis section, the increase of pedestrians at the unsignalized and
uncontrolled intersection of Steuart Street and Market Street could be accommodated within the existing
crosswalk area.
As also described for the Existing Conditions, for the Future (2035) Plus Project, the same potential for
additional congestion and conflicts between bicycles, pedestrians, and automobiles along the
Embarcadero Promenade and roadway would exist. In addition, BART’s Ferry Plaza Barrier Project
would be expected to change the pedestrian circulation patterns in the project area in the future.
However, these changes would affect pedestrian circulation on the Ferry Plaza; and, as described in the
Pedestrian Conditions subsection of Section 3.2.2, Affected Environment, passengers using WETA’s
existing and new water transit services would not be expected to use the Ferry Plaza area for access or
egress to the gates. The proposed project would also improve pedestrian circulation conditions with new
pedestrian and bicycle enhancements constructed in the Ferry Terminal area.
For the two crosswalks that would be potentially adversely impacted (The Embarcadero Midblock at the
Ferry Building Southbound and Northbound [No. 15A/15B] and The Embarcadero and Market Street
Southbound [No. 17]), mitigation measures could reduce project impacts. For The Embarcadero
Midblock at the Ferry Building Southbound and Northbound (No. 15A/15B), Mitigation
Measure TRANS-1 requires that WETA enter into an agreement with SFMTA to modify the pedestrian
crosswalk timing, which would improve pedestrian flow without resulting in a drop in intersection LOS.
For The Embarcadero and Market Street Southbound (No. 17), Mitigation Measure TRANS-2 requires
that WETA enter into an agreement with SFMTA to widen the crosswalk to 72 feet, which would
improve pedestrian flow. Both of these mitigation measures are discussed in more detail Section 3.2.4,
Mitigation Measures.
NEPA Determination. Increases in pedestrian circulation associated with the project under Future
(2035) Conditions would result in substantial overcrowding for three study area crosswalks, resulting in a
an adverse impact. Preliminary analysis indicates that Mitigation Measures TRANS-1 and TRANS-2
would reduce the potential impacts. However, SFMTA and SFDPW would need to examine the signal
timing progression, pedestrian crossing time requirements, and plans for crosswalk widening in greater
detail prior to implementation of the mitigation measures, to determine if the impacts would be fully
mitigated. Due to this uncertainty, for the purposes of the EIS/EIR, these impacts would still be
considered adverse.
CEQA Determination. Increases in pedestrian circulation associated with the project under Future
(2035) Plus Project conditions would result in substantial overcrowding for three study area crosswalks,
resulting in a potentially significant impact.
Preliminary analysis indicates that Mitigation
Measures TRANS-1 and TRANS-2 would reduce the potential impacts to a less-than-significant level.
However, SFMTA and SFDPW would need to examine the signal timing progression, pedestrian crossing
time requirements, and plans for crosswalk widening in greater detail prior to implementation of the
mitigation measures, to determine if the impacts would be fully mitigated. Due to this uncertainty, for the
purposes of the EIS/EIR, these impacts would be considered significant and unavoidable.

of existing WETA services. Only increases in passenger and water transit vessel arrivals that could be
accommodated with the existing facilities at the Ferry Terminal (i.e., at existing Gate B and Gate E)
would occur as a part of the Future (2035) with the No Project Alternative. The existing infrastructure
available to WETA at the Ferry Terminal could accommodate up to 7,800 WETA passengers per
weekday; 2,339 passengers during the AM peak period, and 2,641 passengers during the PM peak period.
For the purposes of assessing the project’s potential impacts in 2035, the Future (2035) Plus Project is
compared to the Future (2035) with the No Project Alternative (and analyzed below under the Action
Alternative). This comparison most accurately assesses the project’s effects on the traffic, pedestrian,
transit, and bicycle circulation, and enables an evaluation of the project’s incremental effect on future
conditions.
Action Alternative
The impacts to bicycle facilities and bicycle accessibility in the Future (2035) Plus Project Condition would be
similar to those described for Existing Conditions. According to CCSF guidelines, causing potentially
hazardous conditions for bicyclists or substantially interfering with bicycle accessibility would be considered
potentially adverse and significant. Bicyclists would access the Ferry Terminal by either crossing The
Embarcadero at ten of the study intersections (No. 14 through No. 19), or by entering the area on the sidewalk
along the eastern side of The Embarcadero. Bicyclists are expected to continue to use existing bicycle lanes
and routes in the study area. The project may add large bicycle volumes relative to existing volumes; however,
the project would add fewer than 50 bicyclists in either the AM or PM peak hour to the study intersections.
As also described for the Existing Conditions, for the Future (2035) Plus Project, the same potential for
additional congestion between bicycles, pedestrians, and automobiles along the Embarcadero Promenade
and roadway would exist. However, the project would also improve conditions with new pedestrian and
bicycle enhancements constructed in the Ferry Terminal area; and new WETA vessels also include greater
bicycle storage capacity onboard, allowing more commuters to bring their bicycles onboard as they desire,
further enhancing regional bicycle commuting access.
NEPA Determination. Overall, the project would not cause potentially hazardous conditions for
bicyclists, or substantially interfere with bicycle accessibility. Therefore, the project would not adversely
impact bicycle facilities and bicycle travel in the vicinity of the project site.
CEQA Determination. Overall, the project would not cause potentially hazardous conditions for
bicyclists, or substantially interfere with bicycle accessibility. Therefore, the project would have a lessthan-significant impact on bicycle facilities and bicycle travel in the vicinity of the project site.
3.2.4

Mitigation Measures

Mitigation Measure TRANS-1: Implement The Embarcadero Midblock at the Ferry
Building Southbound and Northbound (No. 15A/15B) Intersection Adjustments
WETA will enter into an agreement with SFMTA to modify the intersection signal timing for The
Embarcadero Midblock at the Ferry Building Southbound and Northbound (No. 15A/15B), to remove the
northbound-southbound movement (No. 9); and distribute the time to the northbound movement (Turning
Movement No. 2/Turning Movement No. 5) and southbound movement (Turning Movement No. 10), to
allow for longer crossing times for pedestrians. This adjustment would result in the LOS for the
crosswalk to be improved to LOS D for the respective AM and PM peak hours, without causing
intersection LOS to drop to an unacceptable level. SFMTA has discretion over the specific timing
adjustments, and the timing of the implementation of any changes affecting the transportation network in
San Francisco.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Mitigation Measure TRANS-2: Implement The Embarcadero and Market West (No. 17)
Crosswalk Adjustments
WETA will enter into an agreement with SFMTA to widen the pedestrian crosswalk at The Embarcadero
and Market Street Southbound (No. 17) to a minimum of 72 feet. This adjustment would result in the
LOS for the crosswalk to be improved to LOS D, without causing a drop in intersection LOS for traffic.
The existing crosswalk at this location is 42 feet in width; therefore, it would require a 30-foot widening
(for a minimum width of 72 feet). However, there are a number of signs, poles, and other street furniture
located north and south of the crosswalk on either side of the roadway that could have to be relocated to
allow the crosswalk to be widened. These include:


Along the western side of The Embarcadero, 2.5 feet north of the crosswalk, there is a traffic signal;
and 15 feet north of the crosswalk, there is a manhole.



Along the western side of The Embarcadero, south of the crosswalk, there is a pedestrian crossing
signal 2 feet from the crosswalk; a newspaper vending box 8 to 16 feet from the crosswalk; a street
light 20 feet from the crosswalk; a “no parking” sign 24 feet from the crosswalk; and a traffic signal
30 feet from the crosswalk. A tree is located approximately 44 feet south of the crosswalk.



Along the eastern side The Embarcadero, a traffic signal and pedestrian call button are located 1 foot
north of the crosswalk.



Along the eastern side The Embarcadero, a pedestrian crossing signal is located at the southern edge
of the crosswalk, a decorative spherical bollard is 23 feet south of the crosswalk, and a traffic signal is
32 feet south of the crosswalk.

SFMTA has discretion over the specific adjustments and the timing of the implementation of any changes
affecting the transportation network in San Francisco, and SFDPW will be required to review and approve
any relocation of manholes.
Mitigation Measure TRANS-3: Construction Circulation Management
WETA will meet with the Traffic Engineering Division of SFMTA, the SFFD, Muni, and the San
Francisco Planning Department to determine the best methods and avoidance measures to minimize
traffic congestion and potential negative effects to pedestrian or bicycle circulation in the project area
during construction of the proposed project. Additional avoidance measures that could be implemented
include encouraging carpooling and transit use for construction workers, managing construction traffic on
Mission Street to avoid peak-period congestion, informing the public of construction schedules and
activities, and posting of wayfinding signage in the project area for pedestrians and bicycles.

LAND USE AND LAND USE PLANNING

3.3.1

Introduction to the Analysis

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

This section describes the existing land uses in the project area; presents the land use planning context for
development at the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal), including applicable plans
and policies, and evaluates the potential land use impacts from implementation of the No Action and the
Action Alternative. As described below, the proposed project would have less-than-significant impacts
on land use.
3.3.2

Affected Environment

This section describes existing land uses and land use planning within the project area and the study area.
It also provides a regulatory framework describing policies and plans applicable to land uses within the
study area. For the purpose of this analysis, the project’s study area encompasses the project area and the
parcels within approximately 1,000 feet of the project site.
Existing Setting
Land Use
Study Area
The proposed project would be within downtown San Francisco’s diverse mix of urban uses. Although
the downtown area is dominated by high-rise buildings, the area closest to the water and in the study area
is characterized by smaller scale commercial structures and large open spaces, such as Justin Herman
Plaza (see Section 3.4, Parklands and Recreation, for discussion of area parklands and open spaces). The
northern part of the study area is adjacent to Golden Gateway, a waterfront neighborhood containing lowto high-rise residential and commercial development. To the west and south of the project area is the
downtown commercial district.
Project Area
Land uses in the project area include commercial, recreation, open space, public transportation, and
maritime activities.
The San Francisco Ferry Building (Ferry Building) is three stories tall and includes 65,000 square feet of
retail space at the ground level; and 175,000 square feet at the second and third levels, which house office
space and the hearing room of the San Francisco Port Commission. The area in front of the Ferry
Building is used on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays for the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market. Other
events are sometimes held in the area in front of the Ferry Building as well. On the San Francisco Bay
side of the Ferry Building are a 30-foot-wide wharf and the Ferry Plaza, which are also used on Saturdays
by the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market. The Ferry Plaza provides a mix of public services, including the
Golden Gate Ferry Terminal; public access on top of the Golden Gate Terminal and along the southern
and eastern sides of the Plaza; Carnelian by the Bay, a restaurant and lounge; and open space in the center
of the plaza. Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) also has facilities located on and beneath the Ferry Plaza,
and retains approval authority over uses on and near the Ferry Plaza. The Ferry Building and the Ferry
Plaza are leased from the Port of San Francisco (Port) and managed by a private entity, Equity Office
Partners.
The project area also includes active water transit gates: the Golden Gate Ferry Terminal (Gates C
and D), Gate B, and Gate E.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

South of Gate E, on Pier 2, is a restaurant that operates on a short-term lease from the Port. The Ferry
Station Post Office Building, also known as the Agriculture Building, is to the south of the Ferry
Building. It currently contains a mix of office spaces, including Amtrak, which operates a ticket window
from this location.
The City and County of San Francisco (CCSF), through the Port, owns and manages the uses within the
project area. In addition, much of the project area is within the jurisdiction of the San Francisco Bay
Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC). BCDC and the Port have developed joint plans
and policies related to the use and development of the project area, the San Francisco Waterfront Special
Area Plan (SAP) (BCDC, 2000).
General Plan
CCSF and the Port manage the project site according to several plans and policies identified in the
Regulatory Setting below.
Study Area
The area adjacent to the north of the project is designated as General Commercial/Public Trust and
General Commercial; the area across The Embarcadero to the northwest is designated as High-Density
Residential and General Commercial; the area to the west is designated as Public and Downtown Office;
and the area to the south is designated as Public and High-Density Residential (SF Planning, 2003). To
the east of project area is San Francisco Bay. See Figure 3.3-1 for area land uses.
Project Area
The project area is within General Commercial/Public Trust, as designated by the Ferry Building Subarea
Generalized Land Use Map (SF Planning, 2003).
Zoning
Study Area
The area adjacent to the north of the project is composed of C-2 (Community Business); across The
Embarcadero to the northwest is RC-4 (High-Density [1 unit per 200 square feet]); to the west is P
(Public) and C-3-O (Downtown Office); and to the south is C-2 and P. To the east of project area is San
Francisco Bay. See Figure 3.3-1 for area zoning.
Project Area
The project area is within a C-2 zoning district with an 84-foot height restriction and “j” bulk limitation. 1
Areas designated as C-2 are generally characterized by shopping areas with assorted goods and services.
Regulatory Setting
Federal
The proposed project seeks federal funds that would be administered by the Federal Transit
Administration, and as such the project would be subject to the provisions of the National Environmental
Policy Act.

1

“J” corresponds to a maximum bulk limit of 40 feet (San Francisco Municipal Code).

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Coastal Zone Management Act
The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), established in 1972 and administered by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, provides
for management of the nation’s coastal resources. The overall purpose is to balance competing land and
water issues in the coastal zone. Under the federal consistency provisions of the CZMA, federal projects
need to be determined to be consistent with the state’s coastal zone management program and policies
(16 United States Code § 1456). For San Francisco Bay and the project area, the San Francisco BCDC
(discussed below) is the state’s coastal zone management agency responsible for issuing consistency
determinations under the CZMA.
State
At the state level, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (California Public Resources Code
Sections 21000-21178) and the CEQA Guidelines (14 California Code of Regulations 15000-15387) are
the primary policies that require projects to analyze potential impacts to land use, as well as to analyze the
project’s consistency with land use planning policies applicable to the project.
Public Trust Doctrine (California State Lands Commission)
The California State Lands Commission (CSLC) manages lands in California according to the Public
Trust Doctrine. Several of the guiding principles of the Public Trust are:
I.

Lands under the ocean and under navigable streams are owned by the public and held in trust for
the people by government. These are referred to as public trust lands, and include filled lands
formerly under water. Public trust lands cannot be bought and sold like other state-owned lands.
Only in rare cases may the public trust be terminated, and only where consistent with the
purposes and needs of the trust.

II. Uses of trust lands, whether granted to a local agency or administered by the state directly, are
generally limited to those that are water dependent or related, and include commerce, fisheries,
and navigation, environmental preservation and recreation. Public trust uses include, among
others, ports, marinas, docks and wharves, buoys, hunting, commercial and sport fishing, bathing,
swimming, and boating. Public trust lands may also be kept in their natural state for habitat,
wildlife refuges, scientific study, or open space. Ancillary or incidental uses, that is, uses that
directly promote trust uses, are directly supportive and necessary for trust uses, or that
accommodate the public’s enjoyment of trust lands, are also permitted. Examples include
facilities to serve visitors, such as hotels and restaurants, shops, parking lots, and restrooms.
Other examples are commercial facilities that must be located on or directly adjacent to the water,
such as warehouses, container cargo storage, and facilities for the development and production of
oil and gas. Uses that are generally not permitted on public trust lands are those that are not trust
use related, do not serve a public purpose, and can be located on non-waterfront property, such as
residential and nonmaritime related commercial and office uses. While trust lands cannot
generally be alienated from public ownership, uses of trust lands can be carried out by public or
private entities by lease from this CSLC or a local agency grantee. In some cases, such as some
industrial leases, the public may be excluded from public trust lands in order to accomplish a
proper trust use.
III. Because public trust lands are held in trust for all citizens of California, they must be used to
serve statewide, as opposed to purely local, public purposes.
In 1968, under the Burton Act, the State of California transferred jurisdictional responsibility of the San
Francisco waterfront to the City of San Francisco (City). The City, as a condition of the transfer, created

the Port Commission, a department of the City, with the authority to manage the waterfront for the
citizens of California and as public trust lands. As such, the CSLC is considered a trustee agency for this
project. Trust lands are those under navigable waters, including filled lands formerly under water.
Regional
San Francisco Bay Plan
BCDC has permit authority over development of San Francisco Bay and the shoreline pursuant to the
McAteer-Petris Act (California Government Code Section 66000 et seq.). The act requires BCDC to
prepare a “comprehensive and enforceable plan for the conservation of the water of San Francisco Bay
and the development of its shoreline.” BCDC’s jurisdiction includes all tidal areas of San Francisco Bay
up to the line of mean high tide; all areas formerly subject to tidal action that have been filled since
September 17, 1965; and the “shoreline band,” which extends 100 feet inland from and parallel to the San
Francisco Bay shoreline.
BCDC is also the local coastal zone management agency for San Francisco Bay. Therefore, under the
provisions of Section 307 of the federal CZMA (discussed above), federal agencies must assess whether
their actions are consistent with BCDC’s regulations and policies.
BCDC has jurisdiction over all filling, 2 dredging, and changes in use in San Francisco Bay. Furthermore,
BCDC regulates new development within 100 feet of the shoreline subject to tidal action, to ensure that
maximum public access to San Francisco Bay is provided; and ensures that the limited amount of
shoreline suitable for regional high-priority water-oriented uses is reserved for such purposes. A permit
would be needed from BCDC for demolition of piers, construction of new gates, and new deck and pile
construction.
The San Francisco Bay Plan (Bay Plan), adopted in 1969, is BCDC’s policy document specifying goals,
objectives, and policies for BCDC jurisdictional areas (BCDC, 2008). Major conclusions and policies
that are applicable to the proposed project are:
Uses of the Shoreline. All desirable, high priority uses of the Bay and shoreline can be fully
accommodated without substantial Bay filling, and without loss of large natural resource areas. But
shoreline areas suitable for priority uses—ports, water-related industry, airports, wildlife refuges, and
water-related recreation—exist only in limited amount, and should be reserved for these purposes.
Fills in Accord with Bay Plan. A proposed project should be approved if the filling is the minimum
necessary to achieve its purpose, and if it meets one of the following three conditions:
a. The filling is in accord with the Bay Plan policies as to the Bay-related purposes for which
filling may be needed (i.e., ports, water-related industry, and water-related recreation) and is
shown on the Bay Plan maps as likely to be needed; or
b. The filling is in accord with Bay Plan policies as to purposes for which some fill may be
needed if there is no other alternative (i.e., airports, roads, and utility routes); or
c. The filling is in accord with the Bay Plan policies as to minor fills for improving shoreline
appearance or public access.

2

Fill is generally defined as any material in or over the water surface, including pilings, structures placed on pilings, and
floating structures in the San Francisco Bay.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Filling for Public Trust Uses on Publicly-Owned Property Granted in Trust to a Public Agency
by the Legislature Policies Concerning Filling for Public Trust Uses on Publicly-Owned
Property Granted in Trust to a Public Agency by the Legislature
1. Filling should be approved if the filling is undertaken on land granted in trust by the
Legislature to a public agency and the Commission finds that the filling and use proposed on
the fill are consistent with the Public Trust Doctrine, the terms of the legislative trust grant,
and with a Special Area Plan for the area that the Commission has found:
a. Is necessary to the health, safety, and welfare of the public in the entire Bay Area; and
b. Provides for major shoreline parks, regional public access facilities, removal of existing
pile-supported fill, open water basins, increased safety of fills, mechanisms for
implementation, enhanced public views of the Bay, and other benefits to the Bay, all of
which exceed the benefits that could be accomplished through BCDC’s permit authority
for individual projects through the application of other Bay Plan policies.
Additional Bay Plan policies applicable to the proposed project include:
Transportation Policy 5. Ferry terminals should be sited at locations that are near navigable
channels, would not rapidly fill with sediment, and would not significantly impact tidal marshes, tidal
flats, or other valuable wildlife habitat. Wherever possible, terminals should be located near higher
density, mixed-use development served by public transit. Terminal parking facilities should be set
back from the shoreline to allow for public access and enjoyment of San Francisco Bay.
Public Trust. Policy 1. When the Commission takes any action affecting lands subject to the public
trust, it should ensure that the action is consistent with the public trust needs for the area and, in case
of lands subject to legislative grants, should also ensure that the terms of the grant are satisfied and
the project is in furtherance of statewide purposes.
BCDC relies on the CSLC determination that the project use is consistent with public trust. As discussed
above, the Port is the responsible party related to public trust in the project area.
Public Access. Bay Plan findings and policies related to public access (Public Access to the Bay
Findings a through d, Public Access Policies 8 and 9, and Section 66602 of the McAteer-Petris Act) are
discussed in Section 3.4, Parklands and Recreation.
Fish, Other Aquatic Organisms, and Wildlife. Bay Plan policies related to fish, other aquatic
organisms, and wildlife are discussed in Section 3.9, Biological Resources.
Water Surface Area and Volume. Bay Plan policies related to surface area of San Francisco Bay and
the total volume of water are discussed in Section 3.11, Hydrology and Water Quality.
Water Quality. Bay Plan policies related to water quality and water pollution prevention are discussed
in Section 3.11, Hydrology and Water Quality.
Safety of Fills and Seal Level Rise. Bay Plan policies related to flood protection and seal level rise are
discussed in Section 3.11, Hydrology and Water Quality.
San Francisco Waterfront Special Area Plan
The SAP is an amendment to the Bay Plan and focuses exclusively on the San Francisco Waterfront from
India Basin to the Aquatic Park. The SAP was developed in coordination with CCSF and the Port, and
initially adopted by BCDC in 1975. It applies the requirements of the McAteer‐Petris Act and the

provisions of the Bay Plan to the San Francisco waterfront in greater detail than the Bay Plan (BCDC,
2000).
The SAP includes general policies that are applicable to the entire San Francisco waterfront area. The
general policies identify three separate geographic vicinities, each of which have more specific policies
enabling the reuse of specific piers, and facilitating the implementation of public benefits. The project
site is within the Ferry Building Subarea of the Northeastern Waterfront. Policies for the Northeastern
Waterfront geographic vicinity enable the reuse of certain piers along the Northeastern Waterfront, and
facilitate the implementation of a public benefits package. The SAP includes policies related to pier uses,
open water basins and area, plaza areas, and public access. The purpose of the SAP is to reunite the City
with the Northeastern Waterfront by establishing policies to realize the waterfront’s potential as a focal
point for recreation; increase public use and enjoyment of San Francisco Bay and the waterfront; and
support maritime cargo shipping, fisheries, ferries, excursion boats, and other maritime navigation uses of
the waterfront, consistent with BCDC’s San Francisco Bay Area Seaport Plan (see below for discussion
of Seaport Plan). The SAP was amended in 2012 to incorporate findings and policies as they relate to the
America’s Cup Project (BCDC, 2012). This section discusses the elements relevant to land use and
planning; please see Section 3.4, Parklands and Recreation, for discussion of recreational and public
access policies.
The SAP policies related to land use and planning that are applicable to the proposed project are as
follows:
Open Water Areas
Permitted Uses:





Water-Related Recreation
Water Transportation (e.g., ferries, water taxis, and excursion boats)
Bay-Oriented Commercial Recreation and Bay-Oriented Public Assembly
Public Access

Policy 1
Open Water Areas are those areas of San Francisco Bay not designated as Open Water Basins.
Create new Open Water Areas as follows:
b. By March 2013, remove a portion of Pier ½ as part of the 34th America’s Cup Event Project,
retaining only that portion required for retaining a vessel berthing facility and public access.
c. By March 2015, remove the existing shed at Pier 2 after the 34th America’s Cup Event project, to
improve Bay views and public access. Remove the northern portion of Pier 2 as part of the
Downtown Ferry Terminal Phase 2 development project, whichever comes first; or (2) any
reconfiguration of the existing restaurant on Pier 2.
Policy 2
Within Open Water Areas, new fill should be limited only to the following:
a. Minor pile-supported or floating fill for water transportation uses, such as ship and boat berthing
facilities, mooring dolphins, buoys, floats and similar support uses.
b. Minor, pile-supported fill for Bay-oriented commercial recreation and Bay-oriented public
assembly uses. The amount of new pile-supported fill for such uses will be offset by removal of

an equivalent amount of pile-supported fill elsewhere on the Northeastern Waterfront not
otherwise designated as a pier for removal.
c. Areas appropriate for additional ferry terminals.
e. Minor fill for improving shoreline appearance or public access to the Bay, consistent with the
Commission’s regulations.
f.

Seismic and safety repairs to an existing pier that is not being wholly reconstructed.

SAP Public Access Policies 1, 2, and 3; Policy 10, Public Access Siting and Design; Policy 13, Public
Access Design; and General Policy 6, Required Public Access, are applicable to the project and are
discussed in Section 3.4, Parklands and Recreation.
The SAP integrated package of public benefits includes the completion of a waterfront-wide, integrated
public access network, guided by a policy framework for expanding public access; design policies that
promote low-scale development and preserve significant San Francisco Bay views; an implementation
program to fund and construct the plazas and pier removals; and enhancement of San Francisco Bay
views and opportunities to enjoy water areas adjacent to The Embarcadero.
San Francisco Bay Trail Plan
See the Regulatory Settings in Section 3.4, Parklands and Recreation, for the relevant recreation and
public access policies related to the proposed project and San Francisco Bay.
The San Francisco Bay Area Seaport Plan
The San Francisco Bay Area Seaport Plan (Seaport Plan) is a joint regional policy document of BCDC
and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. The Seaport Plan constitutes the maritime element of
Metropolitan Transportation Commission’s Regional Transportation Plan, and is incorporated into
BCDC’s Bay Plan, where it is the basis of the Bay Plan port policies. The overarching purpose of the
plan is to enhance economic activity while protecting the environment, making efficient use of all
resources, and coordinating development. The plan designates several ports in San Francisco Bay as port
priority use areas, reserved for regional maritime port use. The priority use area for the Port is located
south of China Basin, and is not in the proposed project area.
Local
San Francisco General Plan
Northeast Waterfront Area Plan. The overall goal of the Northeast Waterfront Area Plan is to create a
physical and economic environment in the Northeastern Waterfront area to best serve the needs of the San
Francisco community. To accomplish this goal, the dominant planning principles of the Plan are:
(1) provide for those uses that positively contribute to the environmental quality of the area and contribute
to the economic health of the Port and the City, (2) preserve and enhance the unique character of the area,
and take advantage of the unique economic opportunity provided by San Francisco Bay, and (3) provide
the maximum possible visual and physical access to San Francisco Bay while minimizing the adverse
environmental impacts of existing and new activity.
Relevant land use and planning policies of the Northeast Waterfront Area Plan include:
Policy 1.1. Accommodate, where appropriate, additional activities that will strengthen the
predominant economic functions of each subarea of the Northeastern Waterfront.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Policy 1.2. Consistent with other policies of this [Plan], encourage uses on Port property that return
revenue to the Port to support and improve its facilities.
Policy 9.4. To the extent feasible, facilitate and expand the operation of passenger ferry systems to
minimize traffic impacts.
Policy 10.7. Enhance and maintain the physical prominence of the Ferry Building.
Policy 26.7. Promote new maritime attractions and waterside access, such as water taxi and
excursion boat stops, historic ships, and temporary mooring areas as part of new development.
Policy 26.17. Establish a Downtown Ferry Terminal at the Ferry Building as a primary destination
point for all ferry and excursion boat riders on San Francisco Bay. The Downtown Ferry Terminal
should provide a range of public landing facilities accessible to the disabled community to
accommodate all vessel types requiring access to San Francisco. Any landing facilities should allow
multiple operators access to the facilities.
Policy 26.18. Improve pedestrian access through the Ferry Building to the Downtown Ferry
Terminal, including the Golden Gate Ferry Terminal. Create a continuous walkway along the eastern
side of the Ferry Building that is separate from service vehicle access, to improve public access and to
provide expanded space for ferry, excursion boat, water taxi, and other waterborne transit riders.
Northeast Waterfront Area Plan policy related to public access (Policies 5.5, 7.8, 7.9, 10.19, and 10.20)
are discussed in Section 3.4, Parklands and Recreation.
San Francisco Planning Code
The San Francisco Planning Code (Planning Code), which incorporates by reference the City’s Zoning
Maps, implements the General Plan and governs permitted uses, densities, and configuration of buildings
within the City. Permits to construct new buildings (or to alter or demolish existing ones) may not be
issued unless (1) the proposed project conforms to the Planning Code, (2) allowable exceptions are
granted pursuant to provisions of the Planning Code, or (3) amendments to the Planning Code are
included as part of the project.
As mentioned previously, the project area is in a C-2 district. These districts provide convenience goods
and services to residential areas of San Francisco, both in outlying sections and in closer-in, more densely
built communities. In addition, some C-2 districts provide comparison shopping goods and services on a
general or specialized basis to a citywide or regional market area, complementing the main area for such
types of trade in downtown San Francisco. The extent of these districts varies from smaller clusters of
stores to larger concentrated areas, including both shopping centers and strip developments along major
thoroughfares, and in each case the character and intensity of commercial development are intended to be
consistent with the character of other uses in the adjacent areas. The emphasis is on compatible retail
uses, but a wider variety of goods and services is included to suit the longer-term needs of customers, and
greater latitude is given for the provision of automobile-oriented uses.
The Port of San Francisco Waterfront Land Use Plan
One of the highest priorities of the Port of San Francisco Waterfront Land Use Plan (Waterfront Plan) is
to restore the Ferry Building to its historic role as a transportation hub and centerpiece of the waterfront
(Port, 2004). The goals of the Waterfront Plan also include establishing a framework to determine
acceptable uses for properties of the Port. It includes the expansion of water transit operations at the
Ferry Building, and encourages and fosters a balance of uses and activities on the waterfront, including

Consequences, and Mitigation

open space, recreation, and maritime and commercial activities. Policies of the Waterfront Plan related to
public access and recreation are discussed in Section 3.4, Parklands and Recreation.
The Waterfront Plan describes uses that are consistent with the Public Trust. Long-term uses deemed
consistent with the Public Trust include all maritime and maritime support, other water-related industry,
open space, public recreation and assembly, aquaria, museums, water-related commercial recreation, and
specialty retail and commercial designed to draw people to the water.
The Port of San Francisco Waterfront Land Use Plan Design and Access Element
The Waterfront Design and Access Element addresses the nature of public access and open spaces along
the waterfront. It includes special emphasis on public access and open spaces, and provides design
criteria for the Port Walk, which creates continuous waterfront pedestrian access from the Embarcadero
Promenade south of the Agriculture Building to the southern edge of Pier 1.
The project site is in the Ferry Building Subarea of the Design and Access Element of the Waterfront
Land Use Plan. The overarching goal of the plan is to reunite the City with a continuously accessible
waterfront. The plan contains policies for the historic preservation of the Ferry Building and its adaptive
reuse; support of the Ferry Building’s prominence as a civic focal point on the waterfront; and
preservation of views of the historic buildings on streets connecting the city to the waterfront. Policies
support the connection of open spaces at the Ferry Building with nearby Justin Herman Plaza and Rincon
Park; the design of Ferry Building open spaces to reflect the civic character already established by the
Ferry Building, Agriculture Building, and bulkhead buildings; and the provision of connections to open
water areas.
3.3.3

Impact Evaluation

The analysis considered whether the project would:


Physically divide an existing community;



Substantially affect existing land uses and land use patterns in the project vicinity; or



Conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy, or regulation that an agency with jurisdiction over
the project has adopted to avoid or mitigate environmental effects (including the local coastal
program implementing the federal CZMA administered by BCDC).

The land use analysis for the proposed project evaluates land uses at buildout of the proposed project, and
compares them with existing land uses at the project site and with the land use plans and policies
pertaining to the project area.
The nearest residential communities to the project area are across The Embarcadero, west of the Ferry
Building. The activities within the project area would not prevent access through neighborhoods, create a
barrier to the residential area, or create an obstacle to circulation. Therefore, the project would not
physically divide an existing community.
The project’s contributions to the continuity of the existing land uses and land use patterns were also
considered in this analysis (refer to Impact 3.3-1).
Issues related to displacement of people or businesses are addressed in Section 3.16, Socioeconomics.
The analysis evaluates the proposed project’s consistency with land use plans and policies that apply to
the project area. The evaluation of consistency with plans is organized by the responsible agencies (refer
to Impacts 3.3-2, 3.3-3, and 3.3-4).
R:\13 WETA\DTFX\Draft 0413\3_3_Land Use.docx

Page 3.3-11

Water Emergency Transportation Authority
Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

The CZMA is the only applicable federal regulation pertaining to land use; it is implemented locally
through the plans and policies of BCDC, as described in Section 3.3.2, under Regulatory Setting.
Therefore, CZMA consistency is discussed under Impact 3.3-2.
There are two applicable state regulations pertaining to land uses: CEQA and the Public Trust Doctrine.
This Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)/Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is being completed to
analyze and disclose to the public the potential impacts of the proposed project, consistent with the
requirements of CEQA. Both the Port and BCDC have plans and policies that address consistency with
the Public Trust Doctrine; the evaluation of the Public Trust Doctrine is provided in the sections of this
chapter that discuss those agencies. The Port is the responsible agency for the Public Trust Doctrine
under the Burton Act, and therefore consistency with the Public Trust Doctrine is discussed under Port
policies in Impact 3.3-4. In addition, Public Trust is also a consideration under BCDC’s plans and
policies and is described briefly under the BCDC evaluation in Impact 3.3-2.
At the local level, CCSF and the Port are agencies with applicable land use plans and policies. Consistency
with the San Francisco General Plan, including the Northeast Waterfront Area Plan, and the San Francisco
Planning Code are evaluated under Impact 3.3-3. Consistency with the Port’s Waterfront Land Use Plan
and Waterfront Land Use Plan Design and Access Element are evaluated under Impact 3.3-4.
Direct Impacts
Impact 3.3-1: Substantially Affect Existing Land Uses and Land Use Patterns
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no changes to the existing terminal facilities would occur. The project
area would continue to include a mixture of commercial, recreational, open space, public transportation,
and maritime uses. Water Emergency Transportation Authority (WETA) water transit ridership would
increase from 5,100 to approximately 7,800 passengers per weekday by 2035, and total AM peak-period
WETA vessel arrivals would increase from 14 to approximately 20. Without facility improvements to
accommodate the increase in passengers, the No Action Alternative could result in congestion around the
Ferry Building from longer queues, and would temporarily decrease public access around the Ferry
Terminal during peak water transit passenger boarding times. This could have periodic adverse impacts
to existing land use patterns in the project area.
Action Alternative
The proposed project would expand the existing water transit facilities, pedestrian circulation, and passive
recreation uses at the Ferry Terminal. All project improvements would occur with areas directly
controlled by the Port, and would not affect, encroach on, or modify any property or access to property
under the control of other entities, including transportation easements or rights-of-way held by other
entities (e.g., Equity Office Partners or BART). The improvements along the northern edge of the Ferry
Building would be located within an existing maintenance easement for the Ferry Building held by Equity
Office Partners (the leaseholder for the Ferry Building); responsibility for maintenance of the new
facilities would be set forth in a Site Maintenance Plan developed by the Port and WETA in coordination
with Equity Office Partners; refer to Section 2.3.6, Site Maintenance. The proposed uses of the project
area would continue to include a mixture of commercial, recreational, open space, public transportation,
and maritime uses, consistent with the existing uses in the project area and in the immediate vicinity.
Therefore, the proposed project improvements and increase in water transit services at the Ferry Terminal
support the existing land uses at the Ferry Terminal, and would allow for the continuation of existing land
use patterns in the project vicinity.
NEPA Determination. The project would not result in adverse impacts to existing land uses or land use
patterns.
R:\13 WETA\DTFX\Draft 0413\3_3_Land Use.docx

Page 3.3-12

June 2013

Water Emergency Transportation Authority
Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

CEQA Determination. The proposed project would not substantially affect existing land uses and land
use patterns in the project vicinity; therefore, it would result in less-than-significant impacts.
Impact 3.3-2: Conflict with Applicable BCDC Plans and Policies
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no modifications would be made to the existing Ferry Terminal
facilities. No new fill would be placed in San Francisco Bay, and no BCDC permits would be required.
The No Action Alternative would not result in physical changes to the Ferry Terminal infrastructure, and
therefore would not conflict directly with the policies of the Bay Plan or the SAP. Overall, the No Action
Alternative would not have adverse impacts related to conflicts with applicable plans and policies of the
BCDC.
Action Alternative
The project would be within BCDC’s jurisdiction and would be subject to the McAteer-Petris Act and the
Bay Plan. The proposed project would generally not conflict with applicable BCDC land use plans and
policies adopted to avoid or mitigate environmental effects, because the project would generally comply
with the McAteer-Petris Act and the policies of the Bay Plan, the SAP, and the Seaport Plan, as described
below. BCDC policies pertaining to other resources are described in other sections of this EIS/EIR, as
follows: Public Access is described in Section 3.4, Parklands and Recreation; Fish, Other Aquatic
Organisms, and Wildlife are described in Section 3.9, Biological Resources; Water Surface Area and
Volume, Water Quality, and Safety of Fills and Sea Level Rise are described in Section 3.11, Hydrology
and Water Quality. As described in these sections, implementation of the proposed project would not be
anticipated to result in conflicts with BCDC plans or policies.
BCDC would review the project for consistency with the applicable plans and policies prior to issuing
permits and approvals. Because BCDC is also the local coastal zone management agency, BCDC’s
issuance of permits and approvals would also serve as the Federal Transit Administration’s federal
consistency determination pursuant to Section 307 of the CZMA. BCDC’s involvement in the design of
the proposed project is described in Section 2.6, Agency Approvals Required; and Chapter 6.0, Public
Agency Involvement. As a result of BCDC’s review and permitting for the proposed project, the project
would be implemented in a manner consistent with BCDC plans and policies.
BCDC exercises two types of jurisdiction over the project area. The first is jurisdiction over a shoreline
band, which extends 100 feet inland from and parallel to the San Francisco Bay shoreline. Port property
landward of the seawall or on the seawall itself, such as The Embarcadero roadway and much of the Herb
Caen Way/Embarcadero Promenade, lies within the BCDC shoreline band jurisdiction. Second, BCDC
has jurisdiction over San Francisco Bay. The proposed project activities on the piers fall under BCDC
Bay jurisdiction. Project demolition and construction would require a BCDC permit. As a condition of
approval, BCDC requires maximum feasible public access for any project subject to its review.
The Ferry Terminal is designated as an Open Water Area in the SAP, and the project area is within
Special Area Plan Map 3. Open Water Areas are defined as those areas along the San Francisco Bay
waterfront not otherwise designated as Open Water Basins. BCDC policies support the continuation and
further development of water transit services at the Ferry Terminal. Such uses are considered a permitted
use in Open Water Areas; minor pile-supported or floating fill for water transportation uses, such as boat
berthing facilities, is allowed.
Bay Fill. As detailed in Table 2-2, under the proposed project approximately 40,000 square feet of net
new fill would be constructed in and over San Francisco Bay in the project area. As described in
Chapter 2.0 and Table 2-2, the proposed project includes: (1) removal of existing fill; (2) repair of
R:\13 WETA\DTFX\Draft 0413\3_3_Land Use.docx

Page 3.3-13

June 2013

Water Emergency Transportation Authority
Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

existing structures that do not change the amount of fill; (3) replacement fill (i.e., demolition of structures
and rebuilding new structures); and (4) the addition of new fill.
BCDC regulates the placement of new fill in San Francisco Bay. As described below, the proposed
project would result in changes in San Francisco Bay fill that are consistent with the Bay Plan uses of the
shoreline; fills in accordance with the Bay Plan; and filling for public trust uses on publicly-owned
property.
Section 66605 of the McAteer-Petris Act states that further filling of San Francisco Bay should only be
authorized if it is the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of the project, and if the harmful effects
associated with its placement are minimized. Fill is limited to water-oriented uses or minor fill for
improving shoreline appearance of public access, and should only be authorized when no alternative
upland location is available for those purposes. In addition, under the SAP, piers that are not designated
for removal may be repaired or wholly reconstructed for uses that are consistent with the Public Trust
Doctrine and the Port’s Legislative Trust Grant. Consistent with the Public Trust Doctrine, new fill may
be allowed for uses that (1) are necessary for public health, safety or welfare of the entire Bay Area; and
(2) provide for major shoreline parks, regional public access facilities, removal of existing pile-supported
fill, open water basins, increased safety of fills, mechanisms for implementation, enhanced public views
of San Francisco Bay, and other benefits to San Francisco Bay.
The facility improvements proposed are the minimum required to meet the project’s purpose, as described
in Chapter 1.0, Purpose and Need. The project’s purpose is to improve the facilities at the Ferry Terminal
to support both daily water transit service, as outlined in WETA’s Implementation and Operations Plan,
and to improve facilities to support emergency operations. The project improvements include new gates,
as well as the replacement of existing and construction of new pile-supported deck structures built to
Essential Facility standards (i.e., designed to withstand earthquakes). Such improvements would increase
public safety and welfare in the San Francisco region during a catastrophe, and improve day-to-day public
water transit. Design of the project, including areas of additional fill for vessel docking, passenger
queuing, and emergency coordination, is based on the anticipated water transit ridership (see Table 1-2),
as well as emergency staging and evacuation needs (see Section 1.5.4). As such, the proposed project is
considered to be the minimum necessary fill to achieve the purposes of the project. The potential harmful
effects of the placement of the new fill would be minimized as described in other sections of this
EIS/EIR. The project improvements would also improve public access in the project area, as described in
further detail in Section 3.4, Parklands and Recreation.
The removal of the northern portion of Pier 2 would be consistent with SAP Policy 1. Consistent with
SAP Policy 2 for Open Water Areas, the new fill in the Open Water Areas would be limited to areas
appropriate for additional ferry terminals and would support San Francisco Bay-oriented public assembly
uses such as the Embarcadero Plaza; improve shoreline appearance and public access; and support
seismic and safety repairs. Overall, the net new fill would not conflict with the policies of the Bay Plan
and the SAP.
Pursuant to BCDC policies, fill consistent with Bay Plan and SAP policies would be required to be offset
with the removal of fill elsewhere in their jurisdiction. Implementation of Mitigation Measure LU-1
requires that WETA mitigate new fill in San Francisco Bay with the removal of fill. The specific location
and the amount of fill that would be removed would be determined as a part of the BCDC Major Permit
and Design Review process.
Transportation. Policy 5 of the Bay Plan states that ferry terminals should be sited at locations that are
near navigable channels; would not rapidly fill with sediment; and would not significantly impact tidal
marshes, tidal flats or other valuable wildlife habitat. Wherever possible, terminals should be near higher
density, mixed-use development served by public transit. Terminal parking facilities should be set back
from the shoreline to allow for public access and enjoyment of San Francisco Bay.

Water Emergency Transportation Authority
Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Consistent with Policy 5, the proposed project would be along a navigable channel, near a high-density
mixed-use area served by public transit in a location that is currently used for water transit. The Ferry
Terminal is the main water transit hub for the City, and is served by a number of local and regional transit
lines. The San Francisco Municipal Transit Agency’s Municipal Railway provides bus and light rail
service in close proximity to the Ferry Terminal, including connections to Caltrain. Additionally, the
BART’s Embarcadero Station is approximately 0.2 mile from the Ferry Terminal, providing connections
to San Francisco, the East Bay, and San Mateo County. Additional transit connections are available at the
Transbay Terminal (approximately 0.5 mile from the Ferry Terminal) to the Alameda-Contra Costa
Transit District, the San Mateo County Transit District, and Golden Gate Transit.
Additionally, consistent with Policy 5 and as described in Section 3.9, Biological Resources, the Ferry
Terminal site does not contain tidal marshes, flats, or other valuable wildlife habitat, and would not result
in impacts to such biological resources. The proposed project does not include the development of any
additional parking facilities, because it would primarily be the destination for passengers coming into San
Francisco from the East Bay. The proposed water transit gates would be in proximity to navigable
channels, and only minor maintenance dredging would be required beneath the new floats, every 3 or
4 years, as described in Section 2.3.6.
Public Trust. The purpose of the Public Trust Doctrine is to ensure that the lands to which it pertains are
kept for trust uses, defined as uses that benefit the public as a whole, such as commerce, navigation,
fisheries, wildlife habitat, recreation, and open space. Per Bay Plan Public Trust Policy 1, the
Commission is tasked with ensuring that the action it takes regarding public trust lands is consistent with
the public trust needs for the area. In the case of lands subject to legislative grants, the Commission
should also ensure that the terms of the grant are satisfied and the project is in furtherance of statewide
purposes.
Title to Port property, including the project site, is held by CCSF, and administered through its Port
Commission. Under the Burton Act, the Port has the power to use, manage, operate, and regulate port
lands consistent with public trust restrictions established by common law, the Burton Act, the City
Charter, the transfer agreement, and local and regional plans. Consistency with Public Trust is further
evaluated under Impact 3.3-5, below. BCDC will rely on the Port’s determination when making its own
determination of project’s consistency with its laws and policies. The Port will issue its findings when
issuing the lease agreement for the project based on review of this EIS/EIR, and contingent upon design
review and building permit requirements.
Seaport Plan. Policies of the Seaport Plan seek to enhance the economic activity at the ports while
protecting the environment and making efficient use of all resources. The project site is not in a port
priority use area, but it does support plan policies for the preservation of maritime uses because it expands
the existing ferry facilities. Consistent with the plan policies, the expansion of the Ferry Terminal would
continue to assist in alleviating traffic congestion, and would not interfere with ongoing or future planned
port uses. The proposed project supports passenger safety, which is a goal of the project, by providing
expanded and improved passenger facilities; and it supports navigational safety in San Francisco Bay by
creating adequate docking facilities for the anticipated future vessel traffic, including for emergency
response.
NEPA Determination. The proposed project would be consistent with applicable BCDC plans and
policies, and therefore consistent with the CZMA, with the implementation of Mitigation Measure LU-1.
With implementation of Mitigation Measure LU-1, impacts would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. With the implementation of Mitigation Measure LU-1, the proposed project
would be consistent with applicable BCDC plans and policies that were adopted to avoid or mitigate
environmental effects. Therefore, impacts would be less than significant with mitigation incorporated.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Impact 3.3-3: Conflict with Applicable City and County of San Francisco Land Use Plans
and Policies
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no modifications would be made to the existing Ferry Terminal
facilities. No new structures would be constructed, and no CCSF permits or approvals would be required.
The No Action Alternative would not result in physical changes to the Ferry Terminal infrastructure;
therefore, it would not conflict with the policies of the San Francisco General Plan, including the
Northeast Waterfront Area Plan and the San Francisco Planning Code. Therefore, the No Action
Alternative would not have adverse impacts related to conflicts with applicable plans and policies of
CCSF.
Action Alternative
The project area is designated as General Commercial/Public Trust, in the Ferry Building Subarea
Generalized Land Use Map of the Northeast Waterfront Area Plan. The proposed project would be
generally consistent with the permitted commercial and public trust uses of this district. The proposed
project would respond to the objectives and policies of the area plan by contributing to the economic
health of the Port and the City. Expansion of Ferry Terminal facilities would contribute to the unique
character of the area by adding gates and other features consistent with a ferry terminal; improve Port
facilities with additional plaza area and walkways; and capitalize on the unique economic opportunities of
San Francisco Bay, such as providing linkages with other ports in the Bay. The proposed project would
enhance and maintain the prominence of the Ferry Building by expanding the facilities for passenger
water transit services. Consistent with the Ferry Building Subarea policies, the proposed project would
promote expanded waterside access and water transit services, and further the Ferry Terminal as a
primary destination for water transit services. A continuous walkway along the eastern side of the Ferry
Building would provide improved public access along the waterfront.
The project area is designated by the San Francisco Planning Code as a Community Business (C-2)
District with an 84-foot height restriction and “j” bulk limitation. 3 C-2 districts provide convenience
goods and services to residential areas, as well as comparison shopping goods and services on a general or
specialized basis to citywide or regional market areas. The proposed uses are a continuation of the
existing uses at the site, and would be consistent with the uses permitted by right in the C-2 District.
Permits for the construction of proposed structures would be required for the proposed project, in
compliance with the Planning Code.
NEPA Determination. Through compliance with the required building permit process, the project would
not result in adverse impacts related to conflicts with applicable plans and policies of the CCSF.
CEQA Determination. The project would not conflict with applicable CCSF plans and policies that
were adopted to avoid or mitigate environmental effects, and therefore would have no impact.
Impact 3.3-4: Conflict with Applicable Port of San Francisco Land Use Plans and Policies
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no modifications would be made to the existing Ferry Terminal
facilities. No new structures would be constructed and no Port permits or approvals would be required.
The No Action Alternative would not result in physical changes to the Ferry Terminal infrastructure;
therefore, it would not conflict with the policies of the Waterfront Land Use Plan, including the Design

and Access Element of the plan. Therefore, the No Action Alternative would not have adverse impacts
related to conflicts with applicable plans and policies of the Port.
Action Alternative
The Port is the trustee of the Public Trust for lands within its jurisdiction, and may enter into leases or
franchises not to exceed 66 years for trust‐consistent purposes. The Waterfront Land Use Plan outlines
evaluation criteria to determine whether a use is consistent with the Public Trust, including a
determination of whether the project would “promote navigation, fisheries, waterfront commerce,
enhance natural resources or attract people to use and enjoy the bay.” Maritime uses, as defined in the
plan, include ferry terminals. The maritime, open space, and public recreation uses proposed under the
project would be consistent with the long-term Public Trust uses described in the Waterfront Land Use
Plan.
The project site is in the Ferry Building Waterfront Subarea of the Waterfront Land Use Plan, and is
designated as a Waterfront Mixed Use Opportunity Area. The plan allows for existing and acceptable
maritime uses, commercial areas, public access, and open space areas in a Waterfront Mixed Use
Opportunity Area. Consistent with BCDC’s SAP, areas of the project sites are designated for public
access and open space; new water transit gates are proposed; and portions of piers are designated to be
removed. The proposed project is consistent with these use designations.
The Waterfront Design and Access Element of the Waterfront Land Use Plan addresses the nature of
public access and open spaces along the waterfront. It places special emphasis on public access and open
spaces, and provides design criteria for the Port Walk, which creates continuous waterfront pedestrian
access from the Embarcadero Promenade south of the Agriculture Building to the southern edge of Pier 1.
The project site is in the Ferry Building Subarea of the Design and Access Element, and would be
consistent with applicable design criteria for massing of structures, preservation of open water, and
orientation of public access and toward the water; refer to Section 3.10, Aesthetics and Visual Resources,
for more information on these policies. The project would be consistent with the plan’s goal to create a
continuously accessible waterfront by improving the South Apron of the Agriculture Building and
Marginal Wharf and constructing the East Bayside Promenade and Embarcadero Plaza. The project
would be consistent with policies that support the connection of open spaces that reflect the civic
character of the area, and provide connections to open water areas.
The Waterfront Design and Access Element provides specific design criteria for areas near the Ferry and
Agriculture buildings, which include the project site. These design criteria address the massing and
orientation of structures, water coverage, enhancement of view of San Francisco Bay and boating activity,
public access, and architectural design and details. The proposed design of the project facilities would be
consistent with the existing facilities in the Ferry Terminal area, including the design of the existing gates
at the Ferry Building (Gates B and E) that were constructed by the Port in 2003.
The final project design would be considered jointly by the Port and BCDC during design review and
project permitting. The Port’s review and permitting process would ensure that the project is
implemented in a manner that is consistent with its plans and policies.
NEPA Determination. The project would not result in adverse impacts related to conflicts with
applicable Port plans and policies that were adopted to avoid or mitigate environmental effects.
CEQA Determination. The project would have less-than-significant impacts related to conflicts with
applicable Port plans and policies that were adopted to avoid or mitigate environmental effects.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Indirect Impacts
Neither the No Action Alternative nor the Action Alternative would have indirect impacts to land use.
Construction Impacts
The No Action Alternative would not result in any physical changes to the Ferry Terminal, and no
construction activities would be required. Therefore, there would be no construction impacts to land use.
Impact 3.3-5: Substantially Affect Existing Land Uses During Construction
Under the Action Alternative, staging and construction of the proposed project would take place from
barges over San Francisco Bay, and there would be limited landside activities at the Ferry Terminal.
Construction activities would be limited to those areas shown on Figure 2-9, and would not affect,
modify, or prevent access to the other land uses in the project area located on the Ferry Plaza, or in the
Ferry Building or Agriculture Building. In addition, the existing fire lane along the southern side of the
Ferry Building would remain unobstructed during construction. As described in Section 2.4.5,
Construction Staging, access to the existing businesses and water transit gates would be maintained
during construction, and appropriate wayfinding signage would be included as necessary. Landside
activities would include delivery of materials that could result in traffic lane closures or vehicular and
pedestrian delays, as described in Section 3.2, Transportation and Circulation. Other potential
construction-related impacts are described in other sections of this EIS/EIR. Construction of the proposed
project would be temporary and would not result in adverse impacts from the physical division of existing
communities, substantial changes to land use or land use patterns, or conflicts with applicable land use
plans or policies.
NEPA Determination. Construction-related impacts to land use would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. There would be no construction-related impacts to land use.
Cumulative Impacts
Impact 3.3-6: Potential to Result in Cumulative Impacts on Land Use
The proposed project would expand water transit and passive recreation uses at the Ferry Terminal, and
would require the construction of new facilities, such as the gates. The proposed project facilities and
land uses would be generally consistent with the existing land uses and land use patterns in the project
area, and would also be generally consistent with the Port’s land use and design plans and policies. The
Port’s permitting and approval process would ensure the project’s consistency with the Port’s policies.
Although the impacts from the proposed project would not be substantial and have been determined to be
less than significant and not adverse, other reasonably foreseeable projects in the study area (along and
adjacent to San Francisco’s eastern waterfront) could result in similar impacts. Projects, such as the
America’s Cup project, San Francisco/Oakland Bay Bridge Seismic Safety projects, Pier 27 Cruise Ship
Terminal project, the Piers 15 and 17 Exploratorium Relocation, 8 Washington Street, 350 Mission Street,
Transbay Transit Center, Central Subway, and Pier 70 Area (listed in Table 3.1-1), would generally
involve upgrades to existing infrastructure and public facilities, rehabilitation or replacement of aging
facilities, or the development of mixed urban uses. These projects, in combination with the proposed
project, would affect land use and lands use patterns in the study area and/or result in the construction of
facilities along the waterfront. Although individual projects may result in land use impacts, those
projects—in combination with the proposed project—would not be anticipated to contribute collectively
to cumulative land use impacts, because individual impacts would be mitigated, and because the projects
under the cumulative scenario would be generally consistent with the urban character and existing land
uses in the study area. As part of the permitting and approvals process for individual projects, potential

Consequences, and Mitigation

land use impacts would be evaluated and project consistency with the CCSF and Port’s applicable plans
would be ensured by the lead agency. Therefore, the reasonably foreseeable projects, in combination with
the proposed project, would not result in adverse cumulative land use impacts.
The proposed project is also within the jurisdiction of BCDC, and would be generally consistent with
BCDC’s plans and policies. The project would increase fill in San Francisco Bay, a potentially adverse
impact. Projects, such as the America’s Cup project, San Francisco/Oakland Bay Bridge Seismic Safety
projects, Brannan Street Wharf, Pier 27 Cruise Ship Terminal project, the Piers 15 and 17 Exploratorium
Relocation, and Pier 70 Area (listed in Table 3.1-1), could also result in additional fill in San Francisco
Bay. BCDC regulates the placement of new fill in San Francisco Bay to ensure that changes in San
Francisco Bay fill are consistent with the Bay Plan uses of the shoreline; that fills are in accordance with
the Bay Plan; and that the fill is for public trust uses on publicly owned property. As part of the
permitting and approvals process for individual projects, potential fill impacts would be evaluated and
project consistency with the BCDC plans would be ensured by the lead agency and BCDC. Mitigation of
proposed new fill would be required, as necessary. For example, WETA will implement Mitigation
Measure LU-1, which requires the removal of fill elsewhere in San Francisco Bay. Therefore, the
reasonably foreseeable projects, in combination with the proposed project, would not result in adverse
cumulative impacts related to an increase in fill in San Francisco Bay.
NEPA Determination. The project would not contribute to cumulative adverse impacts to land uses in
the study area.
CEQA Determination. Cumulative impacts to land uses in the study area would be less than significant.
3.3.4

Mitigation Measures

Mitigation Measure LU-1: Removal of Fill in San Francisco Bay
To offset the new fill in San Francisco Bay created by the proposed project improvements, WETA will
remove fill elsewhere in San Francisco Bay. Fill removal location and amount will be determined in
coordination with BCDC during the Major Permit and Design Review process. The amount of fill to be
removed is anticipated to be no more than the amount of new fill created by the project. Sites that would be
considered for fill removal include dilapidated piers, wharfs, and remnant pilings that were constructed
with creosote‐treated wood; have no current maritime uses; and are not in areas with sensitive biological
resources, such as eelgrass beds.
WETA would conduct removal activities in accordance with applicable regulatory permits (as described
in this EIS/EIR), and would cut or break the piles off at least 2 feet below the mudline. WETA would
minimize sediment disturbance during removal, use a floating boom around the work area to contain and
capture debris; and have absorbent pads available in the event that a petroleum sheen develops during
removal of the structures. Mitigation measures and regulatory requirements described in the EIS/EIR for
proposed project activities (i.e., demolition and removal of piles and piers) would also apply to the
demolition and removal of fill elsewhere in the Bay; these would include Mitigation Measures AQ-1,
Implement BAAQMD-Recommended Best Management Practices; CUL-1, Inadvertent Discovery
Measures; CUL-2, Stop Construction if Buried Paleontological Resources are Discovered; HAZ-1,
Prepare a Hazardous Materials Management Plan; and BIO-1, Dredging and Pile Driving Measures.

PARKLANDS AND RECREATION

3.4.1

Introduction to the Analysis

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

This section describes the existing parks and recreation environment, including recreation resources in the
project area; discusses applicable regulations; and evaluates the potential impacts of implementation of
the No Action Alternative and the Action Alternative. In addition to parks and open space areas, public
access to San Francisco Bay, provided by both trails and viewing areas of San Francisco Bay, are key
components of the parks and recreation analysis because they serve an important recreation function in
the immediate project area. As described below, the proposed project’s impacts on parklands and
recreation would not be adverse, and would be less than significant.
3.4.2

Affected Environment

This section describes existing parklands and recreation facilities in the project area and the study area. It
also provides a regulatory framework describing applicable policies and plans relevant to parklands and
recreation in the study area. For the purpose of this analysis, the project’s study area encompasses the
project area and the surrounding area within approximately 1,000 feet of the project area.
Existing Setting
Study Area
The project area is in the San Francisco Ferry Building (Ferry Building) Subarea of the Northeastern
Waterfront Planning Area of San Francisco. The Northeastern Waterfront Area Plan identifies the Ferry
Building Subarea as the area from just north of Pier 3 to south of Pier 22½ (SF Planning, 2003). For the
purpose of this analysis, the project’s study area encompasses the project area and the surrounding area
within approximately 1,000 feet of the project area. Figure 3.4-1 shows the major parklands and open
spaces in the study area, including Pier 7, Justin Herman-Embarcadero Plaza (Justin Herman Plaza),
Harry Bridges Plaza, Sue Bierman Park, Pier 14, and Rincon Park.
Within the study area, recreation facilities support a variety of functions, including both passive and
active recreation uses, as described below.
Parklands and Open Space and Trails
The parks and piers in the study area—as well as the Herb Caen Way/Embarcadero Promenade (the
Embarcadero Promenade), which connects the park areas—are described below. Uses in the vicinity of
the parks are primarily office and commercial; however, there are residential uses near Sue Bierman and
Rincon parks.
Harry Bridges Plaza, the paved area west of the Ferry Building and between The Embarcadero’s
northbound and southbound lanes, is popular for skateboarding and pedestrian access between the Ferry
Building and The Embarcadero. Harry Bridges Plaza is under the jurisdiction of the Port of San
Francisco (Port).
Justin Herman Plaza is a 4.3-acre open space at the foot of Market Street, across the street from the Ferry
Building, and is characterized by large open paved and grassy areas and a large fountain/sculpture. Justin
Herman Plaza, under the jurisdiction of the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department, is used for
various activities and group events throughout the year. In the winter, an ice skating rink is created in the
plaza. Tables, benches, and steps offer seating opportunities year round.
Sue Bierman Park is a 4.4-acre park, formerly known as Ferry Park, bounded by The Embarcadero and
Washington, Davis, and Clay streets. Sue Bierman Park is under the jurisdiction of the San Francisco

Recreation and Park Department. There are residential uses, as well as office and commercial uses,
adjacent to the park.
Rincon Park is a 2-acre waterfront grassy area on The Embarcadero at the terminus of Folsom Street
between Harrison Street and Howard Street, under the jurisdiction of the Port. There are residential uses
across The Embarcadero.
Two piers provide additional open space in the study area.


Pier 7, an 840-foot-long public access and fishing pier south of Broadway Avenue, is under the
jurisdiction of the Port. It was reconstructed following the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. The pier
includes timber decking, ornamental iron handrails, antique-style iron and wooden benches, light
fixtures, and benches.



Pier 14, a 637-foot-long public pier, is under the jurisdiction of the Port. It was built in Phase I of the
Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal) project. The pier serves as a breakwater
for the South Basin of the Ferry Terminal. There are rotating public art installations on the land side
of Pier 14.

These open spaces are linked by the Embarcadero Promenade, the 25-foot-wide pedestrian promenade
running 2.75 miles along the waterfront between The Embarcadero and the pier bulkhead buildings, from
South Beach to Fisherman’s Wharf, passing the Ferry Building. The Embarcadero Promenade is also
under the jurisdiction of the Port. The Embarcadero Promenade and its contiguous open spaces provide
more than 16 acres of public open space. The Promenade is a multi-use pathway designated for
recreation, bicycle transportation, maritime functions, and access to piers. The San Francisco Bay Trail is
collocated with the Embarcadero Promenade. The Bay Trail’s purpose is to create connections between
more than 130 parks and publicly accessible open space areas in a 400-mile recreational “ring around the
Bay.” Furthermore, the Bay Trail provides access to a wide array of commercial ferries and public boat
launches. Additionally, the Embarcadero Promenade in the study area is part of the Shoreline Trail
identified in the San Francisco General Plan. Bicycle Route 5, a Class II bicycle lane, is also located
along The Embarcadero. See Section 3.2, Transportation and Circulation, for discussion of bicycle lanes.
Recreational Activity
Recreational boating in San Francisco Bay includes motoring, sailing, and kayaking. There are several
sailing clubs and schools in the Bay Area. Crewed charters and scheduled sailboat cruises based in the
South Beach Harbor may pass near the study area. Sailboats and charters pass near the study area mostly
in the afternoon and on the weekends. There is a public launch ramp in San Francisco at Pier 54,
approximately 1.6 miles south of the project area, and also a recreational boat guest dock at Pier 1½; both
of these are used by motored and nonmotored vessels, including water taxis. There are three marinas in
San Francisco: near AT&T Park, in Fisherman’s Wharf, and near Crissy Field. The closest is at the
South Beach Harbor, near AT&T Park, and is approximately 1 mile south of the project area.
There are many recreational kayak tours operating in the Bay Area. Kayak tours close to the project
study area launch from Fisherman’s Wharf or the South Beach Harbor (BoatingSF, 2011). Kayakers may
paddle near the project area.
Public Access
There are many public access opportunities in the study area, including the Embarcadero Promenade,
which passes through the project area; the Broadway and Rincon Point Open Water Basins; public access
at Pier 3; and Justin Herman and Harry Bridges plazas. The Broadway Open Water Basin is between

Piers 3 and 9. The Rincon Open Water Basin is between the Ferry Terminal Breakwater (Pier 14) and the
Pier 22½ Fire Boat House. Broadway and Rincon Point Open Water Basins are maintained as part of the
Port public access and open space policies. They provide opportunities for views of San Francisco Bay
and maritime activities. In addition, they integrate new public access and open space on piers with the
continuous waterfront walkway. The landside Broadway and Rincon Point Open Water Basins are also
maintained in accordance with the San Francisco Waterfront Special Area Plan (SAP) of the San
Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC). Waterside uses of the open water
basins include water-related recreation, such as sailing and kayaking; and water transportation, such
ferries and excursion boats.
Project Area
The project area encompasses the buildings and open spaces between Pier 1 to the north, Pier 14 to the
south, The Embarcadero to the west, and San Francisco Bay to the east. The Ferry Building is
prominently located at the center of the project area, and is a popular attraction for downtown workers,
city residents, and visitors. The project area offers many opportunities for public access to San Francisco
Bay (both physical and visual), including access to water transit services and views of San Francisco Bay,
Treasure Island, the Bay Bridge, and the San Francisco skyline. Refer to Section 3.10, Aesthetics and
Visual Resources, for more detail on views in the project area.
The Ferry Plaza (to the east of the Ferry Building) and areas along the Embarcadero Promenade (north
and south of the Ferry Building) offer limited seating benches facing San Francisco Bay. On Tuesdays,
Thursdays, and Saturdays, the Ferry Plaza Farmer’s Market takes place in the project area. The Ferry
Building has a marketplace at the ground level, offering a variety of retail establishments, such as cafés
and restaurants. There are public restrooms at both ends of the building, and bicycle racks in front of and
behind the Ferry Building.
As previously discussed, the Embarcadero Promenade, including the Bay Trail, also passes through the
project area.
Due to the existing water transit vessel traffic in the project area, recreational users on San Francisco Bay
tend to pass through or near the project area rather than to use the project area as a destination for waterbased recreation.
Regulatory Setting
Federal
Department of Transportation Act of 1966 Section 4(f)
Section 4(f) applies to projects that receive federal funding or federal approval by an agency of the
Department of Transportation (in this case, the Federal Transit Administration). This act requires that
transportation projects avoid impacts to Section 4(f) properties such as public parks, recreation lands,
wildlife refuges, and historic sites. See Section 3.5, Section 4(f) Resources, for further discussion of these
requirements.
Coastal Zone Management Act
The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), established in 1972 and administered by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, provides
for management of the nation’s coastal resources. The overall purpose is to balance competing land and
water issues in the coastal zone. For San Francisco Bay and the project area, the BCDC (discussed
below) is the local coastal zone management agency responsible for issuing consistency determinations

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

under the CZMA. Therefore, under the CZMA, the project should be consistent with BCDC’s plans and
policies.
Regional
McAteer-Petris Act (Section 66602)
The McAteer-Petris Act, which created BCDC, included the finding that:
“...certain water-oriented land uses along the bay shoreline are essential to the public welfare of the
Bay Area, and that these uses include ports, water-related industries, airports, wildlife refuges, wateroriented recreation and public assembly, desalinization plants, upland dredged material disposal sites,
and powerplants requiring large amounts of water for cooling purposes; that the San Francisco Bay
Plan should make provision for adequate and suitable locations for all these uses, thereby minimizing
the necessity for future bay fill to create new sites for these uses; that existing public access to the
shoreline and waters of San Francisco Bay is inadequate and that maximum feasible public access,
consistent with a proposed project, should be provided.”
San Francisco Bay Plan
BCDC has permit authority over development of San Francisco Bay and the shoreline pursuant to the
McAteer-Petris Act (California Government Code section 66000 et seq.). The Act requires BCDC to
prepare a “comprehensive and enforceable plan for the conservation of the water of San Francisco Bay
and the development of its shoreline.”
BCDC has jurisdiction over all filling, dredging, and changes in use in San Francisco Bay. Furthermore,
BCDC regulates new development within 100 feet of the shoreline subject to tidal action, to ensure that
maximum public access to San Francisco Bay is provided; and ensures that the limited amount of
shoreline suitable for regional high-priority water-oriented uses is reserved for such purposes.
The San Francisco Bay Plan (Bay Plan), adopted in 1969, is the BCDC policy document that specifies
goals, objectives, and policies for BCDC jurisdictional areas for the entire Bay Area (BCDC, 2008).
Additionally, the Bay Plan contains policies relevant to the San Francisco Bay Trail Plan (Bay Trail Plan)
(see Bay Trail Plan discussion below).
The major public access and recreation Bay Plan policies related to the project are presented below.
Findings and Policies Concerning Public Access to San Francisco Bay. Bay Plan findings and
policies that concern public access to San Francisco Bay include the following:
Public Access Finding (a). San Francisco Bay is a dominant feature of the nine-county Bay Area
and affords a variety of habitats for many diverse plant and wildlife populations. It provides an
environment for numerous forms of public enjoyment including viewing, photography, wildlife
observation, nature study, fishing, wading, walking, bicycling, jogging, or just sitting beside the
water. As an outstanding visual resource, San Francisco Bay is an important focal point for the entire
region that serves to orient people to its various parts.
Public Access Finding (b). Public access can provide for recreational activities, educational and
interpretive opportunities, and means for alternative transportation.
Public Access Finding (c). Public access required by the BCDC is an integral component of
development and usually consists of pedestrian and other nonmotorized access to and along the
shoreline of San Francisco Bay. It may include certain improvements, such as paving, landscaping,
R:\13 WETA\DTFX\Draft 0413\3_4 Parks and Rec.docx

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

and street furniture; and it may allow for additional uses, such as bicycling, fishing, picnicking, nature
education, etc. Visual access to San Francisco Bay is a critical part of public access. In projects that
cannot provide onsite public access due to safety or use conflicts, including significant adverse effects
on wildlife, in lieu public access may be appropriate.
Public Access Finding (d). The BCDC has adopted advisory “Public Access Design Guidelines” to
assist in the siting and design of public access to San Francisco Bay. The Design Review Board was
formed in 1970 of professional designers to advise the BCDC on the adequacy of public access of
proposed projects in accordance with the Bay Plan.
Public Access Policy 8. Access to and along the waterfront should be provided by walkways, trails,
or other appropriate means, and connect to the nearest public thoroughfare where convenient parking
or public transportation may be available.
Public Access Policy 10. Federal, state, regional, and local jurisdictions, special districts, and the
BCDC should cooperate to provide appropriately sited, designed, and managed public access,
especially to link the entire series of shoreline parks, regional trail systems (such as the Bay Trail),
and existing public access areas to the extent feasible, without additional Bay filling and without
significant adverse effects on natural resources in San Francisco Bay. State, regional, and local
agencies that approve projects should ensure that provisions for public access to and along the
shoreline are included as conditions of approval and that the access is consistent with the BCDC
requirements and guidelines.
Public Access Policy 11. The Public Access Design Guidelines should be used as a guide to siting
and designing public access consistent with a proposed project.
Recreation Policy 4.a(6). Bay Trail segments should be located near the shoreline unless that
alignment would have significant adverse effects on Bay resource.
Recreation Finding L. The goal of the Bay Trail project is to create a continuous, multiple-use trail
around San Francisco Bay that can be used for hiking, jogging, bicycling, and other nonmotorized
uses, and that connects shoreline parks.
San Francisco Waterfront Special Area Plan
The San Francisco Waterfront SAP, an amendment to the Bay Plan, focuses exclusively on the San
Francisco Waterfront from India Basin to the Aquatic Park (BCDC, 2000). The SAP was developed in
coordination with the City and County of San Francisco, and applies the requirements of the McAteer‐
Petris Act and the provisions of the Bay Plan to the San Francisco waterfront in greater detail than the
Bay Plan. This section discusses the elements relevant to parklands and recreation; please see
Section 3.3, Land Use and Planning, for SAP policies related to land use.
The SAP policies related to parklands and recreation that are most relevant to the proposed project are as
follows:
Open Water Basins. Permitted uses include:




Water-Related Recreation;
Water Transportation (e.g., ferries, water taxis, and excursion boats); and
Limited Public Access.
Policy 1. Open Water Basins should be focal points for public use and enjoyment of the Northeastern
Waterfront. Open Water Basins should provide opportunities for physical access between San

Francisco Bay and the piers, and should provide new and substantial San Francisco Bay views from
the boundary piers framing the Open Water Basins.
Open Water Areas. Permitted uses include:




Water-Related Recreation;
Water Transportation (e.g., ferries, water taxis, and excursion boats); and
Bay-Oriented Commercial Recreation and Bay-Oriented Public Assembly.
Public Access. The McAteer-Petris Act requires that projects in BCDC’s jurisdiction provide the
maximum feasible public access, and accommodate uses such as bicycling, fishing, picnicking, and
nature education.
Policy 1. Public access should be provided free of charge to the public, and should provide direct
connections to San Francisco Bay, both physical and visual.
Policy 2. Public access should generally be accessible at any time; however, reasonable restrictions
on public access may be approved to promote public safety and security.
Policy 3. Public access should emphasize passive recreation and focus on the proximity to San
Francisco Bay, the view, and the unique experiences that nearness to San Francisco Bay affords.

Policy 10 Public Access Siting and Design. Policy 10 includes the following requirements:
a. On-pier public access areas should be located to take advantage of the Open Water Basins, views of
San Francisco Bay and its shoreline, views back to the City, wind protection, and solar access. They
should incorporate unique and special amenities that draw the public to them, including cultural
expression, (e.g., public art, event programming, or unique views).
b. Except as otherwise provided in this SAP, public access on new fill should not contribute towards
meeting the required public access on finger piers, unless the fill would replace a former pier apron
that was removed, or existing deteriorated apron areas where the apron is necessary to connect
existing pier apron(s) to Herb Caen Way or other open space areas.
Policy 13. Public access areas should be designed and improved, consistent with the project as follows:
j.

public access improvements provided for projects within the Northeastern Waterfront should be
designed to be low maintenance and should be maintained by the responsible party;

k. queues for excursion boats and ferries should be managed so that continuous shoreline public access
is maintained and no permanent or semi-permanent structures prevent access to the shoreline.
General Policies
Policy 6 Required Public Access. Policy 6 includes the following requirements:
a. In accordance with general Bay Plan policies, maximum feasible public access should be provided in
conjunction with any development in the area covered by this SAP. Public access should be located
at ground or platform level, but minor variations in elevation intended to enhance design of open
space may be permitted. Public access should also be open to the sky, although some covering may
be allowed if it serves the public areas and does not support structures. Particular attention should be
given to the provision of perimeter public access along the platform edge. Other uses may extend to
the platform edge subject to the following conditions:

Consequences, and Mitigation

ii) Such uses should enhance the total design of the project, should serve to make the public access
more interesting, and should not divert the public way along more than 20 percent of the total
platform edge.
iii) Deviations of the public way from the platform edge should be limited to short distances.
b. Development of public access should be required as a condition of permits for new maritime and
nonmaritime development. The location of such access obtained as a condition of maritime
development between Channel Street and India Basin should be guided by the designations for public
recreation, open space, and public access.
San Francisco Bay Trail Plan
The Bay Trail Plan was prepared by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) pursuant to
Senate Bill 100, which mandated that the Bay Trail provide connection to existing parks and recreation
facilities, create links to existing and proposed transportation facilities, and avoid adverse effects on
environmentally sensitive areas. The Bay Trail Plan proposes an alignment of 400-mile recreational “ring
around the Bay.” The Bay Trail’s purpose is to create connections between more than 130 parks and
publicly accessible open space areas around San Francisco and San Pablo bays. Furthermore, the Bay
Trail will provide access to a wide array of commercial ferries and public boat launches. Bay Trail
policies and design guidelines are intended to complement the adopted regulations and guidelines of local
managing agencies. Relevant trail alignment policies include connections of the Bay Trail to other local
and regional trail and bikeway systems to provide alternatives to automobile access to the Bay Trail. Bay
Trail policies encourage access to the trail by all forms of public transit (ABAG, 1999).
Local
San Francisco General Plan
Recreation and Open Space Element. Policies of the General Plan Recreation and Open Space Element
(SF Planning, 1986) include the creation of a recreational trails system to link city parks and public open
space with the neighborhoods. The General Plan calls for a generous and well-maintained shoreline strip
to provide public access and accommodate development of a continuous pedestrian and bicycle shoreline
trail system.
Policies related to the project area include the improvement of physical access to and along the waterfront
by linking the open spaces in the Ferry Building area, including the Ferry Building Plaza, the Ferry Plaza
(the Bay side of the Ferry Building), the Embarcadero Promenade, and public access features as part of
new developments on Piers 1 and ½, and between the Ferry Building and the Agriculture Building. The
General Plan calls for these spaces to be designed to accommodate high volumes of people using
waterborne and landside transit services at and near the Ferry Building. Furthermore, it requires
provision of a mixture of commercial and recreational maritime activities, such as ferries, excursion
boats, historic ships, and water taxis.
Relevant recreation and open space policies include:
Policy 3.1. Ensure that new development adjacent to the shoreline capitalizes on its unique
waterfront location, considers shoreline land use provisions, improves visual and physical access to
the water, and conforms with urban design policies.
Policy 3.3. Create the Bay and Coastal Trails around the perimeter of the City of San Francisco
which links open space along the shoreline and provides for maximum waterfront access.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Policy 3.5. Provide new public open spaces along the shoreline.
Northeast Waterfront Area Plan
The overall goal of the Northeast Waterfront Area Plan is to create a physical and economic environment
in the Northeastern Waterfront area that allows use of the area’s resources and potential in the manner
that best serves the needs of the San Francisco community.
Relevant parklands and recreation policies of the Northeast Waterfront Area Plan include:
Policy 5.5. Encourage Bay-oriented commercial recreation and public assembly uses on piers, which
include public access and complementary maritime activities (e.g., cruises, excursions, ferries,
historic ships), and maritime support services.
Policy 7.8. Require the inclusion of a substantial amount of public open space and peripheral public
access to the water’s edge when major new mixed-use developments occur. Provide connections
between these open spaces and public access areas to create a “PortWalk” that is integrated with
sidewalk and pedestrian improvements along The Embarcadero (the Embarcadero Promenade) which,
between King Street and Jefferson Street, coincides with the regional Bay Trail. Public access should
be located at ground or platform level, but minor variations in elevation intended to enhance design of
open space may be permitted. Public access should also be open to the sky, although some covering
may be allowed if it serves the public areas and does not support structures. Particular attention
should be given to the provision of perimeter public access along the platform edge. Other uses may
extend to the platform edge, subject to the following conditions: (a) such uses should enhance the
total design of the project, should serve to make the public access more interesting, and should not
divert the public way along more than 20 percent of the total platform edge; and (b) deviations of the
public way from the platform edge should be limited to short distances.
Policy 7.9. Provide as much public open space and peripheral access as is feasible in areas of
maritime activity without interfering with the operation of this activity.
Policy 10.19. On nonmaritime piers with sheds, provide continuous peripheral pedestrian public
access ways for walking, viewing, and fishing. Provide benches and street furniture. Prohibit use of
designated public access areas for valet parking, auto drop-off, or trash storage, but allow emergency
vehicle access and, if no feasible alternatives exist, service vehicle access.
Policy 10.20. Provide continuous public pedestrian access to San Francisco Bay on the east side of
the Ferry Building that is separate from any service vehicle access to the Building.
The Port of San Francisco Waterfront Land Use Plan
As identified in Section 3.3, one of the highest priorities of the Waterfront Plan is to restore the Ferry
Building to its historic role as a transportation hub and centerpiece of the waterfront (Port, 2004). The
goals of the Waterfront Plan encourage and foster a balance of uses and activities on the waterfront,
including open space and recreation. The Waterfront Plan includes the following parkland recreational
policies:
Policy 2.b. Including new public access improvements, such as walkways and viewing areas, as part
of any substantial facility upgrade for commercial and recreation-oriented maritime operations (e.g.,
ferry and excursion boats, cruise ships, recreational boating), if financially feasible.
Design and Access Element. The Waterfront Design and Access Element addresses the nature of public
access and open spaces along the waterfront. It includes special emphasis on public access and open

Impact Evaluation

The analysis considers whether the project would:





Increase the use of existing parklands, open spaces, and trails enough that substantial physical
deterioration of the facility would occur or be accelerated;
Include recreation facilities or require the construction or expansion of recreation facilities that may
have an adverse physical effect on the environment;
Result in impacts on recreation resources; or
Conflict with applicable recreation and public access plans and policies.

The proposed project includes the construction of new and improved public access facilities, so the
potential impacts of these facilities are analyzed throughout this Environmental Impact Statement/
Environmental Impact Report.
The analysis evaluates the project’s potential to directly and indirectly affect parklands, open space, trails,
and other recreation facilities. The analysis includes an assessment of the permanent and temporary (i.e.,
construction-related) impacts on adjacent parklands and recreation facilities from the proposed project,
including impacts associated with additional pedestrian traffic in the area. For the purposes of this
analysis, recreation facilities are considered to include public access trails and paths used by the public.
The analysis describes whether the project would conflict with recreational and public access plans and
policies that apply to the project area. The evaluation of consistency with plans is organized by the
responsible agencies at the federal, state, regional, and local level. Potential conflicts with the federal
CZMA are discussed in this section under BCDC policies, because BCDC is the local agency with
implementation authority for the CZMA.
Direct Impacts
Impact 3.4-1: Direct Impacts on Recreation Resources
No Action Alternative
No modifications would be made to the Ferry Terminal facilities under the No Action Alternative;
therefore, there would be no impacts to recreation resources.
Action Alternative
The Action Alternative would result in the expansion and improvement of recreation facilities such as the
Embarcadero Plaza and East Bayside Promenade, resulting in benefits to recreation resources in the
project area. San Francisco Bay is a recreation resource in the study area, and is used for recreational
boating, including motoring, sailing, and kayaking. The closest marina is at South Beach Harbor,
approximately 1 mile to the south, and the closest public boat launch ramp is at Pier 1½, just to the north
of the project area. Additionally, both the Broadway and Rincon Point Open Water Basins provide areas
for water-related recreation. Implementation of the proposed project would result in the construction of
new facilities in San Francisco Bay (e.g., deck and pile structures and gates). However, these facilities
would be built in an area already developed and used as a Ferry Terminal. Therefore, these changes
would not substantially change the nature of San Francisco Bay’s recreation resources in the project area.
NEPA Determination. The project would not result in adverse direct impacts on recreation resources.

California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Determination. The proposed project would result in
less-than-significant direct impacts on recreation resources.
Impact 3.4-2: Conflict with Recreation and Public Access Plans and Policies
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no modifications would be made to the existing Ferry Terminal
facilities to accommodate new or existing Water Emergency Transportation Authority (WETA) services.
This could result in longer queues of water transit passengers and potential temporary conflicts with
public access at the terminal during passenger boarding. These temporary impediments to public access
would conflict with policies that support the flow of pedestrians around the Ferry Terminal, and would
result in adverse impacts in the area. However, potential conflicts with public access policies would be
limited and would generally occur only during passenger boarding or disembarking. Therefore, the
potential conflicts with recreation and public access plans and policies would be negligible.
Action Alternative
Potential conflicts with plans and policies are described by agency below for the proposed project.
BCDC. BCDC plans and policies pertaining to parks and recreation include the requirements of the
McAteer-Petris Act and the provisions of the Bay Plan and SAP. Section 66602 of the McAteer-Petris
Act states that maximum feasible public access, consistent with the proposed project, should be provided.
The SAP directs that the area be accessible to the public, free of charge and at any time; and that it serve
as passive recreational areas, focusing on its proximity to San Francisco Bay and on the views and unique
experiences that San Francisco Bay affords.
Existing public access at the Ferry Terminal is provided along The Embarcadero and around the Ferry
Building, including the Ferry Plaza, and the area between the Agriculture Building and the Ferry
Building. As described above and in Chapter 2.0, Alternatives, the proposed project would increase
public access around the Ferry Terminal by constructing improvements such as the new Embarcadero
Plaza, East Bayside Promenade, North Basin Marginal Wharf Improvements, and Gate A Access Pier.
These public access improvements would result in 37,600 square feet of public access space in the project
area, the majority of which would be new public access space.1 These improvements would be consistent
with the objectives of the project and would be accessible at any time; provide for passive recreation such
as walking, sitting, and viewing; emphasize and facilitate views of San Francisco Bay; and be free to the
public. Not only would the project expand physical public access around the Ferry Terminal, it would
also increase opportunities for viewing access to San Francisco Bay.
The proposed project would be generally consistent with the public access and recreation policies of the
Bay Plan, because it supports public access to San Francisco Bay. Public access would provide views of
San Francisco Bay and San Francisco, and would be designed to provide amenities consistent with the
public access and siting/design policies of the SAP.
The proposed project would not conflict with the policies of the McAteer-Petris Act, the Bay Plan, or the
SAP. The proposed project would require review and approval by the BCDC Design Review Board,
which would ensure project consistency with BCDC policies, including BCDC’s Public Access Design
Guidelines. Therefore, the proposed project would not conflict with BCDC plans and policies.

All of the pier deck constructed in the North Basin and South Basin would be available for public access. As shown in
Table 2-2 of Chapter 2 of this Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report, approximately 8,000 square
feet of pier deck would be constructed in the North Basin for the Gate A Access Pier. None of this area is currently available
for public access. In the South Basin, 29,600 square feet of pier deck would be constructed; approximately 9,760 square feet
of this currently exists and is generally accessible to the public.

ABAG. The San Francisco Bay Trail, which extends along The Embarcadero on the land side of the
Ferry Terminal, is collocated with the Embarcadero Promenade in the vicinity of the proposed project.
While the proposed project would not modify the Bay Trail, it would expand the public access in the
immediate vicinity of the trail. The proposed project would generally support the goals of ABAG’s San
Francisco Bay Trail Plan by increasing connections to recreation facilities and furthering links to existing
and proposed transportation facilities. The proposed project would not conflict with the policies of the
San Francisco Bay Trail Plan and would not result in conflicts with ABAG’s plans and policies.
City and County of San Francisco. Implementation of the proposed project would generally be
consistent with the policies of the Recreation and Open Space Element of the General Plan and the
Northeast Waterfront Area Plan. The proposed project improves visual and physical access to the water
and provides open space along the shoreline, consistent with policies 3.1, 3.3, and 3.5. Although the
specific project improvements are not described in the General Plan, the project would be generally
consistent with plan’s vision for the Ferry Building area, because the project would develop and improve
open spaces to promote recreational use and enjoyment of the waterfront, and would be designed to
accommodate high volumes of people using waterborne and landside transit services at and near the Ferry
Building. Consistent with the General Plan, the proposed project would improve physical access to and
along the waterfront, especially between the Ferry Building and Agriculture Building. Elements of the
project would encourage public assembly on piers, such as at the proposed Embarcadero Plaza; provide
open space and access to the extent feasible with the project; and provide continuous public pedestrian
access to San Francisco Bay along the east side of the Ferry Building, separated from vehicle access.
Port of San Francisco. Implementation of the Action Alternative would generally be consistent with
Port parkland policies. As envisioned in the Waterfront Land Use Plan, the Ferry Building is to be
restored to its historic role as a transportation hub and centerpiece for the waterfront. The project would
provide new public access improvements, including walkways and viewing areas at a maritime facility,
consistent with Policy 2b. During the project approval process, the Port would review the project’s
consistency with plan goals, as well as its consistency with the Design Criteria for the Ferry Building
Area. Therefore, the proposed project would not conflict with Port plans or policies.
NEPA Determination. The project would not conflict with applicable plans and policies pertaining to
parks and recreation, and therefore impacts would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The proposed project would have less-than-significant direct impacts related to
conflicts with applicable plans and policies pertaining to parks and recreation.
Indirect Impacts
Impact 3.4-3: Indirectly Increase the Use of Existing Neighborhood and Regional Parks
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no modifications would be made to the existing Ferry Terminal
facilities to accommodate new or existing WETA services. However, the water transit ridership would
increase from 5,100 to approximately 7,800 passengers per weekday by 2035; total AM peak-period
WETA vessel arrivals would increase from 14 to approximately 20 vessels. The increased number of
water transit passengers under the No Action Alternative could result in increased congestion around the
Ferry Building during passenger queuing for ferries, thus periodically reducing access along the public
pathways at the terminal.
The WETA water transit passengers are primarily commuters, who typically travel between the gates and
other downtown destinations. Although passengers may pass through the parks on their way to
destinations downtown, they are generally considered to be incidental users of the parks and recreation

facilities in the project area. Incidental use of the parks occurs when passengers use a park for a purpose
other than recreation, such as to get to a destination, but do not go to the park as a destination in itself.
The parks and recreation facilities in the immediate vicinity of the proposed project are designed to
accommodate high volumes of pedestrian traffic, and the incremental increase in park usage by
passengers under the No Action Alternative would not substantially change the existing character of the
parks.
The No Action Alternative would result in an incremental increase in the use of parks as passengers pass
through the parks, but this increase would not be expected to result in a great enough increase in park use
that substantial physical deterioration of recreation facilities would occur or be accelerated. The No
Action Alternative would result in less-than-significant impacts due to the potential increased use of parks
and recreation facilities. Therefore, the No Action Alternative would not have direct adverse impacts on
parks and recreation facilities.
Action Alternative
Under the Action Alternative, the Ferry Terminal facilities would be expanded and improved as described
in Chapter 2.0, Alternatives. The proposed project improvements would allow WETA water transit
ridership to increase from 5,100 to approximately 25,700 passengers per weekday by 2035, and total AM
peak-period WETA vessel arrivals would increase from 14 to approximately 52 to 57 vessels.
Similar to the No Action Alternative, the WETA passengers would be anticipated to be primarily
commuters who would typically travel to downtown destinations after disembarking from the vessel.
Passengers would incidentally use parks and recreation facilities as they pass through them, resulting in
an incremental increase in the use of these spaces. However, the parks through which departing
passengers would pass (e.g., the Harry Bridges Plaza and Justin Herman Plaza) are designed for high
pedestrian traffic. The incremental increase in users from the proposed project would not be anticipated
to result in the substantial deterioration of these park facilities. In addition, the expansion of public
facilities (e.g., Embarcadero Plaza and East Bayside Promenade) and improvements to facilities (e.g.,
pedestrian pathways) at the Ferry Terminal would provide expanded opportunities for passive recreational
activities for water transit passengers and other users.
NEPA Determination. The project would not result in adverse impacts associated with the potential
increased use of parks and recreation facilities.
CEQA Determination. The proposed project would result in less-than-significant indirect impacts
associated with the potential increased use of parks and recreation facilities.
Impact 3.4-4: Indirect Impacts on Recreation Resources
No Action Alternative
San Francisco Bay, a recreation resource in the study area, is used for recreational boating, including motoring,
sailing, and kayaking. The closest marina is at South Beach Harbor, approximately 1 mile to the south, and the
closest public boat launch ramp is at Pier 54, approximately 1.6 miles to the south. Additionally, both the
Broadway and Rincon Point Open Water basins provide areas for water-related recreation. Due to the existing
water transit vessel traffic in the project area, recreational users tend to pass through or near project area, rather
than to use the project area waters as a destination.
The increase in vessel traffic associated with the No Action Alternative (i.e., an increase from 14 to 20
peak period vessel arrivals) would be consistent with the current nature of the area, which entails heavy
use by water transit vessels, recreational boats, and large shipping vessels. Existing recreational users of

Consequences, and Mitigation

San Francisco Bay are accustomed to high vessel traffic in the area, and the incremental increase from the
No Action Alternative would not substantially change their experience or the nature of San Francisco Bay
as a recreation resource. The No Action Alternative would result in less-than-significant direct impacts
on recreation resources.
Action Alternative
As described above, San Francisco Bay is a resource used for recreational activities. However, due to the
existing water transit vessel traffic in the project area, recreational users tend to pass through or near project
area, rather than to use the project area waters as a destination.
The proposed project improvements would accommodate an increase in water transit vessel traffic in the
project area, from 14 to approximately 52 to 57; and the potential for conflicts with recreational users of
San Francisco Bay in the project area could increase due to the increased vessel traffic. However,
existing users of San Francisco Bay near the project area are accustomed to high vessel traffic, including
water transit vessels, recreational boats, and large shipping vessels. In addition, to limit wake impacts to
existing berthing facilities and to ensure passenger safety, the vessels are operated under self-imposed
procedures to approach berths slowly. This slow approach would reduce the risk of conflicts with San
Francisco Bay recreational users that could be passing through the project area. Therefore, the
incremental increase in WETA vessels would not substantially change the public’s ability to recreate on
San Francisco Bay in the project area.

Increased vessel traffic would result in less-than-significant impacts on

Construction Impacts
The No Action Alternative would not result in any physical changes to the Ferry Terminal, and no
construction activities would be required. Therefore, there would be no construction impacts to parklands
or recreation facilities.
Impact 3.4-5: Construction Impacts on Recreation Resources
Under the Action Alternative, portions of the existing public access at the Ferry Terminal would be
temporarily closed during construction, and new and improved public access facilities would be
constructed. This would not result in a great enough increase in the use of existing neighborhood and
regional parks or other recreation facilities that substantial physical deterioration of the facility would
occur or be accelerated. The proposed project includes the construction of recreation facilities, so the
potential impacts of the construction of these facilities are analyzed throughout this Environmental Impact
Statement/Environmental Impact Report. The proposed project would not result in construction-related
conflicts with applicable plans or policies.
Under the Action Alternative, construction activities at the Ferry Terminal could result in short-term
impacts on existing recreation resources in the project area. Public access in the proposed construction
zone (shown on Figure 2-9) would be restricted during the construction period. To minimize the area
around the Ferry Building that would be affected, the majority of construction activities would be
conducted and staged from barges in the construction zone. The Embarcadero Promenade and Bay Trail
would be outside the construction zone, and pedestrians could continue to pass through the area.
Pedestrian circulation around the Ferry Building would be maintained, as would access to water transit
gates and facilities along the Ferry Plaza.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

NEPA Determination. Because public access and services at the Ferry Terminal would be maintained
during construction, potential impacts to these recreation resources would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The proposed project would result in less-than-significant construction-related
impacts on parks and recreation facilities.
Cumulative Impacts
Impact 3.4-6: Potential to Result in Cumulative Impacts on Parklands and Recreation
The proposed project would improve and expand recreational facilities along San Francisco’s
northeastern waterfront. However, new deck and pile structures in San Francisco Bay and the increase in
vessel traffic could affect in-water recreational uses. The increase in water transit passengers that would
result from implementation of the proposed project would indirectly increase use of existing
neighborhood and regional parks in the study area. In addition, during construction, portions of the
project area would not be accessible to the public for recreational use. Although the impacts from the
proposed project would not be substantial and have been determined to be less than significant and not
adverse, other reasonably foreseeable projects in the study area could result in similar impacts. Projects,
such as the America’s Cup project, the Piers 15 and 17 Exploratorium Relocation, Pier 36 Brannan Street
Wharf project, 350 Mission Street, Pier 70 Area, Bay Area Rapid Transit Ferry Plaza Physical Barrier
Project, and the Blue Greenway project, would generally involve upgrades to existing infrastructure and
public facilities, rehabilitation or replacement of aging facilities, or the development of mixed urban uses
on derelict piers, as listed in Table 3.1-1. These projects, in combination with the proposed project, could
change existing recreation spaces; create new parks spaces; or result in an increase in residents and workers,
who would collectively be expected to increase the use of recreation facilities in the study area. However,
the recreation facilities in the study area are urban parklands, open space, and trails designed and
constructed to support substantial use, and are capable of serving large numbers of people. In addition,
many of the projects under the cumulative condition would construct or improve existing parks/open space
areas (including the proposed project), and would be anticipated to generally result in improvements to
recreation facilities. The construction activities that could result in a short-term reduction in recreational
space available would be unlikely to overlap and, as with the proposed project, it would be anticipated that
during construction the projects would accommodate recreational users to minimize disruption. Sufficient
recreation facilities would be available to serve the projects, and increased use of these facilities would not
result in substantial physical deterioration of recreation resources, nor would they otherwise result in
physical degradation of existing recreation resources. Therefore, there would be no cumulative impact on
parklands and recreation resources.
NEPA Determination. The project would not contribute to cumulative adverse impacts on recreation
resources.
CEQA Determination. Cumulative impacts to parks and recreation in the study area would be less than
significant.

properties are publicly owned lands of a park, recreation area, or wildlife and water fowl refuge, or land
of a historical site of national, state, or local significance, as determined by the federal, state, regional, or
local officials having jurisdiction over the resource. Under Section 4(f), an operating administration of
the U.S. Department of Transportation may not approve a project that uses protected properties unless
there are no prudent or feasible alternatives, and the project includes all possible planning to minimize
harm to such properties.
This chapter describes the statutory requirements associated with Section 4(f), and identifies the potential
protected properties in the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Project (project) area and the use of
those properties that would result from the Action Alternative. There would be no potential for impacts to
Section 4(f) properties under the No Action Alternative. As described below, the Action Alternative
would result in no use of or de minimis impacts to Section 4(f) properties.
3.5.2

Affected Environment

This section describes existing Section 4(f) properties in the study area. It also provides a regulatory
framework describing applicable laws, policies, and plans relevant to these properties. For the purpose of
this analysis, the project’s study area encompasses the project area and the properties within
approximately 1,000 feet of the project site.
Existing Setting
Project Area
The project is in northeastern San Francisco, along The Embarcadero, between Pier 1 and Pier 14,
including all areas west of The Embarcadero. The San Francisco Ferry Building (Ferry Building), the
Agriculture Building, the Golden Gate Ferry Terminal, the Ferry Plaza, Pier 2, existing water transit
Gates B, C, D, and E, and portions of San Francisco Bay are in the project area.
Study Area
The study area is in downtown San Francisco’s diverse mix of urban uses. Although the downtown area
is dominated by high-rise buildings, the portion of the study area closest to the water is characterized by
smaller-scale commercial structures and large open spaces, such as Justin Herman Plaza and the piers
along San Francisco’s waterfront. The northern part of the study area is adjacent to Golden Gateway, a
waterfront neighborhood containing low- to high-rise residential and commercial development. To the
west and south of the project area is the downtown commercial district.
Section 4(f) Properties
Section 4(f) properties in the study area consist of parks and recreation facilities, as well as historic
properties and historic districts. No wildlife or waterfowl refuges were identified within the study area.
For a park or recreation facility to be considered a Section 4(f) property, its primary use must be for
recreation. Therefore, areas that may be used by the recreating public, but whose primary use is other
than recreation (e.g., a sidewalk whose purpose is circulation or a retail and commercial space) are not
considered Section 4(f) properties.

Section 4(f) Parks and Recreation Areas. Figure 3.4-1 shows the major parklands and open spaces in
the study area. Section 4(f) parks and recreation facilities in the study area include several parks and open
spaces, as well as two piers under the jurisdiction of either the Port of San Francisco (Port) or the San
Francisco Recreation and Park Department for providing recreation and open spaces along the waterfront.
These properties are connected by the Herb Caen Way/Embarcadero Promenade (Embarcadero
Promenade), which is contiguous with the Bay Trail and the Shoreline Trail in the project area. Brief
descriptions of these properties are presented below; additional information about these properties is
presented in Section 3.4, Parklands and Recreation. Of the Section 4(f) parks and recreation facilities in
the study area, only the Embarcadero Promenade, Bay Trail, and Shoreline Trail pass through the project
area.


Harry Bridges Plaza, the paved area west of the Ferry Building and between The Embarcadero’s
northbound and southbound lanes, is popular for skateboarding and pedestrian access between the
Ferry Building and The Embarcadero, and is under the jurisdiction of the Port.



Justin Herman Plaza is a 4.3-acre open space at the foot of Market Street, across the street from the
Ferry Building, and is characterized by large, open, paved and grassy areas and a large fountain/
sculpture. Justin Herman Plaza, under the jurisdiction of the San Francisco Recreation and Park
Department, is used for various activities and group events throughout the year. In the winter, an ice
skating rink is created in the plaza. Tables, benches, and steps offer seating opportunities year round.



Sue Bierman Park, under the jurisdiction of the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department, is a
4.4-acre park, formerly known as Ferry Park, and is situated on the blocks bounded by The
Embarcadero and Washington, Davis, and Clay streets.



Pier 14 is a 637-foot-long public pier, under the jurisdiction of the Port, that was built in Phase I of
the project. The pier serves as a breakwater for the South Basin of the Downtown San Francisco
Ferry Terminal. Rotating public art installations are displayed on the landside of Pier 14.



Rincon Park is a 2-acre waterfront grassy area on The Embarcadero at the foot of Folsom Street,
between Harrison Street and Howard Street, and is under the jurisdiction of the Port.



Pier 7, south of Broadway Avenue, is an 840-foot-long public access and fishing pier, under the
jurisdiction of the Port, that was reconstructed following the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. The
pier includes timber decking, ornamental iron handrails, antique-style iron and wooden benches, light
fixtures, and benches.



Herb Caen Way/Embarcadero Promenade is a 25-foot-wide pedestrian promenade, running
2.75 miles along the waterfront between The Embarcadero and the pier bulkhead buildings, from
South Beach to Fisherman’s Wharf, passing the Ferry Building. The Embarcadero Promenade is
under the jurisdiction of the Port, and its contiguous open spaces provide more than 16 acres of public
open space. The Promenade is a multi-use pathway designated for recreation, bicycle transportation,
maritime functions, and access to piers.



The San Francisco Bay Trail is contiguous with the Embarcadero Promenade, and therefore under the
jurisdiction of the Port. The Bay Trail’s purpose is to create connections between more than 130
parks and publicly accessible open space areas in a 400-mile recreational “ring around the Bay.”
Furthermore, the Bay Trail provides access to a wide array of commercial ferries and public boat
launches.



The Shoreline Trail, identified in the San Francisco General Plan, is also contiguous with the Bay
Trail and the Embarcadero Promenade, in the study area.

Section 4(f) Historic Resources. The study area includes three Section 4(f) historic properties: Pier 1,
the Ferry Building, and the Agriculture Building. In addition, the study area is in two historical districts:
the Port of San Francisco Embarcadero Historic District (Embarcadero Historic District), and the Central
Embarcadero Piers Historic District. Section 3.8 – Cultural and Paleontological Resources, includes a
detailed description of the historical districts and properties in the study area, along with figures
illustrating their locations.


Pier 1 is on the eastern side of The Embarcadero at the foot of Washington Street. The structure is
listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) for its association with San Francisco
maritime commerce and transportation, as well as its architecture, and contributes to the Embarcadero
Historic District and to the Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District.



The Ferry Building, known originally as the Union Ferry Depot Building, is on The Embarcadero at
the foot of Market Street. The building is listed in the NRHP for its association with important
transportation events, and its significant engineering design.



The Agriculture Building, originally known as the Ferry Station Post Office Building, is on The
Embarcadero at the foot of Mission Street. The building is listed in the NRHP for its architecture, as
well as its association with the centralization of San Francisco’s postal system.



The Port of San Francisco Embarcadero Historic District stretches nearly 3 miles along San
Francisco’s waterfront, from Pier 45 on the north to Pier 48 on the south. The district is listed on the
NRHP for its association with important events and people in history, and for its architectural
significance. The boundary of this district encompasses only the elements that contribute to the
district’s overall NRHP eligibility. In the project area, the only contributing element to this district
that is not individually eligible for listing in the NRHP is the seawall. The seawall is a linear stone,
concrete, and wood embankment that unifies the physical form of the district. In the project area, the
seawall is obscured from view by the bulkhead wharves and piers that were built on top of it.



The Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District, whose contributing elements are Piers 1, 1½, 3,
and 5, lies along San Francisco’s northeastern waterfront, immediately north of the Ferry Building
and the project area. This Historic District is listed in the NRHP for its association with commerce
and transportation in San Francisco, as well as its architecture. The boundary of this district
encompasses only the elements that contribute to the district’s overall NRHP eligibility.

Regulatory Setting
Federal
Department of Transportation Act of 1966 Section 4(f)
Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966, codified in federal law as 49 USC §303
(commonly referred to as Section 4[f]), declares that “[i]t is the policy of the United States Government
that special effort should be made to preserve the natural beauty of the countryside and public park and
recreation lands, wildlife and water fowl refuges, and historic sites.” Compliance with Section 4(f) is
required for transportation projects that may receive federal funding and/or discretionary approvals. The
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) may not approve the use of a Section 4(f) property, as defined in
49 USC 303(c), unless it determines: there is no feasible and prudent avoidance alternative to the use of
the land and the action includes all possible planning to minimize harm to the property resulting from
such use or the project has a de minimis impact according to 49 USC § 303(d).

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Impact Evaluation

The analysis considers whether the project would:


Result in a use of any Section 4(f) properties. As defined in 23 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR),
Section 771.135(p), the “use” of a protected Section 4(f) resource occurs when any of the following
conditions are met:
−

Land is permanently incorporated into a transportation facility through partial or full acquisition
(i.e., “direct use”).

−

There is a temporary occupancy of land that is adverse in terms of the preservationist purposes of
Section 4(f) (i.e., “temporary occupancy”).

−

There is no permanent incorporation of land, but the proximity of a transportation facility results
in impacts so severe that the protected activities, features, or attributes that qualify a resource for
protection under Section 4(f) are substantially impaired (i.e., “constructive use”).

Section 4(f) Direct Use
A direct use of a Section 4(f) resource occurs when property is permanently incorporated into a proposed
transportation facility (23 CFR, Section 771.135[p][1]). This may occur as a result of partial or full
acquisition of a property, permanent easements, or temporary easements that exceed regulatory limits
noted in 23 CFR, Section 771.135(p)(7); or when a physical feature of a proposed improvement would
directly intersect with a portion or all of the resources, and require the use of property from that resource.
Section 4(f) Temporary Occupancy
A temporary occupancy of a Section 4(f) resource occurs when a property is temporarily occupied, and
the occupation is considered adverse in terms of the preservationist purposes of the Section 4(f) statute.
Under 23 CFR, Section 771.135(p)(7), a temporary occupancy of property does not constitute a use of a
Section 4(f) resource when the following conditions are satisfied:


The occupancy is of a temporary duration (i.e., shorter than the period of construction) and does not
involve a change in ownership of the property.



The scope of work is minor, with only minimal changes to the protected resource.



There are no permanent adverse physical effects on the protected resource, and there would be no
temporary or permanent interference with activities or the purpose of the resource.



After the use, the property being used is fully restored to a condition that is at least as good as that
which existed prior to the proposed project.



There must be documented agreement of the appropriate officials having jurisdiction over the
resource, regarding the foregoing requirements.

Section 4(f) Constructive Use
A constructive use of a Section 4(f) resource occurs when a transportation project does not permanently
incorporate land from the resource, but the proximity of the project results in impacts (e.g., noise,
vibration, visual, access, and/or ecological impacts) so severe that the protected activities, features, or
attributes that qualify the resource for protection under Section 4(f) are substantially impaired (23 CFR,
Section 771.135[p][2]). Substantial impairment occurs only if the protected activities, features, or

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

attributes of the resource are substantially diminished. This determination is made through the following
practices:


Identification of the current activities, features, or attributes of the resource that may be sensitive to
proximity impacts.



Analysis of the potential proximity impacts on the resource.



Consultation with the appropriate officials having jurisdictions over the resource (23 CFR,
Section 771.135[p][6]).

Section 4(f) De Minimis Impacts
According to Federal Highway Administration/FTA joint guidance on determining de minimis impacts on
Section 4(f) resources, the impact criteria and requirements specified in 23 CFR Section 774 are different
for historic sites than for parks, recreation areas, and wildlife and waterfowl refuges.
A finding of de minimis impact on a park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge may be made
when:


The transportation use of the Section 4(f) resource, together with any impact avoidance,
minimization, and mitigation or enhancement measures incorporated into the project, does not
adversely affect the activities, features, and attributes that qualify the resource for protection under
Section 4(f);



The officials(s) with jurisdiction over the property are informed of the FTA’s intent to make a finding
of de minimis impact based on their agency’s written concurrence that the project would not adversely
affect the activities, features, and attributes that qualify the resource for protection under Section 4(f);
and



The public has been afforded an opportunity to review and comment on the effects of the project on
protected activities, features, and attributes of the Section 4(f) resource.

A finding of de minimis impact on a historic site may be made when:


The process required by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act results in the
determination of “no adverse effect” or “no historic properties affected,” with the concurrence of the
State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO);



SHPO is informed of the FTA and sponsoring agency’s intent to make a de minimis impact finding
based on SHPO’s written concurrence on the Section 106 determination of effect; and



FTA has considered the views of any consulting parties participating in the Section 106 consultation.

Analysis of Section 4(f) Use for the No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no modifications would be made to the existing Ferry Terminal
facilities to accommodate new or existing San Francisco Bay Area Water Emergency Transportation
Authority services. Existing park and recreation spaces, historic properties, and historic districts would
be unaffected. Therefore, there would be no direct use or indirect impacts that would substantially impair
the use of any Section 4(f) properties.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Analysis of Section 4(f) Use for the Proposed Project
Section 4(f) Parks and Recreation Areas
The construction zone for the proposed project is outside the boundaries of any Section 4(f) park or
recreation properties. Because no land would be required from these properties, there would be no direct
use of these properties as a result of the project.
As discussed in Section 3.2, Transportation and Circulation; Section 3.4, Parklands and Recreation;
Section 3.7, Noise and Vibration; and Section 3.10, Aesthetics and Visual Resources, the Action
Alternative would not result in indirect impacts that would substantially impair the use of the park and
recreation features in the study area. For example, access to these Section 4(f) properties would be
maintained during and after construction, and the visual setting of the project would not significantly
change. These Section 4(f) properties are in an urban setting, and are not noise-sensitive. Furthermore,
noise levels during construction would be in compliance with City and County of San Francisco
ordinance. As further discussed in Section 3.4, Parklands and Recreation, the Action Alternative would
have a beneficial impact to parks and recreation areas by expanding opportunities for passive recreational
activities. Therefore, the Action Alternative would not result in a constructive use of these Section 4(f)
properties.
In summary, the Action Alternative would not require the use of any Section 4(f) park or recreation
property.
Section 4(f) Historic Properties
Pier 1
The project construction zone is outside the boundaries of Pier 1, except where the wood fendering could
be replaced. The Action Alternative may involve the potential replacement of wood fendering along the
southern edge of Pier 1, to safely operate vessels at the new Gate A. During the final design of the
project, the existing fendering along the southern edge of Pier 1 would be inspected to determine whether
replacement is necessary. This replacement would require the removal of 33 wood piles along the
southern side of the pier, which would be replaced with 330 linear feet of “chock block” fendering with
33 new wood piles. In the event that the fendering would require replacement, Mitigation
Measure CUL-3, presented in Section 3.8, would be required. This measure requires that replacement of
the fendering be constructed consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of
Historic Properties, Standards for Rehabilitation (NPS, 2001). Additionally, because inadvertent damage
to Pier 1 during construction could result in an adverse effect, implementation of Mitigation
Measure CUL-4 requires demarcation of the construction zone, to reduce the potential for inadvertent
damage; and implementation of a response and repair plan, should any inadvertent damage occur during
construction. These measures would avoid and minimize potential adverse effects. With the
implementation of CUL-3 and CUL-4, the project would result in “no adverse effect” to Pier 1. SHPO
concurred with this determination on April 15, 2013.
As described in Section 3.8, Cultural Resources, other new project elements would be in keeping with the
existing scale and visual context of the area, and would not result in the introduction of visual elements that
diminish the integrity of the property’s significant historic features, nor result in adverse effects to the
historic properties. The noise caused by construction activities, as well as project operations, would not
cause indirect adverse effects to historic properties or resources. The analysis of construction vibration
concluded that vibration has the potential to result in damage to the individual historic properties or
resources in the study area. Mitigation Measure NOISE-3, presented in Section 3.7, requires the selection of
appropriate pile-driving techniques based on the distance from existing buildings; vibration monitoring
during construction; and that work be ceased and corrective measures or alternative construction methods be

implemented should vibration monitoring indicate the threshold would be exceeded. Therefore,
implementation of Mitigation Measure NOISE-3 would avoid indirect adverse effects to Pier 1. SHPO
concurred with this determination on April 15, 2013.
Therefore, in accordance with 23 CFR 774.5, FTA has determined that the Action Alternative would have
a de minimis impact on Pier 1.
Ferry Building
The construction zone for the Action Alternative is outside the boundary of the Ferry Building; therefore,
there would be no direct use of this Section 4(f) property.
As discussed in Section 3.8, Cultural Resources, new project elements would be in keeping with the
existing scale and visual context of the area, and would not result in the introduction of visual elements
that diminish the integrity of the property’s significant historic features, or adversely affect the historic
property. Mitigation Measure CUL-6 requires that final design of the weather protection canopies be
developed in consultation with local agencies, and consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s
Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties, Standards for Rehabilitation (NPS, 2001). Although
adverse impacts are not anticipated based on the preliminary design, implementation of Mitigation
Measure CUL-6, presented in Section 3.8, would ensure that indirect adverse visual effects from the final
design of the weather protection canopy element of the proposed project are avoided for the Ferry
Building. The consultation and application of the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards would ensure that
historic integrity is retained, and that the property would remain eligible for listing in the NRHP and
California Register of Historical Resources. Additionally, because inadvertent damage to the Ferry
Building during construction could result in an adverse effect, implementation of Mitigation
Measure CUL-4 would avoid and minimize potential adverse effects from inadvertent damage.
Therefore, with implementation of CUL-4 and CUL-6, the project would result in “no adverse effect” to
this historic property. SHPO concurred with this determination on April 15, 2013.
The noise caused by construction activities and project operations would not cause indirect adverse
effects to historic properties/resources. With the implementation of Mitigation Measure NOISE-3,
presented in Section 3.7, there would be no indirect adverse effects to this historic property as a result of
vibration. Therefore, the Action Alternative would not result in proximity impacts that would
substantially impair this Section 4(f) property, resulting in “no adverse effect” to this historic property.
SHPO concurred with this determination on April 15, 2013.
Therefore, there would be no Section 4(f) use of the Ferry Building.
Agriculture Building
The construction zone for the Action Alternative is outside the boundary of any portion of the Agriculture
Building; therefore, there would be no direct use of this Section 4(f) property.
Similar to the Ferry Building, described above, and as discussed in Section 3.8, Cultural Resources, the
Action Alternative’s project elements would not diminish the integrity of the property’s significant historic
features, nor adversely affect this historic property. Implementation of Mitigation Measure CUL-6 would
ensure that indirect adverse visual effects from the final design of the weather protection canopy element
of the proposed project are avoided for the Agriculture Building. Additionally, because inadvertent
damage to the Agriculture Building during construction could result in an adverse effect, implementation
of Mitigation Measure CUL-4 would avoid and minimize potential adverse effects from inadvertent
damage. The noise caused by construction activities and project operations would not cause indirect
adverse effects to historic properties/resources.
With the implementation of Mitigation
Measure NOISE-3, presented in Section 3.7 there would be no indirect adverse effects to this historic

property as a result of vibration. Therefore, the Action Alternative would not result in proximity impacts
that would substantially impair this Section 4(f) property, resulting in “no adverse effect” to this historic
property. SHPO concurred with this determination on April 15, 2013.
Therefore, there would be no Section 4(f) use of the Agriculture Building.
Port of San Francisco Embarcadero Historic District
The boundaries of the district encompass only the elements that contribute to the district’s overall NRHP
eligibility; and in the study area, this is limited to Pier 1 and the seawall. The potential use associated
with Pier 1 is described above. The project would not result in a direct impact to the seawall, and would
result in no actual Section 4(f) use of the seawall. However, as described above, the Action Alternative
would impact Pier 1—a contributing feature to the district. With the implementation of CUL-3, the
project would result in “no adverse effect” to Pier 1 from fendering replacement, because the replacement
of fendering would be consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of
Historic Properties, Standards for Rehabilitation (NPS, 2001). Additionally, because inadvertent damage
to the Pier 1 during construction could result in an adverse effect, implementation of Mitigation
Measure CUL-4 would avoid and minimize potential adverse effects from inadvertent damage. Therefore
the project would have “no adverse effect” on Pier 1. SHPO concurred with this determination on
April 15, 2013. The project is not anticipated to cause a direct adverse effect to historic properties/
resources, because construction or demolition would not—with the aforementioned exception of the
possible fendering removal at Pier 1—damage, destroy, or otherwise alter, in whole or in part,
contributing or individually eligible historic properties or resources.
New project elements would be in keeping with the existing scale and visual context of the area, and
would not result in the introduction of visual elements that diminish the integrity of the property’s
significant historic features, or adversely affect the historic property. Mitigation Measure CUL-6 requires
that final design of the weather protection canopies be developed in consultation with local agencies, and
be consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties,
Standards for Rehabilitation (NPS, 2001). Although adverse impacts are not anticipated based on the
preliminary design, implementation of Mitigation Measure CUL-6 would ensure that indirect adverse
visual effects from the final design of the weather protection canopy element of the proposed project are
avoided for the Port of San Francisco Embarcadero Historic District. The noise caused by construction
activities and project operations would not cause indirect adverse effects to historic properties/resources.
Although there may be indirect impacts to the contributing seawall as a result of vibration, with the
implementation of Mitigation Measure NOISE-3, presented in Section 3.7, the Action Alternative would
result in “no adverse effect” to this contributing element.
The Action Alternative would result in “no adverse effect” to the Port of San Francisco Embarcadero
Historic District. SHPO concurred with this determination on April 15, 2013. Therefore, in accordance
with 23 CFR 774.5, FTA has determined the Action Alternative would have a de minimis impact to the
Port of Embarcadero Historic District.
Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District
The Action Alternative would require construction within the boundaries of the Central Embarcadero
Piers Historic District. The boundaries of the district encompass only the elements that contribute to the
district’s overall NRHP eligibility; and in the study area, this is limited to Pier 1. As described above, the
Action Alternative would impact Pier 1—a contributing feature to the district. With the implementation
of Mitigation Measure CUL-3 and CUL-4, the project would result in “no adverse effect” to Pier 1.
SHPO concurred with this determination on April 15, 2013. The project is not anticipated to cause a
direct adverse effect to historic properties or resources, because construction or demolition would not—

New project elements would be in keeping with the existing scale and visual context of the area, and
would not result in the introduction of visual elements that diminish the integrity of the property’s

preliminary design, implementation of Mitigation Measure CUL-6 would ensure that indirect adverse
visual effects from the final design of the weather protection canopy element of the proposed project are
avoided for the Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District. The noise and vibration caused by
construction activities and project operations would not cause indirect adverse effects to historic
properties/resources. The Action Alternative would result in no adverse effect to Central Embarcadero
Piers Historic District. SHPO concurred with this determination on April 15, 2013.
Therefore, in accordance with 23 CFR 774.5, FTA has determined the Action Alternative would have a
de minimis impact to the Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District.

AIR QUALITY AND GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE

3.6.1

Introduction to the Analysis

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

This section summarizes the existing air quality conditions in the local air basin, describes the air
quality and climate change regulations applicable to the proposed project, identifies the analysis
methodology, and discusses the potential impacts that the project alternatives may have on air quality
and climate change. Applicable thresholds applied to the project’s potential emissions include those
established by federal transportation conformity regulations, and by the Bay Area Air Quality
Management District’s (BAAQMD’s) CEQA (California Environmental Quality Act) Air Quality
Guidelines. Appendix B details the methods and assumptions used to estimate construction and
operational emissions from project alternatives. This analysis has determined that the proposed project,
with the implementation of mitigation measures, would not result in adverse impacts on air quality or
climate change.
3.6.2

Affected Environment

This section describes the air quality and global climate change environmental and regulatory setting.
Meteorological data are discussed, including temperature and precipitation; and ambient concentrations
for the appropriate criteria pollutants are summarized. Toxic air contaminants (TACs) are also discussed.
The regulatory discussion includes sections on federal, state, and local air quality and global climate
change laws, rules, and regulations as they pertain to the proposed project.
Air Quality Setting
Climate and Meteorology
The project area is located within the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin (SFBAAB). The project area is
within the jurisdiction of the BAAQMD. BAAQMD is the primary agency responsible for air quality
regulation in the 9-county SFBAAB. San Francisco’s proximity to onshore breezes stimulated by the
Pacific Ocean provide for generally very good air quality in the project area.
The SFBAAB is characterized by complex terrain, consisting of coastal mountain ranges, inland valleys,
and bays, which distort normal wind flow patterns. The Coast Range splits wind flows, resulting in a
western coast gap (Golden Gate) and an eastern coast gap (Carquinez Strait), which allows air to flow in
and out of the SFBAAB and the Central Valley.
During the summer, winds flowing from the northwest are drawn inland through the Golden Gate and
over the lower portions of the San Francisco Peninsula, such as through the San Bruno Gap. Immediately
south of Mount Tamalpais, the northwesterly winds accelerate considerably and come more directly from
the west as they stream through the Golden Gate. This channeling of wind through the Golden Gate
produces a jet that sweeps eastward and splits off to the northwest toward the City of Richmond, and to
the southwest toward the City of San Jose when it meets the East Bay hills. The San Bruno Gap extends
from Fort Funston on the ocean to the San Francisco Airport. Because the gap is oriented in the same
northwest-to-southeast direction as the prevailing winds, and because the elevations along the gap are less
than 200 feet, marine air is easily able to penetrate into San Francisco Bay.
Wind speeds may be strong locally in areas where air is channeled through a narrow opening, such as the
Carquinez Strait, the Golden Gate, or the San Bruno gap. For example, the average wind speed at San
Francisco International Airport in July is about 17 knots (from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.), compared with only
7 knots at San Jose (BAAQMD, 2011).

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

The air flowing in from the coast to the Central Valley, called the sea breeze, begins developing at or
near ground level along the coast in late morning or early afternoon. As the day progresses, the sea
breeze layer deepens and increases in velocity while spreading inland. The depth of the sea breeze
depends in large part upon the height and strength of the inversion. If the inversion is low and strong
(and hence stable), the flow of the sea breeze will be inhibited, and stagnant conditions are likely to
result.
In the winter, the SFBAAB frequently experiences stormy conditions with moderate to strong winds, as
well as periods of stagnation with very light winds. Winter stagnation episodes are characterized by
nighttime drainage flows in coastal valleys. Drainage is a reversal of the usual daytime air-flow patterns;
air moves from the Central Valley toward the coast and back down toward San Francisco Bay from the
smaller valleys within the SFBAAB (BAAQMD, 2011). The predominant wind direction in the project
vicinity is from west to east (BAAQMD, 2012a).
The climate is dominated by the strength and location of a semi-permanent, subtropical high-pressure cell.
During the summer, the Pacific high pressure cell is centered over the northeastern Pacific Ocean,
resulting in stable meteorological conditions and a steady northwesterly wind flow. Upwelling of deep
cold ocean water to the surface produces a band of cold water off the California coast. The cool and
moisture-laden air approaching the coast from the Pacific Ocean is further cooled by the presence of the
cold water band, resulting in condensation and the presence of fog and stratus clouds along the Northern
California coast.
In the winter, the Pacific high-pressure cell weakens and shifts southward, resulting in wind flow
offshore, curtailing upwelling, and causing storms. Weak inversions coupled with moderate winds result
in a low air pollution potential.
Summertime temperatures in the SFBAAB are determined in large part by the effect of differential
heating between land and water surfaces. Because land tends to heat up and cool off more quickly than
water, a large-scale gradient (differential) in temperature is often created between the coast and the
Central Valley, and small-scale local gradients are often produced along the shorelines of the ocean and
bays. The temperature gradient near the ocean is also exaggerated, especially in summer, because of the
upwelling of cold ocean bottom water along the coast. On summer afternoons, the temperatures at the
coast can be 35 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than temperatures 15 to 20 miles inland. At night, this contrast
usually decreases to less than 10 degrees Fahrenheit (BAAQMD, 2011).
In the winter, the relationship of minimum and maximum temperatures is reversed. During the daytime
the temperature contrast between the coast and inland areas is small, and at night the variation in
temperature is large.
The SFBAAB is characterized by moderately wet winters and dry summers. Winter rains account for
about 75 percent of the average annual rainfall. The amount of annual precipitation can vary greatly from
one part of the SFBAAB to another, even within short distances. In general, total annual rainfall can
reach 40 inches in the mountains, but it is often less than 16 inches in sheltered valleys (BAAQMD,
2011).

Notes:
1
California standards for ozone, carbon monoxide (except Lake Tahoe), sulfur dioxide (1 and 24 hour), nitrogen dioxide,
suspended particulate matter—PM10, PM2.5, and visibility-reducing particles—are values that are not to be exceeded. All
others are not to be equaled or exceeded. California ambient air quality standards are listed in the Table of Standards in
Section 70200 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations.
2
National standards (other than ozone, particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), and those based on annual averages or annual
arithmetic mean) are not to be exceeded more than once a year. The ozone standard is attained when the fourth-highest
8-hour concentration in a year, averaged over 3 years, is equal to or less than the standard. For PM10, the 24-hour standard is
attained when the expected number of days per calendar year with a 24-hour average concentration above 150 µg/m3 is equal
to or less than one. For PM2.5, the 24-hour standard is attained when 98 percent of the daily concentrations, averaged over
3 years, are equal to or less than the standard. Contact U.S. EPA for further clarification and current federal policies.
3
Concentration expressed first in units in which it was promulgated. Equivalent units given in parentheses are based upon
a reference temperature of 25 degrees Celsius and a reference pressure of 760 torr. Most measurements of air quality are
to be corrected to a reference temperature of 25 degrees Celsius and a reference pressure of 760 torr; ppm in this table
refers to ppm by volume, or micromoles of pollutant per mole of gas.
4
National Primary Standards: The levels of air quality necessary, with an adequate margin of safety to protect the public health.
5
National Secondary Standards: The levels of air quality necessary to protect the public welfare from any known or
anticipated adverse effects of a pollutant.
6
To attain this standard, the 3-year average of the 98th percentile of the daily maximum 1-hour average at each monitor
within an area must not exceed 0.100 ppm (effective January 22, 2010). Note that the U.S. EPA standards are in ppb.
California standards are in ppm. To directly compare the national standards to the California standards the units can be
converted from ppb to ppm. In this case, the national standards of 53 ppb and 100 ppb are identical to 0.053 ppm and
0.100 ppm, respectively.
7
On June 2, 2010, the U.S. EPA established a new 1-hour SO2 standard, effective August 23, 2010, which is based on the
3-year average of the annual 99th percentile of 1-hour daily maximum concentrations. The U.S. EPA also revoked both
the existing 24-hour SO2 standard of 0.14 ppm and the annual primary SO2 standard of 0.030 ppm, effective August 23,
2010. The secondary SO2 standard was not revised at that time; however, the secondary standard is undergoing a separate
review by the U.S. EPA. Note that the new standard is in ppb. California standards are in ppm. To directly compare the
new primary national standard to the California standard the units can be converted to ppm. In this case, the national
standard of 75 ppb is identical to 0.075 ppm.
8
The California Air Resources Board has identified lead and vinyl chloride as “toxic air contaminants,” with no threshold
level of exposure for adverse health effects determined. These actions allow for the implementation of control measures at
levels below the ambient concentrations specified for these pollutants.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Ozone
Ozone, or smog, is not emitted directly into the environment, but is formed in the atmosphere by complex
chemical reactions between reactive organic gases (ROG) and oxides of nitrogen (NOX) in the presence of
sunlight. Ozone formation is greatest on warm, windless, sunny days. The main sources of NOX and
ROG, often referred to as ozone precursors, are combustion processes (including motor vehicle engines);
the evaporation of solvents, paints, and fuels; and biogenic sources. Automobiles are the single largest
source of ozone precursors in the SFBAAB. Tailpipe emissions of ROG are highest during cold starts,
hard acceleration, stop-and-go conditions, and slow speeds. They decline as speeds increase up to about
50 miles per hour, then increase again at high speeds and high engine loads. ROG emissions associated
with evaporation of unburned fuel depend on vehicle and ambient temperature cycles. Nitrogen oxide
emissions exhibit a different curve; emissions decrease as the vehicle approaches 30 miles per hour and
then begin to increase with increasing speeds (BAAQMD, 2011).
Ozone levels usually build up during the day and peak in the afternoon hours. Short-term exposure can
irritate the eyes and cause constriction of the airways. Besides causing shortness of breath, it can
aggravate existing respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. Chronic exposure to
high ozone levels can permanently damage lung tissue. Ozone can also damage plants and trees, and
materials such as rubber and fabrics.
Table 3.6-1 shows that the most stringent applicable standards (state 1-hour standard of nine parts per
hundred million and the federal 8-hour standard of 7.5 parts per hundred million) were not exceeded in
San Francisco between 2006 and 2011 (CARB, 2012a).
Table 3.6-3 (on the next page) shows the current attainment status for each criteria air pollutant. For ozone,
the SFBAAB is classified as a nonattainment area for the state and federal standards. This nonattainment
classification is primarily due to ozone violations recorded in the East Bay portion of the SFBAAB.
Carbon Monoxide
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas. It is formed by the incomplete combustion of fuels.
The single largest source of CO in the SFBAAB is motor vehicles. Emissions are highest during cold
starts, hard acceleration, stop-and-go driving, and when a vehicle is moving at low speeds. When inhaled
at high concentrations, CO combines with hemoglobin in the blood and reduces the oxygen-carrying
capacity of the blood. This results in reduced oxygen reaching the brain, heart, and other body tissues.
This condition is especially critical for people with cardiovascular diseases, chronic lung disease, or
anemia, and for fetuses. Even healthy people exposed to high CO concentrations can experience
headaches, dizziness, fatigue, unconsciousness, and even death (BAAQMD, 2011).
No violations of the CO standard were recorded at the closest ambient air quality monitoring station
(Table 3.6-1). The SFBAAB is classified as an attainment area for the state and federal CO standards.
Particulate Matter
Particulate matter (PM) refers to a wide range of solid or liquid particles in the atmosphere, including
smoke, dust, aerosols, and metallic oxides. Respirable PM with an aerodynamic diameter of
10 micrometers or less is referred to as PM10. PM2.5 includes a subgroup of finer particles that have an
aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less. Some PM, such as pollen, is naturally occurring. In
the SFBAAB, most PM is caused by combustion, factories, construction, grading, demolition, agricultural
activities, and motor vehicles. Extended exposure to PM can increase the risk of chronic respiratory
disease. PM10 is of concern because it bypasses the body‘s natural filtration system more easily than
larger particles, and can lodge deep in the lungs. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA)

Notes:
1
California standards for ozone, carbon monoxide (except Lake Tahoe), sulfur dioxide (1-hour and 24-hour), nitrogen dioxide,
suspended particulate matter – PM10, and visibility-reducing particles are values that are not to be exceeded. The standards for
sulfates, Lake Tahoe carbon monoxide, lead, hydrogen sulfide, and vinyl chloride are not to be equaled or exceeded. If the
standard is for a 1-hour, 8-hour or 24-hour average (i.e., all standards except for lead and the PM10 annual standard), then some
measurements may be excluded. In particular, measurements are excluded that CARB determines would occur less than once
per year on the average.
2
National standards shown are the “primary standards” designed to protect public health. National standards other than for
ozone, particulates, and those based on annual averages are not to be exceeded more than once a year. The 1-hour ozone
standard is attained if, during the most recent 3-year period, the average number of days per year with maximum hourly
concentrations above the standard is equal to or less than one. The 8-hour ozone standard is attained when the 3-year average of
the 4th highest daily concentrations is 0.075 ppm (75 ppb) or less. The 24-hour PM10 standard is attained when the 3-year
average of the 99th percentile of monitored concentrations is less than 150 µg/m3. The 24-hour PM2.5 standard is attained when
the 3-year average of 98th percentiles is less than 35 µg/m3. Except for the national particulate standards, annual standards are
met if the annual average falls below the standard at every site. The national annual particulate standard for PM10 is met if the
3-year average falls below the standard at every site. The annual PM2.5 standard is met if the 3-year average of annual averages
spatially averaged across officially designed clusters of sites falls below the standard.
3
National air quality standards are set by U.S. EPA at levels determined to be protective of public health with an adequate margin
of safety.
4
In June 2004, the Bay Area was designated as a marginal nonattainment area of the national 8-hour ozone standard. The
U.S. EPA lowered the national 8-hour ozone standard from 0.080 to 0.075 ppm (i.e., 75 ppb), effective May 27, 2008. In early
January 2010, the U.S. EPA proposed a stricter air quality standard for ground level ozone. The new ozone proposal would set
the primary smog standard at a level between 0.060 and 0.070 ppm measured over an 8-hour period.
5
The national 1-hour ozone standard was revoked by U.S. EPA on June 15, 2005.
6
In April 1998, the Bay Area was redesignated to attainment for the national 8-hour carbon monoxide standard.
7
In June 2002, CARB established new annual standards for PM2.5 and PM10.
8
Statewide VRP Standard (except Lake Tahoe Air Basin): Particles in sufficient amount to produce an extinction coefficient of
0.23 per kilometer when the relative humidity is less than 70 percent. This standard is intended to limit the frequency and
severity of visibility impairment due to regional haze and is equivalent to a 10-mile nominal visual range.
9
The 8-hour California ozone standard was approved by CARB on April 28, 2005, and became effective on May 17, 2006.
10
The U.S. EPA lowered the 24-hour PM2.5 standard from 65 µg/m3 to 35 µg/m3 in 2006. U.S. EPA designated the Bay Area as
being in nonattainment of the PM2.5 standard on October 8, 2009. The effective date of the designation is December 14, 2009,
and the Air District has 3 years to develop an SIP demonstrating that the Bay Area will achieve the revised standard by
December 14, 2014. The SIP for the new PM2.5 standard must be submitted to the U.S. EPA by December 14, 2012.
11
On June 2, 2010, the U.S. EPA established a new 1-hour SO2 standard, effective August 23, 2010, which is based on the 3-year
average of the annual 99th percentile of 1-hour daily maximum concentrations. The existing 0.030 ppm annual and 0.14 ppm
24-hour SO2 NAAQS, however must continue to be used until 1 year following U.S. EPA initial designations of the new 1-hour
SO2 NAAQS. The U.S. EPA expects to designate areas by June 2012.

and the State of California revised their PM standards several years ago to apply only to these fine
particles. PM2.5 poses an increased health risk because the particles can deposit deep in the lungs and
contain substances that are particularly harmful to human health. Motor vehicles are currently
responsible for about half of particulates in the SFBAAB. Wood burning in fireplaces and stoves is
another large source of fine particulates (BAAQMD, 2011).
Table 3.6-1 shows that exceedances of the state PM10 standard have routinely occurred in San Francisco.
The state 24-hour PM10 standard of 50 micrograms per cubic meter was exceeded on up to 70 days per
year between 2006 and 2011 (CARB, 2012a). The state 24-hour PM2.5 standard was exceeded on up to
54 days per year between 2006 and 2011 (CARB, 2012a).
As indicated in Table 3.6-3, the SFBAAB is classified as a nonattainment area for the state and federal
PM10 and PM2.5 standards.
Nitrogen Dioxide
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a reddish-brown gas that is a by-product of combustion processes.
Automobiles and industrial operations are the main sources of NO2. Aside from its contribution to ozone
formation, NO2 can increase the risk of acute and chronic respiratory disease and reduce visibility. NO2
may be visible as a coloring component of a brown cloud on high pollution days, especially in
conjunction with high ozone levels (BAAQMD, 2011).
Table 3.6-1 shows that the current standards for NO2 are being met in the San Francisco area. In 2010,
the U.S. EPA implemented a new 1-hour NO2 standard presented in Table 3.6-2. The California Air
Resources Board (CARB) is recommending that the SFBAAB be designated as an attainment area for the
new NO2 standard (BAAQMD, 2011).
Sulfur Dioxide
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a colorless acid gas with a pungent odor. It has potential to damage materials, and
it can have health effects at high concentrations. It is produced by the combustion of sulfur-containing
fuels, such as oil, coal, and diesel. SO2 can irritate lung tissue and increase the risk of acute and chronic
respiratory disease (BAAQMD, 2011).
Table 3.6-3 shows that the state standard for SO2 is being met at the San Francisco monitoring station.
Lead
Lead is a metal found naturally in the environment as well as in manufactured products. The major
sources of lead emissions have historically been mobile and industrial sources. As a result of the phaseout of leaded gasoline, metal processing is currently the primary source of lead emissions. The highest
levels of lead in air are generally found near lead smelters. Other stationary sources are waste
incinerators, utilities, and lead-acid battery manufacturers.
Twenty years ago, mobile sources were the main contributor to ambient lead concentrations in the air. In
the early 1970s, the U.S. EPA set national regulations to gradually reduce the lead content in gasoline. In
1975, unleaded gasoline was introduced for motor vehicles equipped with catalytic converters. The
U.S. EPA banned the use of leaded gasoline in highway vehicles in December 1995. As a result of the
U.S. EPA‘s regulatory efforts to remove lead from gasoline, emissions of lead from the transportation
sector and levels of lead in the air decreased dramatically (BAAQMD, 2011).

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Toxic Air Contaminants
In addition to the criteria air pollutants listed above, another group of pollutants, commonly referred to as
TACs or hazardous air pollutants, can result in health effects that can be quite severe. Many TACs are
confirmed or suspected carcinogens, or are known or suspected to cause birth defects or neurological
damage. Secondly, many TACs can be toxic at very low concentrations. For some chemicals, such as
carcinogens, there are no thresholds below which exposure can be considered risk-free.
Industrial facilities and mobile sources are significant sources of TACs. The electronics industry,
including semiconductor manufacturing, has the potential to contaminate both air and water due to the
highly toxic chlorinated solvents commonly used in semiconductor production processes. Sources of
TACs go beyond industry. Various common urban facilities also produce TAC emissions, such as
gasoline stations (benzene), hospitals (ethylene oxide), and dry cleaners (perchloroethylene). Automobile
exhaust also contains TACs such as benzene and 1,3-butadiene. Most recently, diesel particulate matter
(DPM) was identified as a TAC by CARB. DPM differs from other TACs in that it is not a single
substance but rather a complex mixture of hundreds of substances. BAAQMD research indicates that
mobile-source emissions of DPM, benzene, and 1,3-butadiene represent a substantial portion of the
ambient background risk from TACs in the SFBAAB.
Ambient standards have not been developed for TACs. Instead, the BAAQMD uses a risk-based
approach to regulate TACs. In addition to monitoring criteria pollutants, both the BAAQMD and CARB
operate TAC monitoring networks in the SFBAAB. BAAQMD monitors TACs that are typically found
in the highest concentrations in ambient air and therefore represent high risks to human health. The
BAAQMD ambient TAC monitoring station nearest to the project area is the station at 16th and Arkansas
streets in San Francisco (BAAQMD, 2011).
Sensitive Receptors
Sensitive receptors refer to those segments of the population most susceptible to poor air quality:
children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing serious health problems affected by air quality.
Examples of receptors include residences, schools and school yards, parks and play grounds, daycare
centers, nursing homes, and medical facilities. Consistent with BAAQMD guidelines, the health risk
assessment for the project considered the closest sensitive receptors (within 1,000 feet of the project
construction area), as shown on Figure 3.6-1 (BAAQMD, 2011). For the purposes of this analysis, the
closest residential receptor was considered the closest edge of a residentially zoned property. The closest
such property is approximately 300 feet to the northwest of the project area, as shown on Figure 3.6-1;
however, it should be noted that this portion of the residentially zoned property does not contain any
residential structures, and the distance to the nearest residences is 700 feet from the project area. In
addition, commercial areas with outdoor seating and open spaces used for recreation in the vicinity of the
project area were considered in the health risk analysis; those areas are located immediately adjacent to
the project construction zone.
Global Climate Change Setting
This section describes the causes and consequences of global climate change.
Causes of Climate Change
Global climate change is caused by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) released into
the atmosphere through combustion of fossil fuels, and other GHG-producing activities such as
deforestation and land use change.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

GHGs play a critical role in the Earth’s radiation budget by trapping infrared radiation emitted from the
Earth’s surface, which could have otherwise escaped to space. The “greenhouse effect” keeps the Earth’s
atmosphere near the surface warmer than it would be otherwise, and allows for successful habitation by
humans and other forms of life.
Prominent GHGs contributing to this process include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide
(N2O), and fluorocarbons. Emissions of CO2 and N2O are byproducts of fossil fuel combustion, among
other sources. CH4, a highly potent GHG, results from off gassing associated with agricultural practices
and landfills. Fluorocarbons are commonly used in refrigeration systems.
Global warming potential (GWP) is a measure of the estimated contribution to global warming of a given
mass of GHG. It is a relative scale that compares the gas in question to that of the same mass of CO2
(whose GWP is by definition 1). Using each pollutant’s GWP, emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O can be
converted into CO2 equivalents (CO2e) (U.S. EPA, 2012).
Effects of Climate Change
The combustion of fossil fuels releases carbon that has been stored underground into the active carbon
cycle, thus increasing concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere. Emissions of GHGs in excess of
natural ambient concentrations are theorized to be responsible for the enhancement of the greenhouse
effect and contribute to what is termed “global warming,” a trend of unnatural warming of the Earth’s
natural climate. Increases in these gases lead to more absorption of radiation and warm the lower
atmosphere further, thereby increasing evaporation rates and temperatures near the surface. Climate
change is a global problem, and GHGs are global pollutants, unlike criteria pollutants (such as ozone, CO,
and PM) and TACs, which are pollutants of regional and local concern.
Climate change could affect California’s natural environment in the following ways (CEC, 2005):


Rising sea levels along the California coastline, particularly in San Francisco and the Sacramento-San
Joaquin River Delta, due to ocean expansion;



Extreme heat conditions, such as heat waves and very high temperatures, which could last longer and
become more frequent;



An increase in heat-related human deaths and infectious diseases, and a higher risk of respiratory
problems caused by deteriorating air quality;



Reduced snow pack and stream flow in the Sierra Nevada mountains, affecting winter recreation and
water supplies;



Potential increase in the severity of winter storms, affecting peak stream flows and flooding;



Changes in growing season conditions that could affect California agriculture, causing variations in
crop quality and yield; and



Changes in distribution of plant and wildlife species due to changes in temperature, competition of
colonizing species, changes in hydrologic cycles, changes in sea levels, and other climate-related
effects.

These changes in California’s climate and ecosystems could occur at a time when California’s population
is expected to increase from approximately 37 million in 2010 to 51 million by the year 2050 (California
Department of Finance, 2012).

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Transportation generates 41 percent of California’s GHG emissions, followed by the industrial sector
(23 percent), electricity generation (20 percent), agriculture and forestry (8 percent), and other sources
(8 percent). Sinks of CO2 include uptake by vegetation and dissolution into the ocean. In 2004,
California generated 524 million metric tons of GHG measured as CO2e emissions (CARB, 2011).
Regulatory Setting
Federal
Federal Clean Air Act
At the federal level, the U.S. EPA has been charged with implementing national air quality programs.
U.S. EPA’s air quality mandates are drawn primarily from the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA).
The FCAA required the U.S. EPA to establish primary and secondary National Ambient Air Quality
Standards (NAAQS), which are shown in Table 3.6-2. The FCAA also required each state to prepare an
air quality control plan, referred to as a State Implementation Plan (SIP). The Federal Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 added requirements for states with nonattainment areas to revise their SIPs to
incorporate additional control measures to reduce air pollution. The SIP is periodically modified to
reflect the latest emissions inventories, planning documents, and rules and regulations of the air basins, as
reported by their jurisdictional agencies. U.S. EPA has responsibility to review all state SIPs for
conformity with the mandates of the FCAA and to determine whether implementation will achieve air
quality goals (BAAQMD, 2011).
Transportation Conformity. In nonattainment or maintenance areas, road and transit projects are
subject to transportation conformity. Transportation conformity applies to a project’s operational
emissions, but does not apply to construction emissions. Projects subject to transportation conformity
must demonstrate both regional and local conformity. A project would conform regionally if the project
has been included in a conforming long-range and short-range transportation plan—the Regional
Transportation Plan and the Regional Transportation Improvement Program (TIP). These plans are
prepared by the local metropolitan planning organization; in the project area, this is the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission (MTC). The MTC must show that emissions generated by the Regional
Transportation Plan and TIP would not exceed the transportation-related air emissions that have been
included in the applicable SIP. Transportation or transit projects that would cause emissions to exceed
the levels allowed in the SIP cannot be included in the conforming plan, and cannot be built (Caltrans,
2012). The proposed project is included in both the Regional Transportation Plan and the Regional TIP,
both of which have been found to be conforming by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
(FHWA, 2010).
Local conformity is evaluated by performing a microscale or “hot-spot” analysis for conformity if the
project’s air basin is in nonattainment for CO, PM2.5, and/or PM10. Emission reduction measures may be
required to ensure that the project would not cause or contribute to new violations of an existing federal
ambient air quality standard. FHWA and U.S. EPA released a national guidance memo on March 29,
2006, for performance of qualitative PM2.5 and PM10 hot spot analyses (Caltrans, 2012).
Supreme Court Ruling on California Clean Air Act Waiver
On April 2, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that CO2 is an air pollutant as defined under the FCAA,
and that the U.S. EPA has the authority to regulate emissions of GHGs. However, there are no federal
regulations or policies regarding GHG emissions directly applicable to the proposed project. In June
2009, the U.S. EPA granted California a waiver under the FCAA, allowing the state to impose its own,
stricter GHG regulations for vehicles beginning in 2009.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

State Regulations
California Clean Air Act
CARB is the agency responsible for coordination and oversight of state and local air pollution control
programs in California, and for implementing the California Clean Air Act (CCAA). The CCAA requires
that all air districts in the state endeavor to achieve and maintain the California Ambient Air Quality
Standards (CAAQS) by the earliest practical date. The act specifies that districts should focus particular
attention on reducing the emissions from transportation and areawide emission sources, and provides
districts with the authority to regulate indirect sources.
CARB is primarily responsible for developing and implementing air pollution control plans to achieve
and maintain the NAAQS. CARB is primarily responsible for statewide pollution sources, and produces
a major part of the SIP. Local air districts are still relied on to provide additional strategies for sources
under their jurisdiction. CARB combines these data and submits the completed SIP to the U.S. EPA.
Other CARB duties include monitoring air quality (in conjunction with air monitoring networks
maintained by air pollution control and air quality management districts), establishing CAAQS (which in
many cases are more stringent than the NAAQS), determining and updating area designations and maps,
and setting emissions standards for new mobile sources, consumer products, small utility engines, and
off-road vehicles (BAAQMD, 2011).
Executive Order S-3-05
Executive Order S-3-05 sets forth a series of target dates by which statewide GHG emissions would be
progressively reduced: by 2010, reduce emissions to 2000 levels; by 2020, reduce emission to 1990
levels; and by 2050, reduce GHG emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels.
Assembly Bill 32 and the California Climate Change Scoping Plan
The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and Assembly Bill (AB) 32 establish a cap on
statewide GHG emissions and set forth the regulatory framework to achieve the corresponding reduction
in statewide emission levels. Under AB 32, GHG are defined as CO2, CH4, N2O, hydrofluorocarbons,
perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
Pursuant to AB 32, CARB adopted a Scoping Plan in 2008, outlining measures to meet the 2020 GHG
reduction limits (CARB, 2008). To meet these goals, California must reduce its GHG emissions by
30 percent below projected 2020 business-as-usual emission levels, or about 15 percent from today’s
levels. The Scoping Plan estimates a reduction of 174 million metric tons of CO2e from the
transportation, energy, agriculture, forestry, and high GWP sections.
AB 32 also anticipates that local government actions will result in reduced GHG emissions. CARB has
identified a GHG reduction target of 15 percent from 2008 levels for local governments themselves, and
notes that successful implementation of the plan relies on local governments’ land use planning and urban
growth decisions, because those governments have primary authority to plan, zone, approve, and permit
land development to accommodate population growth and the changing needs of their jurisdictions
(CARB, 2008).
Executive Order S-1-07
Executive Order S-1-07 established a goal of reducing the carbon intensity of transportation fuels sold in
California by 10 percent by 2020. CARB determined that a Low Carbon Fuel Standard could be adopted

as a discrete, early-action measure to meet the mandates in AB 32. CARB adopted the Low Carbon Fuel
Standard on April 23, 2009.
Senate Bill 97
Senate Bill 97 acknowledges that climate change is an important environmental issue that requires
analysis under CEQA. The bill directed the California Office of Planning and Research to prepare and
develop guidelines for the feasible mitigation of GHG emissions or the effects of GHG emissions, and
transmit those guidelines to the California Natural Resources Agency by July 1, 2009. The California
Natural Resources Agency certified those CEQA guidelines on December 30, 2009, and they became
effective March 18, 2010 (CNRA, 2009).
Section 15064.4 of the CEQA guidelines describes the steps needed to evaluate whether a project’s GHG
emissions are significant. If a project’s GHG emissions are deemed significant, then mitigation measures
must be implemented. Section 15126.4(c) of CEQA guidelines lists types of GHG mitigation measures.
They may include:
1. Measures in an existing plan or mitigation program for the reduction of emissions that are required as
part of the lead agency’s decision;
2. Reductions in emissions resulting from a project through implementation of project features, project
design, or other measures, such as those described in Appendix F (Energy Conservation);
3. Offsite measures, including offsets that are not otherwise required, to mitigate a project’s emissions;
and/or
4. Measures that sequester greenhouse gases.
Local Regulations
Bay Area Air Quality Management District Air Quality Regulations
The BAAQMD manages air quality conditions in the SFBAAB through a comprehensive program of
planning, regulation, enforcement, technical innovation, and promotion of the understanding of air quality
issues. The clean air strategy of the BAAQMD includes preparing plans for the attainment of ambient air
quality standards, adopting and enforcing rules and regulations concerning sources of air pollution, and
issuing permits for stationary sources of air pollution. The BAAQMD also inspects stationary sources of
air pollution and responds to citizen complaints; monitors ambient air quality and meteorological
conditions; and implements programs and regulations required by the FCAA, FCAA amendments, and
the CCAA (BAAQMD, 2011).
As stated above, the BAAQMD prepares plans to attain ambient air quality standards in the SFBAAB.
The BAAQMD prepares ozone attainment plans for the national ozone standard, and clean air plans for
the California standard in coordination with both the MTC and the Association of Bay Area
Governments.
2010 Clean Air Plan. The BAAQMD prepared the 2010 Clean Air Plan to address nonattainment of the
national 1-hour ozone standard in the SFBAAB. The purpose of the 2010 Clean Air Plan is to:
1. Update the Bay Area 2005 Ozone Strategy in accordance with the requirements of the CCAA to
implement “all feasible measures” to reduce ozone;
2. Consider the impacts of ozone control measures on PM, air toxics, and GHGs in a single, integrated
plan;
3. Review progress in improving air quality in recent years;

4. Establish emission control measures to be adopted or implemented in the period from 2009 to 2012.
Similarly, the BAAQMD prepared the 2010 Clean Air Plan to address nonattainment of the CAAQS.
The SFBAAB is classified as a serious nonattainment area for ozone (Table 3.6-3). The “serious”
classification triggers various plan submittal requirements and transportation performance standards. One
such requirement is that BAAQMD update its Clean Air Plan every 3 years to reflect progress in meeting
the air quality standards and to incorporate new information regarding the feasibility of control measures
and new emission inventory data. The Bay Area’s record of progress in implementing previous measures
must also be reviewed. On September 15, 2010, BAAQMD adopted the most recent revision to the Clean
Air Plan—the 2010 Clean Air Plan. The 2010 Clean Air Plan includes several measures designed to
reduce emissions associated with transportation and transit projects. These include the following
measures that could be applied to the proposed project:





Mobile Source Measure A-3 – Green Fleets;
Transportation Control Measure B-2 – Transit Efficiency and Use Strategies;
Transportation Control Measure E-3 – Implement Transportation Pricing Reform; and
Further Study Measure FSM-17 – Ferry System Expansion.

CEQA Guidelines. The BAAQMD has developed guidelines to assist lead agencies within its
jurisdiction in implementing CEQA. The BAAQMD replaced its former guidelines (December 1999) by
issuing the CEQA Air Quality Guidelines, including Air Quality CEQA Thresholds of Significance, in
June 2010; and updated those new guidelines in May 2011 with new risk and hazard thresholds for
sensitive receptors (BAAQMD, 2011). The guidelines include new thresholds of significance to assist
lead agencies in determining when potential air quality impacts would be considered significant under
CEQA. These guidelines include recommendations for analytical methodologies to determine air quality
impacts and identify mitigation measures that can be used to avoid or reduce air quality impacts.
BAAQMD’s guidelines include procedures for evaluating whether a project’s construction and
operational criteria pollutant emissions would result in a significant air quality impact, along with
mitigation to reduce or eliminate any significant air impacts. BAAQMD’s guidelines also include
procedures for evaluating TAC impacts resulting from project construction and operation. These
procedures consist of a step-by-step approach for determining whether a project’s TAC emissions would
result in significant acute, chronic, or carcinogenic health risks.
On March 5, 2012, the BAAQMD’s Air Quality CEQA Thresholds of Significance were challenged by an
order issued in California Building Industry Association v. BAAQMD, Alameda Superior Court Case
No. RGI0548693. The order requires the BAAQMD thresholds to be subject to further environmental
review. The claims made in the case concerned the CEQA impacts of adopting the thresholds (i.e., how
the thresholds would affect land use development patterns); and petitioners argued that the thresholds for
Health Risk Assessments encompassed issues not addressed by CEQA. However, as discussed in more
detail below, in Section 3.6.3, Impact Evaluation, the BAAQMD’s significance thresholds and
recommended analysis methodologies were used in this analysis.
Bay Area Air Quality Management District Climate Change Regulations
BAAQMD has established a climate protection program to reduce pollutants that contribute to global
climate change and affect air quality in the SFBAAB. The climate protection program includes measures
that promote energy efficiency, reduce vehicle miles traveled, and develop alternative sources of energy,
all of which reduce GHG emissions.
BAAQMD also seeks to support current climate protection programs in the region and to stimulate
additional efforts through public education and outreach, technical assistance to local governments and
other interested parties, and promotion of collaborative efforts among stakeholders.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

In June 2010, the BAAQMD adopted GHG thresholds (BAAQMD, 2011). The BAAQMD recommends
using any of the following three CEQA significance thresholds for individual projects: 1,100 metric tons CO2e
per year, 4.6 metric tons of CO2e per number of residents plus employees, or compliance with a qualified
climate action plan (CAP). If a project’s operational GHG emissions are consistent with any one of these three
significance thresholds, the project’s operational GHG emissions would be considered less than significant.
The BAAQMD has not adopted GHG significance thresholds for construction emissions (BAAQMD, 2011).
San Francisco General Plan Air Quality Element
The San Francisco General Plan includes the 1997 Air Quality Element. The objectives specified by the City
and County of San Francisco (CCSF) include the following objectives that relate to the proposed project:
Objective 1: Adhere to state and federal air quality standards and regional programs.
Objective 2: Reduce mobile sources of air pollution through implementation of the Transportation
Element of the General Plan
Objective 3: Decrease the air quality impacts of development by coordination of land use and
transportation decisions.
Objective 4: Minimize particulate matter emissions from road and construction sites.
Objective 5:
reductions.

Link the positive effects of energy conservation and waste management to emission

San Francisco Transit First Policy
In 1973, CCSF instituted the Transit First Policy to the City Charter, with the goal of reducing San
Francisco’s reliance on freeways and meeting transportation needs by emphasizing mass transportation
(CCSF, 2011c). The Transit First Policy gives priority to public transit investments, adopts street
capacity and parking policies to discourage increased automobile traffic, and encourages the use of
transit, bicycling, and walking instead of single-occupant vehicles.
San Francisco Planning Code
The San Francisco Planning Code includes smart growth policies such as electric vehicle refueling
stations in city parking garages, bicycle storage facilities for commercial and office buildings, and zoning
that is supportive of high-density mixed-use infill development. There is a communitywide focus on
ensuring that San Francisco’s neighborhoods are “livable,” reflected in the San Francisco Better Streets
Plan, which provide streetscape policies throughout the city; the Transit Effectiveness Project, which aims
to improve transit service; and the San Francisco Bicycle Plan. All of these plans and projects are
intended to promote alternative transportation policies for residents and visitors (CCSF, 2011b).
Regional Transportation Plan
In 2009, the MTC adopted the Transportation 2035 Plan for the San Francisco Bay Area, which specifies how
anticipated federal, state, and local transportation funds will be spent in the nine-county Bay Area until 2035.
The plan’s vision is to support a prosperous and globally competitive Bay Area economy; provide for a healthy
and safe environment; and promote equitable mobility opportunities for all residents. Among other initiatives,
the plan launches a Transportation Climate Action Campaign to reduce transportation-related GHG emissions
(MTC, 2012). Projects identified in the Transportation 2035 Plan only include proposed transportation
projects that are consistent with (or conform to) the approved SIP, and hence the requirements of the FCAA.
In 2010, an administrative modification to the plan was approved to make minor changes to project costs,
initiation dates, or funding sources (MTC, 2010b).

The federally required TIP is a comprehensive listing of surface transportation capital projects for the
nine-county San Francisco Bay Area that receive federal funds, are subject to a federally required action,
or are regionally significant. The MTC prepares and adopts the TIP at least once every 4 years. Projects
identified in the TIP only include proposed transportation projects that are consistent with (or conform to) the
approved SIP, and hence the requirements of the FCAA.
The FHWA and the Federal Transit Administration approved the 2011 TIP and 2035 Transportation Plan
on December 14, 2010 (FHWA, 2010).
Local GHG Reduction Strategy
The San Francisco Department of the Environment and the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission
prepared the Climate Action Plan for San Francisco Local Actions to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions
(September 2004), which was designed to meet standards established by the BAAQMD. The CAP
provides background climate change information; presents estimates of San Francisco’s baseline GHG
emissions inventory and reduction target; describes recommended emissions reduction actions in key
target sectors; and presents next steps required during 2005-2007 to implement the CAP (CCSF, 2004).
On October 28, 2010, BAAQMD wrote a letter to CCSF that approved the CAP as “qualified”
(Roggenkamp, 2010). Consequently, projects found to be consistent with CCSF’s qualified CAP do not
need to take any further actions with regard to climate change or GHG emissions.
CCSF’s Strategies to Address Greenhouse Gas Emissions (2010) presents CCSF’s assessment of policies,
programs, and ordinances that collectively represent San Francisco’s qualified GHG reduction in
compliance with the BAAQMD’s CEQA Air Quality Guidelines and thresholds of significance. The
Strategies to Address Greenhouse Gas Emissions (2010) identifies a number of actions that CCSF has
taken in support of the San Francisco CAP (2004), and mandatory requirements and incentives that have
measurably reduced GHG emissions. These include, but are not limited to, increases in the energy
efficiency of new and existing buildings, installation of solar panels on building roofs, implementation of
a green building strategy, adoption of a zero waste strategy, a construction and demolition debris recovery
ordinance, a solar energy generation subsidy, incorporation of alternative fuel vehicles in CCSF’s
transportation fleet (including buses and taxis), and a mandatory composting ordinance. The strategy also
identifies 42 specific regulations for new development that would reduce a project’s GHG emissions.
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Ordinance
In 2008, CCSF amended the San Francisco Environment Code to establish GHG emission reduction
targets and departmental action plans; and to authorize the San Francisco Department of the Environment
to coordinate efforts to meet these targets, and to make environmental findings. The ordinance
establishes the following GHG emission reduction limits for San Francisco and the target dates by which
they must be achieved:



Determine 1990 city GHG emissions, the baseline level with reference to which target reductions are
set; and
Reduce GHG emissions by 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2017, 40 percent below 1990 levels by
2025, and 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.

CCSF departments must prepare a CAP that assesses GHG emissions associated with their activities, and
recommends emission reductions. The Port of San Francisco (Port) must develop a boiler maintenance
and replacement program for all Port property, implement the city’s zero waste programs and green
purchasing requirements, and implement the Port of San Francisco Building Code to further reduce the
Port’s GHG emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 (CCSF, 2011c).

Port of San Francisco Climate Action Plan
The Port CAP for 2009 documents the Port’s carbon footprint and identifies opportunities to reduce the
impacts from activities at the Port that might contribute to climate change. The Port’s property is a
complex mix of piers, structures, and open land with more than 25 million square feet and more than 500
tenants. Both Port and tenant operations contribute to GHG emissions (CCSF, 2011c).
The Port is engaged in several GHG reduction and sustainability measures that contribute to meeting
climate change goals, including zero waste programs, employee commuter benefit programs, green
purchasing, and sustainability planning. Additionally, the Port has been participating in a regional effort
to promote sustainable marine industrial development along the West Coast (CCSF, 2011c).
Regulation of Diesel Backup Generators
In 2002, CCSF passed the Diesel Backup Generator Ordinance, which requires, per Article 30 in the
CCSF’s Health Code, that owners and/or operators of diesel generators submit an application to the
Department of Public Health, and obtain a certificate of registration. The registration program requires
that new diesel backup generators be equipped with emission control technologies; limits the operation of
diesel backup generators for nonemergency purposes; requires periodic maintenance and record keeping;
and provides an enforcement mechanism for violations of the ordinance (CCSF, 2010b; CCSF, 2002).
3.6.3

Impact Evaluation

The analysis considered whether the project would:


Conflict with or obstruct implementation of the applicable air quality plan;



Conflict with U.S. EPA transportation conformity regulations under the FCAA;



Violate any air quality standard or contribute substantially to an existing or projected air quality
violation;



Result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant for which the project
region is in nonattainment under an applicable federal or state ambient air quality standard (including
releasing emissions that exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone precursors);



Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations; or



Create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people.

In addition, a project would have a GHG or global climate change impact if it:


Generates GHG emissions, either directly or indirectly, that may have a significant impact on the
environment; or



Conflicts with an agency’s applicable plan, policy, or regulation designed to reduce GHG emissions.

The project is located in a nonattainment area for PM2.5 and must demonstrate transportation conformity
by: a) showing that the project is listed in and consistent with the Transportation 2035 Plan for the San
Francisco Bay Area; and b) performing a microscale or “hot-spot” analysis for conformity. The proposed
project is also within a nonattainment area for federal PM2.5 standards. Therefore, according to 40 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 93, a PM2.5 hotspot analysis is required for conformity purposes.
However, the U.S. EPA only requires hotspot analyses for projects that are listed in Section 93.123(b)(1)
as a project of air quality concern. Five project categories qualify as projects of air quality concern:

The BAAQMD’s Air Quality CEQA Thresholds of Significance provide reference thresholds for
considering whether a project would have an air quality impact, and recommend procedures for evaluating
potential air quality impacts. The issues identified in the BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines court
case are not considered relevant to the scientific soundness of the BAAQMD’s analysis of the level at which
a pollutant would potentially significantly affect air quality or human health. Therefore, even though the
guidelines have been suspended by the BAAQMD until the issues identified in the case are resolved, the
analysis in this Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR) was conducted in
accordance with the thresholds and methods described in the BAAQMD CEQA Air Quality Guidelines.
It is the BAAQMD’s policy that the adopted new risk and hazards thresholds apply to projects for which a
Notice of Preparation is published, or environmental analysis begins, on or after the effective date of May 1,
2011 (BAAQMD, 2011). Even though the Notice of Preparation for this project was published in April 2011,
a screening-level risk assessment, consistent with the new risk and hazards thresholds, was performed for the
proposed project. The screening-level risk assessment was performed, using the U.S. EPA’s Screen 3 model,
to evaluate the potential risk to existing sensitive receptors in the vicinity of the proposed project’s construction
and operation areas. Further details regarding the methodology of this analysis are provided in Appendix B.
The BAAQMD has also adopted CEQA thresholds for GHGs. The BAAQMD considers a project’s
operations to be a less-than-significant GHG impact if it meets any one of these criteria:




Complies with a qualified GHG Reduction Strategy;
Has operational emissions of less than 1,100 metric tons CO2e units per year; or
Has emissions of less than 4.6 metric tons per service population per year (where service population
refers to the total number of residents and employees for the project).

Because the project would be located within the geographic boundaries of the CCSF, and because CCSF
has a BAAQMD-approved GHG Reduction Strategy, the project has been evaluated for compliance with
the CAP (2004), and CCSF’s Strategies to Address Greenhouse Gas Emissions (CCSF, 2010b). The
proposed project has also been evaluated for consistency with the Port’s CAP (Port, 2011b).
Direct and Indirect Impacts
As described in Section 3.1, the impacts associated with the Water Emergency Transportation Authority’s
(WETA’s) planned expansion of water transit routes and services were analyzed in the Program EIR for the
Implementation and Operations Plan (WETA, 2003a), and therefore are not assessed in this EIS/EIR. This
EIS/EIR analyzes—at a project level—the site-specific impacts of improvements to the Downtown San

Francisco Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal), and impacts associated with the increase in vessels while they
use and/or are docked at the Ferry Terminal. The Program EIR analyzed the air quality impacts associated
with the regional and cumulative increase in water transit by comparing regional emissions of all sources
(i.e., vehicles, buses, and water transit vessels) that would result from the proposed water transit system
expansion with those that would result from the no project alternative (refer to Section 3.6 of the Program
EIR). The Program EIR air quality analysis indicated that water transit system expansion project would
result in a reduction in air emissions for most potential pollutants (NOX, PM10, PM2.5, CO, and combined
ozone precursors [ROG and NOX]). The Program EIR concluded that the expansion of water transit service
could result in a regional increase in ROG. Refer to the Program EIR for additional information.
The Program EIR also suggested that the proposed expansion of the water transit system could result in
site-specific air quality impacts related to NO2 and PM at the Ferry Terminal. This section provides an
additional site-specific analysis of potential impacts at the Ferry Terminal.

Impact 3.6-1: Conflict with or Obstruct BAAQMD Air Quality Plan Implementation, Exceed
Applicable Air Quality Standards, or Contribute Substantially to an Air Quality Violation
No Action Alternative
Although the No Action Alternative would not result in any facility improvements at the Ferry Terminal,
increases in vessel traffic (and associated increases in vessel idling at Gates B and E) could occur under the
No Action Alternative. As described in Section 2.2, a limited increase in vessel traffic would occur, which
could be accommodated by the existing Gates B and E. Under the No Action Alternative, WETA vessel
arrivals could increase from 14 (existing) to 20 vessel arrivals during the AM peak period; and from 37
vessel arrivals per weekday to a total of 65 vessel arrivals per weekday. As a result, the No Action
Alternative would indirectly increase vessel-related exhaust emissions of criteria pollutants and precursors
(ROG, NOX, PM10, and PM2.5) compared to existing conditions. The No Action Alternative would not
involve any direct operational activities, and would not generate any direct emissions. The BAAQMD
CEQA Air Quality Guidelines established maximum annual emission thresholds (tons per year) and average
daily emission thresholds (pounds per day [lbs/day]) for the criteria pollutants (ROG, NOX, PM10, and
PM2.5). The total indirect and direct emissions from the No Action Alternative were compared to these
annual and daily thresholds. As shown in Tables 3.6-4 and 3.6-5 (on the following pages), the No Action
Alternative’s operational emissions would not exceed the applicable BAAQMD thresholds.
Action Alternative
The proposed project improvements would allow for vessel traffic to increase at the Ferry Terminal. The
potential sources of exhaust emissions that could be generated from proposed project operation would include
idling of the additional vessels that could be accommodated at the new gates; operation and periodic testing of
an emergency generator; and the equipment used for maintenance dredging every 3 or 4 years. Based on the
existing and new water transit services that would be operated by WETA for the proposed project, vessel
traffic for WETA services is projected to increase, in comparison to the No Action Alternative, from 20 to 57
vessel arrivals per AM peak hour; and from 65 to 181 vessel arrivals per weekday.
For the purposes of this analysis, the following assumptions were made:


Vessel arrivals are assumed to be evenly composed of small vessels (2,198 horsepower) and large
vessels (7,657 horsepower). Vessel types assumed in this analysis were based on vessel information

25 to 30 percent less ROG, NOX, and PM10 than current diesel engines. In addition, add-on control
devices such as selective catalytic reduction and particulate traps would further reduce NOX and PM10
emissions to 10 percent and 5 percent, respectively, of U.S. EPA Tier 2 levels. Specific emission
factors used in the vessel emission analysis are provided in Appendix B.


Operation of one emergency generator (assumed 549 horsepower) was assumed to occur for up to a
maximum of 124 hours annually (2 hours per month for periodic testing, and up to 100 hours of use).



Maintenance dredging emissions were assumed to occur over a 10-day period.



To be conservative, total emission calculations shown in Tables 3.6-4 and 3.6-5 assume that all operationrelated activities of the proposed project would occur in the same year (which could be as early as 2018).

ROG = reactive organic gases

Additional specific assumptions used to calculate the operational emissions from the Action Alternative
are detailed in Appendix B.
As shown in Tables 3.6-4 and 3.6-5, the proposed project would directly and indirectly increase exhaust
emissions of criteria pollutants and precursors (ROG, NOX, PM10, and PM2.5), in comparison to the No
Action Alternative. However, the proposed project’s direct and indirect operational emissions would not
exceed the applicable annual or daily BAAQMD thresholds.
In addition, as identified in Appendix 1 of the 2035 Transportation Plan (MTC, 2009), the proposed
project is included in an approved transportation project (as project 22006). The project is not a new or
expanded highway project that would have a significant number of or increase in the number of diesel
vehicles (40 CFR Section 93.123[b][1][i]). The proposed project does not affect intersections operating at
a Level of Service D, E, or F with a significant number of diesel vehicles related to the project (40 CFR
Section 93.123[b][1][ii]). The project is not a new bus terminal, rail terminal, or transfer point having a
significant number of diesel vehicles congregating at a single location (40 CFR Section 93.123[b][1][iii],
[iv]). The project is not an expansion of an existing bus or rail terminal, but is an expanded transfer point
(40 CFR Section 93.123[b][1][iv]). The project would be considered an expanded transfer point, and was
analyzed to determine if it could be considered to have a significant number of diesel vehicles
congregating at a single location. During the 2½-hour AM peak period, project diesel-powered water
transit vessel arrivals would increase, in comparison to the No Action Alternative, from 20 to 57.
However, as described in detail in Impact 3.6-2, air quality dispersion modeling was conducted to
estimate how the increase in diesel vessels would affect local air quality. The results of that modeling,
which are included in Table 3.6-6 (on the following page), show that the project’s diesel vessels would
result in less-than-significant health risks and less-than-significant local PM2.5 concentrations. The
proposed project would neither be in nor affect locations, areas, or categories of sites that are identified in
the PM10 or PM2.5 applicable implementation plan or implementation plan submission (as appropriate), as
sites of violation or possible violation. Therefore, the proposed project would be consistent with (or
conform to) the approved SIP, and hence the transportation conformity requirements of the FCAA.

obstruct implementation of the BAAQMD air quality plan, exceed applicable air quality standards, or
contribute substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation for ROG, NOX, PM10, and
PM2.5; therefore, project impacts would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to conflict with or obstruct implementation of the
BAAQMD air quality plan, exceed applicable air quality standards, or contribute substantially to an
existing or projected air quality violation for ROG, NOX, PM10, and PM2.5 would be less than
significant.
Impact 3.6-2: Expose Sensitive Receptors to Substantial Pollutant Concentrations
No Action Alternative
As described above under Impact 3.6-1, the No Action Alternative’s operational emissions would not
exceed the applicable BAAQMD thresholds. The BAAQMD’s daily operational emission thresholds for
criteria pollutants were developed to indicate whether a project’s emissions would have the potential to
expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations. The project’s operational emissions
would be less than BAAQMD’s thresholds, and consequently would not expose sensitive receptors to
substantial pollutant concentrations. As described below for the Action Alternative, the results of a
screening-level health risk assessment indicate that the proposed project’s emissions would also be well
below the health risk thresholds developed by the BAAQMD. The operational emissions for the No
Action Alternative would be even less than those of the Action Alternative, and would also be below the

Consequences, and Mitigation

health risk thresholds developed by the BAAQMD. Therefore, the No Action Alternative would not
expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations.
Action Alternative
As described above under Impact 3.6-1, the proposed project would increase exhaust emissions of criteria
pollutants and precursors (ROG, NOX, PM10, and PM2.5) in comparison to the No Action Alternative.
However, the proposed project’s operational emissions would not exceed the applicable BAAQMD
thresholds (Tables 3.6-4 and 3.6-5).
BAAQMD’s daily operational emission thresholds for criteria pollutants were developed to indicate
whether a project’s emissions would have the potential to expose sensitive receptors to substantial
pollutant concentrations. The project’s operational emissions would be less than BAAQMD’s thresholds,
and consequently would not expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations.
The primary TAC of concern from diesel-powered equipment is diesel particulate matter (DPM), which is
considered to be carcinogenic and poses a chronic health risk. In addition, PM2.5 is also considered a
health risk. DPM emissions include all PM10 exhaust emissions generated by diesel vehicles. A
screening analysis was performed, consistent with the BAAQMD’s guidelines, to determine whether the
project’s operational emissions of DPM and PM2.5 would exceed recommended screening thresholds.
The screening-level analysis methods and thresholds are designed to be substantially conservative. If a
project exceeds screening thresholds, then a more detailed analysis would be required. The screeninglevel risk analysis is described in more detail in Appendix B.
The screening-level risk analysis takes into consideration both the project’s estimated emissions and the
distance to the air quality sensitive receptors from construction and operations activities. The sensitive
receptors nearest to the proposed project are shown on Figure 3.6-1. The nearest residential area is
approximately 700 feet to the northwest. The nearest school is approximately 300 feet to the west. The
nearest commercial uses are located adjacent to and/or within the area where construction and operation
activities would occur. The nearest medical facility is approximately 4,000 feet from the project area.
Table 3.6-6 summarizes the screening-level risk analysis results, by sensitive receptor type. The
operation of the proposed project would result in minor net DPM emissions (less than 0.1 lbs/day), as
shown in Table 3.6-5. The screening-level risk analysis shows chronic or carcinogenic health risks to the
nearest sensitive receptors would be substantially less than the BAAQMD’s thresholds (Table 3.6-6).
In addition, the project’s net increase in PM2.5 at sensitive receptors would also be well below the
BAAQMD’s significance threshold.
NEPA Determination. The project’s potential to expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant
concentrations would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant
concentrations would be less than significant.
Impact 3.6-3: Create Objectionable Odors During Operation
No Action Alternative
The No Action Alternative would result in an increase in exhaust emissions from the idling of dieselpowered vessels. This could create objectionable odors in the immediate vicinity of the vessels. Vessels
associated with the No Action Alternative do not fall into any of the known categories of concern for
objectionable odors identified by the BAAQMD. Consequently, there is no BAAQMD-recommended

Consequences, and Mitigation

screening distance that would be applicable for the project. In addition, the vessels would use ultra-low
sulfur diesel (ULSD), as required in California. This would minimize odors that typically result from
sulfur dioxide emissions. Therefore, this alternative would not generate adverse odors.
Action Alternative
The proposed project would result in an increase in exhaust emissions from the idling of diesel-powered
vessels. In addition, operation of an emergency generator could contribute to localized exhaust emission–
related odors. However, the vessels and the generator would use ULSD, as required in California, which
would minimize odors that typically result from sulfur dioxide emissions. Therefore, the project would
not generate adverse odors.
NEPA Determination. The project’s potential to create odors during construction that would be
objectionable and affect a substantial number of people would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to create odors during operation that would be
objectionable and affect a substantial number of people would be less than significant.
Construction Impacts
The No Action Alternative would not result in any physical changes to the Ferry Terminal, and no
construction activities would be required. Therefore, there would be no construction impacts on air
quality.
Impact 3.6-4: Construction-Related Emissions of ROG, NOX, PM10, and PM2.5 that Could
Exceed Applicable Air Quality Standards
Construction activities would generate short-term emissions of criteria pollutants and ozone precursors
(ROG, NOX, PM10, and PM2.5). Equipment exhaust emissions would be generated by off-road equipment;
on-road worker vehicles and concrete trucks; and marine vessels. Construction activities would not
generate fugitive dust emissions (PM10 or PM2.5), because the construction activities would occur over
water and would not involve any ground-disturbing activities.
Details of the quantities and types of construction equipment, on-road vehicles, and marine vessels
required for each project activity (described in Chapter 2.0, Alternatives) are provided in Appendix B.
The resulting criteria pollutant emissions from these equipment/vehicles/vessels are provided in
Appendix B and summarized in Table 3.6-7 (on the following page). For the purposes of this analysis,
the estimate of unmitigated project emissions assumes that construction activities in the North Basin and
South Basin would overlap, resulting in a 24-month construction period. In addition, the estimate of
unmitigated emissions assumes that each workday would result in 8 hours of active construction-related
unmitigated emissions. Appendix B details additional assumptions used in this analysis.
As previously described, the BAAQMD’s standards have been applied to the project. As shown in
Table 3.6-7, the proposed project’s unmitigated ROG, PM10, and PM2.5 construction-related emissions
would not exceed the BAAQMD’s average daily emission standards for construction activities
(Table 3.6-7). However, as shown in Table 3.6-7, the project’s unmitigated construction-related NOX
emissions could exceed the BAAQMD standards during the 2-year construction period.
Implementation of Mitigation Measures AQ-1 and AQ-2 would reduce the project’s construction NOX
emissions by requiring project construction to be phased, and through implementation of a variety of best
management practices. As shown in Table 3.6-7, implementation of these measures would reduce the
project’s construction emission of NOX below the BAAQMD’s thresholds.

Notes:
Mitigated emissions shown above indicate the emissions reduction from implementation of Mitigation Measure AQ-1, and an

Mitigation Measures.
The BAAQMD thresholds are from the BAAQMD’s CEQA Air Quality Guidelines (2011).

Unmitigated average total construction-related emissions from the proposed project were calculated by dividing the total
combined North Basin and South Basin 2014 and 2015 estimated emissions (tons per year) by a 24-month, 30-day per month
construction period, and applying a conversion factor to obtain an average daily emission in pounds per day. These
unmitigated total emissions were assumed to: 1) occur during an overlapping 24-month construction period; and 2) be emitted
daily from 8 hours of active construction activities.
BAAQMD = Bay Area Air Quality Management District
CEQA = California Environmental Quality Act
NOX = oxides of nitrogen
PM2.5 = particulate matter equal to or less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter
PM10 = particulate matter equal to or less than 10 micrometers in diameter
ROG = reactive organic gases

NEPA Determination. During construction, the project would not exceed applicable air quality
standards or contribute substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation for ROG, PM10, and
PM2.5. Although project construction emissions of NOX have the potential to be adverse, implementation
of Mitigation Measures AQ-1 and AQ-2 would reduce project emissions; therefore, emissions would not
be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to exceed applicable air quality standards or contribute
substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation during construction would be less than
significant for ROG, PM10, and PM2.5; and less than significant for NOX with Mitigation Measures AQ-1
and AQ-2.
Impact 3.6-5: Expose Sensitive Receptors to Substantial Construction-Related Pollutant
Concentrations
TACs described for Impact 3.6-4, the exhaust emissions from construction activities, could expose
sensitive receptors to an increase in pollutant concentrations. BAAQMD’s daily construction emission
thresholds for criteria pollutants were developed to demonstrate whether a project’s emissions have the
potential to expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations.

In addition to the criteria pollutants, construction activities could expose sensitive receptors to TACs. The
primary TACs of concern for the project would be DPM and PM2.5 generated by diesel-powered construction
equipment. A screening analysis was performed, consistent with the BAAQMD’s guidelines, to
determine whether the project’s construction emissions of DPM and PM2.5 would exceed recommended
screening thresholds. The screening-level risk analysis analyzed the chronic, carcinogenic, and PM2.5 risks at
nearby sensitive receptors from the project’s construction emissions, as shown in Table 3.6-8.
Construction-related chronic and carcinogenic risks of the project’s DPM emissions would not exceed the
BAAQMD’s thresholds, as shown in Table 3.6-8. Furthermore, the potential chronic and carcinogenic risks
shown in Table 3.6-7 would be even lower with implementation of Mitigation Measures AQ-1 and AQ-2,
which would further reduce average daily DPM (i.e., PM10) emissions to 1.3 lbs/day.

Detailed risk estimates and methodology are included in Appendix B.
Risks were estimated for the nearest sensitive receptors to the project area for the above-listed sensitive receptor categories.
The BAAQMD thresholds are from the BAAQMD’s CEQA Air Quality Guidelines (2011).
Mitigated emissions assume implementation of Mitigation Measures AQ-1 and AQ-2. With implementation of Mitigation
Measure AQ-1, mitigated emissions assume no overlap of the two construction periods (38 months of construction under
mitigated conditions versus 24 months for the unmitigated scenario). Mitigated emissions also assume a 45 percent reduction in
PM2.5 below the fleetwide average for offroad and marine emissions. This 45 percent reduction can be achieved using one or
more of the options described in Mitigation Measure AQ-2 (e.g., use of late-model engines, or installation of DPM filters,
retrofitting engines).

As indicated in Table 3.6-8, the project’s construction emissions could result in PM2.5 concentrations that
exceed BAAQMD’s significance thresholds. However, with implementation of Mitigation Measures AQ-1
and AQ-2, the PM2.5 concentrations would be reduced, and would be less than BAAQMD’s significance
threshold.

be adverse; however, with implementation of Mitigation Measures AQ-1 and AQ-2, emissions would be
reduced and therefore would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant
concentrations from construction would be less than significant for DPM, and less than significant for
PM2.5 with Mitigation Measures AQ-1 and AQ-2.
Impact 3.6-6: Create Objectionable Odors During Construction
The proposed project would require the use of marine vessels and various types of construction
equipment (as described in Chapter 2.0, Alternatives), which would produce exhaust emissions and create
potentially objectionable odors in the immediate vicinity of the construction site. However, all dieselfueled equipment and vessels would use ULSD, which would minimize any adverse odors. In addition,
the predominant wind direction in the project area is from the west, which blows emissions away from
sensitive receptors.
NEPA Determination. The project’s potential to create odors during construction that would be
objectionable and affect a substantial number of people would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to create odors during construction that would be
objectionable and affect a substantial number of people would be less than significant.
Cumulative Impacts
Impact 3.6-7: Result in a Cumulatively Considerable Net Increase of Any Criteria
Pollutant for which the Project Region is in Nonattainment
As described in Impacts 3.6-1 and 3.6-4 above, the project would result in increases in some air
emissions; however, these emissions of ROG, NOX, PM10, and PM2.5 would not exceed BAAQMD
thresholds with implementation of Mitigation Measures AQ-1 and AQ-2. The BAAQMD has developed
its thresholds so that individual projects would not create a cumulative air quality issue. Therefore, if a
project’s emissions are below the BAAQMD’s thresholds, the project’s individual emissions would not
be considered cumulatively considerable (BAAQMD, 2011). Because the project’s emissions would not
exceed the BAAQMD thresholds, the project’s incremental increase in emissions would not result in
substantial cumulatively adverse impacts on SFBAAB air quality.
In addition, the proposed project would facilitate implementation of WETA’s Implementation and
Operations Plan (IOP) for expanded water transit service in the Bay Area. The WETA IOP Program EIR
analyzed increased regional water transit service, and found that an expanded water transit system would
result in a net decrease in NOX, CO, and PM10 (WETA, 2003b).
NEPA Determination. The project would not contribute to cumulative adverse impacts from increases
in any criteria pollutant for which the project region is in nonattainment under an applicable federal or
state ambient air quality standard.
CEQA Determination. The project’s contribution to cumulative impacts from increases in any criteria
pollutant for which the project region is in nonattainment under an applicable federal or state ambient air
quality standard would be less than significant.
Impact 3.6-8: Expose Sensitive Receptors to Cumulatively Considerable Substantial
Pollutant Concentrations
As described in Impacts 3.6-2 and 3.6-5, the project would result in increases in some air emissions;
however, the project would not expose sensitive receptors to substantial concentrations of criteria

Consequences, and Mitigation

pollutants because, with the implementation of Mitigation Measures AQ-1 and AQ-2, the project’s
construction and operational emissions would not exceed BAAQMD’s thresholds. Also, the project is
included within the applicable regional transportation plans, and consequently its emissions of ROG,
NOX, PM10, and PM2.5 (pollutants for which the SFBAAB does not meet federal ambient air quality
standards) would not contribute to a cumulative adverse impact. In addition, the project would not cause
localized PM10 or PM2.5 hot spot impacts because it is not considered to be a project of air quality concern.
The project also has the potential to expose sensitive receptors to cumulatively substantial concentrations of
TACs. The primary TACs of concern from the project are DPM and PM2.5. Diesel-powered equipment
would generate DPM and PM2.5 during project construction and operation, although the amounts generated
would be relatively low. A cumulative health risk assessment was conducted using BAAQMDrecommended procedures. Those procedures require that the project’s maximum cancer risk, chronic
hazard value, and PM2.5 concentrations be added to the maximum values for other emission sources located
within 1,000 feet of the project. Table 3.6-9 shows the cumulative health risks. The project would not pose
a cumulative cancer risk because the project’s cancer risk, when added to the risk for other nearby emission
sources, would be less than BAAQMD’s cumulative threshold. Similarly, the total chronic hazard indices
for the project plus other nearby sources would be less than BAAQMD’s cumulative chronic significance
threshold. Finally, the project’s maximum PM2.5 concentration, when added to the maximum concentrations
from other nearby sources, would be less than BAAQMD’s cumulative PM2.5 significance threshold.
Consequently, the project would not cause or contribute to a significant cumulative health risk.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Impact 3.6-9: Create Cumulatively Considerable Objectionable Odors Affecting a
Substantial Number of People
Exhaust emissions from construction and operation of the project could create potentially objectionable
odors in the immediate vicinity of the project site. However, as described in Impacts 3.6-3 and 3.6-6, the
project would not result in substantially adverse odor impacts. The proposed project and the other past,
present, and future reasonably foreseeable projects in the project area would all use ULSD for
construction and operation, as required by California law, substantially reducing the potential for
objectionable odors to be of cumulative concern. There would be no cumulatively adverse impact.
NEPA Determination. The project would not contribute to cumulatively adverse objectionable odors
that affect a substantial number of people.
CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to combine with other projects to create cumulatively
objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people would be less than significant.
Impact 3.6-10: Comply with the BAAQMD GHG Thresholds and Applicable Climate
Action Plans
Project construction would result in temporary increases in GHG emissions related to truck and worker
trips, and from the operation of construction equipment and marine vessels (quantified in Appendix B).
In addition, operation of the project accommodates an increase in water transit vessel traffic idling at the
Ferry Terminal, which would result in GHG emissions; periodic GHG emissions from marine vessels
performing maintenance dredging; and periodic GHG emissions from monthly testing and operation of
the project’s emergency generator (quantified in Appendix B).
The total GHG emissions from the project’s construction activities were estimated to be approximately
14,888 lbs/day (approximately 6.8 metric tons per year) during an overlapping 24-month construction
period. These emissions were reduced to approximately 9,403 lbs/day (approximately 4.3 metric tons per
year) when the construction period was extended to 38 months, as required by implementation of
Mitigation Measure AQ-1. There are no applicable quantitative construction-related GHG thresholds.
However, as discussed further below, the project would comply with a qualified GHG Reduction
Strategy.
The operation-related GHG emissions from the project would be approximately 640 metric tons per year,
or 418 metric tons per year in net emissions. This is consistent with the BAAQMD’s operational
emissions threshold of less than 1,100 metric tons CO2e units per year. In addition, the project would
comply with a qualified GHG Reduction Strategy, as discussed further below.
The project would be consistent with the long-term and short-term actions listed in San Francisco’s CAP,
presented in Table 3.6-10 (on the following page). The project would facilitate implementation of
WETA’s IOP, which would expand and improve regional transit service and connections, short- and longterm goals of San Francisco’s CAP, listed in Table 3.6-10. As demonstrated in the Program EIR for the
IOP, implementation of WETA’s IOP would also result in a reduction in overall vehicle miles traveled in
the region (WETA, 2003a).
As described in Section 2.3.5, Design Considerations, Green Building, the proposed project would
include sustainable construction materials and methods, where possible, and would be designed in
response to state, regional, and local standards for stormwater management and water quality, including
the San Francisco Green Building Ordinance. Implementation of these green building approaches would
ensure that the project is consistent with the applicable CAPs and green building ordinances.

The project would be also consistent with the CAP’s renewable energy provisions, because it is planned as a
zero net energy project, which would be achieved through the use of photovoltaic cells incorporated into the
canopies at Gates A, B, E, F, and G. The use of solar energy as part of the proposed project is consistent
with CCSF’s and the Port’s CAPs, which require all tenants to develop onsite renewable energy.
Because the proposed project is consistent with and supports the implementation of CCSF’s and the
Port’s CAPs, the project would not result in substantial long-term cumulatively adverse effects related to
global climate change.
NEPA Determination. As shown in Table 3.6-10 and as discussed above, the project is consistent with
the applicable long-term and short-term actions included in CCSF’s and the Port’s CAPs. Therefore, the
project would not contribute to cumulative adverse GHG emissions impacts.

Mitigation Measures

Mitigation Measure AQ-1: Construction Phasing
WETA will phase construction activities in such a way that onsite emission-generating construction
activities for the North Basin and South Basin improvements do not overlap.
Mitigation Measure AQ-2: Implement BAAQMD-Recommended Best Management
Practices
The following BAAQMD-recommended best management practices will be implemented to reduce
exhaust emissions:


Minimize the idling time of diesel-powered construction equipment to 2 minutes.



The contractor will demonstrate at various phases of construction (e.g., 25 percent, 50 percent, and
completion) that the off-road equipment (more than 50 horsepower) and marine vessels to be used
during construction (i.e., owned, leased, and subcontractor vehicles) would achieve a project-wide
fleet-average 20 percent NOX reduction, and a 45 percent PM reduction compared to the most recent
CARB fleet average, to the extent feasible. Acceptable options for reducing emissions include the
use of late-model engines, low-emission diesel products, alternative fuels, engine retrofit technology,
after-treatment products, add-on devices such as particulate filters, and/or other options that may
become available. The contractor will document efforts taken to achieve the specified goals, explain
why meeting the goals was not feasible (if applicable), and indicate what emissions reduction and
equipment use goals were achieved.



Require that all construction equipment, diesel trucks, and generators be equipped with Best
Available Control Technology for emission reductions of NOX and PM.



Require that all contractors use equipment that meets CARB’s most recent certification standard for
off-road heavy duty diesel engines.

NOISE AND VIBRATION

3.7.1

Introduction to the Analysis

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

This section assesses potential noise and vibration impacts associated with construction activities and
water transit operations for the proposed project. The project’s construction activities could result in
noise impacts and potential vibration impacts to nearby historic structures in the study area. However,
with the implementation of mitigation measures presented in Section 3.7.4, these impacts would be
minimized and reduced to not adverse and less than significant.
3.7.2

Affected Environment

This section describes the existing noise environment within the proposed project study area, as well as
the applicable regulatory setting for evaluating noise and vibration associated with the construction and
operation of the project. Underwater noise and its potential to affect marine life is considered and
discussed in Section 3.9, Biological Resources.
Background
Noise Fundamentals
Noise is generally defined as loud, unpleasant, unexpected, or undesired sound that is typically associated
with human activity, and that interferes with or disrupts normal activities. Although prolonged exposure to
high noise levels has been demonstrated to cause hearing loss, the principal human response to
environmental noise is annoyance. The response of individuals to similar noise events is diverse and
influenced by the type of noise; the perceived importance of the noise and its appropriateness in the setting;
the time of day and the type of activity during which the noise occurs; and the sensitivity of the individual.
Sound consists of vibrations that travel through a medium, such as air, and are sensed by the human ear.
Sound is generally characterized by several variables, including frequency and amplitude. Frequency
describes the pitch of the sound and is measured in Hertz (Hz), while amplitude describes the sound’s
loudness and is measured in decibels (dB). Decibels are measured using a logarithmic scale. A sound
level of 0 dB is approximately the lower threshold of human hearing and is barely audible under
extremely quiet listening conditions. Normal conversational speech has a sound level of approximately
60 dB. Sound levels above approximately 110 dB begin to be felt inside the human ear as discomfort and
eventually pain at 120 dB and higher levels. The minimum change in the sound level of individual events
that an average person can detect is about 2 to 3 dB. A 4- to 5-dB change is readily perceived.
Sound pressure level, expressed in dB, is calculated by reference to a known standard reference level.
Sound pressure level related to a specific sound source depends not only on the acoustical power of the
source, but also on the distance from the source to the receiver and on the acoustical characteristics of the
space surrounding the source.
Hertz is a measure of how many times each second the crest of a sound pressure wave passes a fixed
point. For example, when a drummer beats a drum, the skin of the drum vibrates a number of times per
second. When the drum skin vibrates 100 times per second it generates a sound pressure wave that is
oscillating at 100 Hz, and this pressure oscillation is perceived by the ear/brain as a tonal pitch of 100 Hz.
Sound frequencies between 20 and 20,000 Hz are within the range of sensitivity of the human ear.
Sounds one hears in the environment consist of a broad band of frequencies differing in sound level. The
method commonly used to quantify environmental sounds consists of a weighting system that reflects that
human hearing is less sensitive at low frequencies and extremely high frequencies than at the mid-range
frequencies. This is called “A-weighting,” and the decibel level measured is called the A-weighted sound

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

pressure level. Therefore, the units used are A-weighted decibels (dBA). Although sound pressure level value
may adequately indicate the level of environmental noise at any instant in time, community noise levels vary
continuously. Most environmental noise includes a mixture of noise from distant sources that creates a
relatively steady background noise in which no particular source is identifiable. A single descriptor called the
equivalent sound level (Leq) may be used to describe sound that is changing in level. Leq is the equivalent
energy-mean sound pressure level in dBA during a specific time interval. It is the “equivalent” constant sound
level that would have to be produced by a given source to equal the acoustic energy contained in the
fluctuating sound level measured. In addition to the Leq, it is often desirable to know the acoustic range of the
noise source being measured. The maximum Leq (Lmax) and minimum Leq (Lmin) indicators represent the rootmean-square (RMS) maximum and minimum noise levels measured during the monitoring interval.
To describe the time-varying character of environmental noise, the statistical noise descriptors L10, L50,
and L90 are commonly used. They are the noise levels exceeded 10 percent, 50 percent, and 90 percent of
the measured time interval, respectively. Sound levels associated with the L10 typically describe transient
or short-term events; half of the sounds during the measurement interval are softer than L50 and half are
louder; while levels associated with L90 often describe background noise conditions and/or continuous,
steady-state sound sources.
Finally, another sound measure known as the day-night average noise level (Ldn) is defined as the A-weighted
average sound level for a 24-hour day, with a 10-dB adjustment added to nighttime sound levels (10:00 PM to
7:00 AM) to compensate for increased sensitivity to noise during usually quieter evening and nighttime hours.
The community noise equivalent level (CNEL) is also defined as the A-weighted average sound level for a
24-hour day. It is calculated by adding a 5-dB adjustment to sound levels in the evening (7:00 PM to
10:00 PM) and a 10-dB adjustment to sound levels at night (10:00 PM to 7:00 AM) to compensate for
increased sensitivity during such time periods when a quiet environment is expected. The CNEL is used by
various agencies to define acceptable land use compatibility with respect to vehicular traffic noise. The Leq
during the daytime hours (7:00 AM to 10:00 PM) is described as Lday in this analysis.
Sound levels of typical noise sources and environments are provided in Table 3.7-1 to provide a frame of
reference.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Vibration Fundamentals
Groundborne vibration propagates from the source through the ground to adjacent buildings by surface
waves. Vibration may be composed of a single pulse, a series of pulses, or a continuous oscillatory motion.
The frequency of a vibrating object describes how rapidly it is oscillating, measured in Hz. Most
environmental vibrations consist of a composite, or “spectrum” of many frequencies. The normal frequency
range of most groundborne vibrations that can be felt generally starts from a low frequency of less than 1 Hz
to a high of about 200 Hz. Vibration information for this analysis has been described in terms of the peak
particle velocity (PPV), measured in inches per second, or vibration level measured with respect to RMS
vibration velocity in decibels (VdB), with a reference quantity of 1 micro inch per second.
Vibration energy dissipates as it travels through the ground, causing the vibration amplitude to decrease
with distance away from the source. High-frequency vibrations reduce much more rapidly than do low
frequencies, so that in the far-field zone distant from a source, the low frequencies tend to dominate. Soil
properties also affect the propagation of vibration. When groundborne vibration interacts with a building,
there is usually a ground-to-foundation coupling loss; but the vibration also can be amplified by the
structural resonances of the walls and floors. Vibration in buildings is typically perceived as rattling of
windows, shaking of loose items, or the motion of building surfaces. In some cases, the vibration of
building surfaces also can be radiated as sound and heard as a low-frequency rumbling noise, known as
groundborne noise.
Groundborne vibration is generally limited to areas within a few hundred feet of certain types of industrial
operations and construction/demolition activities such as pile driving. Road vehicles rarely create enough
groundborne vibration amplitude to be perceptible to humans unless the receiver is in immediate
proximity to the source or the road surface is poorly maintained and has potholes or bumps. Human
sensitivity to vibration varies by frequency and by receiver. Generally, people are more sensitive to lowfrequency vibration. Human annoyance also is related to the number and duration of events; the more
events or the greater the duration, the more annoying it becomes.
Existing Setting
Study Area
The study includes the project area, and adjacent areas that could be affected by project-related noise and
vibration. The study area for the noise and vibration analysis is bounded by The Embarcadero, Jackson
Street, Drumm Street, Market Street, Steuart Street, and Howard Street. Four historic structures—the San
Francisco Ferry Building (Ferry Building), the Agriculture Building, Pier 1, and the seawall—are also in
the study area (see Section 3.8, Cultural and Paleontological Resources, for more information on the
historic structures). Figure 3.7-1 illustrates the study area boundary.
Noise and Vibration Sensitive Receivers
Land uses and structures in the study area that would be susceptible or sensitive to noise and vibration
were identified. Noise-sensitive receivers are based on land uses where sensitive receptors may be
present or where noise-sensitive activities may occur. These include land uses where quiet is an essential
element in their intended purpose, such as indoor or outdoor concert halls; residences and buildings where
people sleep; and institutional land uses with primarily daytime and evening use, such as schools, places
of worship, and libraries. Generally, commercial or industrial uses are not considered noise-sensitive
because, in general, the activities are compatible with higher noise levels. For parks or recreation areas, it
depends on how the park is used and how essential quiet is to the enjoyment of the recreation area. For
the purposes of this analysis, the recreation areas in the study area were not considered noise-sensitive
land uses due to the active urban nature of these areas (e.g., Justin Herman Plaza). Refer to Section 3.4,
Parklands and Recreation, for more description of the recreation areas in the study area. For the purposes

of this analysis, the commercial buildings within the project area that contain office space were
conservatively considered in the noise analysis due to their proximity to the construction zone.
Vibration-sensitive land uses include residences where people sleep; and other institutional uses like
laboratories where the activities within the building would be particularly sensitive to vibration.
Those structures located within close proximity to the construction zone identified on Figure 2-9 that
would be susceptible to vibration were also identified. As noted previously, the project area includes four
historic structures, each of which are included in this analysis.

Sound level measurements were conducted at various locations in the study area to collect representative
existing noise levels for various noise-sensitive land uses. A combination of long- and short-term noise
measurements were conducted, as described below.
Sound level measurements were conducted using a Larson Davis Model 820 American National
Standards Institute Type 1 Sound Level Meter for short-term measurements and a Larson Davis Model
720 American National Standards Institute Type 2 Sound Level Meter for the long-term measurement.
The short-term meter was mounted on a tripod roughly 5 feet above the ground to simulate the average
height of the human ear above grade. The meter was equipped with a windscreen and set for slow timeresponse and use of the A-weighting scale. All instruments used were within their recommended
laboratory calibration period, and each instrument was field-calibrated with an acoustic calibrator before
and after each measurement period. All sound-level measurements were conducted in accordance with
International Organization for Standardization standards (ISO 1996a, 1996b, and 1996c).
Weather conditions during the survey period were mild with clear skies and no precipitation. The air
temperature varied from 66 degrees Fahrenheit to 73 degrees Fahrenheit, with 43 to 50 percent relative
humidity. Winds were intermittent, with averages ranging from 0 to 7 mph.
One long-term noise measurement (24 hours) was conducted at the rooftop of the Hyatt Regency Hotel.
The meter was placed at the northeastern corner of the rooftop with a clear view of the streets below,
facing Market Street and Steuart Street. Audible noise sources included vehicular traffic, buses, trolleys,

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Short-term noise measurements where conducted for 20 minutes at six locations to characterize the noise
environment at representative areas of outdoor human activity in the study area, as described below.
ST1 is at the Golden Gateway Tennis and Swim Club. The meter was placed at the southeastern corner of
its parking lot, near tennis courts along Washington Street, and approximately 70 feet from The
Embarcadero. The dominant noise source was vehicular traffic from The Embarcadero.
ST2 is in Sue Bierman Park across from the northern end of the Ferry Building. The meter was placed
approximately 30 feet from The Embarcadero near the sculpture, with water running. The dominant noise
source was vehicular traffic from The Embarcadero.
ST3 is across from the center of the Ferry Building near the center of Harry Bridges Plaza. The meter
was placed approximately 90 feet from The Embarcadero. The dominant noise source was vehicular
traffic from The Embarcadero.
ST4 is across from the southern end of the Ferry Building near the San Francisco Railway Museum and
Don Chee trolley station. The meter was placed approximately 20 feet from The Embarcadero. The
dominant noise source was vehicular traffic from The Embarcadero.
ST5 is at the northeastern corner of the Audiffred Building. The meter was placed approximately 30 feet
from The Embarcadero and 20 feet from Mission Street. The dominant noise source was vehicular traffic
from The Embarcadero.
ST6 is in the center of Justin Herman Plaza. The meter was placed approximately 140 feet from The
Embarcadero. The dominant noise source was vehicular traffic from The Embarcadero. Note that this
measurement was ended after 4 minutes because of music events starting in Justin Herman Plaza.
However, it is considered that the data collected represents the existing environment in this area.
Table 3.7-3 presents the results of the sound level measurements, including estimated Lday and Ldn values.

As presented in Table 3.7-2, the Ldn value at the long-term measurement location was 70 dBA Ldn. In
addition, Table 3.7-3 includes the estimated Ldn ranging from 68 dBA to 76 dBA. The ambient noise
environment was relatively high due to the nearby heavy roadway and trolley traffic.
Regulatory Setting
Federal
The Noise Control Act of 1972
The Noise Control Act (42 United States Code Chapter 4901, et seq.) directs the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) to develop noise level guidelines, which would protect the population
from the adverse effects of environmental noise. The U.S. EPA published a guideline (U.S. EPA, 1974)
recommending that the acceptable noise level limits affecting residential land use be 55 dBA Ldn for
outdoors, and 45 dBA Ldn for indoors. The agency is careful to stress that these recommendations contain
a factor of safety and do not consider technical or economic feasibility issues, and therefore should not be
construed as standards or regulations.
Federal Transit Administration Guidelines
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has published guidance for assessment of noise and vibration
impacts for transit projects, including construction activity and operation of ferry boats and ferry
terminals (FTA, 2006). The “transit project” impact criteria, described below, would apply to the project.
FTA has developed three “sensitive” land use categories to evaluate the compatibility of predicted noise
levels, as described below.




Category 1 includes land where quiet is an essential element, such as outdoor amphitheaters;
Category 2 includes residences where people sleep; and
Category 3 includes institutional buildings where quiet is important, such as schools, libraries, and
churches.

Categories 1 and 3 use the hourly Leq, whereas Category 2 uses Ldn. Such criteria recognize the
heightened community annoyance caused by late-night or early-morning operations, and respond to the
varying sensitivities of communities to projects under different ambient noise conditions. The noise
criteria are to be applied outside of building locations for residential land use and at the property line for
parks and other significant outdoor use (FTA, 2006).
State
Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, Chapter 3, “Guidelines for Implementation of the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA),” requires that a project’s noise and vibration effects on
humans and structures be assessed in the environmental document.
Local
The City and County of San Francisco (CCSF) has both a General Plan and Ordinance.
The primary focus of the noise-related policies contained in the San Francisco General Plan is to protect
new noise-sensitive development from existing noise exposure. Therefore, the these policies would not
apply to this project, because the project would not develop new noise-sensitive land uses.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

City ordinance, Article 29, Regulation of Noise, includes regulations and policies related to construction
equipment, construction work at night, noise limits, and variances. Sections 2907 and 2908 would apply
to project construction activities, and Section 2909 would apply to operational noise sources.
Section 2907 – Construction Equipment
(a) Except as provided for in Subsections (b), (c), and (d) hereof, it shall be unlawful for any person
to operate any powered construction equipment if the operation of such equipment emits noise at
a level in excess of 80 dBA when measured at a distance of 100 feet from such equipment, or an
equivalent sound level at some other convenient distance.
(b) The provisions of Subsection (a) of this Section shall not be applicable to impact tools and
equipment, provided that such impact tools and equipment shall have intake and exhaust mufflers
recommended by the manufacturers thereof and approved by the Director of Public Works or the
Director of Building Inspection as best accomplishing maximum noise attenuation, and that
pavement breakers and jackhammers shall also be equipped with acoustically attenuating shields
or shrouds recommended by the manufacturers thereof and approved by the Director of Public
Works or the Director of Building Inspection as best accomplishing maximum noise attenuation.
(c) The provisions of Subsection (a) of this Section shall not be applicable to construction equipment
used in connection with emergency work.
(d) Helicopters shall not be used for construction purposes for more than two hours in any single day
or more than four hours in any single week.
Section 2908 – Construction Work at Night
It shall be unlawful for any person, between the hours of 8:00 PM of any day and 7:00 AM of the
following day to erect, construct, demolish, excavate for, alter or repair any building or structure if
the noise level created thereby is in excess of the ambient noise level by 5 dBA at the nearest property
plane, unless a special permit therefore has been applied for and granted by the Director of Public
Works or the Director of Building Inspection. In granting such special permit the Director of Public
Works or the Director of Building Inspection shall consider: if construction noise in the vicinity of
the proposed work site would be less objectionable at night than during daytime because of different
population levels or different neighboring activities if obstruction and interference with traffic,
particularly on streets of major importance, would be less objectionable at night than during daytime;
if the kind of work to be performed emits noises at such a low level as to not cause significant
disturbance in the vicinity of the work site; if the neighborhood of the proposed work site is primarily
residential in character wherein sleep could be disturbed; if great economic hardship would occur if
the work were spread over a longer time; if the work will abate or prevent hazard to life or property;
and if the proposed night work is in the general public interest. The Director of Public Works or the
Director of Building Inspection shall prescribe such conditions, working times, types of construction
equipment to be used, and permissible noise emissions, as required in the public interest.
The provisions of this Section shall not be applicable to emergency work.
Section 2909 – Noise Limits
(b) Commercial and Industrial Property Noise Limits. No person shall produce or allow to be
produced by any machine or device, music or entertainment or any combination of same, on
commercial or industrial property over which the person has ownership or control, a noise level
more than 8 dBA above the local ambient at any point outside of the property plane. With respect
to noise generated from a licensed Place of Entertainment, in addition to the above dBA criteria a

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

secondary low frequency C-weighted decibel (dBC) criteria shall apply to the definition above.
No noise or music associated with a licensed Place of Entertainment shall exceed the low
frequency ambient noise level (45 dBC for interior residential noise, and 55 dBC in all other
locations) by more than 8 dBC.
(c) Public Property Noise Limits. No person shall produce or allow to be produced by any machine
or device, or any combination of same, on public property, a noise level more than ten dBA above
the local ambient at a distance of twenty-five feet or more, unless the machine or device is being
operated to serve or maintain the property or as otherwise provided in this Article.
(d) Fixed Residential Interior Noise Limits. In order to prevent sleep disturbance, protect public
health and prevent the acoustical environment from progressive deterioration due to the
increasing use and influence of mechanical equipment, no fixed noise source may cause the noise
level measured inside any sleeping or living room in any dwelling unit on residential property to
exceed 45 dBA between the hours of 10:00 PM to 7:00 AM or 55 dBA between the hours of
7:00 AM to 10:00 PM with windows open except where building ventilation is achieved through
mechanical systems that allow windows to remain closed.
(e) Noise Caused By Activities Subject To Permits From the CCSF. None of the noise limits set
forth in this Section apply to activity for which CCSF has issued a permit that contains noise limit
provisions that are different from those set forth in this Article.
Section 2910 – Variances
The Directors of Public Health, Public Works, Building Inspection, or the Entertainment
Commission, or the Chief of Police may grant variances to noise regulations, over which they have
jurisdiction pursuant to enforcement. All administrative decisions granting or denying variances are
appealable to the San Francisco Board of Appeals.
3.7.3

Impact Evaluation

The analysis considers whether the project would result in:






Project-related operational noise exposure levels exceeding impact limits as defined by FTA criteria
presented on Figure 3.7-2 (dependent on existing noise exposure at specific receiver location);
Project-related construction noise levels exceeding FTA criteria as presented in Table 3.7-5
(dependent on land use and time of day);
Project-related construction groundborne vibration levels exceeding FTA human annoyance criteria
presented in Table 3.7-9 (dependent on land use type and frequency of events);
Project-related construction groundborne vibration levels exceeding FTA damage criteria presented in
Table 3.7-13 (dependent on building type); or
Construction activities (and construction-related noise) that would be inconsistent with the CCSF'S
Ordinance Section 2907 and 2908 (CCSF, 2008b).

Note that potential vibration impacts associated with the project could result from project-related
vibrations being transmitted through the ground. Although some project-related vibrations could be
generated from construction activities (as discussed below), no direct vibration impacts associated with
the water transit operations are anticipated, and no further analysis is necessary.
In addition, groundborne noise refers to a condition where noise is experienced inside a building or
structure as a result of vibrations produced outside of the building, and transmitted as ground vibration
between the source and receiver. Groundborne noise can be problematic in situations where the primary
airborne noise path is blocked, such as in the case of a subway tunnel passing in close proximity to homes

Consequences, and Mitigation

or other noise-sensitive structures. However, proposed noise and vibration-generating activities for this
project would be above ground, where the airborne noise and surface vibration would be present. Any
potential groundborne noise from construction activities would be imperceptible, and therefore would
have no impact. Groundborne noise is therefore not discussed further.
Direct Impacts
No Action Alternative
The No Action Alternative does not include any facilities or fixed noise sources that would generate any
substantial operational noise. However, a limited increase in Water Emergency Transportation Authority
(WETA) vessel operations at the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal) would occur
under the No Action Alternative. The effects of increased vessel operation are analyzed below under
Indirect Impacts.
Action Alternative
The proposed project facilities do not include any facilities or fixed noise sources that would generate any
substantial operational noise. The project would include an emergency generator, which could represent a
potential audible noise source, but it would only be used under certain, very limited circumstances (during
emergencies and for testing). This would not be considered normal operating conditions for the project.
Therefore there would be no direct noise and vibration impacts expected from project operation.
However, the proposed project would develop facilities at the Ferry Terminal that would accommodate an
increase in WETA vessel operations at the Ferry Terminal consistent with WETA’s Implementation and
Operations Plan. The effects of increased vessel operation are analyzed below under Indirect Impacts.
Indirect Impacts
Impact 3.7-1: Potential Impact of Water Transit Operations on Adjacent Noise-Sensitive
Land Uses
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no new facilities would be constructed, and the Ferry Terminal would
generally operate as it does today. However, under the No Action Alternative, WETA vessel arrival
during the AM peak period (i.e., between 6:30 and 9:00 AM) could increase from 14 to 20. The analysis
of the Action Alternative, below, indicates that even an increase in water transit vessel arrivals from 14 to
57 arrivals during the AM peak period would not result in significant increases in noise. Therefore,
because the No Action Alternative would result in fewer additional vessels than the proposed project,
there would be no impact from potential noise increases.
Action Alternative
The proposed project would develop facilities at the Ferry Terminal that would accommodate an increase
in WETA vessel operations at the Ferry Terminal consistent with WETA’s Implementation and
Operations Plan. The increase in vessel operations at the Ferry Terminal could increase noise levels at the
site, potentially affecting nearby noise-sensitive land uses.
The noise general assessment for the increase in water transit operations is based on the procedure
developed in Chapter 5 of the FTA Manual, which requires a determination of both the existing noise
environment in the project study area, and the predicted project noise exposure. The existing noise
exposure values at sensitive receiver locations were determined by a noise measurement program, and the

future noise levels from the proposed project are predicted as described below. This methodology is
consistent with the U.S. EPA’s Guidelines for Preparing Environmental Impact Statements on Noise (National
Academy of Sciences, 1977).
The increase in water transit vessel traffic would result in two future noise sources: 1) vessel operations;
and 2) fog horn soundings from the vessels. The following referenced noise levels of each noise source
are published in the FTA Manual, Chapter 5, Table 5-5.



Water Transit Vessel (no fog horn sounded) – 97 sound exposure level in dBA at 50 feet (based on
four vessel landings in 1 hour); and
Water Transit Vessel (fog horn sounded) – 100 sound exposure level in dBA at 50 feet (based on
four vessel landings in 1 hour).

The noise levels expected from the increase in water transit operations were predicted based on Table 5-6
of the FTA Manual, which describes the computation process of equivalent sound level and the Ldn at
50 feet from the noise source.
Figure 3.7-2 presents the criteria for FTA’s three levels of impact: No Impact, Moderate Impact, and
Severe Impact. As shown in the figure, the criterion for each level of impact is on a sliding scale,
dependent on both the existing noise exposure and the predicted project-related noise exposure. Noise
impacts associated with an increase in water transit operations were assessed using Noise Impact Criteria
presented on Figure 3.7-2.
With the proposed improvements, AM peak vessel arrivals could increase from 14 to approximately 52 to
57 by 2035. Quantitative noise impact analysis was conducted for the Action Alternative to evaluate the
potential impacts related to the increase in vessel arrivals. Because the hourly water transit operation
schedule for 2035 is not available, the following assumptions were used to conservatively assess the
future noise generated by WETA vessel operations.





Daytime peak-hour WETA vessel arrivals would be 22.8 vessels per hour between 7:00 AM and

Vessel operations were assessed assuming the fog horn would be sounded.
Nighttime WETA vessel arrivals would include 11.4 vessels between 6:00 AM and 7:00 AM; and
No nighttime water transit operation would occur between 10:00 PM and 6:00 AM.

Based on the assumptions and impact evaluation described above, Table 3.7-4 presents the project-related
noise levels, and indicates whether these levels would exceed the FTA impact thresholds at the noisesensitive receivers in the study area. As described above in the Noise and Vibration Sensitive Receivers
subsection of Section 3.7.2, Affected Environment, office spaces would not typically be considered noisesensitive land uses; but for the purposes of this analysis, the office spaces located in the project area were
conservatively considered Land Use Category 3.
As shown in Table 3.7-4 (on the following page), operation of the additional water transit vessels at the
Ferry Terminal would not exceed FTA thresholds.
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Determination. The increase in water transit vessel
operation would result in no impacts on adjacent noise-sensitive land uses.
CEQA Determination. The increase in water transit vessel operation would have less-than-significant
impacts on adjacent noise-sensitive land uses.

Construction Impacts
The No Action Alternative would not result in any physical changes to the Ferry Terminal, and no
construction activities would be required. Therefore, there would be no construction impacts to noise and
vibration.
Impact 3.7-2: Potential Impact of Construction and Demolition Equipment other than
Impact Tools on Adjacent Noise-Sensitive Land Uses
See Impact 3.7-3 for a discussion of construction impacts related to the use of impact tools. The
following impact discussion is focused on noise generated from general construction equipment.
As described in Section 2.4.6, construction activities could take place between 7:00 AM and 8:00 PM, 7 days a
week, consistent with the requirements of the CCSF Section 2908. Construction and demolition activities
would be varied from phase to phase, and would include, but are not limited to, demolition of existing pilesupported deck structures, removal of piles, dredging, construction of new pile-supported deck structures, and
a variety of site finishing activities such as assembling canopies, finishing concrete surfaces, and paving.
CCSF Ordinance Section 2907 also regulates construction equipment as follows:

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

No powered construction equipment (excluding impact tools) may be used if the operation of such
equipment emits noise at a level in excess of 80 dBA when measured at a distance of 100 feet.
The CCSF Ordinance requires that each individual piece of construction equipment used not exceed
80 dBA at 100 feet (CCSF, 2008b). WETA and its contractors could comply with this ordinance through
the selection of the construction equipment used on site, such as the selection of lower noise emission
ratings when possible, or the use of enclosures, mufflers, or shrouds. Compliance with this ordinance is
required and would be enforced by the San Francisco Department of Building Inspection.
Impacts from construction and demolition activities were further assessed by applying the FTA Manual
methodology, FTA Manual, Section 12.1. This methodology assumes that the two loudest pieces of
construction equipment would operate simultaneously at the same location under full power. Note that
the pile-driving activity has been analyzed separately under Impact 3.7-3.
Table 3.7-5 presents FTA-suggested construction noise criteria by land use during daytime and nighttime
hours.

If two pieces of construction equipment (each producing noise levels of 80 dBA at 100 feet, per CCSF's
Ordinance) are operated at the same time, under full power, and at the same location, the resulting noise
level would be 83 dBA at 100 feet. Therefore, this analysis considers whether construction noise levels
of 83 dBA at 100 feet would exceed the FTA thresholds, presented in Table 3.7-5, at the noise-sensitive
land uses in the study area.
Based on the impact thresholds presented in Table 3.7-5, and on a construction noise level of 83 dBA at
100 feet, Table 3.7-6 identifies the distances at which the FTA thresholds could be exceeded.

Notes:

This is the distance to the construction zone in the North Basin (excluding the portion of the construction zone for the
Gate B canopy installation, which would be considered a minor construction activity from a noise and vibration
perspective, and not representative of project construction activities).
2
This is the distance to the construction zone in the South Basin.
Distances are estimated based on the construction zone shown on Figure 2-9.

As presented above, the Hotel Vitale is not within 45 feet of the construction zone. Therefore, general
construction noise levels would not exceed the FTA thresholds for residential land uses.
For commercial land uses, only the Agriculture Building is within 15 feet of the construction zone. At
this location, noise from general construction activities could exceed the FTA thresholds within 15 feet of
the Agriculture Building.
The installation of the weather protection canopy for Gate B in the North Basin would be within 30 feet
of the Ferry Building. However, this activity would be completed in approximately 1 week and would
only require minor equipment and use of tools onsite to erect the canopy, which would be delivered to the
site pre-constructed. This activity, by itself, is unlikely to create noise levels that would be typical of
other site construction activities like demolition and deck construction.
Mitigation Measure NOISE-1 requires that the noise-sensitive receivers in the project vicinity be notified
prior to construction with information on the construction activities, and that they be provided with a
number to contact for questions and concerns. Mitigation Measure NOISE-2 requires the selection of
smaller and quieter construction equipment in areas where work would be within 15 feet of the
Agriculture Building, to minimize construction noise impacts to the building occupants. Implementation
of Mitigation Measures NOISE-1 and NOISE-2 would reduce construction-noise below FTA thresholds.
NEPA Determination. General construction noise could exceed FTA thresholds for noise-sensitive
receivers in the project vicinity. With implementation of Mitigation Measures NOISE-1 and NOISE-2,
construction-related noise would be reduced and would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. General construction noise could have potentially significant impacts to noisesensitive receivers in the project vicinity. With implementation of Mitigation Measures NOISE-1 and
NOISE-2, impacts would be reduced to a less-than-significant level.

Impact 3.7-3: Potential Impact of Pile Driving During Project Construction on Adjacent
Noise-Sensitive Land Uses
All project construction activities would occur between 7:00 AM and 8:00 PM, 7 days a week, consistent
with the requirements of CCSF Ordinance Section 2908. The CCSF Noise Ordinance does not have
quantitative thresholds for impact tools. Therefore, the FTA construction noise impact assessment
methodology and criteria are used to assess potential noise impacts from impact tools. The applicable
thresholds are given in Table 3.7-5.
As described in Chapter 2, installation of piles would be required for the construction of Gates A, F,
and G; Gate A Access Pier; Embarcadero Plaza; and the East Bayside Promenade. Piles could be
concrete or steel, and could be driven using an impact hammer, or vibrated into place. Use of the impact
hammer would produce more noise than vibrating piles into place. According to FTA Manual
Table 12-1, the sound pressure level of impact pile driving is 101 dBA at 50 feet; and the sound pressure
level for vibratory pile driving is 96 dBA at 50 feet. Table 3.7-8 presents the distances from pile-driving
activity where noise from impact pile driving could exceed the thresholds presented in Table 3.7-5.

Nighttime is included for informational purposes only; no nighttime construction is anticipated for the proposed project

Nighttime construction is not anticipated for the proposed project, and therefore would not result in any
noise impacts to nearby land uses.
Based on the distances presented in Table 3.7-7, the Hotel Vitale is not within 180 feet of the construction
zone. Therefore, no noise impacts are expected for residential land uses from pile-driving activities.
For commercial land uses, the Ferry Building, the Agriculture Building, and Pier 1 would all be within
55 feet of the construction zone; therefore, if impact pile driving were used within 55 feet of these
buildings, noise from pile driving could exceed the FTA thresholds and could be adverse. In addition, if
vibratory pile driving were used within 32 feet of the Ferry Building, the Agriculture Building, and Pier 1,
noise from pile driving could exceed the FTA thresholds and could be adverse.
Neither the Carnelian by the Bay nor the Golden Gate Transit Terminal are within 55 feet of the
construction zone. Therefore, no noise impact from pile driving would be expected at these two
commercial uses.
Implementation of Mitigation Measures NOISE-1 and NOISE-3 would reduce impacts associated with
pile driving. Mitigation Measure NOISE-3 requires implementation of quieter pile-driving methods
within 55 feet of these buildings, to reduce noise levels.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

NEPA Determination. Construction noise from pile-driving activities could be adverse when conducted
within 55 feet of the Ferry Building, the Agriculture Building, and Pier 1. Construction noise would be
reduced with implementation of Mitigation Measures NOISE-1 and NOISE-3, which require that quieter
pile-driving techniques be used in these areas, and that nearby businesses be notified of construction.
Therefore, construction noise from pile driving would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. Construction noise from pile-driving activities would be potentially significant
when conducted within 55 feet of the Ferry Building, the Agriculture Building, and Pier 1.
Implementation of Mitigation Measures NOISE-1 and NOISE-3 requires the implementation of quieter
pile-driving techniques in these areas, and notification of nearby businesses, which would reduce noise to
less-than-significant levels. Therefore, construction noise from pile driving would be less than significant
with mitigation incorporated.
Impact 3.7-4: Vibration from Project Construction that Could Result in Human
Annoyance
Groundborne vibration impacts are based on the estimated maximum RMS vibration levels for repeated
events from the same source. Vibration from construction could exceed thresholds related to human
annoyance, and thresholds intended to prevent structural damage to adjacent buildings. The potential for
structural damage is assessed in Impact 3.7-5.
Table 3.7-9 presents the thresholds used for vibration assessment of human annoyance. The criteria
presented in Table 3.7-9 account for variations in the type of land use, as well as the frequency of events.
Project construction would require pile driving. The criteria for acceptable groundborne vibration for
human annoyance are expressed in terms of RMS vibration VdB, while the criteria for acceptable
groundborne noise are expressed in terms of A-weighted sound pressure levels.

are included in this assessment.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

The FTA Manual suggests that for frequent events—more than 70 vibration events of the same source per
day—the threshold where the residential users could be affected by vibration is 75 VdB. For occasional
events—between 30 and 70 vibration events of the same source per day—the threshold is 78 VdB. For
infrequent events—fewer than 30 vibration events of the same kind per day—the threshold is 83 VdB.
During construction, groundborne vibration levels depend on the construction equipment used, and the
soil type in the vicinity of the construction site. According to the FTA Manual, construction-related
groundborne vibrations can reach audible and perceptible ranges in buildings near a construction site, and
at levels well below thresholds that could cause structure damage.
Table 3.7-9 presents vibration levels for various types of construction equipment.
Table 3.7-10 presents the distances from construction where construction equipment could exceed the
FTA thresholds for human annoyance. Note that there are no Category 1 receivers in the vicinity of the
project site.

Notes:
The distances presented in this table would only apply if the equipment, except pile driving, were operated onshore. If the
equipment is on a construction barge, then with the exception of pile driving, vibration would not transmit to the nearby land
uses.
1
“Frequent Events” is defined as more than 70 vibration events of the same source per day.
2
“Occasional Events” is defined as between 30 and 70 vibration events of the same source per day.
3
“Infrequent Events” is defined as fewer than 30 vibration events of the same kind per day.

Note that, with the exception of a pile driver, the construction equipment operated on a barge would not
generate groundborne vibration that would reach onshore receivers. Because the pile is driven to the
ground, the groundborne vibration would travel through the bottom sediments to sensitive receivers.
Therefore, with the exception of pile driving, the distances shown in Table 3.7-10 would only be
applicable if the equipment were operated onshore or on the deck and pile structures in the project area.
As a conservative approach, it is assumed the project construction vibration events would be “frequent”
events (i.e., be more than 70 events from the same source per day, as shown in Table 3.7-10).

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

The Hotel Vitale is approximately 230 feet from the construction zone (see Table 3.7-7). Therefore, the
noise-sensitive receivers at the hotel could be adversely affected by vibration from impact pile driving,
and potentially from vibratory pile driving, if these activities occur within the distances presented in
Table 3.7-10.
Implementation of Mitigation Measures NOISE-1 and NOISE-3 would minimize vibration from project
construction by requiring construction notification, vibration monitoring, and selection of appropriate
pile-driving techniques.
NEPA Determination. Vibration from pile driving could adversely affect the residential uses at the
Hotel Vitale, causing annoyance. Implementation of Mitigation Measures NOISE-1 and NOISE-3
requires construction notification, implementation of vibration monitoring, and appropriate pile-driving
techniques in these areas, which would reduce vibration from pile driving. Therefore, construction
vibration as it relates to human annoyance from pile driving would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. Vibration from pile driving could significantly affect the residential uses at the
Hotel Vitale, causing annoyance. Implementation of Mitigation Measures NOISE-1 and NOISE-3
requires construction notification, implementation of vibration monitoring, and appropriate pile-driving
techniques in these areas; and would reduce impacts to less-than-significant levels. Therefore,
construction vibration as it relates to human annoyance from pile driving would be less than significant
with mitigation incorporated.
Impact 3.7-5: Damage to Structures Caused by Vibration from Project Construction
Groundborne vibration from project construction activities has the potential to exceed thresholds designed
to prevent structure damage.
The assessment of the potential for construction activities to cause structural damage is based on FTA
criteria presented in Table 3.7-11, and the potential equipment vibration levels presented in Table 3.7-12
(on the following page).

The FTA categories presented in Table 3.7-11 do not describe every possible construction type that could
be present near a project construction zone, but instead represent a range of construction types with
conservatively assigned thresholds intended to represent a scale of the structure’s sensitivity to vibration.
This would include a wide variety of vibration sources, such as vibration generated by nearby
underground subway trains passing, or “vibration” triggered by a seismic event—not just vibration
generated by construction activities. Structures and buildings assigned a Category I would be considered
those most able to withstand vibration effects, and Category IV buildings would be considered those least
able to withstand vibration effects. Seven buildings and two structures were considered in the vibration
analysis. Each building and structure was assigned a category from Table 3.7-11 that best reflected the
building or structure’s ability to withstand vibration. Where necessary, the information provided in the
documents referenced in the FTA manual were also used to assist in the assignment of the appropriate
building category. The buildings assessed include the Hotel Vitale, Pier 1, Ferry Building, the Carnelian
by the Bay, Bay Area Rapid Transit’s (BART’s) facilities on and beneath the Ferry Plaza, Golden Gate
Transit Terminal, and the Agriculture Building. Each of these buildings is shown on Figure 3.7-1. The
Hotel Vitale, Pier 1, Ferry Building, Carnelian by the Bay, Golden Gate Transit Terminal, and BART’s
facilities were conservatively considered Category II buildings for the purposes of this analysis. In
addition, based on its construction type and condition, the Agriculture Building was also considered a
Category II building (Simpson Gumpertz & Heger, 2012). Two structures were also considered in this
assessment, the seawall and the Ferry Plaza. Because it functions as a retaining wall, the seawall is likely
a Category I; however, due to its age and historic resource status, it was conservatively considered a
Category II structure. The Ferry Plaza is a modern construction. It was built as a support structure and is
currently used for heavy loading activities (e.g., Ferry Plaza Farmer’s Market). Therefore, the Ferry Plaza
was assessed as a Category I structure.
Table 3.7-13 (on the following page) presents the distances from a vibration source where vibration from
construction activities has the potential to exceed the FTA thresholds presented in Table 3.7-11, and
therefore has the potential to result in structural damage.

The seawall, the Ferry Building, the Agriculture Building, the Carnelian by the Bay, and Pier 1 were considered Building
Category II.

The Hotel Vitale is 230 feet from the construction zone, and therefore would not be adversely affected by
project vibration.
The Ferry Building (Building Category II) is 30 feet from the closest point of the construction zone.
Impact pile driving and vibratory pile driving have the potential to cause vibrations that would exceed the
FTA thresholds in Table 3.7-11, if conducted within the distances shown in Table 3.7-13, and therefore
have the potential to result in structural damage.
The Agriculture Building (Building Category II) is 5 feet from the closest point of the construction zone.
If any of the construction equipment listed in Table 3.7-13, with the exception of a small bulldozer, is
operated within the distances presented in Table 3.7-13, there is potential to cause vibrations that would
exceed the FTA thresholds in Table 3.7-1—potentially resulting in structural damage.
The Pier 1 (Building Category II) is 25 feet from the closest point of the construction zone. Impact pile
driving and vibratory pile driving, if conducted within the distances shown in Table 3.7-13, have the
potential to cause vibrations that would exceed the FTA thresholds in Table 3.7-1; and therefore have the
potential to result in structural damage.
The Carnelian by the Bay, Golden Gate Transit Terminal, and BART’s facilities on and underneath the
Ferry Plaza (Building Category II) are more than 200 feet from the closest point of the construction zone,
and therefore would not be adversely affected by project vibration.
The Ferry Plaza, considered a Building Category I, is adjacent to a small area of the project construction
zone (just to the southeast of the Ferry Building, as shown on Figure 3.7-1). The majority of the
construction zone is more than 50 feet from the Ferry Plaza, where vibration would not be expected to
exceed the FTA threshold. However, if any of the construction equipment listed in Table 3.7-13 is

operated within the distances presented in Table 3.7-13, there is potential to cause vibrations that would
exceed the FTA thresholds in Table 3.7-1—potentially resulting in structural damage.
The seawall was conservatively considered a Building Category II in this analysis, and is in the
construction zone. If any of the construction equipment listed in Table 3.7-13 is operated within the
distances presented in Table 3.7-13, there is potential to cause vibrations that would exceed the FTA
thresholds in Table 3.7-1—potentially resulting in structural damage.
Mitigation Measures NOISE-3 and NOISE-4 would reduce vibration from construction activities that
could result in structural damage. These measures require that appropriate pile-driving techniques be
selected, based on the distance from existing buildings; that vibration monitoring be conducted during
construction; and that work be ceased and corrective measures or alternative construction methods be
implemented should vibration monitoring indicate that the threshold would be exceeded. Therefore,
implementation of the Mitigation Measures NOISE-3 and NOISE-4 would reduce construction-related
vibration below the thresholds that could result in structural damage.
NEPA Determination. Project construction activities could produce vibration that could exceed
thresholds designed to protect buildings from structural damage. With implementation of Mitigation
Measures NOISE-3 and NOISE-4, vibration would be reduced and would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. Project construction activities could produce vibration that could exceed
thresholds designed to protect buildings from structural damage. With implementation of Mitigation
Measures NOISE-3 and NOISE-4, impacts would be reduced to a less-than-significant level.
Cumulative Impacts
There would be no vibration cumulative impacts because the vibration impact is assessed based on
individual events, not accumulated events.
Impact 3.7-6. Potential to Result in Cumulative Impacts on Noise
The potential noise from the increase in water transit vessel operation would not impact noise-sensitive
receptors, and therefore would not contribute to potential cumulative adverse noise levels in the study
area.
The proposed project could result in adverse noise and vibration impacts during construction. There are
two projects listed in Table 3.1-1 that have the potential to result in cumulative noise impacts, when
combined with the proposed project, due to their location (close proximity to the proposed project) and
the potential for overlapping construction activities: Golden Gate Transit Ferry Terminal Improvements,
and the Embarcadero Pedestrian Signage and Map Program. BART’s Ferry Plaza Physical Barrier
Project, although located within the project area, would be completed before WETA’s project
construction would commence.
Golden Gate Transit Ferry Terminal Improvements include accessibility upgrades to Gates C and D. The
improvements are expected to include reconfiguring of the existing ramps. This project is not anticipated
to result in a change in service frequency or volumes. However, construction activities could occur at the
same time as the proposed project. As long as the projects comply with the San Francisco Noise
Ordinance, the noise level would be 83 dBA at 100 feet when two pieces of equipment are operated under
full power at the same location.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

If the Golden Gate Transit Terminal Improvements and the proposed project were under construction at
the same time, the expected cumulative construction noise level at the Ferry Building would be 93 dBA,
and would not exceed the 100-dBA threshold presented in Table 3.7-5. 1 Therefore, no cumulative noise
impact is expected for the Ferry Building. Similarly, if both projects were under construction at the same
time, the estimated cumulative construction noise level at the Carnelian by the Bay would be 93 dBA, and
would not exceed the 100-dBA threshold. 2 Therefore, no cumulative noise impact is expected for the
Carnelian by the Bay. Other noise-sensitive land uses in the project vicinity (i.e., Agriculture Building,
Pier 1, and Hotel Vitale) are farther away from the Golden Gate Transit Ferry Terminal Improvements,
and therefore would not be expected to be cumulatively impacted by the two projects.
The Embarcadero Pedestrian Signage and Map Program installs pedestrian signage and maps along The
Embarcadero. It is assumed that this project would not use heavy construction equipment, and that it
would have a short-term construction period. Therefore, cumulative noise impacts would not be expected
from this project.
NEPA Determination. The project would not contribute to cumulative adverse noise impacts.
CEQA Determination. Cumulative noise impacts would be less than significant.
3.7.4

Mitigation Measures

Mitigation Measure NOISE-1: Construction Notification
Prior to the start of construction, the owners and occupants of Pier 1, the Hotel Vitale, the Ferry Building,
the Carnelian by the Bay, and the Agriculture Building (i.e., those noise-sensitive receivers listed in
Table 3.7-7) will be notified of the project schedule, and that noise- and vibration-generating construction
activities are anticipated. Prior to the start of the job, these businesses will be provided with the phone
number of the construction foreman, or another responsible party who can be reached for noise- and
vibration-related questions and concerns.
Mitigation Measure NOISE-2: Use of Smaller and Quieter Construction Equipment within
15 Feet of the Agriculture Building
When construction activities would occur within 15 feet of the Agriculture Building during a time when
the building is occupied, equipment will be selected to minimize the noise generated from construction.
The contractor will use smaller and quieter construction equipment with lower noise-emission ratings.
Mitigation Measure NOISE-3: Pile-Driving Technique Selection; Vibration Monitoring;
and Corrective Measures to Minimize Noise and Vibration at Nearby Buildings
To reduce the effect of noise and vibration on adjacent land uses and structures, the following measures
will be implemented during construction:

This estimate was calculated assuming the Golden Gate Transit Ferry Terminal Improvements would be approximately
120 feet from the Ferry Building. Therefore, the construction noise level from Golden Gate Transit Ferry Terminal
Improvements would be 81 dBA at the Ferry Building. As presented in Table 3.7-7, the Ferry Building is 30 feet from the
construction zone of the proposed project. Therefore, the noise level at the Ferry Building from the proposed project would be
93 dBA. Cumulatively, the construction noise level at the Ferry Building would be 93 dBA.
This estimate was calculated assuming the Golden Gate Transit Ferry Terminal Improvements would be approximately 60 feet
from the Carnelian by the Bay. The construction noise level from the Golden Gate Transit Ferry Terminal Improvements
would be 93 dBA at the Carnelian by the Bay. As presented in Table 3.7-7, the Carnelian by the Bay is 100 feet from the
construction zone of the proposed project. The noise level at the Carnelian by the Bay from the proposed project would be
83 dBA. Cumulatively, the construction noise level at the Carnelian by the Bay would be 93 dBA.



Within 55 feet of a building (i.e., the Ferry Building, the Agriculture Building, or Pier 1), vibratory
pile driving will be employed to reduce noise levels at the building to below 100 dBA.



When vibratory pile driving occurs within 32 feet of an occupied building (i.e., the Ferry Building,
the Agriculture Building, or Pier 1), noise monitoring will be conducted to ensure that noise levels at
the building do not exceed 100 dBA. If necessary, noise-reducing measures will be employed to
reduce noise levels at the building to below 100 dBA.



When impact pile driving occurs within 540 feet of the Hotel Vitale, vibration monitoring will be
performed to ensure that the vibration levels at the hotel do not exceed 75 VdB (the threshold for
annoyance for residential land uses).



When vibratory pile driving occurs within 315 feet of the Hotel Vitale, vibration monitoring will be
performed to ensure that the vibration levels at the hotel do not exceed 75 VdB (the threshold for
annoyance for residential land uses).



When pile driving occurs within 290 feet of the Hotel Vitale, techniques to reduce vibration, such as
selection of vibratory pile driving, will be applied to ensure that vibration levels at the hotel do not
exceed 75 VdB (the threshold for annoyance for residential land uses).



To ensure that vibration from construction activities does not result in damage to any of the Vibration
Category II structures in the project area (the Ferry Building, the Agriculture Building, the Carnelian
by the Bay, Pier 1, and the seawall), the following measures will be applied:



−

When impact pile driving occurs within 73 feet of the building, vibration will be monitored to
ensure that the vibration levels at the building do not exceed 0.3 PPV.

−

Within 42 feet of an existing building, an alternative method to impact pile driving will be
employed, such as vibratory pile-driving construction.

−

When vibratory pile driving occurs within 45 feet of the building, vibration will be monitored to
ensure that the vibration levels at the building do not exceed 0.3 PPV.

−

Pile driving will not be implemented within 17 feet of an existing building unless it can be
demonstrated that the activity will not generate vibration levels that would exceed 0.3 PPV at the
building.

To ensure that vibration from construction activities does not result in damage to the Ferry Plaza
(Vibration Category I), the following measures will be applied:
−

When impact pile driving occurs within 53 feet of the Ferry Plaza, vibration will be monitored to
ensure that the vibration levels at the plaza do not exceed 0.5 PPV.

−

Within 30 feet of the Ferry Plaza, an alternative method to impact pile driving will be employed,
such as vibratory pile-driving construction.

−

When vibratory pile driving occurs within 33 feet of the Ferry Plaza, vibration will be monitored
to ensure that the vibration levels at the plaza do not exceed 0.5 PPV.

−

Pile driving will not be implemented within 13 feet of the Ferry Plaza, unless it can be
demonstrated that the activity will not generate vibration levels that would exceed 0.5 PPV at the
plaza.

methods will be implemented to minimize the risk to the subject or structure.

Mitigation Measure NOISE-4: General Construction Equipment Measures to Minimize
Vibration
To reduce construction-related vibration that has the potential to damage structures in the project area, the
following measures will be implemented during construction:


Vibrating construction equipment should be placed and operated from the construction barge, if
feasible.



When working within 20 feet of the Agriculture Building or the seawall (except when on a barge),
equipment that produces less vibration when operated will be selected (refer to Table 3.7-13). If
vibration-producing equipment is used within 20 feet of the Agriculture Building or the seawall,
vibration will be monitored to ensure that it does not exceed 0.3 PPV. Should the onsite vibration

CULTURAL AND PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES

3.8.1

Introduction to the Analysis

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

This section describes the cultural and paleontological resources in the project area of potential effect
(APE). This evaluation of impacts assessed the potential for the project to affect the historic architectural
properties and resources and archaeological resources identified in the APE, as well as the potential for
the project to affect paleontological resources. The evaluation complies with Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended, and also satisfies the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) requirement that California public agencies identify the significant environmental
impacts of their actions as they pertain to historical resources.
There are no known archaeological resources in the Archaeological APE; however, the inadvertent
discovery of archaeological materials during project activities represents a potential project impact.
Implementation of mitigation measures identified in this section would reduce the project’s potential to
result in impacts to archaeological resources. There are several historic properties in the project APE.
The project has the potential to directly impact historic properties or resources in the Architectural APE;
however, mitigation measures would reduce potential impacts. The proposed project elements and
project construction activities also have the potential to indirectly and adversely affect historic properties
through the introduction of new visual features or damage from construction vibration. Construction
vibration impacts would be avoided with the implementation of the vibration mitigation measures
described in Section 3.7, Noise and Vibration. Pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA, the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) concluded that this undertaking would have no effect on archaeological resources,
and no adverse effect on historic architectural resources or historic properties. The State Historic
Preservation Officer (SHPO) concurred with this determination on April 15, 2013 (refer to Appendix D).
No paleontological resources have been previously identified in the project area; however, the project
area is considered potentially sensitive for paleontological resources. Implementation of mitigation
measures would reduce potential impacts to unknown significant paleontological resources, should they
be discovered.
3.8.2

Affected Environment

Existing Setting
This section presents the potential cultural resources in the project area, and an overview of the study
area’s prehistory, ethnography, and history. The study area is defined as the project area and areas within
½ mile of the project area. Separate, more detailed technical reports describing the archaeological and
historical architectural resources in the project area have been prepared for the project, and are available
from WETA (URS, 2012b; URS and JRP Historical Consulting, 2012).
Prehistoric Background
Human settlement of the San Francisco Bay region is believed to have begun during the early Holocene
period, circa 10,000 years ago. At that time, the mean sea level was considerably lower than today, and
San Francisco Bay was more than 30 miles inland from the current-day coastline. Sea level rose, and by
8,000 years ago, marine waters began to inundate San Francisco Bay. Except for brief periods, the mean
sea level has been at or above its present level for approximately 6,000 years (Moratto, 1984:221-223).
The oldest evidence of human occupation in the San Francisco Bay region was documented in northern
Santa Clara County, where radiocarbon assaying has yielded dates of circa 8000 B.C. Evidence for more
recent occupations, however, is more common. Radiocarbon dates from several sites in the areas
surrounding and between San Francisco and Monterey bays range between circa 5000 and 2000 B.C.
Data from these sites indicate that sparse populations of hunter-gatherers occupied these areas before

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

2000 B.C. Between the years 2000 and 1000 B.C., bayshore- and marsh-adapted peoples began to settle
in the Bay Area. By circa 1500 B.C., Utian people had settled the area around the southern end of San
Francisco Bay, from which they expanded to the north, west, and south. By circa 500 B.C., Costanoan
peoples occupied essentially the same territory that they would until Euro-American contact (Moratto,
1984:279).
Ethnographic Background
The project area is situated in lands occupied during the ethnographic period by speakers of Ramaytush or
San Francisco Costanoan. The territory inhabited by Costanoan peoples extended from the Carquinez
Strait southward to the Sur River, and from the Pacific coast eastward to the Diablo Range (Kroeber,
1976:462; Moratto, 1984:225). This area was significantly affected by the Spanish presence in
California. Between 1769 and 1776, seven Spanish expeditions entered the Costanoan lands; and by the
close of the eighteenth century, seven missions had been established. At the time of these early contacts,
approximately 10,000 Costanoan Indians existed, inhabiting roughly 50 politically autonomous tribelets.
By 1832, the Costanoan population had declined to fewer than 2,000 individuals. Most of the surviving
population relocated to the missions (Cook, 1943a, 1943b). The “missionized” Costanoan were often
forced to assimilate with individuals of other ethnic and/or linguistic affiliations, resulting in the
disruption of Native American cultural practices.
Levy estimated that in the early 1970s, the total number of persons of Costanoan descent was greater than
200 individuals (Levy, 1978:487). In 1971, descendants of the Costanoan incorporated as the Ohlone
Indian Tribe, and received title to the Ohlone Indian Cemetery. The Ohlone Indian Tribe was recently
officially recognized by the United States government.
Regional Historic Background
The Hispanic Period. The California coastline was familiar to navigators by the end of the sixteenth
century (Donley et al., 1979). Conversely, the interior remained unknown until the eighteenth century.
Initial European exploration of the project vicinity was initiated in 1769, and lasted until 1810. During
this period, a number of Spanish expeditions penetrated the territory occupied by the Costanoan peoples.
In the spring of 1776, the site of San Francisco was chosen by Anza for the establishment of a mission
and military post. Later that same year, the Mission San Francisco de Asís and Presidio de San Francisco
were officially dedicated, and Moraga (Anza’s lieutenant) took formal possession in the name of King
Carlos III (Hoover et al., 1990:331-334).
Jurisdiction over what is now California was established by Mexico in April 1822. During the Mexican
Period (1822 to 1848), control over this remote area by the central and local Mexican authorities was
never strong. Rather, the Mexican Period was one of a slow disintegration of control by the Mexican
government. In 1833, the mission lands were secularized, expropriated, and given out as private ranches
during the next decade in the form of land grants (Donley et al., 1979).
The American Period. A major factor leading to the disintegration of Mexican control of California was
pressure from the United States. Initial contacts were made by private citizens, who brought the news of
California back to the United States, helping trigger the immigration of United States citizens into
California. The Mexican government became increasingly agitated by the continued influx of United
States citizens into California.
The continued friction between Mexico and the United States ultimately led to the Mexican War of 1846
to 1847.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

California became part of the United States as a consequence of the United States victory over Mexico in
the war. The territory was formally ceded in the treaty of Guadelupe Hidalgo in 1848, and was admitted
as a state in 1850 (Beck and Haase, 1974; Bethel, 1969).
Prior to the discovery of gold at Sutter’s Mill on January 24, 1848, development in the area consisted of
the Spanish/Mexican facilities (i.e., the Presidio de San Francisco and Mission San Francisco de Asís)
and a small settlement known as Yerba Buena, situated on the shores of the cove of the same name. The
inhabitants of Yerba Buena were predominantly non-Spanish, English-speaking immigrants (e.g., United
States or British citizens). Sometime before the gold rush, the inhabitants of Yerba Buena officially
changed the name of their settlement to San Francisco. Following the discovery of gold, San Francisco
transformed rather quickly from an isolated hamlet into a bustling center of commerce (Hoover et al.,
1990:334-336; Kemble, 1957:7). According to historic accounts cited by Hupman and Chavez (Hupman
and Chavez, 1995:56), after the discovery of gold, the population of San Francisco grew from 375 people
in 1847 to 2,000 by February 1849, and by the end of 1849, there may have been as many as 20,000
people living in the city.
Historic Maritime Background
Although it is well-documented that aboriginal inhabitants of the region used watercraft constructed of
tule (Levy, 1978:406, 492), given the poor preservation qualities of this material, it is not anticipated that
such craft remain preserved in the submarine environment. Therefore, only a discussion of historic period
maritime activities is provided.
The Hispanic Period. Jose de Ortega may have observed the entrance to San Francisco Bay in 1769;
however, the first undisputed identification of the entrance by nonnative peoples occurred on
November 28, 1770, by the expedition of Pedro Fages. Entry into San Francisco Bay from the sea first
occurred in August of 1775, when Juan Manuel de Ayala began his 2-month-long nautical survey of San
Francisco Bay aboard the San Carlos (Beck and Haase, 1974:17).
With Mexico’s independence from Spain in 1821, previous trade restrictions enforced by the Spanish
were relaxed. Merchant vessels from the United States and Europe began freely entering San Francisco
Bay. In addition to the merchant vessels, an occasional whaler or man-of–war would enter San Francisco
Bay to restock provisions, including wood, food, and water (Kemble, 1957:1).
American Period. With the discovery of gold at Sutter’s Mill in 1848, ship traffic into San Francisco
Bay increased dramatically. By July 1850, more vessels entered San Francisco Bay than departed. Some
500 ships, inside and outside the anchorage, lay abandoned by their crews, who had deserted them in
hopes of finding a better life, mostly in the gold fields.
San Francisco became a major city and port almost overnight and grew at a phenomenal rate, replacing
Monterey as the coast’s principal port. Large docks were built so that cargo could be discharged directly
onto the wharves instead of being ferried by rowboats to shore. From those docks, the cargo was
distributed and sometimes reloaded onto smaller vessels to transport to various settlements.
In the 1850s, commercial fishing in San Francisco Bay began with whaling and salmon fishing.
Throughout California’s coastal waters, shrimp were harvested and sold. After 1870, shrimp fishing
evolved into a major industry along the shores of San Pablo and San Francisco bays. Approximately 26
fishing camps or villages have been recorded in this region. During the 1870s, a significant expansion of
the fishing industry occurred due to the increased immigration of fisherman from Italy, Greece, China,
and Portugal. By the beginning of the twentieth century, the staple yields of the fishing industry were
salmon, crabs, cod, and oysters (Hart, 1978).

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Ferry enterprises traveling to Oakland, San Pablo Bay, and San Francisco flourished during the late
nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century. San Francisco Bay was a transportation
corridor for both local and international traffic. During the early part of the American period, the ferries
united the sparsely populated rural communities and ranches with San Francisco. By the early 1870s, the
railroad companies owned the ferries operating on San Francisco Bay. As communities in the area grew
larger, local trade produced a demand for more frequent ferry schedules and for inter-urban lines to feed
the ferry terminals. Despite all this success, the needs of the Bay Area were rapidly changing. Most ferry
service ceased in 1939 with the completion of several bridges spanning San Francisco Bay, and the
opening of the Bay Bridge to electric trains.
Methods for Identifying Existing Conditions in the Study Area
A number of tasks, including archival research, Native American consultation, and archaeological field
inventory efforts, have been completed to determine whether any cultural resources have been previously
identified in or adjacent to the project area, as well as to identify previous cultural resources
investigations. Archival research consisted of a literature review and record search of ethnographic and
historic literature and maps; federal, state, and local inventories of historic properties; archaeological base
maps and site records; and survey reports on file at the Northwest Information Center (NWIC) at Sonoma
State University. The NWIC is a regional clearinghouse of the California Historic Resources Information
System, an arm of California’s Office of Historic Preservation. The purpose of the record search was to
ascertain whether any cultural resources had been previously identified in or adjacent to the project area,
as well as to identify previous cultural resources investigations. In addition, archival research was
conducted in various repositories and online resources, including: San Francisco Planning Department;
the San Francisco Public Library; the California State Library in Sacramento; Shields Library at the
University of California, Davis; and Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley. Lastly,
the shipwreck database maintained by the California State Lands Commission (SLC) was used to
augment the data obtained for these unique resources.
A request for a review of the Sacred Lands File was submitted to the Native American Heritage
Commission (NAHC) to gather information on the presence of resources important to the local Native
American community. In addition, the NAHC provided a list of contacts, all of whom were notified about
the project; and information on their concerns and/or knowledge of resources in the area was requested.
Lastly, both archaeological and historic architectural field visits to the project area were undertaken. The
archaeological component was limited to a cursory visit of the Archaeological APE, because the APE
either consists of open water, or San Francisco Ferry Building (Ferry Building) development constructed
over open water. The historic architectural component, as will be described below, included an inventory
of historic structures in the APE for architectural resources, as defined for the project.
Archaeology Existing Conditions
The APE as defined for archaeological resources (Archaeological APE), shown on Figure 3.8-1, includes all
areas where direct impacts to archaeological resources could occur as a result of project activities. The
Archaeological APE comprises those areas where ground-disturbing activities associated with project
implementation would occur, and is confined to the area east of The Embarcadero, south of Pier 1, and north of
Pier 14. This area is currently inundated by the waters of San Francisco Bay, with structures (e.g., piers) built
over the water in the western extent of the Archaeological APE. Pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA, FTA
initiated consultation with SHPO on June 4, 2012, regarding the delineation of the APE for archaeological
resources. The SHPO concurred with the FTA delineation of the APE on September 13, 2012.
A review of the Sacred Lands File by the staff of the NAHC failed to identify specific information
concerning areas in the Archaeological APE. The NAHC provided a list of groups and individuals who

could have an interest in the project area. The Native American groups and individuals identified by the
NAHC were contacted, and any information or concerns they might have regarding the project was
requested. As of June 2012, no responses have been received from the Native American community
concerning cultural resources in the Archaeological APE.
The record search completed by the staff of the NWIC revealed that no archaeological resources have
been identified in the Archaeological APE. There are several archaeological sites, both prehistoric and
historic, within ½ mile of the APE. All, however, are landside of the seawall and not in the
Archaeological APE. Although no archaeological resources have been previously identified in the APE,
it is not because there have been no past studies in the area. The record search revealed that numerous
cultural resources investigations have occurred in the vicinity, a few of which included portions of the
Archaeological APE, as listed in Table 3.8-1.

The title to all abandoned shipwrecks, archaeological sites, and historic or cultural resources on or in the
tide and submerged lands of California is vested in the State and under the jurisdiction of the SLC. The
online SLC Shipwreck Database (SLC, 2011) was reviewed. The SLC database is a list of shipwrecks by
county, and is based primarily on historical accounts of these incidents. It should be noted that most of
the location data thus refer to where the ship went down and not necessarily where it came to rest on the
sea floor, which may be in a different location. Figure 3.8-2 depicts the location of the reported
shipwrecks. Table 3.8-2 lists the reported shipwrecks in the general vicinity of the Archaeological APE.

As shown on Figure 3.8-2, the purported locations of two historic shipwrecks, the Alice Garrett and West
Wind, occur in close proximity to the Archaeological APE. A third wreck, the Helen Hensley, occurs
immediately to the north.
It should be noted that the SLC database does not indicate whether the wrecked vessel was ultimately
salvaged. Given the close proximity of these wrecks to the historic shoreline, it would seem likely that
these vessels would have been salvaged or at least demolished, because they would have represented
navigational hazards to the ship traffic that was prevalent in this area. It is assumed that repeated
dredging has historically taken place in the project area to accommodate the facilities and historic ship
traffic in the project area, and that this dredging would have likely dislodged any remnants of these
vessels if they remained in these locations in the twentieth century. Lastly, none of the cultural resources
studies listed in Table 3.8-1 identified these shipwrecks as potential resources during their investigations.
Therefore, it is unlikely that these shipwrecks are present in the Archaeological APE for the project.
Historic Architecture Existing Conditions
The Architectural APE, shown on Figure 3.8-3, was established to include any historic-period building,
structure, or object that may be directly or indirectly affected by implementation of the project. The
general Architectural APE includes the entire Port of San Francisco (Port) Embarcadero Historic District
(Embarcadero Historic District) to account for potential indirect effects. As shown on Figure 3.8-4, the
Focused Architectural APE coincides with the project area boundary line where it runs north to south
along the eastern edge (northbound lane) of The Embarcadero. On the northern and southern boundaries,
the Focused Architectural APE goes beyond the project areas to encompass Piers 1 and 14, both of which
are in the viewshed of proposed project elements, to account for potential indirect effects. Together, the
general Architectural APE and the Focused Architectural APE account for all the historic properties
intersected by the project, and encompass the historic properties immediately adjacent to the project that
could potentially experience indirect effects, such as vibration, noise, or visual effects. Pursuant to
Section 106 of the NHPA, FTA initiated consultation with the SHPO on June 4, 2012, regarding the
delineation of the APE for historical architectural resources. The SHPO concurred with the FTA delineation
of the APE on September 13, 2012.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

The record search conducted by NWIC revealed that there are several historic properties in the Focused
Architectural APE that are listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Two historic
districts encompass or overlap in the Focused Architectural APE: the Embarcadero Historic District; and
the Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District. In addition to contributing to one or both of these
districts, three properties in the Focused Architectural APE—the Ferry Building, Agriculture Building,
and Pier 1—are also listed individually in the NRHP and the California Register of Historical Resources
(CRHR). The “New Seawall” is also listed as a contributor of the Embarcadero Historic District, but is
not individually significant.1
The following studies and documents pertinent to the resources in the Focused Architectural APE were
provided by the Water Emergency Transportation Authority (WETA), the NRHP/National Historic
Landmark Archives in Washington, DC, and from the records search completed at the NWIC. The City
of San Francisco Historical Landmarks List (Historic Preservation Commission, n.d.) was also consulted,
which indicated that the Ferry Building is designated City Landmark #90.

The list of known historic properties with the Focused Architectural APE and the eligibility status of
those properties is presented in Table 3.8-3 (on the following page).
The Focused Architectural APE for this project also contains several buildings and structures that were
built fewer than 50 years ago (i.e., after 1962). 2 These include: the Ferry Plaza and Golden Gate Ferry
Terminal Building, Pier 2, Sinbad’s Restaurant, and Pier 14, all of which were built in the 1970s or later. 3
These buildings and structures would not be considered historic properties due to their age.
JRP Historical Consulting, LLC visited the project site and Focused Architectural APE on April 19 and
May 26, 2011, to verify the presence of known historic properties, and to update and confirm the
adequacy of the previous evaluations.

The Cultural Resources section of the Technical Appendices for the Final Program Environmental Impact Report for the
Expansion of Ferry Transit Service in the Bay Area, prepared by URS Corporation for the Water Transit Authority in June
2003, notes that the Ferry Building rests on the eastern side of the “New Seawall,” which that study concluded had the
potential to be eligible for the NRHP. The reference is to San Francisco’s second great seawall, which was built incrementally
between 1878 and 1915 to replace an earlier structure—the “Old Seawall.” In 2006, the entire New Seawall, including the
segment within the project area, was identified as a contributor to the Port of San Francisco Embarcadero Historic District,
which was subsequently listed on the NRHP (Corbett et al., 2006).
Construction dates for these resources were ascertained through review of documents obtained through the record search,
historic and current U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps, and historic aerial photography. Historic aerial photographs of
the study area from 1931 through 2005 were viewed online at historicaerials.com.
The Secretary of the Interior guidelines for evaluation of NRHP eligibility is for buildings, structures or features 50 years of
age or older to allow for adequate historical perspective.

The 1977 NRHP nomination did not specify a period of significance for the Ferry Building. As a contributing element of
the Port of San Francisco Embarcadero Historic District (January 2006), the Ferry Building has a period of significance
from its initial occupation in 1898 to 1946, for its contribution to transportation and engineering; and from 1898 to 1903 for
its neo-classical Beaux Arts style.

Historic Properties in the Focused Architectural APE
The Focused Architectural APE for this project is along the waterfront at the foot of Market Street, on the
stretch of San Francisco’s Embarcadero between Washington Street and just south of Mission Street
(Figure 3.8-4). Although the Focused APE covers only a small proportion of the city’s nearly 3-milelong Embarcadero, it contains historic-period built environment features that date from the earliest phases
of The Embarcadero’s development—namely a circa 1880s section of “New Seawall”—and well into the
twentieth century. The number of resources listed on the NRHP, built over a period spanning more than
half a century, reflects the site’s long history as one of San Francisco’s principal transportation hubs. In
addition to including several resources that contribute to the Embarcadero Historic District, the Focused

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Architectural APE also includes three buildings and related structures that are individually listed (see
Table 3.8-3).
The following sections summarize the NRHP and CRHR eligibility status of the historic-period buildings
and structures that have been identified in the Focused Architectural APE for the project.
Port of San Francisco Embarcadero Historic District
The Embarcadero Historic District stretches nearly 3 miles along San Francisco’s waterfront, from
Pier 45 on the north to Pier 48 on the south (Figure 3.8-3). The National Park Service listed the district
on the NRHP on May 12, 2006 (NRHP Property #06000372), at which time it was automatically placed
on the CRHR. The Embarcadero Historic District was determined significant under NRHP Criteria A, B,
and C.
The district represents a rare surviving example of the once common “break bulk” type of port, which
employed the traditional method of cargo handing (in contrast to modern containerization), in which
individual boxes, crates, barrels, and the like are loaded and unloaded individually using cranes, winches,
and other devices. The district consists of 47 contributing resources that include several elements
common to break bulk ports: a seawall; bulkhead wharfs; and piers and their related buildings, including
bulkhead buildings, transit sheds, and other small structures (Corbett et al., 2006, Section 7).
The district boundaries were drawn to include the major waterfront features, so that the inshore line
follows the inside edge of the top of the seawall, defined more or less by the façades of the buildings built
along The Embarcadero. The outshore line is drawn to include the buildings, piers, seawall, and portions
of the bulkhead wharf that are contributors to the district; it follows the edges of these structures and
excludes the water basins and noncontributing structures between them. The district is discontiguous,
divided in two sections by China Basin, a water channel near the southern end of the district (Corbett et
al., 2006, Section 10).
The seawall (sometimes referred to as the “New Seawall”) and associated bulkhead wharf segments were
evaluated for the first time as part of the Embarcadero Historic District study and are listed as
contributing elements. The construction histories and character-defining features of the sections of these
resources in the APE are summarized below.
Also within the boundaries of the Embarcadero Historic District are four properties that were previously
listed in the NRHP, all of which are wholly or in part within the Focused Architectural APE: the Ferry
Building (listed December 1, 1978, NRHP Property #78000760); the Agriculture Building (listed
December 1, 1978, NRHP Property #78000756); Pier 1, listed individually (January 5, 1999, NRHP
Property #98001551); and the Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District, including Piers 1, 1½, 3, and 5
(listed November 20, 2002, NRHP Property #02001390). These resources are described in further detail
below.
Seawall and Bulkhead Wharf
The seawall is “a linear embankment of stone, concrete, and wood, which defines San Francisco’s
waterfront for more than 3 miles along a curving line from the foot of Jones Street on the north (Pier 45)
to the mouth of China Basin on the east, and for an additional 500 feet south of China Basin (to Pier 48)”
(Corbett et al., 2006, Section 7). The seawall is a contributing element of the Embarcadero Historic
District and unifies the physical form of the district. Within the APE—and in fact throughout most of the
Embarcadero Historic District—the seawall is obscured from view by the bulkhead wharves and piers
built on top of it, but construction records show that it consists of an embankment of rocks set in a trench
with sides that rise to a flat top. Because the seawall was built incrementally from 1878 through 1915,

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

with design variations from section to section, there are some dimensional differences, such as the width
of the base trench, the embankment height, and the crown width.
Attached to the crest of the seawall and cantilevered into San Francisco Bay are the bulkhead wharf
structures. Like the seawall, the bulkhead wharf is a linear feature consisting of separately built structures
that connect end to end throughout the length of the historic district. They are horizontal platforms that
rest on piles driven vertically into the seawall embankment as far as the waterfront line, which is defined
by the toe of the seawall. The portions of the bulkhead wharf that contribute to the historic district date to
the district’s period of significance—and serve as the constructed edge of the waterfront between the
piers—act as a supporting structure of buildings, and allow access between pier/transit sheds, berthed
vessels, and The Embarcadero (see Figure 3.8-5).
Piers are also pile-supported horizontal platforms but unlike bulkhead wharves, they typically extend
perpendicularly into San Francisco Bay and include three components: the pier substructure (consisting
of pilings, caps that span the pilings, and a deck that rests on the caps); a transit shed (an enclosed
warehouse building that rests on and covers most of the pier deck); and a bulkhead building (an enclosed
building, usually used to house offices or passenger facilities, that rests on the bulkhead wharf and faces
The Embarcadero) (Corbett et al., 2006, Section 7:81).
The relationship of the seawall, bulkhead wharf, and pier buildings is shown on Figure 3.8-5.
For the purposes of organization and to follow historical naming conventions, the authors of the
Embarcadero Historic District study identified the various sections of the seawall and attached bulkhead
wharf according to section number, listed in ascending order from north to south (Corbett et al., 2006,
Section 7:19). The four portions of seawall and bulkhead wharf that are fully or partially in the Focused
Architectural APE are Sections 7, 8a, 8b, 8, and 9a, as shown on Figure 3.8-5. Section 9a is not a
contributing feature of the historic district due to loss of integrity.
Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District
The Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District, whose contributing elements are Piers 1, 1½, 3, and 5, is
along San Francisco’s northeastern waterfront, immediately north of the Ferry Building (Figure 3.8-5).
The National Park Service listed the district on NRHP on November 20, 2002 (NRHP Property
#02001390), at which time it was automatically placed on the CRHR.
The Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District was determined significant under NRHP Criterion A at
the state level, for its association with commerce and transportation in San Francisco. 4 The district is also
eligible under Criterion C on the local level, as one of the two largest remaining pier groups on the
Northeast Waterfront conveying the original Beaux Arts design that characterized San Francisco’s
waterfront in the early twentieth century.
The district boundary was drawn to encompass the contributing features, which are all along the eastern
side of The Embarcadero between Washington Street and Broadway (see Figure 3.8-3).
Each of the four contributing piers was originally composed of three parts (although not all of the original
elements survive): a bulkhead building, along The Embarcadero with a west-facing façade; the pier
structure extending into San Francisco Bay; and a transit shed built atop the pier structure. The bulkhead
buildings on Piers 1, 1½, 3, and 5 all survive and share character-defining features.

The Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District is entirely within the boundaries of the Port of San Francisco Embarcadero
Historic District. The Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District was nominated first, and the Port of San Francisco
Embarcadero Historic District was nominated later to expand the Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District; however, both
districts and district boundaries remained.

Piers 1, 1½, 3, and 5 are built on a portion of seawall constructed in 1889, which is a contributing element
to the Embarcadero Historic District (2006), as discussed below.
In addition to contributing to both the Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District and Embarcadero
Historic District, Pier 1 is also individually listed on the NRHP. The individual resource is discussed in
further detail below.
Pier 1
Pier 1 is on the eastern side of The Embarcadero at the foot of Washington Street (Figures 3.8-3
and 3.8-4). The pier was completed in 1931 and includes the bulkhead building along The Embarcadero,
the utilitarian transit shed on the San Francisco Bay side, and the finger pier upon which the transit shed
is built. Pier 1 is the southernmost of a continuous façade consisting of the Pier 1, Pier 1½, and Pier 3
bulkhead buildings. The National Park Service listed Pier 1 on the NRHP on January 5, 1999 (NRHP
Property #98001551), at which time it was automatically placed on the CRHR.
Pier 1 was determined significant under NRHP Criterion A at the state level, for its association with San
Francisco maritime commerce and transportation. It is also significant under Criterion C in the area of
architecture, as an important example of the neo-classical architecture used by the California State Harbor
Commissioners’ 1915 City Beautiful-inspired plan. The property boundary is the footprint of the pier
structure and bulkhead building, encompassing an area of 118,313 square feet.
Pier 1 was rehabilitated during 2001 to 2002 to serve as Port and private business offices. The work was
completed as a federal historic tax credit project, using the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation. The project included rebuilding the deck apron, filling the interior of the transit shed for
adaptive reuse, seismic repairs, and construction of a wharf between the bulkhead wharf and south apron.
Original wood fender pilings were retained on the southern side of the pier (Thatcher, 2000a, 2000b,
2001; Page & Turnbull, 2002). The character-defining features on the exterior of the building remain
essentially the same as described in the 1998 nomination.
Pier 1 is also a contributing element to both the Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District and the
Embarcadero Historic District (see descriptions above).
Ferry Building (Union Ferry Depot Building)
The Ferry Building, known originally as the Union Ferry Depot Building, is on The Embarcadero at the
foot of Market Street (Figure 3.8-3). Constructed from 1895 to 1903, the Ferry Building was one of the
busiest transportation points on the Pacific Coast until the decline of water transit traffic following the
completion of the Bay Bridge in 1937. The Ferry Building was listed on the NRHP on December 1,
1978. The property boundary is the footprint of the building, encompassing an area of 120,716 square
feet (NRHP Property #78000760) (McGuire, 1977).
The original nomination form did not specify under which NRHP criteria the Ferry Building was eligible,
nor did it establish a period of significance for the property. Its eligibility was clarified when it was
identified as a contributing element of the Embarcadero Historic District (Corbett et al, 2006). The Ferry
Building is significant under NRHP Criterion A at the national level, in the area of transportation, with a
period of significance from its initial occupation in 1898; to 1946, which marked the dramatic decline of
shipping activity after World War II. Under Criterion C, the building is also significant in engineering for
its reinforced concrete design that withstood the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake, and as an important
local example of the neo-classical Beaux Arts style.
During the 1950s, the Ferry Building was extensively remodeled to include office space. Beginning in
1998 and completed in 2003, the Ferry Building was renovated and redeveloped as a mixed-use property,

following the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. The project restored many original
features and removed other historically unsympathetic materials and design elements, thus returning the
building to a closer approximation of its original appearance, but also changing several features present at
the time it was described for listing in the NRHP in 1978. Many of the building’s basic characterdefining features were retained or refurbished.
Most of the changes from the renovation were to the building’s interior and east (Bayside) façade. The
ground floor level was converted to a public foods marketplace, with thirty 8-foot-tall gates lining the
nave, each of which opens to an individual shop. The upstairs level includes rows of office space.
The exterior changes to the building since 1978 are mostly confined to the eastern side, which at that time
had been substantially altered from its original appearance. The renovation project replaced the existing
eastern façade in its entirety with a 10-foot-deep cantilevered metal extension that runs the length of the
façade, and includes a continuous row of 11-foot-tall arched windows that “provide[s] a modern
interpretation of the windows that once admitted light into the second floor waiting rooms.” At the foot
of the building on this façade is a new, 30-foot-wide wharf for pedestrian foot traffic.
The Ferry Building is also a contributing element to the Embarcadero Historic District (Corbett et al,
2006). The Ferry Building was designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the
American Society of Civil Engineers in November 1975, and a San Francisco City Landmark #90 in
1977.
Agriculture Building (Ferry Station Post Office Building)
The Agriculture Building, originally known as the Ferry Station Post Office Building, is on The
Embarcadero at the foot of Mission Street (Figures 3.8-3 and 3.8-4). It was built in 1915; and until 1925,
it served as a post office, after which it was occupied by Southern Pacific and other companies. By 1933,
it was occupied by the Department of Agriculture, and became known as the “Agriculture Building.” The
National Park Service listed the building in the NRHP on December 1, 1978. The property boundary is
the footprint of the building, encompassing an area of 25,238 square feet (NRHP Property #78000756)
(McGuire, 1978).
The Agriculture Building was determined significant under NRHP Criterion A at the local level, for its
association with the centralization of San Francisco’s postal system; and under Criterion C, in the area of
architecture, as a surviving example of the Mediterranean-style government architecture designed by the
California State Harbor Commissioner.
The Agriculture Building is a Mediterranean-style, two-story, steel-frame building on a granite base, with
tile hip roof. Character-defining features include red brick Flemish bond, light-ochre terra cotta trim and
surrounds around entries, upper beltcourse, copper cornice, wood casement windows, iron doors, and
door and window pattern. A field check confirmed that the exterior of the building remains essentially
the same as described in the 1978 nomination.
The Agriculture Building is also a contributing element to the Embarcadero Historic District, discussed
above.
Paleontological Setting and Assessment
Paleontological resources are fossils (the remains of ancient plants and animals) and trace fossils (such as
burrows or tracks) that can provide scientifically significant information on the history of life on earth.
Assessments of the scientific significance of these remains are based on whether they can provide data on
the taxonomy and phylogeny of ancient organisms, the paleoecology and nature of paleoenvironments in
the geologic past, or the stratigraphy and age of geologic units. Fossils need not be mineralized to be of

Consequences, and Mitigation

scientific significance.
In areas dominated by geologically recent sedimentation in estuarine
environments (as is the case in the vicinity of the current project area), the remains of extinct Pleistocene
fauna are preserved due to anaerobic (oxygen-free) conditions, and are usually unaltered and not
mineralized.
This section describes the paleontological resources potential of the project area. It complies with
standards and guidelines recommended by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (SVP) (SVP, 1995).
The SVP, an international scientific organization of professional vertebrate paleontologists, has developed
guidelines that outline acceptable professional practices in the conduct of paleontological resource
assessments; these guidelines are the standard against which paleontological regulatory compliance
programs are evaluated.
For undertakings that require compliance with regulations for the management of paleontological
resources, SVP guidelines recommend having literature and museum archival reviews, and a field survey.
Geology and Stratigraphy
The geologic setting of San Francisco Bay, including the project area, is described in Section 3.13,
Geology, Soils, and Seismicity. The vicinity of the project area has been developed over the years by
artificially filling the waterfront and constructing various seawalls to enable construction of piers,
buildings, and roadways. Numerous geotechnical borings have been drilled and sampled to evaluate
subsurface conditions at the location of the Ferry Building, the Muni Metro Turnaround, piers, and
potential commercial buildings. In general, the landward boundary of the project area is along the
seawall. The waterside portion of the site is underlain by relatively soft recent deposits (Young Bay Mud)
on the order of 100 feet thick, overlying a thin accumulation of Bay sediments (i.e., Merritt Sand) and Old
Bay Mud at an approximate thickness of 60 feet. Bedrock of the Franciscan Assemblage is at a depth of
approximately 250 feet below the mudline (bottom of Bay).
For the paleontological analysis, sensitivity ratings are presented of those underlying strata that could be
encountered during project implementation. As proposed, the project would require the installation of
piles though the Young Bay Mud and into the underlying Merritt Sand and Old Bay Mud. No elements
of the project would extend to the depth of the underlying bedrock. Therefore, the paleontological
sensitivity of the Young Bay Mud, Merritt Sand, and Old Bay Mud are relevant for the project. The
paleontological sensitivity ratings of the strata found to be in the project vicinity are based on the
available literature, and on the known geologic process that led to their formation.
Young Bay Mud. Numerous Late Pleistocene and Holocene fossils have been reported from sediments
referred to as San Antonio Formations in the San Francisco area, the marine facies of which appear to be
represented by the Young Bay Mud. Fossils recovered from such sediments at sites in the area around San
Francisco Bay include microfossils useful in paleoenvironmental reconstructions (radiolaria, foraminifera,
sponge spicules, coccoliths, diatoms, dinoflagellates, pollen, and spores) (Atwater et al., 1977; McGann et
al., n.d.; Sloan, 1992). Schlocker has also reported fossil plant remains from sediments he referred to as
“Bay mud and clay” (Schlocker, 1974), while Bonilla reported fossil shells and plant remains from what he
termed “Bay Mud” (Bonilla, 1971). More recently, Fisk recovered abundant fossil mollusk shells from
cores retrieved from Young Bay Mud at depths of approximately 20 and 25 feet (Fisk, 2004).
The record search revealed that sediments commonly referred to as Young Bay Mud have produced
numerous significant plant, invertebrate, and vertebrate fossils at numerous previously recorded fossil
sites. Several previously recorded fossil localities are recorded in the San Francisco waterfront, including
sites containing vertebrate fossils within the limits of the Islais Creek estuary. In addition, abundant fossil
mollusks were observed in such sediments by Fisk in the Potrero Point vicinity (Fisk, 2004). The
presence of these previously recorded fossil sites in nearby Late Pleistocene to early Holocene sediments
suggests that Young Bay Mud in the project area is potentially sensitive for paleontological resources.

Merritt Sand and Old Bay Mud. These Late Pleistocene sediments date to the Last Interglaciation
(circa 128,000 and 75,000 years ago) during which, for part of this time, sea level was actually higher
than the present by 6.5 to 10 feet. Significant marine and terrestrial fossils have been previously
recovered from these strata, including by Rodda and Baghai who reported bones and teeth of mammoth
and extinct bison from sands and clays unconformably overlying the Franciscan Complex in downtown
San Francisco (Rodda and Baghai, 1993). Marine facies, including some units identified as the Merritt
Sand, have produced marine megafossils, marine and nonmarine diatoms, and sponge spicules
(Schlocker, 1974). Fossil mollusk shell fragments were recovered from a geotechnical sample in what
Fisk identified as Merritt Sand (Fisk, 2004). This geotechnical boring was from the Potrero Point
vicinity, approximately 2.6 miles south of the project area. In addition, Radbruch and Schlocker reported
the recovery of fossils from borings in the Islais Creek area (approximately 3.6 miles south of project
area), in sediment identified as Old Bay Mud. Radbruch and Schlocker also reported the discovery of
fossil plants and mollusk fossils in an excavation at the Southeast Sewage Treatment Plant (now known
as the Southeast Water Pollution Control Plant (Radbruch and Schlocker, 1958).
The record search has revealed that the Merritt Sand and Old Bay Mud have produced significant fossils
at numerous previously recorded fossil localities in the Bay Area, including in a geotechnical borehole
south of the project area near Potrero Point (Fisk, 2004). The presence of these fossil sites suggests that
Merritt Sand and Old Bay Mud in project area are potentially sensitive for paleontological resources.
Regulatory Setting
Cultural resources are defined as buildings, sites, structures, or objects, each of which may have historical,
architectural, archaeological, cultural, or scientific importance. Numerous laws, regulations, and statutes, on
both the federal and state levels, seek to protect and target the management of cultural resources.
Federal
Historic Sites Act (1935)
The Historic Sites Act, regulated at 16 United States Code (USC) 461 et seq., declares a national policy to
preserve historic sites, buildings, antiquities, and objects of national significance, including those located
on refuges. The Historic Sites Act provides procedures for designation, acquisition, administration, and
protection of such sites.
National Historic Preservation Act, as Amended (1966)
The NHPA declares federal policy to protect historic sites and values in cooperation with other nations,
states, and local governments. The NHPA establishes a program of grants to assist states for historic
preservation activities. Subsequent amendments designated the SHPO as the individual responsible for
administering state-level programs. The act also created the President’s Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation (ACHP). Federal agencies are required to consider the effects of their undertakings on
historic resources, and to give the ACHP a reasonable opportunity to comment on those undertakings. A
lead federal agency will be responsible for project compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA and its
implementing regulations, set forth by the ACHP at 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.
National Environmental Policy Act, as Amended (1969)
Under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 USC Sections 4321-4327, federal agencies are
required to consider potential environmental impacts and appropriate mitigation measures for projects
with federal involvement. The Council on Environmental Quality NEPA regulations state that an
environmental impact statement (EIS) shall include, among other analysis topics, discussions of historic
and cultural resources (40 CFR 1502.16). In addition, FTA NEPA regulations require a Final EIS that

Consequences, and Mitigation

documents compliance with all applicable laws (23 CFR 771.125[a][1]).
This regulation is
complemented by the Section 106 NHPA regulations, which encourage agencies to coordinate
Section 106 compliance with the NEPA process, and to meet the purposes and requirements of both
statutes in a timely and efficient manner (36 CFR 800.8).
Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act (1974)
Under 16 USC 469-469c, the Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act requires federal agencies to
provide notice to the Secretary of the Interior of any dam constructions or alterations of terrain and, if
archaeological resources are found, for recovery or salvage of them. The law applies to any agency
whenever it receives information that a direct or federally assisted activity could cause irreparable harm to
prehistoric, historic, or archaeological data. Up to 1 percent of project funds could be used to pay for
salvage work. The NHPA also authorized additional funding to be availed for this purpose.
American Indian Religious Freedom Act (1978)
The American Indian Religious Freedom Act, 42 USC 1996, et seq., regulated under 43 CFR 7, has been
established to protect religious practices, ethnic heritage sites, and land uses of Native Americans. It
directs various federal departments, agencies, and other instrumentalities responsible for administering
relevant laws to evaluate their policies and procedures in consultation with Native American traditional
religious leaders, to determine changes necessary to protect and preserve Native American cultural and
religious practices.
Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) (1979)
ARPA supplements the provisions of the Antiquities Act of 1906, and declares it illegal to excavate or
remove from federal or Native American lands any archaeological resources without a permit from the
land manager (or federal agency with jurisdiction over those lands). ARPA would also apply to
underwater cultural resources if they are found in locations under federal jurisdiction.
Submerged Lands Act (1953)
This act is largely superseded by the Abandoned Shipwreck Act, but has been used by states to protect
abandoned historic shipwrecks by citing various state-level historic preservation laws. The Submerged
Lands Act established state jurisdiction over offshore lands within 3 miles of shore (or 3 marine leagues
for Texas and the Gulf coast of Florida).
Abandoned Shipwreck Act (1987)
The Abandoned Shipwreck Act, 43 USC 2101–2106, is a federal-level legislative act, but it does protect
shipwrecks found in state waters. The Abandoned Shipwreck Act also states that the laws of salvage and
finds do not apply to abandoned shipwrecks protected by the act. Under the Abandoned Shipwreck Act,
the United States asserts title to abandoned shipwrecks in state waters that are either:




Embedded in state-submerged lands;
Embedded in the coralline formations protected by a state on submerged lands; or
Resting on state-submerged lands and are either included in or determined eligible for the NRHP.

The Abandoned Shipwreck Act also has a provision for the simultaneous transfer, by the federal
government, of title for those abandoned shipwrecks to the state(s) in whose waters the wrecks are located.

State
CEQA and CEQA Guidelines
In California, cultural resources include archaeological and historical objects, sites and districts, historic
buildings and structures, cultural landscapes, and sites and resources of concern to local Native American
and other ethnic groups. CEQA Section 21084.1 defines a historic resource under CEQA, and the level of
change that would cause a significant effect on a historic resource. Compliance procedures are set forth
in CEQA Guidelines Sections 15064.5 and 15126.4.
At the state level, consideration of significance as an “important archaeological resource” is measured by
cultural resource provisions considered under CEQA Section 21084.1 and CEQA Guidelines
Sections 15064.5 and 15126.4(b), and the draft criteria regarding resource eligibility to the CRHR.
Section 15064.5 of the CEQA Guidelines also assigns special importance to human remains and specifies
procedures to be used when Native American remains are discovered. These procedures are detailed
under California Public Resources Code (PRC) Section 5097.98.
California Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (2001)
In the California Health and Safety Code, Division 7, Part 2, Chapter 5 (Sections 8010-8030) 5, broad
provisions are made for the protection of Native American cultural resources. The act sets the state policy
to ensure that all California Native American human remains and cultural items are treated with due
respect and dignity.
California Public Resources Code, Section 5020
This California code created the California Historic Landmarks Committee in 1939, and authorizes the
Department of Parks and Recreation to designate Registered Historical Landmarks and Registered Points
of Historical Interest.
California Public Resources Code, Section 5097.9
Procedures are detailed under PRC Section 5097.9, for actions taken whenever Native American remains
are discovered. No public agency, and no private party using or occupying public property, or operating
on public property, under a public license, permit, grant, lease, or contract made on or after July 1, 1977,
shall in any manner whatsoever interfere with the free expression or exercise of Native American religion
as provided in the United States Constitution and the California Constitution; nor shall any such agency
or party cause severe or irreparable damage to any Native American sanctified cemetery, place of
worship, religious or ceremonial site, or sacred shrine on public property, except on a clear and
convincing showing that the public interest and necessity so require.
California Public Resources Code, Section 7050.5
Every person who knowingly mutilates or disinters, wantonly disturbs, or willfully removes any human
remains in or from any location other than a dedicated cemetery without authority of law is guilty of a
misdemeanor, except as provided in Section 5097.99 of the PRC. In the event of discovery or recognition
of any human remains in any location other than a dedicated cemetery, there shall be no further
excavation or disturbance of the site, or any nearby area reasonably suspected to overlie adjacent remains,
until the coroner of the county in which the human remains are discovered has determined the remains to

the coroner recognizes the human remains to be those of a Native American or has reason to believe that
they are those of a Native American, he or she shall contact the NAHC by telephone within 24 hours.
California Public Resources Code, Section 7051
Every person who removes any part of any human remains from any place where it has been interred, or
from any place where it is deposited while awaiting interment or cremation, with intent to sell it or to
dissect it, without authority of law, or written permission of the person or persons having the right to
control the remains under Section 7100, or with malice or wantonness, has committed a public offense
that is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison.
Administrative Code, Title 14, Section 4307
Under this state preservation law, no person shall remove, injure, deface, or destroy any object of
paleontological, archaeological, or historical interest or value.
Local
San Francisco Historic Preservation Commission and Planning Code, Articles 10 and 11.
The Office of Historic Preservation has included the City and County of San Francisco on its list of
Certified Local Governments, which means that San Francisco has an approved historic preservation
ordinance, Historic Preservation Commission, and other formal processes related to historic preservation
and cultural resources management. Article 10 describes procedures regarding the preservation of sites
and areas of special character or special historical, architectural, or aesthetic interest or value, designated
as City Landmarks and included within locally designated historic districts. Article 11 of the Planning
Code designated six downtown conservation districts. The Ferry Building is designated as a landmark
pursuant to Article 10 of the Planning Code.
Port of San Francisco Review Procedures for Alterations to Historic Resources Port Commission
Resolution No. 04-89.
Port Commission Resolution 04-89 requires that all work in the Embarcadero Historic District be
consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. The
Waterfront Design Advisory Committee is responsible for design and architectural review of major Port
projects, and also reviews projects for consistency with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Historic Rehabilitation for alterations to designated historic resources and projects within historic
districts. This design review process would also be coordinated with other agencies with jurisdiction over
and expertise in areas along the waterfront, including the Bay Conservation and Development
Commission and, given the historic resources within the project area, the San Francisco Historic
Preservation Commission. The public is invited to participate in the design review process.
Significance Criteria for Evaluation of Cultural Resources
Federal Significance Criteria
The four evaluation criteria to determine a resource’s eligibility to the NRHP, in accordance with the
regulations outlined in 36 CFR 800, are identified at 36 CFR 60.4. These evaluation criteria, listed
below, are used to help determine what properties should be considered for protection from destruction or
impairment resulting from project-related activities (36 CFR 60.2).

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
(a) Resources that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
(b) Resources that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) Resources that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or
that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) Resources that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history
(36 CFR 60.4).
A property may also possess traditional cultural significance that may make it eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP. “Traditional” in this context refers to those beliefs, customs, and practices of a living community
of people that have been passed down through the generations, usually orally or through practice. The
traditional cultural significance of a historic property, then, is derived from the role the property plays in a
community’s historically rooted beliefs, customs, and practices. Examples of properties possessing such
significance include:


a location associated with the traditional beliefs of a Native American group about its origins, its
cultural history, or the nature of the world;



a rural community whose organization; buildings and structures; or patterns of land use reflect the
cultural traditions valued by its long-term residents;



an urban neighborhood that is the traditional home of a particular cultural group, and that reflects its
beliefs and practices;



a location where Native American religious practitioners have historically gone, and are known or
thought to go today, to perform ceremonial activities in accordance with traditional cultural rules of
practice; and



a location where a community has traditionally carried out economic, artistic, or other cultural
practices important in maintaining its historic identity.

A traditional cultural property, then, can be defined generally as one that is eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP because of its association with cultural practices or beliefs of a living community that: (a) are
rooted in that community’s history; and (b) are important in maintaining the continuing cultural identity
of the community.
State Significance Criteria
In considering impact significance under CEQA, the significance of the resource itself must first be
determined. At the state level, consideration of significance as a “historical resource” is measured by
cultural resource provisions considered under CEQA Sections 15064.5 and 15126.4, and the criteria
regarding resource eligibility to the CRHR.

R:\13 WETA\DTFX\Draft 0413\3_8_Cultural.docx

Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Generally, under CEQA, a historical resource (these include built-environment historic and prehistoric
archaeological resources) is considered significant if it meets the criteria for listing on the CRHR. These
criteria are set forth in CEQA Section 15064.5, and defined as any resource that:
(a) Is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
California’s history and cultural heritage;
(b) Is associated with lives of persons important in our past;
(c) Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of construction, or
represents the work of an important creative individual, or possesses high artistic values; or
(d) Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
Section 15064.5 of CEQA also assigns special importance to human remains and specifies procedures to
be used when Native American remains are discovered. These procedures are detailed under California
PRC Section 5097.98.
“Unique” archaeological resources are also considered under CEQA, as described under PRC 21083.2. A
unique archaeological resource implies an archaeological artifact, object, or site about which it can be
clearly demonstrated thatwithout merely adding to the current body of knowledgethere is a high
probability that it meets one of the following criteria:
(a) The archaeological artifact, object, or site contains information needed to answer important scientific
questions, and there is a demonstrable public interest in that information;
(b) The archaeological artifact, object, or site has a special and particular quality, such as being the oldest
of its type or the best available example of its type; or
(c) The archaeological artifact, object, or site is directly associated with a scientifically recognized
important prehistoric or historic event or person.
A nonunique archaeological resource indicates an archaeological artifact, object, or site that does not meet
the above criteria. Impacts to nonunique archaeological resources and resources which do not qualify for
listing on the CRHR receive no further consideration under CEQA.
Conformity of Federal and State Evaluation Criteria
The criteria for eligibility for the CRHR are very similar to those that qualify a property for the NRHP.
A property that is eligible for the NRHP is also eligible for the CRHR. All potential impacts to
significant resources for projects where there is federal agency involvement must be assessed and
addressed under the procedures of Section 106 of the NHPA, set forth at 36 CFR 800. All resources, with
the exception of isolate artifacts and isolate features that appear to lack integrity or data potential, will be
evaluated for significance.
3.8.3

Impact Evaluation

This impact evaluation assesses the potential for the project to affect the historic architectural properties
and resources and archaeological resources identified in Section 3.8.2 under applicable federal and state
laws. The evaluation complies with Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966, as amended, by applying the
Criteria of Adverse Effect, set forth in Title 36 CFR, Part 800.5, and following the guidelines for
documentation in 36 CFR 800.11, as they pertain to historic properties and archaeological resources in the
project APE. The analysis also satisfies the CEQA requirement that California public agencies identify
the significant environmental impacts of their actions as they pertain to historical resources. The CEQA
assessment has been prepared in compliance with Section 15064.5(a)-(b) of the CEQA Guidelines, using

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

the criteria outlined in Section 5024.1 of the California PRC. The impacts analysis includes
recommendations to avoid, minimize, or mitigate the identified impacts.
The criteria for determining an adverse effect under Section 106 are applied to assess what impacts an
undertaking would have on the historic integrity of a historic property, and how an undertaking would
affect those features of a historic property that contribute to its eligibility for listing in the NRHP.
Similarly, the criteria of significant impacts to historic resources under CEQA are applied to assess a
project’s impacts on the historic integrity of a historical resource, and whether the project impacts would
materially impair the historical significance of the resource. Under both sets of criteria, effects can be
direct, indirect, and cumulative. Direct effects include such actions as physical destruction or damage.
Indirect effects include the introduction of visual, auditory, or vibration impacts, as well as neglect of a
historic property. Cumulative effects are the impacts of the project taken into account with known past or
present projects, along with foreseeable future projects.
Definition of Effect and Criteria of Adverse Effect under Section 106
Section 106 regulations state that if there are historic properties in the APE that may be affected by a
federal undertaking, the agency official shall assess adverse effects, if any, in accordance with the Criteria
of Adverse Effect defined in 36 CFR 800.5. The definition of effect in that section states: “Effect means
alteration to the characteristics of a historic property qualifying it for inclusion in or eligibility for the
National Register.” An adverse effect occurs “when an undertaking may alter, directly or indirectly, any
of the characteristics of a historic property that qualify the property for inclusion in the National Register
in a manner that would diminish the integrity of the property’s location, design, setting, materials,
workmanship, feeling, or association . . . Adverse effects may include reasonably foreseeable effects
caused by the undertaking that may occur later in time, be farther removed in distance, or be
cumulative.” 6 Examples of adverse effects may include, but are not limited to, the following (36 CFR
800.5[a][2])[i through vii]:
i.

Physical destruction of or damage to all or part of the property;

ii. Alteration of a property, including restoration, rehabilitation, repair, maintenance, stabilization,
hazardous material remediation, and provision of handicapped access, that is not consistent with the
Secretary’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (36 CFR Part 68) and applicable
guidelines;
iii. Removal of property from its historic location;
iv. Change of the character of the property’s use or of physical features within the property’s setting that
contributes to its historic significance;
v. Introduction of visual, atmospheric, or audible elements that diminish the integrity of the property’s
significant historic features;
vi. Neglect of a property that causes its deterioration, except where such neglect and deterioration are
recognized qualities of a property of religious and cultural significance to an Indian tribe or Native
Hawaiian organization; and
vii. Transfer, lease, or sale of property out of federal ownership or control without adequate and legally
enforceable restrictions or conditions to ensure long-term preservation of the property’s historic
significance.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Definition and Criteria of Significant Impacts to Historic Resources under CEQA
The CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations, Chapter 3, beginning with
Section 15064.5(b), define significant impacts for historical resources as follows:
(1) Substantial adverse change in the significance of an historical resource means physical demolition,
destruction, relocation, or alteration of the resource or its immediate surroundings such that the
significance of an historical resource would be materially impaired.
(2) The significance of an historical resource is materially impaired when a project:
(A) Demolishes or materially alters in an adverse manner those physical characteristics of an
historical resource that convey its historical significance and that justify its inclusion in, or
eligibility for, inclusion in the CRHR; or
(B) Demolishes or materially alters in an adverse manner those physical characteristics that account
for its inclusion in a local register of historical resources pursuant to Section 5020.1(k) of the
PRC or its identification in an historical resources survey meeting the requirements of
Section 5024.1(g) of the PRC, unless the public agency reviewing the effects of the project
establishes by a preponderance of evidence that the resource is not historically or culturally
significant; or
(C) Demolishes or materially alters in an adverse manner those physical characteristics of a historical
resource that convey its historical significance and that justify its eligibility for inclusion in the
CRHR as determined by a lead agency for purposes of CEQA.
Therefore, the analysis of impacts to historic architectural and archaeological resources considered
whether the project would result in:


A substantial adverse change in the significance of an archaeological resource (prehistoric or historic)
that is either listed or eligible for listing on the NRHP, the CRHR, a local register of historic
resources, or is considered a unique archaeological resource;



Disturbance of any human remains (prehistoric or historic), including those interred outside of formal
cemeteries; or



A substantial adverse change in the significance of an historic architectural resource that is either
listed or eligible for listing on the NRHP, the CRHR, or a local register of historic resources.

Paleontological Resources
Paleontological resources, or fossils, have not been previously identified in the project area. However,
the Young Bay Mud, Merritt Sand, and Old Bay Mud in project area are potentially sensitive for
paleontological resources.
Based on the details of project construction, this section provides an assessment of the potential for the
project to impact significant paleontological resources. The analysis is conducted consistent with the
standards and guidelines recommended for the assessment and mitigation of impacts to paleontological
resources recommended by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (SVP, 1995).
Therefore, the analysis of impacts to paleontological resources considers whether the project would result
in disturbance or destruction of a sensitive and/or unique paleontological resource or site.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Direct Impacts
Those impacts (operational as well as construction-related) resulting in the disturbance or destruction of a
cultural or paleontological resource would be considered a direct impact, because the effect would be
permanent.
Impact 3.8-1: Substantial Adverse Change to NRHP and/or CRHR Listed, or Eligible to Be
Listed, or Unique Archaeological Resources
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no modifications would be made to the existing Downtown San
Francisco Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal) facilities to accommodate new or existing WETA services.
Therefore, the No Action Alternative would have no effect or impact to NRHP and/or CRHR Listed, or
Eligible to be Listed, or Unique Archaeological Resources.
Action Alternative
Implementation of the proposed project would include activities that would disturb the sediments in the
project area, potentially affecting archaeological resources in the Archaeological APE. Sedimentdisturbing activities would include initial dredging during construction; periodic maintenance dredging;
pile demolition and removal; and pile installation. There are no recorded archaeological resources—
NRHP and/or CRHR listed or eligible, unique, or otherwise—in the Archaeological APE for the project.
Therefore, the proposed project would have no impact on known archaeological resources.
Because dredging and other disturbances have occurred in the Archaeological APE historically, and
considering that the previous archaeological investigations in the immediate vicinity did not identify any
resources, it is unlikely that previously unidentified archaeological resources are present in the Archaeological
APE. However, there remains the potential that previously unidentified archaeological materials could be
inadvertently uncovered by project activities. Such inadvertently discovered archaeological sites could
represent NRHP and/or CRHR eligible or unique archaeological resources, and their disturbance could
adversely change their condition. Therefore, the inadvertent discovery of archaeological materials represents a
potential project impact. Implementation of Mitigation Measure CUL-1, Inadvertent Discovery Measures,
would reduce potential impacts to archaeological material by identifying the procedures to be followed in the
event that archaeological resources are exposed during project implementation.
Pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA, FTA concluded that this undertaking would have no effect on
archaeological resources. SHPO concurred with this determination on April 15, 2013 (refer to
Appendix D).
NEPA Determination. The inadvertent discovery of archaeological materials during project activities
represents a potential adverse impact; however; with implementation of Mitigation Measure CUL-1, the
potential for impacts would be reduced and would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The inadvertent discovery of archaeological materials during project activities
represents a potential project impact; however; implementation of Mitigation Measure CUL-1 would reduce
the project’s potential to result in impacts to archaeological resources to a less-than-significant level.

Impact 3.8-2: Disturbance of Human Remains, Including those Interred Outside of a
Formal Cemetery
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no modifications would be made to the existing Ferry Terminal
facilities to accommodate new or existing WETA services. Therefore, the No Action Alternative would
have no effect or impact to human remains, including those interred outside of formal cemeteries.
Action Alternative
Implementation of the proposed project includes sediment-disturbing activities, which have the potential
to disturb human remains interred outside of formal cemeteries. There are no known cemeteries—formal
or otherwise—or other evidence of human internment in the Archaeological APE for the project.
Although it is unlikely, given the repeated dredging and other disturbances that have occurred in the
sediments in the Archaeological APE, there remains the potential that previously unidentified human
remains could be inadvertently uncovered with project implementation. Such disturbance of human
remains represents a potential project impact. Implementation of Mitigation Measure CUL-1, Inadvertent
Discovery Measures, and Mitigation Measure CUL-2, Treatment of Human Remains, would reduce
potential impacts due to disturbance of human remains, by identifying the procedures to be followed in
the event that human remains are inadvertently exposed during project implementation.
NEPA Determination. The inadvertent disturbance of human remains during construction represents a
potential adverse impact; however, with implementation of Mitigation Measures CUL-1 and CUL-2, the
potential for impacts would be reduced and would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The inadvertent disturbance of human remains during construction represents a
potential project impact; however, implementation of Mitigation Measures CUL-1 and CUL-2 would
reduce the project’s potential to result in impacts to human remains to a less-than-significant level.
Impact 3.8-3: Cause a Direct Adverse Effect or Impact to Historic Properties or
Resources
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no modifications would be made to the existing Ferry Terminal
facilities to accommodate new or existing WETA services. Therefore, the No Action Alternative would
have no effect or impact on historical properties or resources.
Action Alternative
There is one element of the proposed project that would directly affect historic properties or resources.
This element involves the potential replacement of wood fendering along the southern edge of Pier 1, as
indicated on Figure 2-2.
As described in Section 2.3.2, the existing fendering along the southern edge of Pier 1 in the North Basin
could be removed and replaced. This would require the removal of 33 wood piles along the southern side
of Pier 1 (see Figure 3.8-6), which would be replaced with 330 linear feet of “chock block” fendering,
with 33 new 14-inch-diameter wood piles. Pier 1 is individually listed on the National Register, and
contributes to the Embarcadero Historic District and to the Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District,
both of which partially overlap the Focused Architectural APE for this project. The pilings that are
subject to removal have been identified as original to the building, and contribute to the significance of
the property (Page & Turnbull, 2002). Their removal, therefore, has the potential to cause an adverse

effect/significant impact to the historic property or resource. WETA has not yet determined whether
replacement of the fendering would be required to safely operate vessels at the new Gate A. During the
Final design of the project, the existing fendering along the southern edge of Pier 1 would be inspected to
determine whether replacement is necessary. In the event that it is determined that the fendering would
require replacement, Mitigation Measure CUL-3, Replacement in Accordance with Secretary of the
Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, would be implemented. This measure requires that replacement of
the fendering be constructed in a manner consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the
Treatment of Historic Properties, Standards for Rehabilitation (NPS, 2001). Implementation of this
mitigation measure, should the fendering require replacement, would reduce potential adverse effects;
therefore, project effects would not be adverse.
All other construction is occurring outside the boundaries of the historic properties or resources that are in
or partially in the Focused Architectural APE, except where the project would connect to the historic
bulkhead wharf. The boundaries of the Embarcadero Historic District and the Central Embarcadero Piers
Historic District encompass only the elements that contribute to the districts, and generally exclude
noncontributing features. In the project area, these noncontributing features include Pier 2 and the Ferry
Plaza, and portions of the bulkhead wharf built after the end of the two districts’ respective periods of
significance. The boundaries of the three buildings that are individually listed in the NRHP and CRHR
(the Ferry Building, the Agriculture Building, and Pier 1) are also defined by the footprint of each
building (which in the case of Pier 1 also includes the extent of the pier substructure) (Figure 3.8-3). The
construction zone encompasses areas currently occupied by Pier 2, as well as noncontributing portions of
the bulkhead wharf. As described in Table 2-2, the proposed project would include resurfacing an area of
decking immediately west of the existing water basin between the Ferry Building and the Agriculture
Building. Some of this pavement would be situated atop a contributing section of bulkhead wharf west of
the line between the west-facing façades of the Ferry Building and the Agriculture Building, as depicted
on Figure 3.8-5. The existing surfacing in this area is nonhistoric; it was installed after the end of the
period of significance, and does not contribute to the significance of the resource (Corbett et al., 2006,
Section 7:57). Because these construction or demolition activities would not—with the aforementioned
exception of the possible fendering removal at Pier 1—damage, destroy, or otherwise alter, in whole or in
part, contributing or individually eligible historic properties or resources, the project would not cause a
direct adverse effect or significant impact to historic properties or resources.
There are, however, several historic properties and resources very near the planned construction activities.
Because inadvertent damage to these historic properties or resources would be adverse and potentially
significant, the undertaking would apply measures to avoid and minimize this effect. Implementation of
Mitigation Measure CUL-4 requires demarcation of the construction zone, to reduce the potential for
inadvertent damage; and implementation of a response and repair plan, should any inadvertent damage
occur during construction. This measure would avoid and minimize potential adverse effects; therefore,
project effects would not be adverse.
None of the historic properties are federal property, and the project does not constitute the transfer, lease,
or sale of property out of federal ownership. Therefore, the undertaking would not constitute an adverse
effect under this criterion, nor would it cause a significant impact. Finally, the project would not cause
neglect to or change the use or location of a historic property, and so would not cause an adverse effect or
a significant impact.
Pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA, FTA concluded that this undertaking, with the implementation of
proposed mitigation measures, would have no adverse effect on historic properties (also refer to
Impact 3.8-5). SHPO concurred with this determination on April 15, 2013 (refer to Appendix D).

NEPA Determination. Should it be determined that the fendering along Pier 1 requires replacement, the
project could directly affect historic properties or resources in the Focused Architectural APE.
Implementation of Mitigation Measures CUL-3 and CUL-4 require application of measures during
construction to avoid inadvertent damage; implementation of a response and repair plan, should any
inadvertent damage occur during construction; and replacement of the fendering along Pier 1, in a manner
consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties,
Standards for Rehabilitation (NPS, 2001). With implementation of these mitigation measures, impacts
would be reduced and would result in no adverse effect.
CEQA Determination. Direct impacts to historic properties or resources in the Focused Architectural
APE would be potentially significant, should it be determined that the fendering along Pier 1 requires
replacement. Implementation of Mitigation Measures CUL-3 and CUL-4 require application of measures
during construction to avoid inadvertent damage; implementation of a response and repair plan, should
any inadvertent damage occur during construction; and replacement of the fendering along Pier 1, in a
manner consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties,
Standards for Rehabilitation (NPS, 2001). These measures would reduce potential impacts to a less-thansignificant level.
Impact 3.8-4: Adverse Effects to Unidentified Significant Paleontological Resources
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no modifications would be made to the existing Ferry Terminal
facilities to accommodate new or expanded WETA services. Therefore, the No Action Alternative would
have no impacts to paleontological resources.
Action Alternative
Implementation of the proposed project would include activities that would disturb the sediments in the
project area, potentially affecting paleontological resources. Sediment-disturbing activities would include
initial dredging during construction; periodic maintenance dredging; pile demolition and removal; and
pile installation. No paleontological resources have been previously identified in the project area;
however, there are previously recorded fossil sites nearby, and the project area is therefore considered
potentially sensitive for paleontological resources. As proposed, the project would require the installation
of piles though the Young Bay Mud and into the underlying Merritt Sand and Old Bay Mud. No
elements of the project would extend to the depth of the underlying bedrock. Dredging would be less
likely to impact paleontological resources, based on the limited depth of dredging (to 14 feet below mean
lower low water), and because the area has been previously disturbed by historic dredging and vessel
traffic. Implementation of Mitigation Measure CUL-5 would reduce potential impacts to unknown
significant paleontological resources, by halting work within 50 feet of sediment-disturbing activities if
buried paleontological resources are discovered during construction. A qualified paleontologist could
then document the discovery as needed, evaluate the potential resource, assess the significance of the find,
and determine how to mitigate the potentials effects, as necessary.
NEPA Determination. The project has the potential to adversely impact paleontological resources.
With the implementation of Mitigation Measure CUL-5, the potential for impacts would be reduced and
would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. With implementation of proposed Mitigation Measure CUL-5, the project’s
potential to result in impacts to paleontological resources would be reduced to a less-than-significant
level.

Indirect Impacts
Impact 3.8-5: Potential Indirect Effects of Visual or Noise and Vibration Elements on
Historic Properties or Resources
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no modifications would be made to the existing Ferry Terminal
facilities to accommodate new or expanded WETA services. Therefore, the No Action Alternative would
have no indirect effects on historic properties or resources.
Action Alternative
The proposed project elements and project construction activities have the potential to indirectly impact
historic properties in the Focused Architectural APE. The potential visual or noise and vibration effects
are discussed below.
Visual
For additional information, also refer to Section 3.10, Aesthetics and Visual Resources.
The proposed project would introduce nonhistoric visual elements to the immediate surroundings of two
listed historic districts, and to three individually listed buildings. However, the visual presence of these
new project elements would not contrast with the scale or existing visual context of the area, and would
be consistent with historic water transportation uses of area. Introduction of these new project features
would not cause an adverse effect or significant impact to historic properties or resources, as discussed
below.
The project area is between Pier 1 and Pier 14, The Embarcadero, and San Francisco Bay (see
Figure 1-1). The Embarcadero extends for 3 miles along the waterfront, and includes a considerable
variety of use and urban forms on the land side of the district. Generally, the waterfront side of the
district comprises bulkhead buildings and piers, with maritime and other uses, parking areas, and open
spaces. The new visual features of the proposed project (gates, berthing structures, weather canopies)
would be consistent with the existing visual elements, and would be in or along the water basins between
Piers 1 and 14. From the east, the project area can be seen from Treasure Island, Yerba Buena Island, and
from the upper deck of the Bay Bridge, as well as from boats on San Francisco Bay. These views from
the east encompass the piers and commercial structures on both sides of the Ferry Building, whose clock
tower visibly punctuates the low San Francisco skyline. The views from this perspective are framed by
the Agriculture Building and the Pier 14 breakwater on the south, and Pier 1 on the north, visually
enclosing the North and South Basins that house the water transit gates (existing and proposed). From
The Embarcadero on the west, views of the project site contain the visual elements of the Ferry Building,
which serves as the visual focal point; the Agriculture Building; and Sinbad’s Restaurant (on Pier 2).
These buildings, as well as smaller-scale elements such as signs, lamp posts, streetscape decorative
features, street trees, and pedestrian and transit facilities, obstruct some of the views to the water side of
the project site.
The Port’s design guidelines promote aesthetic planning criteria that guide the initial development of
projects in a manner consistent with preservation of views and scenic resources. The preliminary design
of the project improvements has been developed taking into consideration compatibility with the
surrounding visual environment, as well as the nearby historic properties. Generally, the Focused
Architectural APE is characterized by a mixture of historically significant bulkhead buildings and piers
(the Ferry Building, the Agriculture Building, and Pier 1), modern buildings and structures (the Ferry
Plaza, the ferry canopies and gates, and Sinbad’s Restaurant), and parking areas and other open spaces.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

The historic buildings are situated with their principal façades facing west onto The Embarcadero, while
the modern buildings and structures are on the east or San Francisco Bay side of the Focused
Architectural APE.
The new vertical project elements consist of gates, berthing structures, railings, lighting, and weather
protection canopies. Most of the proposed new visual features included in the preliminary design would
be placed on the San Francisco Bay side, in or along the water basins between Piers 1 and 14, outside of
the boundaries of any listed historic district or individual building, in an area that is composed almost
entirely of modern buildings and structures (built in the 1970s and later). The proposed project elements
have been designed to be consistent with the scale, visual quality, and visual context of the existing
landscape (see Figures 2-5 and 2-6), which is a built environment consisting of a mix of historic and
modern elements. The proposed new gates (Gates A, F, and G) would be placed adjacent to the existing
gates (Gates B and E), and would be similar in terms of height, scale, color, material, and texture (though
the new gates would have slightly wider door openings). The float and access pier for proposed Gate A,
in the North Basin, would be placed in the former location of the noncontributing Pier ½ (which has
recently been demolished). Gates F and G, in the South Basin, would be constructed between existing
Gate E and Pier 14.
Three weather protection canopies are also included in the project’s preliminary design. The weather
protection canopies would have a uniform look throughout the project area. They would be
approximately 20 feet wide and 18 to 20 feet high; constructed of steel and glass; and could include
photovoltaic cells (see Figure 3.8-7). One weather protection canopy would be constructed along the
Gate A Access Pier. A similar canopy would be placed on the existing access pier along the north side of
the Ferry Building. In the South Basin, an extension of the East Bayside Promenade—also topped with a
photovoltaic canopy—would replace the existing, noncontributing Pier 2 and Sinbad’s Restaurant.
Because of their low vertical profiles, light massing, and glass features, the visual impact of these
project elements would be minimal, particularly when compared to the overall scale of the Ferry
Building, Pier 1, and the Agriculture Building, as shown on Figures 3.8-7 through 3.8-10. The tallest
features—the weather protection canopies and gates—would stand no higher than 20 feet, far below the
heights of the adjacent buildings. The canopies, gates, and other project features would be visually
subordinate to these historic properties. The placement and profiles of the gates and canopies are low
enough that sightlines to the historic properties from various vantage points on the water side (such as
at the ends of Piers 1 or Pier 14, or from the Ferry Plaza) would be either unimpeded or only partially
obscured. Sightlines toward the principal façades of the Ferry Building, Agriculture Building, and
Pier 1 from The Embarcadero would be unaffected. Additionally, although the proposed canopies,
gates, piers, and decking would result in a slight net increase in visual bulk within the Focused
Architectural APE, several of these project elements would replace existing visual clutter, namely
noncontributing Pier 2 and Sinbad’s Restaurant.
Additionally, the introduction of new visual elements would not adversely affect or significantly impact
the historic properties or resources, because the surrounding setting and historic views—especially on the
water side, where most of the project work would occur—have been fundamentally altered since the ends
of their respective periods of significance, the latest of which was in 1952. 7 From a historical perspective,
the water side of the project area bears little resemblance to the first half of the twentieth century, the
period in which all of the listed properties achieved significance. In fact, this is the reason that the
boundaries of the Embarcadero Historic District, Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District, and

7

As shown in Table 3.8-3, the periods of significance for the Embarcadero Historic District and the Central Embarcadero Piers
Historic District end in 1946 and 1952, respectively. The periods of significance of the individual buildings range from 1925
(Agriculture Building) to 1946 (Ferry Building).

individually listed buildings in the Focused Architectural APE were drawn to capture the elements that
contribute to the historic significance, and to exclude the elements that do not.
As shown on Figure 3.8-11, the Bayside elements in the project area have been changed many times.
First, many of the original ferry slips were removed; and then, in 1971, the Bay Area Rapid Transit
(BART) Ferry Plaza Platform and Transition Structure were constructed as part of the Transbay Tube
connection to the East Bay. This new platform (i.e., the Ferry Plaza) then became the location for the
Golden Gate Ferry Terminal.
The effects of these nonhistoric developments on the historic setting surrounding the project area are
substantial, as evidenced in a comparison of similar oblique aerial views from the 1950s and 2000s
(Figure 3.8-12). The visual character that existed on the waterfront during the period of significance has
been diminished with the removal or alteration of several major elements present at that time, and also
through introduction of new elements. Gone are the distinctive, nose-in ferry slips that dominated the
waterfront during the first half of the twentieth century, as are original Pier 14 bulkhead and wharf
structure. In their places are several modern constructions: Gate B, which projects into the North Basin
from the northeastern corner of the Ferry Building; the Ferry Plaza, including the Transition Structure,
Golden Gate Ferry Terminal, and Gates C and D; Pier 2, which includes the Sinbad’s Restaurant building
and Gate E; and the modern Pier 14, a municipal pier and breakwater. Additionally, the eastern façade of
the Ferry Building, which faces the waterfront, has been completely modified since its period of
significance. Beginning in 1998 and completed in 2003, the Ferry Building was renovated and
redeveloped as a mixed-use property. The project was certified by the National Park Service as being
consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties.
Although the renovation effort restored many original features and removed other historically
unsympathetic materials and design elements, thereby returning the building to a closer approximation of
its original appearance, it also added new elements to the eastern façade. Also, a new, 30-foot-wide
wharf for pedestrian foot traffic was added to the foot of the Ferry Building on the eastern façade.
The introduction of the proposed small-scale, low-profile project elements would not cause an adverse effect
to historic properties or resources because most of the proposed features would be placed on the San
Francisco Bay side of the Architectural APE and outside of the boundaries of the historic properties. As
discussed above, this is an area where modern development has already compromised the integrity of the
historic setting. For these reasons, the project as proposed under the preliminary design would not cause an
adverse effect to historic properties or resources in either the Architectural APE or Focused Architectural
APE.
Assessment of the preliminary design does not indicate that an adverse effect is likely; however, a
mitigation measure has been developed to ensure that the final design of project features directly adjacent to
historic properties and not located within the water basins (i.e., weather protection canopies) would also
avoid indirect adverse effects to adjacent to historic properties.
Mitigation Measure CUL-6 requires that final design of the weather protection canopies be developed in
consultation with the Port Waterfront Advisory Design Committee and the San Francisco Historic
Preservation Commission, and consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment
of Historic Properties, Standards for Rehabilitation (NPS, 2001). Although adverse impacts are not
anticipated based on the preliminary design, implementation of Mitigation Measure CUL-6 would ensure
that indirect adverse visual effects or significant impacts from the final design of the weather protection
canopy element of the proposed project are avoided for all of the four historic properties in the Focused
Architectural APE. The consultation and application of the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards would
ensure that historic integrity is retained, and that the properties would remain eligible for listing in the
NRHP and CRHR; therefore, the project would have no adverse effect.

Noise and Vibration
For additional details of the noise and vibration analysis, including the applicable analysis assumption,
thresholds, and potential impacts, refer to Section 3.7, Noise and Vibration.
The analysis presented in Section 3.7 found that the potential noise and vibration impacts from project
operations would not be expected to exceed thresholds that may cause indirect adverse effects or
significant impacts to historic properties or resources. Therefore, noise and vibration impacts from
project operation would not constitute an adverse effect or significant impact to historic properties or
resources.
The noise caused by construction activities would not cause indirect adverse effects or significant impacts
to historic properties or resources, because it would not permanently diminish their historic integrity.
The analysis did, however, find that groundborne vibration from project construction activities could
exceed vibration thresholds for potential structure damage (Impact 3.7-5). Although groundborne
vibration does not often reach the levels that can damage structures, the FTA cautions that care must be
taken to avoid damage to old, fragile, or historically significant buildings, where high-vibration
construction activities have the potential to cause damage. The four buildings and structures in the APE
that have been identified as historic properties or resources are the Ferry Building, the Agriculture
Building, Pier 1, and the seawall. The FTA provides consideration for buildings and structures in
Chapter 12 of its Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment (FTA, 2006). Applying the FTA
Construction Vibration Damage Criteria for building types, each building and structure has been
categorized as Building Category II: engineered concrete and masonry (no plaster) (FTA, 2006:
Table 12-3).
Using FTA criteria for vibration levels that have the potential to cause structural damage to buildings
(FTA, 2006: Table 12-3), and for vibration source levels for different types of construction equipment
(e.g., pile drivers and bulldozers), the vibration analysis determined the distance from each building type
where construction could exceed the FTA thresholds. The analysis concluded that vibration from
proposed project construction activities has the potential to result in damage to the individual historic
properties or resources, as follows:


The Ferry Building (Building Category II) is 30 feet from the closest point of the construction zone.
The analysis determined that when pile driving occurs within 73 feet (for impact pile driving) and
45 feet (for vibratory pile driving) of the Ferry Building, the pile driving has the potential to cause
vibrations that would exceed the FTA thresholds of 0.3 peak particle velocity (PPV) for potential
damage to the Category II building.



Pier 1 (Building Category II) is 25 feet from the closest point of the construction zone. The analysis
determined that when pile driving occurs within 73 feet (for impact pile driving) and 45 feet (for
vibratory pile driving) of the Ferry Building, the pile driving has the potential to cause vibrations that
would exceed the FTA thresholds for potential damage to the Category II building (0.3 PPV).



The seawall (Building Category II) is in the construction zone. If any of the construction equipment
listed in Table 3.7-13 is operated within the distances presented in Table 3.7-13, there is the potential
to cause vibrations that would exceed the FTA thresholds for potential damage to the Category II
structure (0.3 PPV).



The Agriculture Building (Building Category II) is 5 feet from the closest point of the construction
zone, and 17 feet from the nearest pile driving. If any of the construction equipment listed in
Table 3.7-13—with the exception of a small bulldozer—is operated within the distances presented in

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Table 3.7-13, there is the potential to cause vibrations that would exceed the FTA thresholds for
potential damage to the Category II building (0.3 PPV).
Mitigation Measures NOISE-3 and NOISE-4, presented in Section 3.7, would reduce vibration from
construction activities that could result in structural damage. These measures require that appropriate
pile-driving techniques be selected, based on the distance from existing buildings; that vibration
monitoring be conducted during construction; and that work be ceased and corrective measures or
alternative construction methods be implemented should vibration monitoring indicate that the threshold
would be exceeded. Therefore, implementation of Mitigation Measures NOISE-3 and NOISE-4 would
avoid indirect adverse effects or significant impacts to each of the four historic properties or resources in
the Focused Architectural APE.
Pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA, FTA concluded that this undertaking, with the implementation of
proposed mitigation measures, would have no adverse effect on historic properties. SHPO concurred with
this determination on April 15, 2013 (refer to Appendix D).
NEPA Determination. There is potential for the design of the project’s weather protection canopies to
adversely affect the adjacent historic properties in the Focused Architectural APE. With implementation
of Mitigation Measure CUL-6, indirect adverse visual effects from the final design of the weather
protection canopy element of the proposed project would be avoided, and the project would result in no
adverse effect.
There is a potential that vibration from construction could adversely affect the historic properties or
resources in the Focused Architectural APE. These potential effects would be avoided by implementing
Mitigation Measures NOISE-3 and NOISE-4. Therefore, the project would result in no adverse effect.
CEQA Determination. There is potential for the design of the project’s weather protection canopies to
significantly impact the adjacent historic properties in the Focused Architectural APE. With
implementation of Mitigation Measure CUL-6, indirect adverse visual effects from the final design of the
weather protection canopy element of the proposed project would be avoided, and project impacts would
be less than significant.
There is a potential that vibration from construction could indirectly affect the historic properties or
resources in the Focused Architectural APE. These potential effects would be avoided by implementing
Mitigation Measures NOISE-3 and NOISE-4. Therefore, impacts would be less than significant with
mitigation incorporated.
Construction Impacts
Given the nature of cultural and paleontological resources, there are no construction impacts. All
construction impacts are considered direct or indirect, and permanent. As such, construction impacts are
addressed above under Direct and Indirect Impacts.
Cumulative Impacts
Impact 3.8-6: Potential to Result in Cumulative Impacts on Archaeological Resources
Project implementation would not result in impacts to known NRHP- and/or CRHR-listed or eligible or
unique archaeological resources. The project could result in the inadvertent discovery of a buried
archaeological resource or buried human remains. The other projects shown in Table 3.1-1 would also
have the potential to inadvertently uncover previously unidentified buried archaeological resources or
buried human remains.

If previously undiscovered archaeological resources are inadvertently exposed during construction
activities, an incremental effect to archaeological resources may occur. However, the proposed project
and the other planned future projects in the project vicinity, including those in areas administered by the
Port—which are subject to CEQA-level environmental review—would be required to consider mitigation
for impacts to historical or unique archaeological resources. If these resources are properly evaluated and

The project would not contribute to cumulative adverse impacts to

CEQA Determination. Cumulative impacts to archaeological resources would be less than significant.
Impact 3.8-7. Potential to Result in Cumulative Impacts on Historic Properties
The proposed project has the potential to directly and indirectly affect historic properties or resources in
the Focused Architectural APE. Should it be determined that the fendering along Pier 1, a historic
resource, needs to be replaced, the proposed project could directly affect a historic property. In addition,
the Focused Architectural APE includes four historic resources and two overlapping historic districts.
Vibration from construction activities has the potential to affect the historic resources in the project area.
In addition, the introduction of the new project elements has the potential to visually affect the adjacent
historic buildings and historic districts. There are four other known ongoing and future projects that
could have a potential to affect the historic properties and resources within the Focused Architectural
APE as well: the America’s Cup Project; Golden Gate Transit Ferry Terminal Improvements; BART
Ferry Plaza Physical Barrier Project; and Agriculture Building Rehabilitation and Seismic Upgrades. The
America’s Cup Project components in the project area would result in the removal of existing deck and
pile structures, and of the restaurant on Pier 2 (none of which are historic properties or historical
resources). In addition, the America’s Cup Project could involve other temporary uses, such as addition
of boats and temporary berthing facilities along the northern waterfront. These changes are not
anticipated to affect historic properties or resources. The Golden Gate Transit Ferry Terminal
Improvements, which would occur at Golden Gate Transit’s gates in the project area, are intended to
upgrade accessibility. At this time, environmental review has not been initiated on this project, but the
upgrade is anticipated to be minor in scope, and is not anticipated to result in significant changes in the
area. The BART Ferry Plaza Physical Barrier Project involves the construction of surface security
features around BART’s facilities on the Ferry Plaza, which are not historic properties or within the
boundaries of the historic district. The project is minor in scope and is not expected to result in
significant visual changes to the area. The Agriculture Building Rehabilitation has also not initiated
environmental review or design. At the time this project is defined, a detailed environmental review
would evaluate both the project’s potential to affect the historic properties and districts in the project area,
and the project’s potential cumulative impacts. The proposed project has been designed so as to not
interfere with the future rehabilitation of the Agriculture Building.
In addition, several past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects have affected properties and
buildings within the Embarcadero Historic District (such as the demolition of Pier 36, or the development
of the Exploratorium and Cruise Terminal). Each of these projects would be required, pursuant to Port
Resolution 04-89, to be designed to the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards. As described in the
environmental analysis for each project, the modifications have been and would be required to be
designed so as not to result in substantial or adverse impacts to the Historic District and its integrity.
Because the other reasonably foreseeable projects are not anticipated to have substantial impacts to
historic properties or resources, and because the proposed project’s potential effects on historic resources
would be less than significant and not adverse with the implementation of mitigation measures identified

for the project, no cumulative adverse impacts to historic properties or resources along San Francisco’s
waterfront are anticipated.
NEPA Determination. The project would not contribute to cumulative adverse impacts to historic
properties.
CEQA Determination. Cumulative impacts to historic properties would be less than significant.
Impact 3.8-8: Potential to Result in Cumulative Impacts on Paleontological Resources
Implementation of the proposed project would include activities that would disturb the sediments in the
project area, potentially affecting paleontological resources. No paleontological resources have been
previously identified in the project area; however, the general vicinity of the project is considered
potentially sensitive for paleontological resources, and therefore paleontological resources could be
uncovered during construction. The other projects shown on Table 3.1-1 would also have the potential to
inadvertently uncover previously unidentified paleontological resources.
If previously undiscovered paleontological resources are inadvertently exposed during construction
activities, an incremental effect to may occur. However, the proposed project and the other planned
future projects in the project vicinity, including those in areas administered by the Port—which are
subject to CEQA-level environmental review—would be required to consider mitigation for impacts to
paleontological resources. If these resources are properly evaluated and managed according to mitigation
measures, no adverse cumulative impact to paleontological resources is expected to occur.

Mitigation Measures

Mitigation Measure CUL-1: Inadvertent Discovery Measures
To avoid any potential adverse effect on inadvertently discovered NRHP- and/or CRHR-eligible or
unique archaeological resources as defined in CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5(a)(c), WETA will
distribute an archaeological resource “ALERT” sheet to the project prime contractor, and to any project
subcontractor firms involved in soil/sediment disturbing activities in the project site. The “ALERT” sheet
will contain sufficient information to allow contractor personnel to identify conditions that may indicate
the presence of archaeological resources. Prior to undertaking any soil-disturbing activities (i.e.,
dredging, pile installation), each contractor is responsible for ensuring that the “ALERT” sheet is
circulated to all field personnel, including machine operators, field crew, pile drivers, and supervisory
personnel. Should there be any indication of an archaeological resource—including, but not limited to,
encountering fragments of bone, stone tools, midden soils, structural remains, ship remnants, or historic
refuse—during any soil-disturbing activity of the project, WETA will immediately suspend any soildisturbing activities in the vicinity of the discovery.
In the event of such a discovery, WETA will retain the services of a qualified archaeological consultant.
The archaeological consultant will advise WETA as to whether the discovery is an archaeological
resource that retains sufficient integrity, and is of potential scientific/historical/cultural significance. If an
archaeological resource is present, the archaeological consultant will identify and evaluate the
archaeological resource. The archaeological consultant will make a recommendation to WETA as to
what action or additional measures, if any, are warranted, including coordination with appropriate
agencies.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Measures might include preservation in situ of the archaeological resource; an archaeological monitoring
program; or an archaeological evaluation program. If an archaeological resource cannot be avoided by
project activities, the archaeologist will prepare an Archaeological Evaluation Plan (AEP). The AEP will
create a program to determine the potential of the expected resource to meet the CRHR criteria—
particularly Criterion 4, the resource’s potential to address important research questions identified in the
AEP—and the archaeologist will submit this plan to WETA for approval. The archaeologist will then
conduct an evaluation consistent with the WETA-approved AEP. The methods and findings of the
evaluation will be presented in an Archaeological Evaluation and Effects Report, which will be submitted
to WETA for review on completion.
Mitigation Measure CUL-2: Treatment of Human Remains
The treatment of human remains and associated or unassociated funerary objects discovered during any
soil-disturbing activity will comply with applicable state laws. In the event the discovery is composed
entirely of, or includes, human skeletal remains, in addition to implementation of Mitigation
Measure CUL-1, Inadvertent Discovery Measures, construction activities will immediately cease and
WETA’s project representative will immediately contact the San Francisco County coroner to evaluate
the remains, following the procedures and protocols set forth in Section 15064.5 (e)(1) of the CEQA
Guidelines. If the coroner determines that the remains are Native American, WETA will contact the
NAHC, who will appoint a Most Likely Descendant (MLD), in accordance with Health and Safety Code
Section 7050.5, subdivision (c), and PRC 5097.98 (as amended by AB 2641). In accordance with
PRC 5097.98, WETA and the Port (as landowner/administrator) will ensure that, according to generally
accepted cultural or archaeological standards or practices, the immediate vicinity of the Native American
human remains is not damaged or disturbed by further development activity until WETA and the Port
have discussed and conferred with the MLD, as prescribed in this section (PRC 5097.98), regarding their
recommendations, if applicable, taking into account the possibility of multiple human remains. WETA,
the Port, and the MLD will make all reasonable efforts to develop an agreement for the treatment, with
appropriate dignity, of human remains and associated or unassociated funerary objects (CEQA Guidelines
Sec. 15064.5[d]). The agreement should take into consideration the appropriate excavation, removal,
recordation, analysis, custodianship, curation, and final disposition of the human remains and associated
or unassociated funerary objects. PRC allows 48 hours to reach agreement on these matters. If the MLD
and the other parties do not agree on the reburial method, the project will follow Section 5097.98(b) of the
PRC, which states, “the landowner or his or her authorized representative will re-inter the human remains
and items associated with Native American burials with appropriate dignity on the property in a location
not subject to further subsurface disturbance.”
Mitigation Measure CUL-3: Replacement in Accordance with Secretary of the Interior’s
Standards for Rehabilitation
If replacement of the existing pile fendering attached to the southern side of Pier 1 is deemed necessary,
the replacement work will be conducted in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
the Treatment of Historic Properties (NPS, 2001), specifically adhering to the Standards for
Rehabilitation. Project compliance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and applicable
guidelines will ensure that Pier 1 retains sufficient historic integrity to convey its significance for listing
in the NRHP and CRHR, therefore avoiding and minimizing the adverse effect or significant impact
potentially caused by this undertaking.
When replacing the pile fendering on the southern side of the building, in-kind replacement materials will
be used to the greatest extent feasible. The replacement timber pilings will have a diameter similar to that
of the original pilings. The number of replacement pilings will match the number of pilings being
removed (33), and the new pilings will be spaced similarly to the originals. The selection of replacement
pilings should include input and review from an architectural historian who meets the Secretary of the
Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards (as defined in 36 CFR, Part 61). The project’s compliance

Consequences, and Mitigation

with the Standards for Rehabilitation will result in Pier 1 retaining integrity of design, workmanship,
materials, feeling, association, and location. Although the project will result overall in some diminished
integrity of material, the elements that comprise the building’s significant form, plan, and design,
illustrating its important historic function and aesthetic value, will be retained; and the impact would be
avoided and minimized.
Mitigation Measure CUL-4: Plan for Protection Against, and Response to, Inadvertent
Damage
Protection and Monitoring to Avoid Effects. To avoid and minimize adverse effects that would
inadvertently cause damage to historic properties during project construction activities, the project
construction zone will be clearly delineated using orange construction fencing or other similar suitable
materials, and designated as a restricted area. Mitigation Measure NOISE-3 would also help reduce this
impact.
Response to and Repair of Inadvertent Damage. Should project actions cause inadvertent damage to
historic properties, project work will cease, and the response plan prepared prior to construction for repair
of damage will be implemented. The plan and response will include input and review from an
architectural historian who meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards (as
defined in 36 CFR, Part 61). Inadvertent damage to the historic properties resulting from the project will
be repaired in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. The response
plan will include photographic documentation of the condition of the portions of historic properties prior
to project implementation, to establish the baseline condition for assessing damage. Prior to
implementation, WETA will provide the plans for any repairs to SHPO for review and comment, to
ensure conformance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation.
Mitigation Measure CUL-5: Stop Construction if Buried Paleontological Resources Are
Discovered
In the event that paleontological resources are discovered during construction, sediment-disturbing
activities within 50 feet of the find will be temporarily halted or diverted until the discovery is examined
by a qualified paleontologist (in accordance with Society of Vertebrate Paleontology standards). The
paleontologist will document the discovery as needed, evaluate the potential resource, and assess the
significance of the find under the criteria set forth in CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5. The
paleontologist will notify the appropriate agencies to determine procedures that would be followed before
construction is allowed to resume at the location of the find. If the project proponent determines that
avoidance is not feasible, the paleontologist will prepare a salvage plan in accordance with the SVP and
CEQA Guidelines for mitigating the effect of the project on the qualities that make the resource
important. The plan will be submitted to WETA for review and approval prior to implementation.
Mitigation Measure CUL-6: Consultation with Local Agencies Regarding Final Design of
Weather Protection Canopies and Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation
The final design of the weather protection canopies will be developed in consultation with the Port’s
Waterfront Design Advisory Committee and the San Francisco Historic Preservation Commission, and
consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties,
Standards for Rehabilitation (NPS, 2001). The basic scale and massing of these project features is
described in Section 6.1, but the details of their appearance has not been finalized.
Mitigation Measure CUL-6 requires consultation regarding final design of weather protection canopies,
and application of the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards to the final design. Project compliance with
the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and applicable guidelines will ensure that the weather protection
canopy element of the proposed project would not adversely affect any of the historic properties in the

Architectural APE or Focused Architectural APE. The standards for rehabilitation recommend “designing
new exterior additions to historic buildings or adjacent new construction which is compatible with the
historic character of the site and which preserves the historic relationship between the building or
buildings and the landscape” (NPS 2001, 105). The guidelines also state that new additions, exterior
alterations, or related new construction should not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial
relationships that characterize the historic property. The new work should be compatible with the historic
materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its
environment. New additions and adjacent or related new construction should be undertaken in such a
manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its
environment would be unimpaired. These guidelines, and others for historic setting, is and will continue
to be incorporated in the design of the project features at the historic Ferry Building and the surrounding
historic properties. The consultation and application of the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards would
ensure that historic integrity is retained, and that the properties would remain eligible for listing in the
NRHP and CRHR, therefore avoiding potential adverse effects.
The final design for the project will include consultation and review by the Port’s Waterfront Design
Advisory Committee and the San Francisco Historic Preservation Commission. Through the design
review process, the Waterfront Design Advisory Committee is responsible for ensuring that project
improvements comply with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Historic Rehabilitation, and that
projects would not adversely affect historic properties or districts along the waterfront. Given the
resources in the project area, the San Francisco Historic Preservation Commission will be involved in the
design review process. The public is also invited to participate in the design review process. WETA will
submit the preliminary final design for the weather protection canopies to the Port’s Waterfront Design
Advisory Committee and the San Francisco Historic Preservation Commission for review and comment;
input received during this review will be incorporated in the final design plans. This process will ensure
that the final design would also avoid adverse effects to historic properties or resources in either the
Architectural APE or Focused Architectural APE.

BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES

3.9.1

Introduction to the Analysis

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

This section describes the existing biological setting of the project area and the San Francisco Bay.
Existing species, including special-status species, and habitats, including designated critical habitat, are
described. This section also provides a discussion of the federal, state, and local regulations applicable to
construction and implementation of the proposed project.
Potential impacts related to maintenance dredging and permanent fill (including shading) are addressed.
Temporary impacts to biological resources including pile installation which can generate underwater
noise that can affect fish and marine mammals, and habitat disturbance during initial dredging, which can
affect water quality and disturb bottom habitat are evaluated.
As described below, the proposed project’s impacts would largely be negligible because the project would
follow regulatory guidance and permit conditions to minimize impacts to fish and marine mammals.
Initial dredging during construction and subsequent maintenance dredging would result in temporary
bottom disturbance and increases in suspended sediment. Pile driving would result in underwater noise
levels that could temporarily affect fish and marine mammal behavior. These impacts would be reduced
with implementation of regulatory guidance and mitigation measures described in this section.
3.9.2

Affected Environment

This section provides an overview of the biological resources that may be affected by implementation of
the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project (project) alternatives. The project could
potentially affect marine habitat and corresponding species. This section describes the habitat types
found within the study area, and the species commonly found in them. Species protected under the
California Endangered Species Act (CESA) and the Federal Endangered Species Act (FESA) and other
regulations that may occur in the study area are also identified.
Environmental Setting
Study Area
The project location is in northeastern San Francisco, along The Embarcadero, between Pier 1 and
Pier 14, including all areas west of The Embarcadero. The San Francisco Ferry Building, the Agriculture
Building, the Golden Gate Ferry Terminal, the Ferry Plaza, Pier 2, water transit Gates B and E, and
portions of San Francisco Bay are in the project area, as shown on Figure 1-1. Because the project area
includes portions of San Francisco Bay, the study area includes the project areas, as well as the Central
Bay portion of San Francisco Bay. The Central Bay encompasses areas east of the Golden Gate, south of
the Richmond Bridge, and north of the San Mateo Bridge.
Habitat Types
San Francisco Bay represents the only natural habitats within or adjacent to the study area. As described
above, the majority of the project area is characterized by urban development.
Developed Areas
Development within the project area is dominated by paved surfaces and Downtown San Francisco Ferry
Terminal (Ferry Terminal) facilities. Although there are no native-vegetation communities present,
landscaped ornamental plant species do occur. These ornamental species are not expected to be used as
nesting habitat by birds; however, western gulls (Larus occidentals), house finches (Carpodacus
mexicanus), and double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) could potentially use the rooftops of

Consequences, and Mitigation

buildings within and adjacent to the project area as nesting locations. Surveys associated with the
Exploratorium Relocation Project noted the presence of more 100 roosting gulls along the rooftops of
buildings on Piers 15 and 17, north of the project area. Bat surveys in the same area did not detect
evidence of roosting in the interior or exterior of these buildings (CCSF, 2009).
Open Bay
The Goals Report (Goals Project, 1999) subdivides the open bay habitats into two habitat subunits: deep
bay and shallow bay. Deep bay habitat is defined as those portions of San Francisco Bay deeper than
18 feet below mean lower low water (MLLW), including the deepest portions of San Francisco Bay and
the largest tidal channels. Shallow bay is defined as that portion of San Francisco Bay between 18 feet
below MLLW and MLLW. Open bay habitat is an important feeding area for the brown pelican
(Pelecanus occidentalis), double-crested cormorant, greater and lesser scaup (Aythya marila and Aythya
affinis), and Caspian tern (Hydroprogne caspia). Anadromous fish, such as Chinook salmon and
steelhead (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and Oncorhynchus mykiss), use San Francisco Bay as a migratory
corridor between their upstream spawning grounds and the Pacific Ocean. Marine mammals, such as
harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) and the California sea lion (Zalophus californianus), can be found foraging
within San Francisco Bay (Goals Project, 1999). Although there are no marine mammal haul out sites
within the project area, harbor seals and the California sea lion may use the open water area for foraging.
Site Fauna
Plankton
Representing the lower levels of the food chain, plankton is important to many marine community
members, including benthic organisms, fish, and mammals. There are three major groups of plankton:
phytoplankton, zooplankton, and ichthyoplankton.
Phytoplankton are simple, often microscopic, plants or algae that represent the base of the marine food
web. The dominant species found within San Francisco Bay are diatoms, dinoflagellates, and
cryptophytes (Cloern and Dufford, 2005). Studies have shown that plankton growth and distribution
within San Francisco Bay can be attributed to the amount of sunlight, turbidity, and influx of fresh water
(Cloern et al., 1985; Alpine and Cloern, 1988; Cloern, 1999; Jassby et al., 2002; May et al., 2003; NOAA,
2007). The productivity of other organisms, including clams, worms, mussels, and zooplankton, depends
on the growth of phytoplankton (SFEP, 1992).
Zooplankton consist of microscopic and macroscopic animals that either free-float or feebly swim in open
water. Common zooplankton found in San Francisco Bay include species of copepods, rotifers,
tintinnids, and meroplankton (larval forms of gastropods, bivalves, barnacles, polychaetes, and
crustaceans such as the Dungeness crab [Cancer magister]) (Ambler et al., 1985; NOAA, 2007). Their
distribution is driven by seasonality, geographical variations, and life histories (Ambler et al., 1985;
Gewant and Bollens, 2005; NOAA, 2007). Zooplankton also provide an ecologically important food
source for many types of fish, such as anchovies, smelt, and striped bass.
Ichthyoplankton are the eggs and larval forms of marine fishes, such as Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii),
northern anchovy, goby (family Gobiidae), white sea bass (Cynoscion nobilis), staghorn sculpin, and
diamond turbot (Hypsopsetta guttulata).
Seasonal abundance and distribution of individual
ichthyoplankton species are dependent on the reproductive cycles of the adult fish species and their
circulation within San Francisco Bay.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Benthos
In San Francisco Bay, many benthic invertebrates, bottom-dwelling organisms, live within sedimentary or
soft-bottom habitats, usually within the top 2 to 10 centimeters of the soft sediment. The benthic
community inhabiting the nearshore area of this portion of the Central Bay is identified as Marine Muddy
(Thompson et al., 2000), which is characterized by species such as polychaetes (Euchone liminicola and
Mediomastus spp.); and by amphipods, including Ampelisca abdita and several species of the genus
Corophium.
Some benthic invertebrates also live on hard substrates, which are much less common in San Francisco
Bay compared to sedimentary habitats. Structures such as piers, breakwaters, rip rap, and other hard
substrates function as habitat for colonization of benthic invertebrates. These artificial intertidal habitats
are populated by algae, barnacles (Balanus glandula and Chthamalus fissus), mussels (Mytilus spp.),
tunicates, bryozoans, cnidarians, and crabs. Additionally, these structures can serve as habitat for
invasive species such as the alga (Undaria pinnatifida) (CCC, 2010).
Several of the more common benthic species in San Francisco Bay today were accidentally or
intentionally introduced species (SFEP, 1992). Some of these nonindigenous species serve ecological
functions similar to those of the native species that they have displaced. Examples of these include the
eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), the Japanese littleneck clam (Tapes philippinarum), and the softshelled clam (Mya arenaria), all of which have supported commercial or sport fisheries. However, other
species, such as Corbula amurensis, have a negative effect on phytoplankton and zooplankton
populations and organisms that depend on them. The benthos also provide an important food source for
many species of fish, birds, and mammals in the marine environment.
Shrimp and Crabs
San Francisco Bay is home to many species of shrimp and crab that are important for their recreational
fishery and ecological values. The bay shrimp (Crangon spp.) is the most common shrimp reported by
the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) in San Francisco Bay (Baxter et al., 1999).
Shrimp species are an important food source for virtually all species of fish, marine mammals, and water
birds.
Although distributed widely throughout San Francisco Bay, the various species of shrimp have differing
centers of distribution. For example, C. franciscorum are more commonly collected in the northern reach
of San Francisco Bay (San Pablo to the west Delta) than in the Central or South bays, while
C. nigromaculata are usually found in the Central and South bays (Baxter et al., 1999).
Crabs are both recreationally and ecologically important in San Francisco Bay. The most common
species is the Dungeness crab, which supports an important commercial fishery. Other commonly found
species include the red rock crab (C. productus), Pacific rock crab (C. antennarius), and the graceful rock
crab (C. gracilis). These species are typically abundant in the more marine waters of the Central Bay, but
are also found in the South Bay and San Pablo Bay (Baxter et al., 1999).
Due to their wide distribution within the Central Bay, C. franciscorum, C. nigromaculata, red rock crab,
Pacific rock crab, and graceful rock crab could potentially occur in the project area.
Fish
More than 100 species of fish inhabit the San Francisco Bay system. The majority of species are native,
but there are also many introduced species. Many complete all stages of life within San Francisco Bay; a
smaller portion, anadromous fish, migrate from ocean waters, through the San Francisco Bay-Delta
Estuary, and into a series of freshwater streams where they spawn. As adults or young-of-the-year, they

June 2013

Water Emergency Transportation Authority
Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

migrate back to the ocean. Whether spawned offshore and carried into San Francisco Bay by currents or
spawned directly in the Bay, most of the anadromous species spend 4 to 8 months in San Francisco Bay
before entering the ocean. Three anadromous salmonid species, steelhead, Chinook salmon, and green
sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris), are known to occur within San Francisco Bay. Other common fish
species include the Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), topsmelt
(Atherinops affinis), jacksmelt (Atherinopsis californiensis), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), white
croaker (Genyonemus lineatus), Pacific herring, and English sole (NOAA, 2007).
Fish reported to be, or to have potential to be, in the project area include white croaker, northern anchovy,
shiner perch, starry flounder, speckled sanddab, American shad (Alosa sapidissima), bat ray, brown
rockfish (Sebastes auriculatus), leopard shark, and striped bass (NOAA, 2007); and green sturgeon and
Pacific herring (SFEP, 1992). Of these species, Pacific herring are of note, because they are an important
component of the San Francisco Bay ecosystem and support one of the few remaining urban fisheries on
the Pacific Coast. Although the Pacific herring is neither a protected species under the FESA or CESA
nor a managed fish species under the Magnuson‐Stevens Act, as a state fishery it is regulated under
Sections 8550-8559 of the California Fish and Game Code. Pacific herring spawn within San Francisco
Bay, broadcasting their adhesive eggs over kelp, rocks, or other structures. In past years, peak spawning
has occurred along the San Francisco shore from December to March (USFWS, 1988). There is potential
for spawning to occur on hard substrates within the project area.
Birds
Roughly 120 waterbird species from 16 families occur in San Francisco Bay. Of these birds,
approximately two-thirds are represented by three families: Anatidae (waterfowl), Laridae (gulls and
terns), and Scolopacidae (sandpipers and phalaropes).
San Francisco Bay serves as an important staging and wintering ground on the Pacific Flyway for
numerous species of waterbirds, both common and uncommon. The Pacific Flyway is a bird migration
corridor along the Pacific Coast that stretches as far north as northern Canada and Alaska, and as far south
as the southern tip of South America (SFEP, 1992). In San Francisco Bay, the greatest waterbird
abundance and species diversity is seen in winter, as birds migrate along the flyway. Each year, nearly
one million waterfowl and more than one million shorebirds pass through this area.
Some of the most common birds in the open San Francisco Bay are diving ducks, including canvasback
(Aythya valisineria), scoters, and scaup. San Francisco Bay supports the largest population of canvasback
along the Pacific coast, 46 percent of the midwinter population in the Pacific Flyway (Goals Project,
2000). Additionally, San Francisco Bay provides crucial wintering habitat for surf scoter (Goals Project,
2000). Any of these species has the potential to occasionally be found in the project area.
The project area could also be used for foraging by brown pelicans, double-crested cormorant and
Forester’s tern (Sterna forsteri); and other fish-eating birds, such as osprey (Pandion haliaetus) and belted
kingfisher (Megaceryle alcyon)—although there is no suitable nesting habitat for these species in the
project area. Studies along the southern San Francisco Bay waterfront (Piers 24 and 96) noted the
presence of nesting western gulls at Pier 24, and perching brown pelicans at Piers 32 and 36 (GGAS,
2007; GGAS, 2008); there is also potential for western gulls to nest in the project area on rooftops or
other structures. Gulls are considered migratory and are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
Marine Mammals
The most common marine mammals in San Francisco Bay are the Pacific harbor seal and the California
sea lion, and these are the most likely species to occur in the project area. Other marine mammal species
that have been seen occasionally in San Francisco Bay include the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus),
harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), Steller sea lion

(Eumetopias jubatus), northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus), and, less frequently, the southern sea otter
(Enhydra lutris). On rare occasions, individual humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) have
entered San Francisco Bay.
Pacific harbor seals are nonmigratory and use San Francisco Bay year-round, where they engage in
limited seasonal movements associated with foraging and breeding activities (Kopec and Harvey, 1995).
Harbor seals forage in shallow waters on a variety of fish and crustaceans, and therefore could
occasionally be found foraging in the project area. Harbor seals haul out (come ashore) in groups ranging
in size from a few individuals to several hundred. Habitats used as haul-out sites include tidal rocks,
bayflats, sandbars, and sandy beaches (Zeiner et al., 1990).
California sea lions breed in Southern California and along the Channel Islands. After the breeding
season, males migrate up the Pacific Coast and enter San Francisco Bay. In San Francisco Bay, sea lions
are known to haul out at Pier 39 in the Fisherman’s Wharf area. During anchovy and herring runs,
approximately 400 to 500 sea lions (mostly immature males) feed almost exclusively in the North and
Central bays (USFWS, 1992) and could occasionally forage in the project area.
No seal or sea lion haul outs or pupping areas occur in the project area (Goals Project, 2000).
Terrestrial Mammals
There is no natural habitat in upland areas within the project area. The upland area consists of urban and
marina development, intermixed with landscape vegetation. Bats, such as the Townsend’s big-eared bat
(Corynorhinus townsendii), are known to roost along the San Francisco waterfront, and could potentially
occur within the project area.
Special-Status Species
Special-status species that occur, or have the potential to occur, in the project area were identified from
several sources, including the following: the California Natural Diversity Data Base (CNDDB) (CDFG,
2011), the California Native Plant Society’s online Inventory of Rare and Endangered Vascular Plants of
California (CNPS, 2011), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Sacramento Office’s Endangered
and Threatened Species list (USFWS, 2011). CNDDB and the USFWS online species databases were
queried for the San Francisco North U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute quadrangle.
The resulting species list gathered from these sources is included in Appendix C, along with a general
description of suitable habitat for each species, and the likelihood of occurrence in the project area.
Species with the potential to occur in the project area are discussed in more detail below.
Fish
Central California Coast (CCC) Steelhead Distinct Population Segment (DPS) and Central Valley
Steelhead DPS. CCC steelhead was federally listed as threatened on August 18, 1997, and is a CDFW
species of concern. The Central Valley steelhead DPS was listed as threatened on March 19, 1998.
Steelhead historically ranged throughout the northern Pacific Ocean, from Baja California to Kamchatka
Peninsula. Currently, their range extends from Malibu Creek in southern California to Kamchatka
Peninsula (Busby et al., 1996). San Francisco Bay and its tributary streams support migrating steelhead
populations. O. mykiss can be either anadromous or can complete their entire life cycle in fresh water.
Those fish that remain in fresh water are referred to as rainbow trout. Steelhead, the anadromous form of
O. mykiss, can spend several years in fresh water prior to smoltification, and can spawn more than once
before dying, unlike most other salmonids (Busby et al., 1996). Adult steelhead typically migrate from
the ocean to fresh water between December and April, peaking in January and February (Fukushima and

Lesh, 1998). Juvenile steelhead migrate as smolts to the ocean from January through May, with peak
migration occurring in April and May (Fukushima and Lesh, 1998).
Sacramento Winter-Run, Central Valley Spring-Run, and Central Valley Fall/Late–Fall-Run
Chinook Salmon Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs). The species historically ranged from the
Ventura River in California to Point Hope, Alaska, on the eastern edge of the Pacific; and in the western
portion of the Pacific Ocean from Hokkaido, Japan, to the Anadyr River in Russia (Healey, 1991). Three
Chinook salmon ESUs migrate through San Francisco Bay: Sacramento River winter-run, Central Valley
spring-run, and Central Valley fall/late–fall-run. Factors used in determining ESUs include spatial,
temporal, and genetic isolation, maturation rates, and other life history traits. Chinook salmon have been
categorized into 17 ESUs. Each ESU is considered a distinct race and has been given its own
management status.
Both winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon tend to enter freshwater as immature fish, migrate far
upriver, and delay spawning for weeks or months. For comparison, fall-run Chinook salmon enter fresh
water at an advanced stage of maturity, move rapidly to their spawning areas on the main stem or lower
tributaries of rivers, and spawn within a few days or weeks of freshwater entry (Healey, 1991).
The winter-run, a state and federally listed endangered species, spawns in the upper Sacramento River
below Keswick Dam. The fall/late–fall-run, a state and federally listed species of special concern, spawns
in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River basins (Myers et al., 1998). Central Valley spring-run Chinook
salmon, a state and federally listed threatened species, spawn in the Sacramento River Basin. All three
runs are most commonly found migrating through the northern and central portions of San Francisco Bay
(CDFG, 1987).
CCC Coho Salmon ESU. CCC Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) are listed as endangered under
FESA and endangered under CESA. This species ranges from Baja California, Mexico, north to Alaska,
and southwest to Japan (McGinnis, 1984). This species exhibits a simple 3-year anadromous life cycle
(Federal Register, 1999), rearing in fresh water for up to 15 months before migrating to the ocean. Coho
salmon typically spend two growing seasons in the ocean before returning to their natal streams to spawn
(Federal Register, 1996). The CCC coho salmon ESU occurs from Punta Gorda in Northern California
south to, and including, the San Lorenzo River in central California (Weitkamp et al., 1995). Coho
generally return to their natal streams between November and December. This species has been
extirpated from tributaries of San Francisco Bay; therefore, coho are rare in San Francisco Bay.
North American Green Sturgeon Southern DPS. Green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) southern
DPS are a federally threatened species. Green sturgeon are not abundant along the Pacific Coast, but are
known to exist in the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary (Pycha, 1956; Skinner, 1962; Moyle, 1976).
Green sturgeon are anadromous fish that spend most of their lives in salt water and return to spawn in
fresh water. Green sturgeon rely on streams, rivers, estuarine habitat, and marine waters during their
lifecycle. Adult southern DPS green sturgeon spawn in the reaches of the Sacramento River watershed
with swift currents and large cobble. Pre-spawn green sturgeon enter the Bay between late February and
early May, as they migrate to spawning grounds in the Sacramento River (Heublein et al., 2009). Postspawning adults may be present in the Bay after spawning in the Sacramento River in the spring and early
summer for months prior to migrating to the ocean. Juvenile green sturgeon move into the Delta and San
Francisco estuary early in their juvenile life history, where they may remain for 2 to 3 years before
migrating to the ocean (Allen and Cech, Jr., 2007; Kelly et al., 2007). Sub-adult and nonspawning adult
green sturgeon use both ocean and estuarine environments for rearing and foraging.
Longfin Smelt. Longfin smelt are listed as threatened under CESA, and a candidate species under FESA.
Longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) are small (approximately 9 to 11 centimeters standard length at
maturity), euryhaline fish that are a native fish known to occur within the San Francisco Estuary,
including the Delta, Suisan Marsh, and San Francisco Bay to the Golden Gate (USFWS, 2009). The

population found within San Francisco Bay represents the largest known longfin smelt population in
California (Rosenfield and Baxter, 2007). In addition, this population is in the southernmost known range
for the Longfin smelt (Rosenfield and Baxter, 2007; USFWS, 2009). Depending on the salinity levels
within an area, longfin smelt spawning can occur between November and late June (Moyle, 2002;
USFWS, 2009). Although there is no current data on specific spawning locations within San Francisco
Bay, recently published reports indicate spawning probably occurs near the mixing zones between fresh
and brackish water (Rosenfield and Baxter, 2007) in the northern portion of San Francisco Bay and the
lower San Joaquin Delta (Moyle, 2002). Juveniles and sub-adult longfin smelt use deep water habitats,
often foraging on opossum shrimp (Neomysis mercedis) (USFWS, 2009; DRERIP, 2010).
Mammals
Southern Sea Otter. The southern sea otter is considered a threatened population under FESA and is
protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. Approximately 16,000 to 18,000 sea otters
were formerly distributed along the California coastline. After extensive harvesting in the 18th and 19th
centuries, fewer than a hundred sea otters remained off the isolated coastline of Big Sur, California. After
years of protection, the population increased to 500 to 600 individuals by 1950 and, thereafter, increased
by approximately 5 percent annually until 1976, when the increase slowed (Estes, 1990). Currently,
about 2,200 individuals exist in the southern sea otter range. They have expanded their range to north of
Santa Cruz (about Half Moon Bay), and are rarely seen in San Francisco Bay.
Other Marine Mammals. All marine mammals are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act
of 1972. San Francisco Bay supports several common marine mammal species, including the Pacific
harbor seal, California sea lion, and occasionally, the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus). None of these
species are listed as threatened or endangered. No seal or sea lion haul outs or pupping areas occur in the
study area (Goals Project, 2000), although both species use shallow subtidal areas for foraging. Harbor
seals would be the marine mammal most likely to be observed in the waters of the study area.
Critical Habitat
Steelhead. Critical habitat was established for the CCC steelhead distinct population segment on
September 2, 2005 (70 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 52488 52626). Designated critical habitat for
this species includes all portions of San Francisco Bay below the ordinary high water line. The project
area is within this designated critical habitat. The designation includes natal spawning and rearing waters,
migration corridors, and estuarine areas that serve as rearing areas. The lateral extent of this critical
habitat is defined by the ordinary high water line (NOAA, 2005).
Chinook Salmon. Critical habitat for the Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon was designated
by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) (50 CFR Part 226) in 2005. The designation includes
natal spawning and rearing waters, migration corridors, and estuarine areas that serve as rearing areas.
Designated critical habitat for this species includes the waters of San Francisco Bay north of the San
Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge, which includes the project area. The lateral extent of this critical
habitat is defined by the ordinary high water line (NOAA, 2005).
Green Sturgeon. On October 9, 2009, the NMFS issued a final designation of critical habitat for green
sturgeon (74 CFR 52300-52351). This includes the designation of specific rivers, estuaries, and coastal
areas as critical habitat for this species. Under this ruling, the entire San Francisco Bay below mean
higher high water is designated as critical habitat, which includes the portion of San Francisco Bay within
the project area (NMFS, 2009).

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Essential Fish Habitat
San Francisco Bay is classified as Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The Central Bay serves as habitat for 14 species of commercially
important fish and sharks that are federally managed under two fisheries management plans (FMPs): the
Pacific Groundfish FMP and the Coastal Pelagic FMP. The entire San Francisco Bay is classified as EFH
for species managed under the Pacific Coast Salmonid FMP, which includes Chinook salmon.
The Pacific Groundfish FMP is designed to protect habitat for more than 90 species of fish, including
rockfish, flatfish, groundfish, some sharks and skates, and other species that associate with the underwater
substrate. This includes both rocky and muddy substrates.
The Coastal Pelagic FMP is designed to protect habitat for a variety of fish species that are associated
with open coastal waters. Fish managed under this plan include planktivores and their predators.
The Pacific Salmon FMP is designed to protect habitat for commercially important salmonid species.
Chinook salmon is the only one of these species that may be seasonally present in the project area.
Although some evidence suggests that migrating salmonids move along the deeper channels of San
Francisco Bay, migrational behavior in estuaries is poorly understood, and migrating fish may pass
through the project area.
Although they are not a state or federally listed species, native oysters (Ostrea conchaphila) are
considered a historical keystone species for San Francisco Bay, and contribute to EFH where oyster beds
occur. A century ago, native oysters were a highly visible component of San Francisco Bay ecosystems,
supporting industries from cement-making to gourmet dining. Oysters require hard substrate for larval
settlement, preferably other oyster shells, and this settling habit led to the formation of oyster reefs, the
nooks and crannies of which support communities of fish, crab, and other invertebrates. By the early
1900s, however, overfishing, habitat degradation, and the introduction of nonnative shellfish led to the
decline of native oysters. Oyster beds are not known to occur in the project area.
Regulatory Setting
Federal
Federal Endangered Species Act (16 United States Code [USC] 1531-1544)
FESA provides protection for federally listed special-status species, and requires conservation of the
critical habitat for those species. An “endangered” species is a species in danger of extinction throughout
all or a significant portion of its range. A “threatened” species is one that is likely to become
“endangered” in the foreseeable future without further protection. Other federally listed special-status
species include “proposed” and “candidate” species. Proposed species are those that have been officially
proposed (in the Federal Register) for listing as threatened or endangered. Candidate species are those for
which enough information is on file to propose listing as endangered or threatened. A “delisted” species
is one whose population has reached its recovery goal and is no longer in jeopardy.
Areas of habitat considered essential to the conservation of a listed endangered or threatened species may
be designated as critical habitat (referred to above), which is protected under FESA. Critical habitat
designations are intended as a tool to be used by the USFWS and NMFS in helping federal agencies
comply with their obligations under Section 7 of FESA.
The FESA is administered by the USFWS and the NMFS. In general, NMFS is responsible for protection
of FESA-listed marine species and anadromous fishes, while other species are under USFWS jurisdiction.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

FESA Section 9 prohibits the “take” of federally listed special-status species. Section 7 of this act
requires formal consultation with USFWS or NMFS for projects that may affect those species that are
either listed as or proposed for listing as endangered or threatened, to ensure that the proposed action will
not jeopardize federally listed special-status species or destroy or adversely modify designated critical
habitat. The Section 7 consultation process provides a means of authorizing the “take” of federally listed
special-status species. Taking is defined by FESA (Section 3[19]) to mean “to harass, harm, pursue, hunt,
shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or attempt to engage in any such conduct.” The Federal
Transit Administration (FTA) and the San Francisco Bay Area Water Emergency Transportation
Authority (WETA) have initiated consultation with NMFS under the FESA.
Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (16 USC 661-667e)
This act requires consultation with the USFWS, NMFS, and state agencies responsible for fish and
wildlife resources for all proposed federal undertakings and nonfederal actions needing a federal permit or
license that would impound, divert, deepen, or otherwise control or modify a stream or water body, and to
make mitigation and enhancement recommendations to the involved federal agency.
Additionally, the act requires that wildlife conservation be coordinated with other water resource
development programs that have joint jurisdiction over the water resource. Determination under this
authority for specific projects in estuarine areas constitute compliance with the provisions of the Estuary
Protection Act, as discussed below.
Estuary Protection Act (16 USC 1221–1226)
Under this act, the Secretary of the Interior is required to review all project plans and reports for land and
water resource development affecting estuaries, and make an assessment of likely impacts and related
recommendations for conservation, protection, and enhancement of estuaries.
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 USC 1801-1882)
The primary purpose of this act is conservation and management of fishery resources in the United States,
development of domestic fisheries in the United States, and phasing out foreign fishing activities within
federal waters (the 200-mile limit extending from the edge of state waters).
The Amended Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1996, also known as the
Sustainable Fisheries Act (Public Law 104-297), requires all federal agencies to consult with the
Secretary of Commerce on proposed projects authorized, funded, or undertaken by that agency that may
adversely affect EFH. The main purpose of the EFH provisions of the Sustainable Fisheries Act is to
avoid loss of fisheries due to disturbance and degradation of the fisheries habitat. FTA and WETA have
initiated consultation with NMFS under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management
Act.
Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 USC 703-712)
This act established special protection for migratory birds by regulating hunting or trade in migratory
birds. Furthermore, this act prohibits anyone to take, possess, buy, sell, purchase, or barter any migratory
bird listed in 50 CFR 10, including feathers or other parts, nests, eggs, or products, except as allowed by
implementing regulations (50 CFR 21). Definition of “take” includes any disturbance that causes nest
abandonment and/or loss of reproductive effort (e.g., killing or abandonment of eggs or young), and such
activity is potentially punishable by fines and/or imprisonment.

Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 USC 1361-1421h)
The Marine Mammal Protection Act, adopted in 1972, makes it unlawful to take or import any marine
mammals and/or their products. Under Section 101(a)(5)(D) of this act, an incidental harassment permit
may be issued for activities other than commercial fishing that may impact small numbers of marine
mammals. An incidental harassment permit covers activities that extend for periods of not more than
1 year, and that will have a negligible impact on the impacted species. Amendments to this act in 1994
statutorily defined two levels of harassment. Level A harassment is defined as any act of pursuit, torment,
or annoyance that has the potential to injure a marine mammal in the wild. Level B harassment is defined
as harassment having potential to disturb marine mammals by causing disruption of behavioral patterns
including, but not limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering.
Executive Order 13112: Invasive Species
The purpose of this order is to prevent the introduction of invasive species and to provide control for the
spread of invasive species that have already been introduced. This law prohibits the federal government
to “authorize, fund, or carry out actions that it believes are likely to cause or promote the introduction or
spread of invasive species in the United States or elsewhere unless, pursuant to guidelines that it has
prescribed, the agency has determined and made public its determination that the benefits of such actions
clearly outweigh the potential harm caused by invasive species; and that all feasible and prudent measures
to minimize risk of harm will be taken in conjunction with the actions.”
Clean Water Act Section 404 (33 USC 1251-1376) and Rivers and Harbors Action Section 10
(33 USC 403)
Under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) regulates the
disposal of dredged and fill materials into “waters of the United States,” which include intrastate lakes,
rivers, streams (including intermittent streams), bayflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes,
wet meadows, playa lakes, or natural ponds, and wetlands adjacent to any water of the United States
[33 CFR 328]. In areas subject to tidal influence, Section 404 jurisdiction extends to the high tide line or
boundary of any adjacent wetlands.
The Corps also regulates navigable waters under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act. Navigable
waters are defined as “those waters of the United States that are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide
shoreward to the mean high water mark and/or are presently used, or have been used in the past, or may
be susceptible to use to transport interstate or foreign commerce” [33 CFR 322.2].
In San Francisco Bay, waters of the United States include open water, seasonal and tidal wetlands, and
intertidal habitats. Any dredge or fill activities for the project would require a permit from the Corps.
Long Term Management Strategy Management Plan for Dredging in San Francisco Bay
The Long Term Management Strategy (LTMS) Management Plan for maintenance dredging of navigation
channels in San Francisco Bay was established in 2001. It represents a cooperative program among the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Corps, Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB), San
Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC), and regional stakeholders,
including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) NMFS, CDFW, area
environmental organizations, and water‐related industries. The focus of the LTMS is sediment
management in San Francisco Bay. It maximizes the use of dredged material as a beneficial resource, and
establishes a cooperative permitting framework for dredging, dredged material disposal, and development
of beneficial reuse site for dredge material. A key component of the LTMS is the establishment of
construction work windows, which include time periods when in-water construction activities are
allowed, restricted, or prohibited. If a project proponent wishes to construct during restricted periods,

formal consultation would be required with the appropriate resource agencies (NOAA, USFWS, and
CDFW). Through formal consultation, specific measures must be implemented to avoid or reduce
potential impacts. In the project area, the authorized work window for steelhead and salmonids is June 1
through November 30, and for Pacific herring is March 1 through November 30.
State
California Endangered Species Act (California Fish and Game Code 2050-2116)
Similar to FESA, CESA (along with the Native Plant Protection Act) authorizes the California Fish and
Game Commission to designate, protect, and regulate the taking of special-status species in the state of
California. CESA defines “endangered” species as those whose continued existence in California is
jeopardized. State-listed “threatened” species are those not presently threatened with extinction, but which
may become endangered if their environments change or deteriorate. Any proposed projects that may
adversely impact state-listed threatened or endangered species must formally consult with the CDFW.
Section 2080 of the California Fish and Game Code prohibits the taking of state-listed plants and animals.
The CDFW also designates “fully protected” or “protected” species as those which may not be taken or
possessed. Species designated as fully protected or protected may or may not be listed as endangered or
threatened.
In addition to state-listed special-status species, the CDFW also maintains a list of “Species of Special
Concern,” most of which are species whose breeding populations in California may face extirpation. To
avoid the future need to list these species as endangered or threatened, the CDFW recommends
consideration of these species, which do not as yet have any legal status, during analysis of the impacts of
proposed projects.
3.9.3

Impact Evaluation

This section includes an analysis and determination of the potential adverse and beneficial impacts of the
proposed project on biological resources. The analysis considered whether the project would:


Have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or through habitat modifications, on any species
identified as a candidate, proposed, or listed species under or otherwise protected by the FESA or the
CESA;



Alter or diminish critical habitat, EFH, or a special aquatic site, including eelgrass beds, mudflats, and
wetlands;



Result in the reduction of protected wetland habitat as defined in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act,
or result in alteration of desirable functions and values through direct removal, filling, hydrological
interruption, or other means;



Cause the introduction or substantial spread of invasive nonnative plants or wildlife;



Interfere substantially with the movement of resident or migratory fish or wildlife species;



Cause substantial or sustained impact to spawning habitat of commercially important species (e.g.,
Pacific herring);



Cause underwater sound pressure levels during construction or operation that exceed NMFS
guidelines for protection of marine mammals or fish;



Conflict with any locally applicable policies protecting biological resources; or

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Conflict with the provisions of an adopted Habitat Conservation Plan, Natural Community
Conservation Plan, or other applicable Habitat Conservation Plan.

A literature review was conducted to investigate the potential presence of biological resources in the
project area, including listed, proposed, and candidate species. Information was obtained from the
following sources:


The Sacramento Office of the USFWS online database for the San Francisco North, San Francisco
South, and Oakland West U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute quadrangles;



California Natural Diversity Database Rarefind 3, occurrence records from the above 7.5-minute
quadrangles (CDFG, 2011);



CDFG Game Wildlife Habitat Relations System (CDFG, 2010) (used to identify the habitat
requirements and distribution of special-status species); and



Studies presented in scientific journals and other publications about San Francisco Bay.

Effects to fish and marine mammals from construction noise are evaluated using a spreadsheet noise
calculation tool developed by the NMFS, and by comparison to measured noise levels for similar
underwater work. Noise levels were compared to NMFS guidelines for the protection of marine
mammals and fish.
Qualitative discussions are provided below for indirect impacts to species, such as from shading,
increased turbidity and other water quality effects, and bottom disturbance. These impacts are evaluated
by comparing proposed project features and construction methods with impacts observed and reported in
the literature.
There are no Habitat Conservation Plans, Natural Community Conservation Plans, or other approved
local, regional, or state conservation plans that apply to the project area.
The federal and state special-status species most likely to occur within the marine environment of the
project area include adult and juvenile salmonids (Chinook, steelhead), green sturgeon, and longfin smelt.
The Pacific herring, a species of commercial importance, could also be present within the project area. In
addition, several common marine mammal species, including the Pacific harbor seal, California sea lion,
and occasionally the gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), could be present within the project area. These
species are not listed as threatened or endangered, but they are protected under the Marine Mammal
Protection Act. Harbor seals would be the marine mammal most commonly observed in the waters of the
study area. Potential impacts to these species and their habitat are analyzed below.
The project area is also within the boundaries of San Francisco Bay, and contains critical habitat for three
special-status species—green sturgeon, steelhead, and Chinook salmon. In addition, the project area and
surrounding water is considered EFH for a number of species managed under the Magnuson-Stevens Act.
Sensitive habitats, such as eel grass beds and oyster beds, are protected under state and federal law.
However, these habitats are not present within the project area.
WETA and FTA have initiated consultation with NMFS under Section 7 of the FESA for impacts to
special-status species and critical habitat, and for impacts to EFH under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The status of consultation is described in more detail in
Impacts 3.9-1, 3.9-2, 3.9-4, and 3.9-5. The consultation process will be completed prior to the release of
the Final Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR).

Direct Impacts
Impact 3.9-1: Potential Adverse Effects of Maintenance Dredging on Special-Status or
Commercially Valuable Marine Species
No Action Alternative
Regular maintenance dredging is not currently required to maintain operations at existing Gates B and E.
Patterns of sediment accumulation in the Ferry Terminal area would be expected to be similar to
historically observed patterns; therefore, regular maintenance dredging would not be anticipated for the
No Action Alternative. Therefore, there would be no impact.
Action Alternative
As described in Section 2.3.6, it is anticipated that maintenance dredging could be required at Gates F
and G. Dredging within these areas would be anticipated to occur every 3 to 4 years, and approximately
5,000 to 10,000 cubic yards of material could be removed. Periodic maintenance dredging would disturb
bottom sediments, which would increase turbidity, disturb benthic habitat and associated communities of
organisms living in or on the mud bottom, and affect EFH. This disturbance could result in the temporary
loss or reduction of habitat suitable for fish foraging for sensitive species such as steelhead, Chinook
salmon, green sturgeon, and longfin smelt, as well as fish managed under the Magnuson-Stevens
Fisheries Act. Pacific herring, a commercially important species, could also be affected if spawning had
occurred in the area just before or during maintenance dredging activities. Mortality of fishes could result
from entrainment in dredging equipment. The behavior of marine mammals such as harbor seals could
also be affected by dredging activities.
Refer to Impact 3.9-4 for a more detailed discussion of the potential for dredging to increase suspended
sediment, entrain species, disrupt spawning, and physically impact the benthos.
Increased turbidity from maintenance dredging activities is not expected to have a substantial effect on
plankton productivity. Turbid plumes from maintenance dredging would be small in relation to
surrounding areas of San Francisco Bay, as well as short in duration (on the order of a few weeks every
3 to 4 years). In addition, San Francisco Bay waters in the study area are naturally turbid due to
resuspension of sediments from wind waves and tides, and light penetration is generally limited to a few
feet from the surface.
Maintenance dredging impacts could be substantial, however, based on the frequency of the maintenance
dredging, coupled with the relatively small area being dredged; it is anticipated that impacts would be
short-term and similar to other small maintenance dredging operations in San Francisco Bay.
Green sturgeon and longfin smelt are present in San Francisco Bay all year; therefore, regardless of when
maintenance dredging is conducted, authorization of potential incidental take of these species would be
required. WETA and FTA are consulting with NMFS, under Section 7 of FESA (for green sturgeon); and
would be required to consult with CDFW, under Fish and Game Code Section 2080.1 (for longfin smelt).
To minimize impacts to special-status and commercially important fish species, Mitigation
Measure BIO-1 will be implemented. This measure requires that dredging be conducted during the
LTMS dredge window of June 1 through November 30, to the extent feasible. During this time period,
sensitive life stages of listed salmonids are not present in San Francisco Bay. This work window would
also avoid the Pacific herring spawning season. Mitigation Measure BIO-1 also requires the use of the
smallest feasible dredge head for mechanical dredge, to reduce the likelihood of entrainment; and
measures to prevent exposure of fish and other aquatic organisms to contaminants that may be present in
sediments exposed by dredging.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

In the case that dredging must be extended outside of the work window, FTA and WETA have initiated
consultation with NMFS to authorize potential incidental take of federally listed salmonids (see more
detail below on the status of consultation). In addition, dredging outside the work window would require
a waiver from CDFW—which may include specifications such at monitoring by a qualified biologist, and
halting of dredging activities for a specified period if herring spawning activity is noted in the
construction area.
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Determination. The proposed project’s maintenance
dredging activities have the potential to adversely impact special-status and commercially valuable
marine species, including their habitats. With implementation of Mitigation Measure BIO-1 and
adherence to the requirements of NMFS’ Biological Opinion, impacts of maintenance dredging on
special-status and commercially valuable marine species would be reduced, and would not be adverse.
WETA and FTA have also initiated consultation with NMFS under Section 7 of the FESA, and for EFH
under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The Biological Assessment
was submitted to NMFS for further action. FTA’s Biological Assessment included the following
conclusions:


If dredging activities occur during the proposed work window between June 1 and November 30, the
project may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect steelhead, Sacramento River winter-run
Chinook salmon, and Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon.



If dredging activities occur outside of the proposed work window (i.e., between December 1 and
May 31), the project is likely to adversely affect steelhead, Sacramento River winter-run Chinook
salmon, and Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon.



Dredging activities for the project, regardless of timing, are likely to adversely affect green sturgeon.

With regard to designated critical habitat in the action area, for the purposes of the Biological
Assessment, FTA has determined and WETA supports the determination that the project does not
appreciably diminish the value of designated critical habitat for CCC and Central Valley steelhead,
Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon, and green sturgeon. Therefore, the project may affect, but
is not likely to adversely modify, the capability of designated critical habitat for these species to support
the survival and recovery of the species. With regard to EFH in the action area, FTA has determined and
WETA supports the determination that EFH may be disturbed due to dredging activities, which may
adversely affect EFH for Pacific salmon species.
However, the implementation of avoidance and minimization measures described in Mitigation
Measure BIO-1 would minimize these potential effects. These avoidance and minimization measures, in
combination with the ability of these species to move themselves out of the range affected by injurycausing noise and turbidity, would minimize the direct impacts on individuals, and thus on populations of
the species. In addition, as described in more detail in the Biological Assessment, the potential impacts to
species and their habitats (critical habitat and EFH) would be temporary and not likely to result in death
of injury to individuals. The consultation process will be completed prior to the release of the Final
EIS/EIR.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Determination. The proposed project’s maintenance
dredging activities have the potential to impact special-status and commercially valuable marine species,
including their habitats. Mitigation Measure BIO-1 includes measures to reduce the impacts on specialstatus and commercially valuable marine species from maintenance dredging. Therefore, with
implementation of Mitigation Measure BIO-1 and adherence to the requirements of NMFS’ Biological
Opinion, impacts from maintenance dredging would be less than significant with mitigation.

Consequences, and Mitigation

Impact 3.9-2: Potential Adverse Effects of Permanent Fill in San Francisco Bay on
Benthic Habitat and Marine Species
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no physical alterations to the Ferry Terminal would be made; therefore,
there would be no change in the amount of permanent fill of Waters of the United States. Therefore, there
would be no impact.
Action Alternative
The installation of permanent in-water and over-water structures, including piers, gangways, floating
docks, and deck areas, would result in permanent fill in Waters of the United States. The permanent fill
could impact benthic habitat, affecting EFH and marine species in the study area. The fill resulting from
the project consists of two types: 1) permanent fill from structures (piles) that would result in loss of
benthic habitat; and 2) shading from overwater structures, such as floating docks, gangways, and decking.
Although shading would not result in the permanent loss of habitat, it can alter the remaining habitat and
the composition of species that use the habitat. In addition to installing new structures, the proposed
project would remove some existing fill (piles) and overwater structures from the project area.
There are no jurisdictional wetlands, mudflats, eelgrass beds, or other habitats within the study area that
would be defined as “special aquatic sites.” No fill would occur in special aquatic sites.
Permanent Fill Due to Placement of Piles. Under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, placement of
piles would be considered fill in Waters of the United States. Placement of fill would require a permit
from the Corps (Section 404). As detailed in Table 2-2, the proposed project would result in a net
increase of 345 square feet (0.008 acre) of fill in bottom habitat in the North and South Basins. The
placement of piles would be within the existing Ferry Terminal area, which has a number of structures
already in place, and is considered a relatively disturbed environment in comparison to other open water
portions of central San Francisco Bay. The small loss of benthic habitat would be considered negligible
in this environment.
Shading from Overwater Structures. The proposed project improvements would result in a change in
the subtidal area that would be shaded by structures in the project area. There would also be a net
increase of shading of approximately 22,130 square feet (0.50 acre). It should be noted that the net
change in area of shade (both “floating fill” and “shadow fill”) shown in Table 2-2 includes the areas of
fill that would be considered “replacement fill” (areas where an existing structure is removed, but a new
structure is built in its place). Although these “replacement fill” areas can be considered new fill for
certain regulatory purposes, from a biological perspective replacement fill does not represent additional
shading, because this shading already occurs in the existing environment. Therefore, for biological
purposes, the area of shading increase only considers those areas that would represent new shading (i.e.,
subtracts the replacement fill from the net change shown in Table 2-2).
Shade cast from overwater structures reduces the amount of ambient light that can reach into the water
column beneath the structure. It can affect invertebrate and vertebrate community composition, reduce
fish prey forage, and alter fish species composition and predator-prey relationships in comparison to
typical open-water conditions (Nightingale and Simenstad, 2001). Decreased light beneath the structures
could also affect phytoplankton production (which represents the base of the food chain), and the
presence and growth of other marine algae.
San Francisco Bay waters within the Ferry Terminal basin are subject to currents and daily tidal
fluctuations that circulate water through the terminal area. Water flowing beneath the structures due to
tidal currents would limit the duration that phytoplankton cells would be subject to shading conditions.

Water Emergency Transportation Authority
Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Wind waves and tidal currents in San Francisco Bay cause naturally high levels of sediments in
suspension, limiting ambient light penetration and phytoplankton production.
The new structures would be placed within the existing Ferry Terminal area, where a number of
overwater structures already exist. The increased area of shade that would result from the project is small
relative to the size of the surrounding open waters of San Francisco Bay, and the impact on phytoplankton
production and the food chain is expected to be negligible.
The reduction in light resulting from overwater structures can also create “behavioral barriers” that can
deflect or delay fish migration, reduce prey resource production and availability, and alter predator-prey
relationships (Nightingale and Simenstad, 2001). Many predatory fish, such as striped bass (Morone
saxatilis), are associated with in-water structures (Haeseker et al., 1996) and could occur within the area
associated with the new structures. This could result in a slight increase in predation on larval and young
fish in the local project area. This increase would be most pronounced during high tide, when larger
predatory fish move into shallow water to feed. However, larval or young fish are likely to avoid areas
that are shaded by the pier. Due to the daily changes in water depths resulting from tidal action, it is
unlikely that prey fish would remain in this zone for extended periods, and experience large increases in
predation. The impact from the project is expected to be negligible in the current environment of the
Ferry Terminal.
NEPA Determination. Impacts to benthic habitat, affecting EFH and marine species, related to the
placement of fill in the project area would not be adverse.
WETA and FTA have also initiated consultation with NMFS under Section 7 of the FESA, and for EFH
under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The Biological Assessment
was submitted to NMFS for further action. With regard to designated critical habitat in the action area,
for the purposes of the Biological Assessment, FTA has determined and WETA supports the
determination that the project does not appreciably diminish the value of designated critical habitat for
CCC and Central Valley steelhead, Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon, and green sturgeon.
Therefore, the project may affect, but is not likely to adversely modify, the capability of designated
critical habitat for these species to support the survival and recovery of the species. With regard to EFH
in the action area, FTA has determined and WETA supports the determination that EFH may be modified
but modification would be minor. The consultation process will be completed prior to the release of the
Final EIS/EIR.
CEQA Determination. Impacts to benthic habitat, affecting EFH and marine species, related to the
placement of fill in the project area would be less than significant.
Impact 3.9-3: Interference with the Movement of Resident of Migratory Fish or Wildlife
Species Due to Modification of Ferry Terminal Facilities
No Action Alternative
This alternative would not modify the current Ferry Terminal facilities. Therefore, the current movement
of resident or migratory fish or wildlife species would not be altered.
Action Alternative
This alternative would result in the modifications to the Ferry Terminal facilities, through the removal and
installation of additional piers, gangways, floating docks, and pile-supported deck areas. Currently,
structures exist within the project areas that are not known to impede the movement of marine species.
Although the modifications would result in a small net increase in the total area of overwater structures
within the project area, the addition is relatively small. The proposed structures would be supported by

Consequences, and Mitigation

piles, or would be floating platforms. No solid structures, such as a breakwater, are proposed; therefore,
the project would not interfere with the movement of resident or migratory fish or other wildlife species.
NEPA Determination. The project would not adversely impact the movement of resident or migratory
fish or wildlife species.
CEQA Determination. The project would have a less-than-significant impact on the movement of
resident or migratory fish or wildlife species.
Indirect Impacts
The Program EIR for WETA’s expansion of water transit service analyzed the effects of expansion of
service for the system, and the effects of an increase in water transit vessel traffic and operation on San
Francisco Bay, its habitats, and its species. Separate environmental analysis pursuant to NEPA and
CEQA will be prepared for each new route, which analyzing potential impacts at the route origin.
No indirect effects have been identified for this project. The proposed project would not substantially
affect primary productivity or food resources in the study area or surrounding San Francisco Bay, and no
indirect effects to animals higher in the food chain are expected.
Construction Impacts
The No Action Alternative would not result in physical modification to the Ferry Terminal, and no
construction would be required. Therefore, there would be no construction impacts to biological
resources.
Impact 3.9-4: Potential Adverse Effects on Special-Status or Commercially Valuable
Marine Species from Dredging Activities during Construction
Construction of the proposed project would require initial dredging in the Ferry Terminal area for the new
gates. Approximately 29,500 to 33,000 cubic yards of material would be dredged (refer to Table 2-10).
Dredging is expected to take approximately 1 month for Gate A, and 2 months for Gates F and G.
Dredging activities associated with construction could temporarily increase suspended sediments in the
vicinity of the project site (potentially affecting fish and marine mammal behavior and spawning), entrain
fish in the dredging equipment, and result in physical disturbance to benthic organisms in the dredged
area. These effects could be substantial, as discussed in more detail below. Implementation of Mitigation
Measure BIO-1 would require that, to the extent possible, dredging would occur during the LTMS dredge
window of June 1 through November 30. During this time period, sensitive life stages of listed salmonids
are not present in San Francisco Bay. This work window would also avoid the Pacific herring spawning
season. Mitigation Measure BIO-1 also requires the use of the smallest feasible dredge head for
mechanical dredge, to reduce the likelihood of entrainment; and measures to prevent exposure of fish and
other aquatic organisms to contaminants that may be present in sediments exposed by dredging.
Mitigation Measure BIO-1 would minimize impacts to listed and commercially important fish species.
In the case that dredging must be extended outside of the work window, FTA and WETA have initiated
consultation with NMFS to authorize potential incidental take of federally listed salmonids. If dredging
must occur during the herring spawning season, a waiver from CDFW would be required. However these
are only typically granted if unforeseen circumstances arise (i.e., in emergency situations). A waiver, if
granted, may include specifications such as monitoring by a qualified biologist, and halting of dredging
activities for a specified period if herring spawning activity is noted in the construction area.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Green sturgeon and longfin smelt are present in San Francisco Bay all year; therefore, regardless of when
maintenance dredging is conducted, authorization of potential incidental take of these species would be
required. WETA and FTA have initiated consultation with NMFS, under Section 7 of FESA (for green
sturgeon); and would be required to consult with CDFW, under Fish and Game Code Section 2080.1 (for
longfin smelt).
In addition, as discussed in Section 3.11, Hydrology and Water Quality, dredging and other in-water
activities construction activities would comply with Corps, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
RWQCB, and BCDC regulations and conditions in issued permits, including best management practices
for avoiding or reducing potential impacts related to resuspended sediments.
Suspended Sediments
Suspended sediments have been shown to affect fish behavior, including avoidance responses,
territoriality, feeding, and homing behavior. Wilber and Clarke found that suspended sediments result in
cough reflexes, change in swimming activity, and gill flaring. Suspended sediments can have other
impacts, including abrasion to the body and gill clogging (Wilber and Clarke, 2001). Generally, bottomdwelling fish species are most tolerant of suspended solids, and filter feeders are the most sensitive. The
effect of dredging on fish can vary with the life stage; early life stages tend to be more sensitive than
adults. Adult fish (including salmonids, green sturgeon, and longfin smelt) would be motile enough to
avoid areas of high turbidity plumes caused by the dredging, and it is expected that adult fish would avoid
the affected areas during dredging activities. Effects to sensitive life stages of listed salmonids would be
avoided if dredging is conducted during the LTMS dredging work window, during which time the more
sensitive juveniles would not be present in the project area. Dredging activity during the Pacific herring
spawning season (November through March [Watters et al., 2004]) in areas where spawning occurs could
impact the eggs and spawning success. Impacts to spawning Pacific herring could be substantial if
spawning in the project area occurs during dredging operations.
Marine mammals would not be substantially affected by dredging operations. Seals and sea lions forage
over large areas of San Francisco Bay, and can avoid areas of increased turbidity and dredging
disturbance. The disturbance would be temporary.
Increased sediment concentrations in the upper water column can reduce sunlight penetration, and thus
reduce phytoplankton productivity. Turbid plumes from dredging that could limit productivity would be
localized to the project area, and would be small in relation to surrounding areas of San Francisco Bay.
The impact of turbidity on phytoplankton productivity due to decreased light transmission would depend
largely on the difference between background turbidity and increased turbidity from dredged material
during the time period in which dredging takes place. Wind waves and tidal currents in San Francisco
Bay cause naturally high levels of sediments in suspension, limiting ambient light penetration and
phytoplankton production. In conditions typical of the project area, turbidity plumes would be quickly
diluted to near or within background particulate concentrations, generally within the tens of milligrams
per liter (mg/L) to upwards of 150 mg/L in the Central Bay, based on U.S. Geological Survey suspended
sediment monitoring (USGS, 2012). Increased turbidity from dredging activities is expected to have
negligible effect on plankton productivity in central San Francisco Bay.
Entrainment of Organisms
Fishes and invertebrates could be vulnerable to entrainment in dredging equipment, particularly hydraulic
dredges. Dredging for the proposed project would be done with clamshell dredging equipment, which has
a considerably lower likelihood of entraining fish, because fish have the ability to actively avoid the
dredge bucket as it is lowered. Listed fish species, including Chinook salmon, steelhead, green sturgeon,
and longfin smelt, do not spawn in the project area, but adults and juveniles can be present. It is expected
that adults and juveniles would avoid the dredge bucket, and this impact would be negligible.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Disturbance to Benthic Organisms
Dredging would directly impact benthic communities through physical disruption and direct removal of
benthic organisms, resulting in the potential loss of most, if not all, organisms in the dredged area.
Following dredging, disturbed areas are recolonized, beginning with mobile and opportunistic species
(Oliver et al., 1977; Lenihan and Oliver, 1995). These species, characterized by rapid growth and
reproduction, may or may not be the same species that were present in the area prior to the disturbance. San
Francisco Bay harbors more nonindigenous benthic invertebrate species than any other aquatic ecosystem in
North America (Cohen and Carlton, 1995). The introduced species range from approximately 20 to
80 percent (Lee et al., 1999), depending on the area of San Francisco Bay; recolonization may include
nonindigenous species already present in the area. The project is not expected to introduce any new
nonindigenous species from outside San Francisco Bay, because construction equipment to be used in the
water (such as dredging equipment) would not be imported from areas outside San Francisco Bay.
Historically, the benthic communities within the project area have been subject to periodic disturbance for
the demolition, construction, and dredging of the Ferry Terminal and other facilities (e.g., the Bay Area
Rapid Transit tube). 1 Initial dredging during construction would have a negligible effect on central San
Francisco Bay benthic communities, due to the small area of dredging disturbance within an active ferry
terminal. There are no state or federally listed benthic species in the project area.
NEPA Determination. The proposed project’s construction dredging activities have the potential to
adversely impact special-status and commercially valuable marine species. With implementation of
Mitigation Measure BIO-1 and adherence to the requirements of NMFS’ Biological Opinion, the impacts
of construction dredging on special-status and commercially valuable marine species would be reduced,
and would not be adverse.
WETA and FTA also have initiated consultation with NMFS under Section 7 of the FESA, and for EFH
under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The Biological Assessment
was submitted to NMFS for further action. FTA’s Biological Assessment included the following
conclusions:


If dredging activities occur during the proposed work window between June 1 and November 30, the
project may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect steelhead, Sacramento River winter-run
Chinook salmon, and Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon.



If dredging activities occur outside of the proposed work window (i.e., between December 1 and
May 31), the project is likely to adversely affect steelhead, Sacramento River winter-run Chinook
salmon, and Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon.



Dredging activities for the project, regardless of timing, are likely to adversely affect green sturgeon.

With regard to designated critical habitat in the action area, for the purposes of the Biological
Assessment, FTA has determined and WETA supports the determination that the project does not
appreciably diminish the value of designated critical habitat for CCC and Central Valley steelhead,
Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon, and green sturgeon. Therefore, the project may affect, but
is not likely to adversely modify, the capability of designated critical habitat for these species to support
the survival and recovery of the species. With regard to EFH in the action area, FTA has determined and
WETA supports the determination that EFH may be disturbed due to dredging activities, which may
adversely affect EFH for Pacific salmon species.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

However, the implementation of avoidance and minimization measures described in Mitigation
Measure BIO-1 would minimize these potential effects. These avoidance and minimization measures, in
combination with the ability of these species to move themselves out of the range affected by injurycausing noise and turbidity, would minimize the direct impacts on individuals, and thus on populations of
the species. In addition, as described in more detail in the Biological Assessment, the potential impacts to
species and their habitats (critical habitat and EFH) would be temporary and not likely to result in death
of injury to individuals. The consultation process will be completed prior to the release of the Final
EIS/EIR.
CEQA Determination. The proposed project’s construction dredging activities have the potential to
impact special-status and commercially valuable marine species. Mitigation Measure BIO-1 includes
measures to reduce the impacts on special-status and commercially valuable marine species from
construction dredging. Therefore, with implementation of Mitigation Measure BIO-1 and adherence to
the requirements of NMFS’ Biological Opinion, impacts from dredging during construction would be less
than significant with mitigation.
Impact 3.9-5: Potential Adverse Effects to Special-Status Fish and Marine Mammals from
Underwater Sound Generated During Pile Driving
Construction of the proposed project improvements would require pile-driving activities. Pile-driving
activities for the proposed project include impact or vibratory pile driving associated with construction of
the Gate A Access Pier, berthing structures, and the Embarcadero Plaza and East Bayside Promenade; as
well as installation of a fendering “chock block” along Pier 1 and adjacent to Gates E, F, and G. Piles
would be steel, concrete, or wood, depending on the application. Pile types, numbers, and sizes are
described in Chapter 2.
Underwater sound and acoustic pressure resulting from pile driving could affect aquatic resources (e.g.,
fish and marine mammals) by causing behavioral avoidance of the construction area and/or injury to
sensitive species.
Background underwater sound levels in the project area are considered in the assessment of the project’s
construction impacts. Underwater noise in the Ferry Terminal area is regularly generated by small- to
medium-sized boats, including the existing water transit vessels. Based on the 2003 Water Transit
Authority Programmatic EIR, underwater sound levels for water transit vessels ranged from 152 decibels
(dB) to 177 dB (referenced at 1 microPascal at 1 meter) (WETA, 2003a). This data is similar to other
accepted values for similarly sized vessels (Richardson, et al., 1995). Representative underwater noise
levels for San Francisco Bay show that typical ambient noise levels are 120 dB with 133 dB root-meansquare (RMS), as measured in the Oakland Outer Harbor (Caltrans, 2009a). Based on this information,
existing underwater background noise levels in the project area are expected to be 120 dB or greater.
Applicable Criteria for Fish
On July 8, 2008, the Fisheries Hydroacoustic Working Group (FHWG), whose members include NMFS’
Southwest and Northwest Divisions; each of the departments of transportation for the states of California,
Washington, and Oregon; CDFW; and the U.S. Federal Highway Administration, issued an agreement for
the establishment of interim threshold criteria to determine the effects of high-intensity sound on fish
(FHWG, 2008). Although these criteria are not formal regulatory standards, they are generally accepted
as viable criteria for underwater noise effects on fish. Table 3.9-1, NMFS Underwater Noise Thresholds
for Fish, shows the criteria that were established after extensive review of the most recent analyses of the
effect of underwater noise on fish. The FHWG has determined that noise at or above a 206-dB peak level
can cause damage to auditory tissues, the swim bladder, or other sensitive organs. The peak level is the
maximum pressure produced by a sound event, such as a pile strike.

Additionally, FHWG determined that accumulated sound exposure levels (SELs) above 187 dB for large
fish and 183 dB for larval fish (less than 2 grams body weight) are potentially detrimental. Although
injury does not occur, noise levels above the accumulated SEL may cause temporary hearing-threshold
shifts, which may result in temporary decrease in fitness, such as feeding ability. No federal or state
threatened or endangered fish of less than 2 grams body weight would be present in the study area, and
larvae of fish species important to EFH are not expected to occur in large numbers. Therefore, the
187-dB SEL threshold was used for this analysis to assess impacts to fish.
Behavioral effects, such as fleeing and the temporary cessation of feeding or spawning behaviors, could
also result from underwater noise. However, the above criteria do not address these affects. In addition, a
specific criterion has not yet been set by the FHWG for continuous noise, such as vibratory driving, so the
same criteria as impulse-type noise are used.
Applicable Criteria for Marine Mammals
Levels of harassment for marine mammals are defined in the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.
Level A harassment is defined as “Any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance which has the potential to
injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild.” Level B harassment is defined as “Any act
of pursuit, torment, or annoyance which has the potential to disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal
stock in the wild by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, including but not limited to migration,
breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding or sheltering.” Any activities that may result in harassment of marine
mammals under these guidelines would require an Incidental Harassment Authorization from the NMFS.
For marine mammals, NMFS criteria define exposure to underwater sound pressure level from impulse
sounds at or above 160 dB RMS 2 as constituting harassment to marine mammals. NMFS has determined
that sound pressure levels above 190 dB RMS can cause temporary hearing impairment in marine
mammals. NMFS also distinguishes between impulse sound—such as that from impact pile driving, and
continuous sound—such as that from vibratory pile driving. Table 3.9-2, NMFS Level A and B Harassment
Thresholds for Marine Mammals, shows the current Level A (injury) and Level B (disturbance) threshold
levels for cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) (NMFS, 2005).

Root-mean-square measures the average noise energy measured over a 35-millisecond period. Note that this is a different type
of measurement than the peak sound or sound exposure level used to measure impacts to fish (NOAA, 2012).

Assessing Sound Levels from Project Construction
Reference sound levels were based on underwater sound measurements documented for a number of piledriving projects with similar pile sizes and types at similar sites (i.e., estuarine areas of soft substrate
where water depths are less than 16 feet [Caltrans, 2009a]). The noise energy would dissipate as it
spreads from the pile at a rate of roughly 4.5 dB per doubling of distance (Caltrans, 2009a). This is a
conservative value for areas of shallow water with soft substrates, and actual dissipation rates would
likely be higher. Using this information, and the number and size of piles presented in Chapter 2,
underwater sound levels were estimated to determine whether the thresholds described above would be
exceeded. Results are shown in Table 3.9-3.
As shown in Table 3.9-3, pile-driving activities would exceed levels that would cause injury to fish
(206 dB peak) for impact driving of steel piles at distances of 22 feet for 24-inch piles, 43 feet for 36-inch
piles, and up to 57 feet for the largest (42-inch) piles for the berthing structure. Vibratory driving of steel
or wood piles and impact driving of concrete or wood piles would not generate sound levels in excess of
the 206-dB level that could cause injury. Within the distances shown in Table 3.9-3, fish may be exposed
to sound levels above the 187-dB SEL threshold, which may result in temporary reduction of hearing
capacity or temporary changes in behavior, but would not be expected to cause injury or mortality.
Similarly, impact driving of steel piles would exceed levels that would cause injury (Level A harassment)
to seals and sea lions (190 dB RMS) within about 33 to 65 feet of the pile, depending on pile size. The
analysis indicates that the Level A threshold for cetaceans (i.e., whales and dolphins) would be exceeded
at distances of up to 252 feet of impact pile driving of steel piles. However, it is unlikely that whales or
other cetaceans would enter the Ferry Terminal area in such close proximity to the project construction
activities.
Marine mammals may be exposed to levels exceeding the Level B harassment guidelines (160 dB for
impact pile driving and 120 dB for vibratory piles driving) over the distances displayed in Table 3.9-3.
For impact pile driving, the Level B thresholds could be exceeded within 1,920 to 3,779 feet of piledriving activities for steel piles. Impact driving of concrete piles, if used, would produce lower sound

levels, and a radius of Level B harassment of about 252 feet. For vibratory pile driving of steel piles, the
Level B thresholds could be exceeded at greater distances from the project site. However, as discussed
above, existing ambient underwater noise levels in the project area are expected to be 120 dB or greater,
which is the same as the threshold level. Marine mammals would not be affected by the underwater noise
generated during construction in areas where the ambient noise levels are the same as or greater than the
construction noise levels.
To minimize the effect of project construction noise on fish and marine mammals (i.e., avoidance
behavior, fleeing responses, temporary hearing impairment, or the temporary cessation of feeding),
Mitigation Measures BIO-1 and BIO-2 will be implemented. Mitigation Measure BIO-1 would reduce
the construction noise impacts to sensitive life stages of listed salmonids by requiring that pile driving be
conducted between June 1 and November 30, if feasible. In addition, Mitigation Measure BIO-2 requires
that hydroacoustic and biological monitoring for fish and marine mammals be conducted during
construction, and that corrective measures be implemented, in coordination with NMFS, if underwater
sound levels exceed the threshold in this analysis.
NEPA Determination. Underwater sound levels from pile driving during construction could adversely
affect fish and marine mammals. With implementation of Mitigation Measures BIO-1 and BIO-2, and
adherence to the requirements of NMFS’ Biological Opinion, these impacts would be reduced and would
not be adverse.
WETA and FTA have also initiated consultation with NMFS under Section 7 of the FESA, and for EFH
under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The Biological Assessment
was submitted to NMFS for further action. FTA’s Biological Assessment included the following
conclusions:


If pile-driving activities occur during the proposed work window between June 1 and November 30,
the project may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect steelhead, Sacramento River winter-run
Chinook salmon, and Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon.



If pile-driving activities occur outside of the proposed work window (i.e., between December 1 and
May 31), the project is likely to adversely affect steelhead, Sacramento River winter-run Chinook
salmon, and Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon.



Pile-driving for the project, regardless of timing, are likely to adversely affect green sturgeon.

With regard to designated critical habitat in the action area, for the purposes of the Biological
Assessment, FTA has determined and WETA supports the determination that the project does not
appreciably diminish the value of designated critical habitat for CCC and Central Valley steelhead,
Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon, and green sturgeon. Therefore, the project may affect, but
is not likely to adversely modify, the capability of designated critical habitat for these species to support
the survival and recovery of the species. With regard to EFH in the action area, FTA has determined and
WETA supports the determination that although only in the short term and only during construction
activities, the project may adversely affect EFH in the action area through the noise-related impacts and
disturbance due to pile driving.
However, the implementation of avoidance and minimization measures described in Mitigation
Measures BIO-1 and BIO-2 would minimize these potential effects. These avoidance and minimization
measures, in combination with the ability of these species to move themselves out of the range affected by
injury-causing noise and turbidity, would minimize the direct impacts on individuals, and thus on
populations of the species. In addition, as described in more detail in the Biological Assessment, the
potential impacts to species and their habitats (critical habitat and EFH) would be temporary and not

likely to result in death of injury to individuals. The consultation process will be completed prior to the
release of the Final EIS/EIR.
CEQA Determination. Underwater sound levels from pile driving during construction could exceed
thresholds for both injury and behavioral effects on fish and marine mammals. Injury thresholds would
be exceeded primarily during impact driving of steel piles (impact driving of concrete pile would only
exceed criteria for whales and dolphins, over a small distance [15 feet] from the pile). Mitigation
Measures BIO-1 and BIO-2 would be implemented. Mitigation Measure BIO-1 would reduce the
construction noise impacts to sensitive life stages of listed salmonids by requiring that pile driving be
conducted between June 1 and November 30, if feasible. In addition, Mitigation Measure BIO-2 requires
that hydroacoustic and biological monitoring for fish and marine mammals be conducted during
construction, and that corrective measures be implemented, in coordination with NMFS, if underwater
sound levels exceed the threshold in this analysis. Therefore, with implementation of Mitigation
Measures BIO-1 and BIO-2, and adherence to the requirements of NMFS’ Biological Opinion, impacts to
fish and marine mammals from underwater sound would be less than significant with mitigation
incorporated.
Impact 3.9-6: Interference with the Movement of Resident or Migratory Fish or Wildlife
Species During Construction
The Action Alternative would involve the demolition and removal of existing piers, and the installation of
additional in-water and over-water structures. The noise and in-water disturbance associated with these
activities could cause fish and wildlife species to temporarily avoid the immediate construction area when
work is being conducted.
The proposed project location is in the Central Bay, which is a major corridor used by fish and marine
mammals as they move between different habitats in San Francisco Bay and open ocean. However, the
affected area would be limited to the immediate construction zone, and would not substantially limit the
available habitat or movement of fish, seabirds, or marine mammals in San Francisco Bay if these animals
avoid the immediate construction area.
NEPA Determination. The project would not adversely impact the movement or migration of fish or
wildlife species during construction.
CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to impact the movement or migration of fish or wildlife
species during construction would be less than significant.
Cumulative Impacts
Impact 3.9-7. Potential to Result in Cumulative Impacts on Biological Resources
The geographic area of potential biological cumulative impacts is central San Francisco Bay.
The proposed project could result in adverse biological effects related to construction activities in the waters
of San Francisco Bay due to dredging and noise from construction activities. Other projects along the
waterfront, such as the America’s Cup Project, Port of San Francisco maintenance dredging, the Bay Bridge
Seismic Safety Project, the Pier 36/Brannan Street Wharf Project, and the Pier 15 to 17 Exploratorium
Relocation Project, could involve activities similar to the proposed Ferry Terminal modifications that could
also affect biological resources in central San Francisco Bay. The in- and over-water construction activities
associated with these projects could result in adverse cumulative impacts related to underwater noise and the
adverse impacts associated with dredging (e.g., disruption of bottom sediments, increases in turbidity,
disturbance of benthic habitat, temporary loss or reduction of habitat suitable for sensitive fish species,

mortality of fishes from entrainment in dredging equipment, or alteration of behavior of marine
mammals).
Construction activities for each project would be temporary, and it is unlikely that construction on the
various projects listed above would occur simultaneously with the proposed project construction
activities. WETA would comply with existing regulations, requirements, and conditions in permits from
the Corps, NMFS, RWQCB, CDFW, and BCDC for dredging and underwater noise impacts (see
Section 3.11, Hydrology and Water Quality, and Section 3.12, Hazards and Hazardous Materials), which
would minimize and/or avoid adverse impacts associated with dredging. In addition, WETA would
implement Mitigation Measures BIO-1 and BIO-2 to further reduce dredging and underwater noise
impacts. For these reasons, the project’s contribution to adverse cumulative construction impacts to
biological resources would not be cumulatively considerable.
The proposed project’s maintenance dredging and placement of permanent fill in San Francisco Bay
could also have an adverse effect on biological resources. Other projects along the waterfront, such as the
America’s Cup Project, Port of San Francisco maintenance dredging, the Bay Bridge Seismic Safety
Project, the Pier 36/Brannan Street Wharf Project, and the Pier 15 to 17 Exploratorium Relocation Project,
could also affect biological resources in central San Francisco Bay similarly (with the need for ongoing
dredging or the placements of permanent fill). These activities could cumulatively impact biological
resources by impacting water quality, increasing shading, and increasing permanent fill in central San
Francisco Bay. The increase in permanent fill could impact benthic habitat, affecting EFH and marine
species. An increase in shading can alter the remaining habitat and the composition of species that use
the habitat. In 2010, approximately 2,000,000 cubic yards of material was dredged for maintenance
dredging projects in San Francisco Bay (DMMO, 2011). Maintenance dredging activities for the project
would be small and infrequent (5,000 to 10,000 cubic yards of material every 3 or 4 years) in comparison
to the ongoing maintenance dredging programs in San Francisco Bay. In addition, WETA would comply
with existing regulations, requirements, and conditions in permits from the Corps, NMFS, RWQCB,
CDFW, and BCDC for dredging (see Section 3.11, Hydrology and Water Quality, and Section 3.12,
Hazards and Hazardous Materials), which would minimize and/or avoid adverse impacts associated with
dredging. In addition, WETA would implement Mitigation Measures BIO-1, further reducing dredging
impacts. Therefore, the proposed project’s contribution to cumulative dredging impacts would not be
considerable.
Fill within the terminal area, including shading, is small relative to surrounding open areas of San
Francisco Bay. Although the increase in project-related fill would combine with fill associated with other
projects and result in a cumulative increase of fill in San Francisco Bay, the amount of fill for the
proposed project would be small and placed in an area that is already substantially altered by Ferry
Terminal facilities, and therefore less likely to affect habitat, species, and species behavior. Therefore,
the fill from the proposed project would not be considered cumulatively considerable.
The proposed project would not result in adverse effects related to fill in, or disturbance of, special
aquatic sites; movement of migratory species; or conflicts with any Habitat Conservation Plans or other
natural community conservation plans. Therefore, the project would not contribute to cumulative effects
related to these biological resources.
NEPA Determination. The proposed project, in combination with other reasonably foreseeable projects
in central San Francisco Bay, has the potential to adversely cumulatively impact biological resources.
However, the project’s contribution to cumulative biological impacts would not be considerable.
CEQA Determination. The proposed project, in combination with other reasonably foreseeable projects
in central San Francisco Bay, has the potential to cumulatively impact biological resources. However, the
project’s contribution to cumulative biological impacts would not be considerable, and therefore would be
less than significant.

Mitigation Measures

Mitigation Measure BIO-1: Dredging and Pile-Driving Measures
The following measures will be implemented to reduce the impacts of dredging and pile driving on
special-status fish and other aquatic species:


During impact pile driving of steel piles, the applicant will use a bubble curtain or other attenuation
device to attenuate underwater sound levels;



Impact hammers will be cushioned using a 12-inch-thick wood cushion block;



Only a single impact hammer will be operated at a time; and



If a mechanical dredge is used, the applicant will use the smallest possible dredge head to reduce the
likelihood of fish becoming entrained in the mechanical dredge.

WETA plans to conduct all piling installation and dredging between approved work windows, between
June 1 and November 30, when the likelihood of sensitive fish species being present in the work area is
minimal (LTMS, 1998).
Until Final Design is completed and a contractor is selected, WETA will not be able to make a final
determination as to whether piling installation or dredging must occur at times other than the approved
work window. In addition, factors beyond WETA’s control, such as requirements of other agencies or
conflicting timing requirements, may prevent WETA from conducting all piling installation and dredging
within the approved work window.
The project sponsors will undertake formal FESA and CESA consultation with NOAA, NMFS, and
CDFW to identify avoidance and minimization methods that will be implemented to reduce effects on
sensitive marine resources. Methods may include monitoring by a qualified biologist, and halting of
dredging or pile-driving activities for a specific period if spawning activity is noted within the
construction area. In addition to the avoidance and minimization measures identified here, the project
sponsors will comply with additional measures and requirements identified through consultation with
NOAA, NMFS and CDFW.
Mitigation Measure BIO-2: Hydroacoustic and Biological Monitoring and Avoidance
Measures
WETA will minimize sound level exposure from the project to marine mammals and fish. The
performance standards for these minimization efforts are described later in this measure. To provide the
final implementation level details, WETA will develop a Hydroacoustic and Biological Monitoring Plan
in consultation with NMFS, prior to the start of construction. This plan will provide detail on the
methods used to monitor and verify sound levels during pile-driving activities. The plan will include
specific measures to minimize exposure of marine mammals and fish to high sound levels. At a
minimum, avoidance and minimization measures will meet the following performance standards, and will
include the following methods:


Underwater noise levels will be measured during pile-driving activities to determine the distance at
which sound levels do not exceed injury thresholds for fish (206 dB) or marine mammals (Level A
thresholds [180 dB RMS or 190 dB RMS]).



A “soft start” technique shall be employed in all pile driving to give marine mammals an opportunity
to vacate the area.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation



If an activity produces underwater sound levels that exceed injury the threshold for fish or marine
mammals, work will be stopped and sound levels will be reduced through noise control measures
such as the installation of NMFS-approved attenuation devices (e.g., bubble curtains) or modification
of construction methods (such as using cushioning between the hammer and pile).



An NMFS-approved biological monitor will monitor the installation of at least 10 percent of the
24- to 42-inch-diameter steel piles that will be installed by impact hammer. During initial impact
pile-driving efforts, a default exclusion zone at a distance of 500 feet from the pile will be monitored
for the presence of marine mammals. The area will be monitored for 30 minutes prior to impact
driving. No driving will be conducted until the area has been free of marine mammal sightings for
30 minutes. If no marine mammals are sighted, driving will begin, and hydroacoustic monitoring will
be conducted.

AESTHETICS AND VISUAL RESOURCES

3.10.1 Introduction to the Analysis
This section describes the existing aesthetics and visual resources in the study area and the project area, as
well as views of and views from the project area to the surrounding San Francisco waterfront. The
section also describes the state, regional, and local regulatory framework and policies that would apply to
the project. Potential impacts related to the blocking of views, addition of light and glare, and changes to
the visual character of the study area are addressed. As described below, the project alternatives would
not result in adverse changes to the study area that would be substantial or significant. No mitigation
would be necessary.
3.10.2 Affected Environment
This section describes existing aesthetics and visual resources in the study area, and also provides a
regulatory framework describing applicable policies and plans relevant to these resources.
Existing Setting
Study Area
The study area for the aesthetics and visual resources analysis includes the project area, as well as those
publicly accessible areas in the project vicinity where the proposed project improvements would be
visible. The project area extends from Pier 1 on the north to Pier 14 on the south, from The Embarcadero
on the west to San Francisco Bay on the east, and includes the San Francisco Ferry Building (Ferry
Building), water transit gates, and the Agriculture Building. The publicly accessible areas in the study
area include open areas within the project area (such as along the perimeter of the Ferry Building), the
sidewalks and open spaces generally to the west of the project area, and San Francisco Bay.
Character of the Waterfront
The San Francisco waterfront defines the urban edge of the eastern and northern portions of the City and
County of San Francisco (CCSF). Although the downtown area is dominated by high-rise buildings, the
area closest to the water and in the study area is characterized by smaller-scale commercial structures and
large open spaces, such as Justin Herman Plaza.
The overall character of the waterfront is generally characterized by bulkhead buildings and piers, with
maritime and other uses, parking areas, and open spaces. The bulkhead buildings and piers are the
primary visual elements along the waterfront, their spacing broken up by open spaces that invite public
use and provide scenic views of San Francisco Bay. The buildings in the study area represent a mixture
of modern and historic elements. Modern buildings and elements (e.g., Sinbad’s restaurant on Pier 2, and
the water transit gates) are located alongside historic buildings (e.g., the Agriculture Building, Ferry
Building, and Pier 1). The visual elements of The Embarcadero and Embarcadero Promenade 1 create a
well-defined linear element that provides visual continuity along the waterfront.
The Embarcadero extends for 3 miles along the waterfront, and features specifically designed amenities,
including lamp posts, bollards, streetcar platforms and shelters, sidewalks with decorative pavers, and the
Art Ribbon—consisting of concrete blocks that contain a continuous band of light following the path of
the Embarcadero Promenade. The amenities comprise complimentary colors, materials, and styles that
provide visual continuity and connections among the different facilities and uses along The Embarcadero/
Embarcadero Promenade. The waterfront along The Embarcadero is generally devoid of vegetation;

“The Embarcadero” generally refers to the roadway, and “the Embarcadero Promenade” refers to the 25-foot-wide pedestrian
promenade on the water side of The Embarcadero.

however, pockets of park-like open space are occasionally interspersed among maritime and
transportation uses. The median and perimeter of the roadway include rows of ornamental palm trees.
As described in more detail in Section 3.4, Parklands and Recreation, to the west of the project area are
three public open spaces: Harry Bridges Plaza, Justin Herman Plaza, and Sue Bierman Park. Harry
Bridges Plaza is a paved area between the north- and southbound lanes of The Embarcadero. To the west
and northwest of Harry Bridges Plaza, grass and trees planted in Justin Herman Plaza and Sue Bierman
Park soften the concrete façades and sharp angles of nearby structures in the project area, and of the highrise buildings in the Financial District and the South of Market Area.
The primary visual element in the study area is the Ferry Building, which dominates the view from within
the project area and areas surrounding the project site. Its iconic presence is described in the Waterfront
Design and Access Element as the “focal point of this area and indeed, the centerpiece of the Waterfront”
(Port, 2004). The placement and design of the businesses and outdoor amenities that occupy the ground
level of the Ferry Building add texture and color, contrasting with the austere and monumental quality of
the building’s façade. The Ferry Building is in the Beaux Arts style, and was completed in 1892. The
Ferry Building currently operates as a mixed-use retail and office building, encompassing office space,
retail marketplace space, open-air cafes, and restaurants. In addition, on Tuesdays and Saturdays, the
Ferry Plaza Farmers Market temporarily occupies the open spaces in front of the Ferry Building; and on
Saturdays, it also occupies the Ferry Plaza.
Figure 3.10-1, Views 1 and 2, generally show the aesthetics of the study area.
Views
From the east, the project site can be seen from Treasure Island, Yerba Buena Island, and from the upper
deck of the Bay Bridge, as well as from boats on San Francisco Bay. These views from the east
encompass the piers and commercial structures on both sides of the Ferry Building, whose clock tower
visibly punctuates the low San Francisco skyline (see Figure 3.10-1, View 2). Depending on the distance
from the project area, the low profile buildings and structures in the project area are only barely visible
against the San Francisco skyline (as shown in Figure 3.10-1, View 2). However, as the viewer
approaches the project area, the views from this perspective are framed on the south by the distinctive red
brick and Mediterranean style of the Agriculture Building and the Pier 14 breakwater, and on the north by
Pier 1, which together visually enclose the basins housing the water transit gates. Surrounding the study
area is a mix of urban landscapes where building heights taper, heading north toward Telegraph Hill; and
contain a variety of heights heading south toward the Bay Bridge (Figure 3.10-1, View 2).
Views of the project area from the west, from Justin Herman Plaza, Market Street or Harry Bridges Plaza,
contain the visual elements of the Ferry Building, the Agriculture Building, Pier 1, The Embarcadero, the
Embarcadero Promenade, and passing vehicles and pedestrians (Figure 3.10-1, Views 3, 4, and 5). Views
of the project site from Market Street are influenced by the Ferry Building, which serves as the visual
focal point for views down this corridor. As the viewer moves south toward Mission Street along Steuart
Street, Gate E, the Agriculture Building, Sinbad’s Restaurant on Pier 2, and San Francisco Bay become
visible. The majority of these views are partially obstructed by physical objects typical of the urban
landscape, including signs, lamp posts, overhead utilities, streetscape decorative features, street trees, and
pedestrian and transit facilities. Views at street level can become temporarily obstructed by traffic
operating along The Embarcadero. Looking from Justin Herman Plaza toward The Embarcadero and
project site, some existing views to the water are obstructed by buildings. Due to the low height of the
Agriculture Building, views also include the Bay Bridge and East Bay hills in the distance.
South of the Ferry Building, the view to the southeast opens to the Agriculture Building, spanning an
open-water area (Figure 3.10-1, View 8). Walkways around the open-water area provide access to Pier 2

and Gate E, both between the Ferry Building and Agriculture Building (Figure 3.10-1, View 9); the Bay
Bridge is visible in the distance. Looking south from the Ferry Plaza area, the view of waterfront
walkways and open spaces south of Mission Street is generally obstructed by the Agriculture Building,
but is visible from various vantage points in the Ferry Plaza. Looking north from the Ferry Plaza, views
include the existing water transit gates in the foreground and Telegraph Hill in the distance
(Figure 3.10-1, View 10).
Existing Lighting of the Project Area
Within the project area, the open spaces and walkways leading to the existing gates are lit by regularly
spaced vertical light standards, as well as old-fashioned street lamps. Additional lighting emanates from
the Ferry Building and from external fixtures that either extend over adjacent pedestrian areas, or are
recessed into the overhangs on the western side of the Ferry Building. All modern outdoor lighting
fixtures and lighting standards are directed down, minimizing glare. Gates B and E contain internal
lighting fixtures that project light onto the roof of the berthing structure, creating a vibrant glow for water
transit passengers, while enhancing pedestrian safety and security. Lighting along The Embarcadero
illuminates the roadway and sidewalks on the western side of the Ferry Building, and spills into and
contributes to the luminescence of the pedestrian areas north and south of the Ferry Building.
Regulatory Setting
No federal regulations pertain to visual resources in the study area.
State
California’s Scenic Highway Program was created by the state legislature in 1963. Its purpose is to
protect and enhance the natural scenic beauty of California highways and adjacent corridors, through
special conservation treatment. The scenic highway program consists of eligible and officially designated
routes. A highway may be designated as eligible for listing as a state scenic highway if it offers travelers
scenic views of the natural landscape, largely undisrupted by development. Eligible routes advance to
officially designated status when the local jurisdiction adopts ordinances to establish a scenic corridor
protection program, and receives approval from the California Department of Transportation. In San
Francisco, Interstate 80 and Highway 1 are designated as eligible state scenic highways. Interstate 80, the
closest eligible state scenic highway to the project, is approximately 1,800 feet south of the project site.
Regional
San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission Public Access Design Guidelines
and Bay Plan
The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) is charged with
maintaining public access, including visual public access (i.e., views to San Francisco Bay from other
public spaces) within its jurisdiction. Visual access can be achieved through thoughtful site planning and
design, including building massing, to enhance San Francisco Bay sight lines and views. BCDC
developed public access objectives in the Shoreline Space Public Access Design Guidelines (BCDC,
2005), to provide, maintain, and enhance visual access to and visual quality of San Francisco Bay and
shoreline. These policies encourage shoreline development that would allow San Francisco Bay views
and access between buildings, by locating buildings, structures, parking lots, and landscaping of new
shoreline projects in ways that enhance and dramatize views of San Francisco Bay and the shoreline from
public thoroughfares and other public spaces. The visual quality of any shoreline development proposal
should relate directly to a set of site-specific factors. Incorporating design principles such as human scale,
architectural diversity, and varied building massing can lead to well-designed waterfront buildings and
shoreline access areas. The design character of public access areas should relate to the scale and intensity

Consequences, and Mitigation

of the proposed development. The objectives related to visual access and visual quality may be
accomplished by providing visual interest and architectural variety in massing and height to new
buildings along the shoreline, and/or using forms, materials, colors, and textures that are compatible with
San Francisco Bay and adjacent development. In addition, BCDC’s Bay Plan specifies that diverse views
of San Francisco Bay, CCSF, and the waterfront should be provided at frequent intervals along The
Embarcadero, from public plazas, and public piers (BCDC, 2008). The Bay Plan requires that every
effort be made to provide, enhance, and preserve views of San Francisco Bay and the shoreline, especially
those views from public areas and from San Francisco Bay.
Local
San Francisco General Plan
The San Francisco General Plan Urban Design Element (CCSF, 1998) provides policies and objectives to
guide urban design decisions, including aesthetics. The Urban Design Element calls for preserving and
enhancing views and visual quality, as well as for new development to complement existing patterns of
development. In addition, the General Plan states that access to San Francisco Bay should be considered
as a total system that includes physical contact with the water and the shore, and visual contact through
views of the water and water-related activities.
Northeastern Waterfront Area Plan. The Northeastern Waterfront Area Plan, an element of the
General Plan, provides specific objectives and policies for the Northeastern Waterfront to enhance its
unique aesthetic qualities and its historic maritime character. Policies of the Northeastern Waterfront
Area Plan call for maintaining low structures near the water, and increasing vertical development toward
downtown, preserving and creating view corridors toward the Piers 1 to 5 bulkhead buildings, preserving
the prominence of the Ferry Building, and removing surface parking along The Embarcadero.
Port of San Francisco Waterfront Land Use Plan
The study area is within the Ferry Building Subarea of the Port of San Francisco (Port) Waterfront Land
Use Plan. This area extends from Pier 5 to Pier 22, and includes, from north to south, Pier 1½, Pier 1,
Pier ½, the Ferry Building and the Ferry Plaza, Pier 2, and the Agriculture Building. The Waterfront
Design and Access Element is a component of the Waterfront Land Use Plan, and is intended to guide the
physical form of waterfront revitalization. The Waterfront Design and Access Element provides policy
for the preservation and development of public access and open space, views, and historic resources, as
well as architectural design criteria to be applied to new development. The Waterfront Design and
Access Element contains objectives to maintain existing building height and bulk limitations, provide
visual and physical access to San Francisco Bay, and protect and frame near and distant views to and
from San Francisco Bay, particularly along major CCSF streets. Specifically, Port design guidelines call
for new construction to be low-scale to protect views, and to maintain the visual character and design of
existing maritime uses.
Port of San Francisco Waterfront Land Use Plan Design and Access Element. The Waterfront
Design and Access Element addresses the nature of public access and open spaces along the waterfront.
It includes special emphasis on public access and open spaces, and provides design criteria for the Port
Walk, which creates continuous waterfront pedestrian access from the Embarcadero Promenade south of
the Agriculture Building to the southern edge of Pier 1.
The project site is in the Ferry Building Subarea of the Design and Access Element of the Waterfront
Land Use Plan. The overarching goal of the plan is to reunite the City with a continuously accessible
waterfront. The plan contains policies for the historic preservation of the Ferry Building and its adaptive
reuse; support of the Ferry Building’s prominence as a civic focal point on the waterfront; and
preservation of views of the historic buildings on streets connecting the city to the waterfront. Policies

support the connection of open spaces at the Ferry Building with nearby Justin Herman Plaza and Rincon
Park; the design of Ferry Building open spaces to reflect the civic character already established by the
Ferry Building, Agriculture Building, and bulkhead buildings; and the provision of connections to openwater areas.
The plan contains specific design criteria for the Ferry Plaza, which includes areas next to and behind the
Ferry and Agriculture Buildings and Pier ½. The project site is in the Ferry Plaza area. Design criteria
for this area are listed below.
Site
Massing: New Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal) structures should not
detract from the character of the Ferry Building and its dominance in the area.
Open Water: Ends of Ferry Building: Limit new structures to the minimum necessary to serve ferry
passengers and excursion patrons, to maintain views from The Embarcadero to San Francisco Bay.
Remove that portion of Pier ½ not required for a vessel berthing facility and public access, and the
northern portion of Pier 2, and locate water and boating uses as close to the Embarcadero Promenade
as feasible in the Pier ½ area.
Views: Ends of Ferry Building – Remove Pier ½ parking and relocate the Pier 2 restaurant structure
to enhance views of San Francisco Bay and boating activity from The Embarcadero.
Pier Shape: Limit changes to pier shape, if any, to those that allow waterside public access
improvements, or accommodate ferry and maritime operations.
Orientation
Orientation: Activate the Ferry Plaza by allowing surrounding commercial and other uses to spill
out onto the Ferry Plaza, provided they are compatible with ferry operations and the Ferry Plaza’s
function as a public space.
Edge: Water Side of the Ferry Building – Provide public access on the water side of the Ferry
Building (appropriately scaled to the Ferry Building) and on breakwaters throughout the Ferry
Terminal area, while also providing for ferry and excursion boat queuing.
Architectural Details
Character: New Development – The architectural character of any new development should be
compatible with the scale, proportions, materials, colors, and rhythm of openings of adjacent historic
structures.
Character: Ferry Plaza – Use pavement surfacing to reinforce pedestrian uses as the dominant use,
although areas may be shared with vehicle circulation.
Public Improvements: New railings and urban furniture should reflect the civic character of the
Ferry Building.
Service
Trash Enclosures: Locate trash facilities within structures.

Designated or Eligible Scenic Roads
In 1938, San Francisco Downtown Association created the 49-mile Scenic Drive to highlight San
Francisco’s scenic beauty. The route passes through the study area along The Embarcadero. Although
there are no associated plans or policies related to the Scenic Drive, streets the route follows are
recognized for their aesthetic value.
3.10.3 Impact Evaluation
The analysis considered whether the project would:






Create a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista;
Substantially damage scenic resources, including (but not limited to) trees, rock outcroppings, and
other features of the built or natural environment that contribute to a scenic public setting;
Substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of the site and its surroundings;
Create a new source of substantial light or glare that would adversely affect daytime or nighttime
views in the area, or that would substantially affect other people or properties; or
Substantially contrast with the scale or visual context of the surrounding landscape.

Alterations to the study area viewshed were assessed. Views and vistas to and from the study area were
evaluated based on site visits, through use of photographs of the existing setting, and through renderings
and descriptions of the proposed project. The renderings show how the height, bulk, texture, and design
of proposed facilities would relate to what exists today. Impacts to San Francisco Bay views and views of
the project area from the surrounding area were examined, including impacts related to light and glare
emanating from new project-related facilities; view alteration for pedestrians, bicyclists, and users of
public open space along the waterfront; and changes in landscaping and urban design as a result of the
project. Attention was given to potential impacts of the project on San Francisco Bay, a scenic vista in
the project area. Changes or alterations to the view, building character, design, or glare on the Ferry
Building, the Agriculture Building, and Pier 1—historic resources that are in close proximity to proposed
project facilities—are examined in detail in Section 3.8, Cultural and Paleontological Resources, and
referenced below, as appropriate.
Direct Impacts
Impact 3.10-1: Potential to Substantially Alter or Block Views of Scenic Vistas or
Resources
No Action Alternative
No new structures would be built that would alter or block views of scenic vistas (e.g., views to San
Francisco Bay and the San Francisco skyline) or resources (e.g., the Ferry Building, Agriculture Building,
and Pier 1). Therefore, there would be no impact to these resources as a result of the No Action
Alternative.
Action Alternative
For the Action Alternative, deck and pile structures would be demolished (e.g., Pier 2), and vertical
elements (e.g., new gates and weather protection canopies) and horizontal elements (e.g., deck and pile
structures for passenger boarding and circulation areas) would be constructed that could affect publicly
accessible views of scenic vistas and visual resources in the study area.
Three new gates would be constructed. The berthing structures at each gate would consist of concrete or
steel floats approximately 45 feet wide by 115 feet long, steel truss gangways approximately 12 to 14 feet

Consequences, and Mitigation

wide, entrance portals, and float canopies, similar to the existing Gates B and E. Weather protection
canopies would also be constructed in both the North and South Basins along passenger queuing areas.
These linear canopies would be approximately 20 feet wide and 18 to 20 feet high, and constructed of
steel and glass; these canopies could include photovoltaic cells.
Additional horizontal elements would be constructed or repaired to improve passenger circulation and
access to the new gates, including the Gate A Access Pier, North Basin Marginal Wharf, Embarcadero
Plaza, East Bayside Promenade, and the South Apron of the Agriculture Building. Figures 2-3, 2-5,
and 2-6 contain simulated views of the proposed project elements. The Port’s and BCDC’s design
guidelines promote aesthetic planning criteria that guide the initial development of projects in a manner
consistent with preservation of views and scenic resources. The proposed project has been preliminarily
designed to comply with the guidelines. In addition, during final design, and as required by the BCDC
permit process and the Port project approval process, the project’s final design will go through a joint Port
and BCDC design review process. This process ensures the project’s final design consistency with each
agency’s design guidelines and policies.
Gate A, in the North Basin, would require the construction of a 30-foot-wide, 265-foot-long pier to
provide access to the berthing facilities. The Gate A Access Pier would be constructed where Pier ½ 2 was
located, and Gate A would be located to the east of where Pier ½ previously ended (see Figure 2-1).
Figure 3.10-1, View 6, shows the area where Gate A and the Gate A Access Pier would be constructed,
with Pier 1 in the background. Figure 3.10-1, View 3, is a ground-level view from public areas along The
Embarcadero to the North Basin, with views of the Bay Bridge and Treasure Island in the background; it
also shows the area where Gate A and the Gate A Access Pier would be constructed. Views of this area
after implementation of the proposed project would contain an access pier, entry portal, gangway, and
float for Gate A, as well as the weather protection canopies for Gate A and Gate B. The Gate A float
would be similar in height and material to the existing float at Gate B (see Figures 2-3 and 2-5), and
would therefore be of similar scale, color, and texture. Depending on the specific viewer vantage point,
the features in the North Basin could potentially block views of the background (i.e., areas beyond the
North Basin), including San Francisco Bay and portions of Treasure Island and the Bay Bridge.
However, this impact is anticipated to be minor due to the limited width, height, and massing of the new
features, and the abundance of adjacent vantage points that would retain these views. The weather
protection canopies in the North Basin could potentially block portions of the public’s views of the Ferry
Building and Pier 1 from along The Embarcadero, depending on the vantage point. However, because of
their relatively low vertical profiles, light massing, and glass features, these project elements would have
minimal visual impact, particularly when compared to the overall scale of the Ferry Building and Pier 1.
The weather protection canopies would stand no higher than 20 feet, far below the heights of the adjacent
buildings, and would be visually subordinate to the Ferry Building and Pier 1. Refer to Section 3.8,
Cultural and Paleontological Resources, for more discussion of the proposed project’s compatibility with
the historic resources within the project area.
Gates F and G, in the South Basin, would be constructed between existing Gate E and Pier 14. With the
exception of the portion of the basin that currently contains Pier 2, the area where the two new gates
would be placed is open water and can be seen on Figure 3.10-1, Views 1 and 9. Demolition of the deck
and piles for Pier 2 would create space for the development of Gates F and G. Figure 2-6 shows a
simulation of the spacing and layout of the gates and weather protection canopies in the South Basin. The
new gates would be spaced to allow for interspersed views of San Francisco Bay to the east and south
from public areas in and near the project site, and would be similar in scale to the existing Gate E.
Figure 3.10-1, View 4, shows the existing Gate E in relation to the Ferry Building and Agriculture
Building, as viewed by publicly accessible areas along the west side of The Embarcadero. Similarly, the

As described in Chapter 2, as part of the America’s Cup project, Pier ½ has been removed. Additionally, the building that
currently houses Sinbad’s Restaurant on Pier 2 is to be vacated and removed by March 2015. Demolition of these facilities as
a part of the America’s Cup project is not addressed in this Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report.

new vertical elements would also be to the east of and in between the Ferry Building and Agriculture
Building, and therefore would not block or interfere with views of either of these scenic resources.
The project improvements in the South Basin also include a variety of horizontal elements (e.g.,
replacement of deck and pile structure, construction of additional deck and pile structures). These
improvements would be between Gates E, F, and G, and would not have vertical elements that could
block or interfere with views of scenic vistas or resources. In fact, these improvements would provide
additional public vantage points from which to view the vistas and scenic resources in the project area,
and would therefore result in a beneficial impact.
The project would add project elements (i.e., gates, weather protection canopies, piers, and deck and pile
structures) to the North and South Basins that would be consistent with scale and color of existing
features, and would not substantially alter or block views of the Ferry Building, Agriculture Building,
Pier 1, or the San Francisco skyline from San Francisco Bay. The new project elements would interrupt
views of San Francisco Bay from the project area from specific vantage points. However, because an
abundance of views of San Francisco Bay would still exist and because the project would improve the
public’s access to these views, the project would not substantially alter or block views of scenic vistas or
scenic resources.
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Determination. The project’s impact to aesthetics and
visual resources as a result of altering or blocking views of scenic vistas or resources would not be
adverse.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Determination. The project’s impact to aesthetics and
visual resources as a result of altering or blocking views of scenic vistas or resources would be less than
significant.
Impact 3.10-2: Potential to Degrade or Contrast with the Visual or Aesthetic Aspects of
the Existing Landscape
No Action Alternative
No new structures would be built that would degrade or contrast with the scale, visual quality, or visual
context of the existing landscape. Therefore, there would be no impact under the No Action Alternative.
Action Alternative
For the Action Alternative, some deck and pile structures would be demolished, and new vertical (e.g.,
gates and weather protection canopies) and horizontal elements (e.g., deck and pile structures) would be
constructed.
As mentioned above, the Port’s and BCDC’s design guidelines promote aesthetic planning criteria that
guide the initial development of projects in a manner consistent with preservation of views and scenic
resources. The preliminary design of the terminal facility has been developed to ensure compatibility
with the surrounding visual environment; has taken into account the existing area and functional features;
and would be consistent with the scale, visual quality, and visual context of the existing landscape. In
addition, as discussed in Section 2.6, the final design would also be reviewed through the Port’s and
BCDC’s design review processes to ensure that the final design is consistent with the plans and policies
of each agency.
The North Basin is primarily open water between the Ferry Building and Pier 1, including Gate B. Pier ½
was recently demolished in this area. Figure 2-5 is a simulation of North Basin once the new Gate A and
associated elements are constructed. As shown, the improvements in the North Basin would also create a

Consequences, and Mitigation

cohesive aesthetic. Gate A and Gate B would be similar in design (i.e., height, color, massing, and
alignment). The North Basin Marginal Wharf improvements would connect the Gate A Access Pier to
improvements that the Port has implemented along the marginal wharf, creating a contiguous edge along
the water. Gate A and its access pier would be constructed with features (lighting, railings, and surface
treatments) consistent with the rest of the Ferry Building area.
The South Basin currently contains a mix of visual elements, both modern and historic, that results in
some visual clutter, as shown on Figure 3.10-1, Views 4, 8, and 9, including a variety of railing styles and
pavement treatments, vehicular parking, historic buildings of varying architectural styles and colors, and a
modern building. Figure 2-6 is a simulation of the spacing and layout of the new project elements in the
North and South Basins. The simulations show a cohesive visual setting. Circulation improvements
would be made that include creation of an Embarcadero Plaza, by covering the small open-water area
between the Agriculture Building and the Ferry Building; extension of the East Bayside Promenade;
improvement of the South Apron of the Agriculture Building; and weather protection canopies. These
elements would result in more functional passenger circulation and a more cohesive aesthetic in the South
Basin area (including cohesive railings, lighting, and pavement throughout the South Basin). The three
water transit gates in the South Basin would be evenly spaced, similar in size and design, and light in
massing and color. They would not detract from or obstruct from the nearby historic buildings or
character (as described in Impact 3.10-1), and would provide more continuity in the visual character of
the project area.
The new features would not contrast with the scale, visual quality, or visual context of the area. The new
project elements would be consistent with the look of a Ferry Terminal, and would be a continuation of
the design elements that were constructed in the Port’s first phase of the Ferry Terminal Project in 2003.
The new gates (Gates A, F, and G) would match the design of the existing gates (Gates B and E), but with
slightly wider door openings. Features such as seatwalls, steps, planters, bicycle racks, and other
furnishings could be incorporated into the final design to further add to the cohesive aesthetic and
continuity in design of the Ferry Terminal area. Lighting would be consistent in size and light levels with
what is currently in the area, and is discussed in greater detail below. As such, the project would add new
features, but these features are not anticipated to degrade the scale, visual quality, or visual context of the
area.
In addition, as described in the Site Maintenance subsection of Section 2.3.6, Operating Elements, the
Water Emergency Transportation Authority and the Port would develop a Site Maintenance Plan prior to
project initiation. The plan would designate responsibility and a schedule for regular maintenance and
cleaning of the new facilities (e.g., canopies), as well as general site maintenance activities (e.g., washdown; litter removal and trash receptacle management; and lighting and landscape management).
NEPA Determination. The project’s potential to impact aesthetics and visual resources by degrading or
contrasting with the scale, visual quality, or visual context of the area would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to impact aesthetics and visual resources by degrading or
contrasting with the scale, visual quality, or visual context of the area would be less than significant.
Impact 3.10-3: Potential for Light and Glare to Adversely Affect Views, People, or
Properties
No Action Alternative
No new lighting or additional glare would be added to the project area. Therefore, there would be no
impact under the No Action Alternative.

Action Alternative
For the Action Alternative, each berthing facility would be designed with internal lighting fixtures that
project light onto to the roof of the canopies, with sufficient light for pedestrian safety and security.
Lighting would also be installed along the public circulation and access areas. The lighting would be
similar in fixtures size and light levels to what is currently in the Ferry Building area.
Outdoor lighting would be focused, directed, and shielded to avoid the production of glare, and minimize
up-light and light spill. As feasible, fixtures would be located, aimed, or shielded to minimize stray light
to or across property boundaries. Light design would incorporate down-cast, low glare, shields, or
equivalent designs to minimize light and glare. Levels and types of light and glare would be consistent
with the area, would not have an adverse impact on daytime or nighttime views in the area, and would not
result in adverse effects to people or properties.
NEPA Determination. The proposed project’s potential to impact daytime or nighttime views in the area, or
to substantially affect other people or properties as a result of light and glare, would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The proposed project’s potential to impact daytime or nighttime views in the area, or
to substantially affect other people or properties as a result of light and glare, would be less than significant.
Indirect Impacts
Neither the No Action Alternative nor the Action Alternative would have indirect impacts to visual
resources or aesthetics.
Construction Impacts
The No Action Alternative would not result in any physical changes to the Ferry Terminal, and no
construction activities would be required. Therefore, there would be no construction impacts to aesthetics
or visual resources.
Impact 3.10-4. Potential to Substantially Alter or Block Views or Degrade or Contrast
with Existing Landscape During Construction
The proposed project would include demolition and construction of facilities in the project area. The
areas that would be affected by project construction, including construction staging areas, are shown on
Figure 2-9. Public views in the study area of the construction zone would contain the barges, large and
small construction equipment, and equipment and material storage.
The majority of demolition and construction would be staged and conducted from equipment and material
barges. The equipment barges would be outfitted with large cranes and other equipment (e.g., clamshell
dredge, excavator) operating from the barge. Depending on viewer vantage point, the cranes could be visible
from public areas, and could potentially block views to and across San Francisco Bay. The construction
equipment would have a different scale and quality than the permanent features in the project area. The barges
would contrast with the existing gates and water transit vessels that are typically present in the middle ground.
However, larger dredging vessels are occasionally visible in the middle ground for periodic maintenance
dredging along the waterfront, and container and large cruise ships also travel on San Francisco Bay and can
be seen in the background. These barges and construction equipment would be a temporary feature in the
waterfront area, and would be consistent with the maritime character of the area. The scale, visual quality, and
visual context would be consistent with current vessel activity; although specific types of vessels may vary, the
average scale and color would be similar enough that the visual context would not change.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

The project improvements (e.g., Gate A access pier and the Embarcadero Plaza), once constructed, would
also be used for staging of equipment, materials, and supplies during construction of utility extensions,
gate and canopy structures, and topping slab; and placement of ticket machines, railings, lighting,
signage, and bioretention planters. These areas would be highly visible from The Embarcadero.
The curbside areas between the Ferry Building and Pier 1, and between the Ferry Building and the
Agriculture Building, would be used for materials delivered by truck. Goods would be transported
immediately to the staging area after delivery. The Ferry Building currently processes truck deliveries to
the area for building tenants and the regularly scheduled farmers market. Deliveries to the area are a
regular occurrence. The additional delivery of construction materials would not be a substantially adverse
impact, because these materials would be transported to their designated staging areas, and would not
degrade public views from and containing The Embarcadero.
The presence of equipment, barges, and construction staging and material storage on site during
construction would contrast with and could temporarily degrade the visual quality or context of the
existing landscape. As described in Section 2.4, best management practices would be implemented
during construction to ensure that the construction site would be maintained in a clean and orderly state.
Regulatory requirements discussed in Section 3.11, Hydrology and Water Quality, would establish
additional best management practices designed to protect water quality for all demolition and construction
activities, including work over water, such as removing solid waste regularly, and using containment
booms to capture any pile fragments and floating demolition debris. Views of construction equipment
and materials storage would be noticeable, but consistent with the urban and maritime nature of the
waterfront, and therefore are not anticipated to be adverse.
NEPA Determination. The project’s impact on scenic vistas or resources, the scale, visual quality, or
visual context of the area as a result of construction would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The proposed project’s impact on scenic vistas or resources, the scale, visual
quality, or visual context of the area as a result of construction would be less than significant.
Cumulative Impacts
Impact 3.10-5. Potential to Result in Cumulative Impacts on Aesthetics or Visual
Resources
The geographic area of potential aesthetic and visual resource cumulative impacts is within the viewshed
of the study area. As described in this section, the proposed project facilities would introduce new visual
elements to the project area that would affect the visual character of the study area and alter some views
of scenic views, vistas, or resources. The Port and BCDC’s permitting and approval process would
ensure the project’s consistency with the Port and BCDC policies intended to protect aesthetics and public
views along the waterfront. Although the impacts from the proposed project would not be substantial and
have been determined to be less than significant and not adverse, other reasonably foreseeable projects in
the study area could result in similar impacts. The America’s Cup project, Golden Gate Transit Ferry
Terminal Improvements, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Ferry Plaza Physical Barrier Project, and
Agriculture Building Rehabilitation and Seismic Upgrades would all be constructed in the study area and
could affect views, introduce new visual elements, or change the visual character of the project area.
The America’s Cup project (for the portions in the Rincon Point Open Water Basin, 14 – 22½), Golden Gate
Transit Ferry Terminal Improvements, BART Ferry Plaza Physical Barrier Project, and Agriculture Building
Rehabilitation and Seismic Upgrades could involve similar construction activities that could affect aesthetics
or visual resources in the study area. However, none of the projects are anticipated to be constructed
concurrently; therefore, all potential impacts would be related to the operational phases of these projects.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

America’s Cup project components in the vicinity of the Ferry Terminal would result in the temporary
addition of boats and berthing facilities (i.e., floating dock for large spectator yachts) for the event in
2013. The proposed water-based uses—such as docking and mooring boats—would temporarily add
additional vessels to the San Francisco waterfront that would be removed in 2014, prior to the initiation of
the proposed project. The negotiations between CCSF and the America’s Cup Event Authority have also
included long-term development rights for the Rincon Point Open Water Basin, just south of the project
area. However, negotiations are not yet completed, and the future use of the open-water basin is too
speculative to evaluate as a reasonably foreseeable project at this time. The America’s Cup project has
and would result in changes within the project area (the completed removal of Pier ½, and the future
removal of the building on Pier 2), as described in Section 2.2. Removal of these structures would create
space that would be used for the development of the proposed project elements.
Three other projects with the potential to contribute to cumulative visual and aesthetics impacts are planned
in the project study area. Improvements to upgrade accessibility would occur at Golden Gate Transit Ferry
Terminal’s Gates C and D. Although environmental review has not yet been initiated, this project is not
anticipated to result in significant visual changes in the area, and is anticipated to be minor in duration (i.e.,
from weeks to a few months), due to the scale and nature of the project. Construction of the proposed
project would not preclude the Golden Gate Transit Ferry Terminal improvement project, because the
proposed project improvements would not be on the Ferry Plaza or at Gates C and D. If Golden Gate
Transit’s project was to advance, and construction is projected to occur concurrently with the proposed
project, because the scale of construction activities for the Golden Gate Transit project would be small, the
projects would not be expected to cumulatively adversely impact aesthetics or visual resources in the project
area.
Similar to the Golden Gate Transit Ferry Terminal Improvements project, the Agriculture Building
project has not initiated environmental review or design. The proposed project has been developed in a
manner that would not preclude redevelopment of the Agriculture Building. In addition, redevelopment
of the Agriculture Building would not be expected to result in significant visual changes in the area,
because the Agriculture Building is a historic resource, and its redevelopment would need to evaluate any
proposed alterations. Environmental review for the project would evaluate the potential cumulative
impacts as the project is advanced.
The Port and BCDC’s design guidelines would also apply to both of these projects. These projects would
remain consistent with area use; and when combined with the proposed project, would not result in new
or additional adverse effects on area aesthetics or visual resources.
The BART Ferry Plaza Physical Barrier Project would install physical barriers on the Ferry Plaza in the
project area. This project is currently under construction, and would not be expected to result in an
overlap in construction schedules with the proposed project. This BART project has undergone separate
environmental review and design review by BCDC and the Port; it was determined that the project would
not result in significant visual changes in the area. The improvements are generally low-profile and would
not be expected to change views of or views within the project area. In addition, the proposed project
improvements would not be on the Ferry Plaza. Therefore, the projects would not be expected to
cumulatively adversely impact aesthetics or visual resources in the project area.
Therefore, cumulative impacts are not anticipated to be substantially adverse, and the proposed project
would not have a cumulatively considerable contribution to cumulative impacts related to aesthetics or
visual resources.
NEPA Determination. The project would not contribute to cumulative adverse impacts to aesthetics or
visual resources.

Potential impacts related to flooding, sea-level rise, tsunami inundation, and wave activity are addressed.
Construction impacts are evaluated with respect to water quality impacts during dredging, demolition,
pile removal, and installation of piles and decking. Finally, cumulative impacts are assessed based on a
list of reasonably foreseeable projects that could contribute to cumulative effects. As described below,
the proposed project would not have adverse effects on hydrology and water quality.
Existing conditions and potential impacts associated with land uses, including San Francisco Bay
Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) plans and policies, are addressed in Section 3.3,
Land Use and Land Use Planning. Existing conditions and potential impacts associated with water
quality impacts on fisheries and other aquatic species are addressed in Section 3.9, Biological Resources.
3.11.2 Affected Environment
This section describes surface and groundwater hydrology and water quality in the project area, as well as
the applicable and relevant regulations related to hydrology and water quality.
Existing Setting
This section describes hydrology and water quality resources that could be affected by the proposed
project. The discussion of existing setting is based on information presented in the 2003 Program
Environmental Impact Report for the Expansion of Ferry Transit Service in San Francisco Bay Area
(WETA, 2003a), and supplemented or updated, as appropriate, with project-specific and current
information. The primary sources of information include reports prepared by the San Francisco Bay
Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB), the Port of San Francisco (Port), BCDC, San
Francisco Estuary Institute (SFEI), and the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF).
Study Area
The study area for hydrology and water quality is defined as the project area. The project area lies within
the San Francisco Bay hydrologic region, which covers an area of approximately 4,603 square miles,
extending from southern Santa Clara County north to Tomales Bay in Marin County, and inland to the
confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers (RWQCB, 2010). Rivers and streams in the region
flow to San Francisco Bay or directly to the Pacific Ocean. The dominant feature is the San Francisco
Bay estuary, where fresh water from the Central Valley mixes with saline water from the Pacific Ocean.
San Francisco Bay is composed of three distinct hydrographic regimes: the South Bay, which extends
from the Bay Bridge to the southern terminus of San Francisco Bay in San Jose; and the Central and
North bays, which connect the Delta and the Pacific Ocean. The project area is located in the Central
Bay, which is strongly influenced by tidal currents due to its proximity to the Pacific Ocean. East of the
Golden Gate, the water depth is approximately 300 feet, and extensive intertidal mudflats are present at
the eastern edge of the Central Bay (WETA, 2003a). The estimated water depth at the project site is
generally about 10 feet.

Consequences, and Mitigation

The project area is east of The Embarcadero in the waterfront area, between Pier 1 to the north and
Pier 14 to the south. It includes Gate B (north of the San Francisco Ferry Building [Ferry Building]), the
Agriculture Building, the Ferry Plaza, Pier 2, and Gate E. The project area is over and on San Francisco
Bay, east of the seawall. There are no natural seeps, springs, or streams present within the project
boundary. Precipitation that falls onto the project area runs off the piers and directly into San Francisco
Bay.
Potentially hazardous materials are known to be present within the project area (see Section 3.12, Hazards
and Hazardous Materials); this includes existing pilings and structures treated with creosote.
CCSF manages a combined sewer system that serves approximately 10 percent of San Francisco (SFPUC,
2010). Portions of this system are beneath The Embarcadero, adjacent to the project area. For additional
information on the CCSF’s combined sewer system, see the Public Services and Utilities section. As
described above, stormwater runoff from the project area discharges directly into San Francisco Bay, and
not into the combined sewer system.
Water Quality
The San Francisco Bay RWQCB has established beneficial uses for surface water bodies, as well as
groundwater, in the project area. These beneficial uses are described in the San Francisco Bay Basin
(Region 2) Water Quality Control Plan (Basin Plan). The Basin Plan specifies existing beneficial uses for
San Francisco Bay, Central Bay, which include: industrial service and process supplies, commercial
fishing, shellfish harvesting, estuarine habitat, fish migration, fish spawning, navigation, rare and
endangered species preservation, wildlife habitat, and water contact recreation. A detailed discussion of
beneficial uses and water quality objectives can be found in the Basin Plan (RWQCB, 2010).
Since 1993, the SFEI has administered a Regional Monitoring Program (RMP) for the San Francisco Bay
RWQCB and major San Francisco Bay dischargers. Most dischargers to San Francisco Bay are required
to participate as a condition of their discharge permit. SFEI conducts monitoring to assess spatial patterns
and long-term trends in contamination. The RMP measures concentrations of various constituents in
water, sediment, bivalves, bird eggs, and fish at various locations in the estuary, including the Central
Bay.
To assess water quality, trace metals (including copper, mercury, nickel, selenium, silver, and zinc) and
trace organics are measured in water samples collected during the dry season. Water samples are
analyzed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers annually, and all other organic parameters (e.g., pesticides,
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs], and polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]) on a biennial basis.
Ambient water toxicity was last measured in 2007, but because very little aquatic toxicity has been
observed in San Francisco Bay in recent years, testing now takes place every 5 years (SFEI, 2011).
Aquatic toxicity has declined, possibly associated with reduced use of organophosphate pesticides (SFEI,
2006). According to the 2006 Pulse of the Estuary (SFEI, 2006), results of the RMP show significant
improvements in basic water quality conditions, such as the oxygen content of water, due to investments
in wastewater treatment. Contamination due to toxic chemicals has also generally declined since the
1950s and 1960s.
Other trends noted by SFEI include:


Mercury concentrations in striped bass, a key mercury indicator species for the estuary, have shown
little change in 30 years.



PCB concentrations appear to be gradually declining based on trends observed in mussels, fish, and
birds.



3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Concentrations of dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT), chlordane, and other legacy pesticides
have declined more rapidly. On the other hand, concentrations of chemicals in current use, such as
pyrethroid insecticides and polybrominated diphenyl ethers, are on the increase.

The water in San Francisco Bay is considered to be generally well oxygenated, with typical
concentrations of dissolved oxygen in most of San Francisco Bay ranging from 9 to 10 milligrams per
liter (mg/L) during high periods of river flow, 7 to 9 mg/L during moderate river flow, and 6 to 9 mg/L
during the late summer months, when flows are lowest (SFEI, 2008).
Sediment Quality
The SFEI’s RMP also includes sampling and testing of sediments from San Francisco Bay since 1993
(SFEI, 2009). Sediment samples are collected during the wet season and the dry season in alternating
years, and analyzed for conventional sediment quality, trace metals, and trace organics. Samples are
collected from the near surface (top 12 inches). The long-term sampling location closest to the project
site in the Central Bay is east of Yerba Buena Island.
RMP monitoring results indicate that sediment toxicity in San Francisco Bay has consistently been
observed in a large proportion of samples tested, but varies over time (SFEI, 2006). These variations
probably reflect changes in sediment contamination, toxicity, and benthic communities related to seasonal
and annual changes in run-off, salinity, and contaminant loadings. Sediments sampled from the Yerba
Buena Island location suggest that sediment toxicity is associated primarily with DDT, zinc, and lead
(Thompson and Lowe, 2008).
Bay Protection and Toxic Cleanup Program
The Bay Protection and Toxic Cleanup section of the California Water Code (Division 7,
Sections 13390-13396.5) established a program to identify and plan remediation of toxic hot spots in bays
and estuaries. The Consolidated Toxic Hot Spots Cleanup Plan (SWRCB, 2003) identified sediments in
the entire San Francisco Bay as a high-priority toxic hot spot for mercury, selenium, PAHs, and dieldrin.
Flooding
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) identifies special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) on
flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) for all communities that participate in the National Flood Insurance
Program. CCSF only recently joined this program, and the FIRMs for CCSF have not yet been finalized.
FIRMs are used by state and local governments for administering floodplain management programs,
enforcing building codes, and mitigating flooding losses in their communities. The floodplain
information on the FIRM is based on historical data and hydrologic and hydraulic computations. The
100-year floodplain, or the areas inundated by a storm having a 1 percent annual chance of occurrence, is
the regulatory standard used by federal, state, and local agencies.
Because FEMA has not previously published a FIRM for CCSF, there are no officially identified SFHAs
within San Francisco’s geographic boundaries. FEMA completed the initial phases of a study of San
Francisco Bay. On September 21, 2007, FEMA issued a preliminary FIRM of San Francisco for review
and comment by CCSF. FEMA is currently conducting more detailed studies of coastal flooding hazards
in San Francisco Bay, and is expected to publish a revised preliminary FIRM for flood insurance and
flood management purposes when those studies are complete (CCSF, 2011a).
In August 2008, and as amended in 2010, CCSF enacted the Floodplain Management Ordinance (CCSF,
2008a and 2010a). This ordinance regulates construction and substantial improvements to structures in
flood-prone areas. Interim floodplain management maps were developed by the CCSF in 2008, and are in
effect until FEMA publishes its final FIRM. The project site is not in any designated flood zone on

CCSF’s interim floodplain maps (CCSF, 2008a). However, there is a small area south of the Agriculture
Building that is designated as an SFHA.
The Port Building Code (Port, 2011a) establishes design parameters associated with the 100-year flood
event for various offshore points along the Port waterfront. The Building Code includes estimated
elevations and wave heights for the 100-year flood event for properties under the jurisdiction of the Port.

Tsunami
A tsunami is a water wave or a series of waves generated by an impulsive displacement of the surface of
the ocean or other body of water. A tsunami can travel across oceanic basins and cause damage several
thousand miles from its source. Most tsunamis are caused by a rapid vertical movement along a break in
the Earth’s crust; that is, a tectonic fault rupture on the bottom of the ocean resulting in displacement of
the column of water directly above it. The majority of tsunamis are triggered by earthquake rupture along
subduction zones. The 1964 Alaska earthquake generated a tsunami that caused widespread damage
along the coastline of northern California. Investigations have also shown that tsunamis resulting from
earthquakes on the subduction zone beneath Japan and the Cascadia subduction zone in the Pacific
Northwest have inundated the Pacific Coast states (Atwater et al., 1999). For example, the tsunami
following the major Japanese earthquake (March 11, 2011) resulted in an estimated wave height rise of
2 feet in San Francisco Bay (California Coastal Commission, 2011).
In 2009, the California Emergency Management Agency, the University of Southern California, and the
California Geological Survey prepared tsunami evacuation planning maps for San Francisco Bay
(CalEMA et al., 2009). The inundation line shown on the map represents the maximum considered
tsunami runup from a number of extreme, yet realistic, tsunami sources. The purpose of the map is to
assist cities and counties in identifying their tsunami hazard, and is intended for local jurisdictional,
coastal evacuation planning uses only; it is not intended to be used for evaluating infrastructure or land
use with respect to tsunami hazards. The project area is in the predicted tsunami inundation area.
Sea-Level Rise
Sea levels along California’s coast have risen about 7 inches over the past century (CEC, 2008 and 2009).
The average sea level rose at a rate of approximately 0.07 inch per year from 1961 to 2003, with an
accelerated average rate of about 0.12 inch per year during the last decade (CEC, 2009).
Studies that account for climate change as a result of global warming predict that sea‐level rise will
accelerate and proceed at significantly higher rates than previously thought. The Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) has published projections on global sea-level rise in 2001, and refined
estimates in 2007. The projections considered thermosteric sea-level change (expansion of sea water as it
warms) and eustatic sea-level changes due to increased fresh water inflows from melting sea and glacial

ice, under a range of emission scenarios. These earlier studies had estimated that sea level would rise by
as much as 20 inches by 2100, which corresponds to an average rate of approximately 0.2 inch per year,
or about twice the historical average rate.
Recent studies focus on two of the emission scenarios from the earlier studies, and include adjustments
that consider the effects of dams on sea-level rise. These current studies predict that sea-level rise may
accelerate faster than the earlier IPCC studies had indicated (BCDC, 2009; CEC, 2009). In addition, an
Independent Science Board contracted by the State of California has recommended that the state adopt
conservative estimates for sea-level rise to account for accelerating contributions from ice sheet melting,
and use the most conservative methodologies. Based on these emission scenarios, sea-level rise estimates
range from 20 to 55 inches by 2100. It should be noted that the estimated increase of 55 inches is more
than 2.5 times the IPCC’s 2007 estimate.
Groundwater
The project site is in and adjacent to the Downtown San Francisco groundwater basin (DWR, 2004;
RWQCB, 2010). The California Department of Water Resources has identified the boundary of the basin
to be coincident with the land surface edge (including the edge of the piers that extend into San Francisco
Bay). The extent of the basin beneath San Francisco Bay is not known, but studies have recognized the
continuation of aquifers from land to beneath saline coastal waters, with groundwater gradients being
generally toward the coast or the San Francisco Bay shoreline (Harrold et al., 2008). The San Francisco
Bay RWQCB acknowledges that groundwater may also occur outside of currently identified basins; for
this reason, groundwater includes all subsurface waters, regardless of whether these waters meet the
classic definition of an aquifer, or occur within identified groundwater basins. For the Downtown San
Francisco groundwater basin, the Basin Plan identifies municipal and agricultural supply as existing
beneficial uses, and industrial process and service supply as potential beneficial uses (RWQCB, 2010).
Although groundwater may have been used historically for potable water supply, most of CCSF is
supplied with water provided by CCSF from the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in Yosemite National Park.
The water-bearing formations in the Downtown San Francisco groundwater basin are thickest beneath the
central and northeastern portions of the basin (between Interstate 80 and Chinatown). Within most of the
basin, bedrock is encountered at less than 200 feet below ground surface (DWR, 2004).
Published groundwater quality information is not available for the Downtown basin, but limited water
quality data for the surrounding basins suggest that the general character of groundwater for all basins
beneath the entire San Francisco peninsula is similar. Concentrations of most major dissolved
constituents are within the guidelines recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(U.S. EPA). Total dissolved solids vary from about 200 to over 700 parts per million. Elevated
concentrations of nitrate and chloride are common, especially at shallower depths (DWR, 2004).
Regulatory Setting
Federal
Clean Water Act
The federal Clean Water Act (CWA) (33 United States Code [USC] § 1257 et seq.) requires states to set
standards to protect water quality. The objective of the federal CWA is to restore and maintain the
chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation’s waters. Specific sections of the CWA control
discharge of pollutants and wastes into marine and aquatic environments.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Section 311 – Oil Pollution Act
CWA Section 311, as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, provides for spill prevention
requirements, spill reporting obligations, and spill response planning and authorities. It regulates the
prevention and response to accidental releases of oil and hazardous substances into navigable waters, on
adjoining shorelines, or affecting natural resources belonging to or managed by the United States. The
U.S. Coast Guard is responsible for regulations and enforcement related to vessels and marine
transportation, and the U.S. EPA is responsible for nontransportation–related facilities and onshore
operations.
Section 401 – Clean Water Quality Certification
Under Section 401 of the CWA, water quality certification is required from the state for any activity that
requires a federal permit or license that may result in discharge into navigable waters. The certification
must indicate that the activity will comply with the applicable state water quality standards. Under
Section 401, states are also required to establish water quality standards for all state waters. To receive
certification under Section 401, an application must demonstrate that activities or discharges into waters
will not cause concentrations of chemicals to exceed state standards. With respect to the project, the
authority to grant water quality certification has been delegated to the State Water Resources Control
Board (SWRCB), and for the project area, applications for certification under CWA Section 401 are
processed by the San Francisco Bay RWQCB. A Section 401 Certification will be necessary to obtain a 404
permit for discharge into waters subject to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jurisdiction (discussed
below).
Section 402 – National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program
Point source discharges to surface water are regulated by Section 402 of the CWA through requirements
set forth in specific or general National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits.
Stormwater discharges associated with construction activities and certain categories of industrial
activities, as well as incidental nonstormwater discharges associated with construction, fall under this act
and are addressed through general NPDES permits. In California, requirements of the CWA regarding
regulation of point source discharges and stormwater discharges are delegated to the SWRCB, and
administered by the nine RWQCBs. The San Francisco Bay RWQCB implements the statewide policy in
the project area. Under California’s NPDES program, any waste discharger subject to the NPDES
program must obtain coverage under the appropriate general NPDES permit from the local RWQCB.
Section 404 – Discharge of Dredged or Fill Material
Section 404 of the CWA regulates the discharge of dredged or fill material (e.g., fill, pier supports, and
piles) into waters of the United States, which includes San Francisco Bay. The program is jointly
administered by the Corps and the U.S. EPA.
Rivers and Harbors Act
Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (33 USC Section 401 et seq.) requires a permit for
creating obstructions (including excavation and fill activities) to the navigable waters of the United States.
Navigable waters are defined as those water bodies subject to the ebb and flow of the tide, and/or that are
used, in their natural condition or by reasonable improvements, as means to transport interstate or foreign
commerce. Construction of structures in, under, or over navigable water; deposition or excavation of
material in navigable waters; and all work affecting the location, condition, course, or capacity of
navigable water are covered by Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act. San Francisco Bay is a
navigable water. The Corps administers the Rivers and Harbors Act. For projects that fall under both the
Rivers and Harbors Act and Section 404 of the CWA, the Corps will process and issue a single permit.

Refuse Act of 1899
The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 also prohibits the discharge of any refuse matter from a ship, barge,
floating craft, shore, or wharf into any navigable water of the United States (33 USC Section 407). The
U.S. Coast Guard is the responsible enforcement agency.
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships
Title 33 of the Code of Federal Regulations addresses navigation and navigable waters, including the
prevention of pollution from ships, in accordance with the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, 1980
(33 USC 1901–1911); and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973,
as modified by the Protocol of 1978 (referred to as MARPOL 73/78). The regulations cover the
prevention of pollution by oil, noxious liquids, harmful substances, and garbage from operational
measures, as well as from accidental discharges. The U.S. Coast Guard is the responsible enforcement
agency.
Coastal Zone Management Act
The Coastal Zone Management Act, established in 1972 and administered by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration’s Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, provides for
management of the nation’s coastal resources. The overall purpose is to balance competing land and
water issues in the coastal zone. For San Francisco Bay and the project area, the BCDC is the local
coastal zone management agency, and is responsible for issuing consistency determinations under the
Coastal Zone Management Act.
Floodplain Management
Executive Order 11988 requires that federal agency construction, permitting, or funding of a project must
avoid incompatible floodplain development, be consistent with the standards and criteria of the National
Flood Insurance Program, and restore and preserve natural and beneficial floodplain values.
National Flood Insurance Act
The National Flood Insurance Act (42 USC Section 4001 et seq.) addresses both the need for flood
insurance and the need to lessen the devastating consequences of flooding.
Floodplain Management and Protection and Flood Disaster Protection Act
The Floodplain Management and Protection (U.S. Department of Transportation Order 5650.2) and Floor
Disaster Protection Act (42 USC Sections 4001 to 4128) require the identification of flood-prone areas,
provide insurance, and require purchase of insurance for buildings in SFHAs.
State
Porter–Cologne Water Quality Control Act of 1969
The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act of 1969 (Porter-Cologne Act) established the SWRCB
and nine RWQCBs as the primary state agencies with regulatory authority over water quality and surface
water rights allocation. Wastes that cannot be discharged directly or indirectly to waters of the state (and
therefore must be discharged to land for treatment, storage, or disposal) are classified to determine
specifically where such wastes may be discharged. This classification requirement would apply to
dredged material or fill that would be disposed in an upland environment.

Policy with Respect to Maintaining High Quality of Water in California,” which generally restricts
dischargers from reducing the water quality of surface water and groundwater. The project area is within
the jurisdiction of the San Francisco Bay RWQCB. The Basin Plan (RWQCB, 2010) designates
beneficial uses for specific surface water and groundwater resources, establishes water quality objectives
to protect those uses, and sets forth policies to guide the implementation of programs to attain the
objectives.
Pursuant to the Porter-Cologne Act, the RWQCB is authorized to issue individual permits to allow for
discharge of specified quantities and qualities of waste to land or surface waters. The limitations placed
on the discharge are designed to ensure compliance with water quality objectives in the Basin Plan.
Construction Activities
Construction activities that disturb one or more acres of land surface are regulated under the statewide
NPDES General Permit for Storm Water Discharges Associated with Construction and Land Disturbance
Activities (Order No. 2009-0009-DWQ and as amended by Order No. 2010-0014-DWQ) (SWRCB, 2009;
SWRCB, 2010).
To obtain coverage under the Construction General Permit, the legally responsible person must
electronically file the Permit Registration Documents, which include a Notice of Intent, Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan, risk assessment, site map(s), and drawings, and the appropriate permit fee to
the SWRCB and RWQCB.
Municipal Regional Stormwater NPDES Permit
The SWRCB issued Order No. 2003-0005-DWQ, NPDES Permit No. CAS000004, “Waste discharge
requirements for Storm Water Discharges from Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (General
Municipal Permit)” for the discharge of stormwater runoff from the municipal separate storm sewer
systems of jurisdictions and entities in the Bay Area, including CCSF and the Port. The Municipal
Regional Stormwater NPDES Permit prohibits nonstormwater discharges into storm drain systems and
watercourses, as well as discharges that adversely affect beneficial uses of waters of the state. The permit
requires the implementation of specific control measures such as best management practices (BMPs) and
regulating increases in runoff from development projects.
Local
McAteer-Petris Act
The San Francisco BCDC is responsible for implementing the McAteer-Petris Act. The Act directs
BCDC to exercise its authority to issue or deny permit applications for placing fill, dredging, or changing
the use of any land, water, or structure within the area of its jurisdiction (San Francisco Bay waters and
100 feet above the shoreline). The BCDC also carries out determinations of consistency with the federal
Coastal Zone Management Act for federally sponsored projects.
BCDC developed the San Francisco Bay Plan pursuant to the requirements of the McAteer-Petris Act
(BCDC, 2008). This plan, most recently updated in 2008, provides the policies and maps that guide the
development of the San Francisco Bay and shoreline within BCDC’s jurisdiction. Bay Plan policies
relevant to hydrology and water quality include the following:

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Water Quality
Policy 1. Bay water pollution should be prevented to the greatest extent feasible. The Bay’s tidal
marshes, tidal flats, and water surface area and volume should be conserved and, whenever possible,
restored and increased to protect and improve water quality. Fresh water inflow into the Bay should
be maintained at a level adequate to protect Bay resources and beneficial uses.
Policy 2. Water quality in all parts of the Bay should be maintained at a level that will support and
promote the beneficial uses of the Bay as identified in the San Francisco Bay RWQCB’s Water
Quality Control Plan, San Francisco Bay Basin and should be protected from all harmful or
potentially harmful pollutants. The policies, recommendations, decisions, advice and authority of the
SWRCB and the RWQCB, should be the basis for carrying out the Commission’s water quality
responsibilities.
Policy 3. New projects should be sited, designed, constructed and maintained to prevent or, if
prevention is infeasible, to minimize the discharge of pollutants into the Bay by: (a) controlling
pollutant sources at the project site; (b) using construction materials that contain nonpolluting
materials; and (c) applying appropriate, accepted and effective BMPs, especially where water
dispersion is poor and near shellfish beds and other significant biotic resources.
Policy 6. To protect the Bay and its tributaries from the water quality impacts of nonpoint source
pollution, new development should be sited and designed consistent with standards in municipal
stormwater permits and state and regional stormwater management guidelines, where applicable, and
with the protection of Bay resources. To offset impacts from increased impervious areas and land
disturbances, vegetated swales, permeable pavement materials, preservation of existing trees and
vegetation, planting native vegetation and other appropriate measures should be evaluated and
implemented where appropriate.
Policy 7. Whenever practicable, native vegetation buffer areas should be provided as part of a project
to control pollutants from entering the Bay, and vegetation should be substituted for rock riprap,
concrete, or other hard surface shoreline and bank erosion control methods where appropriate and
practicable.
Water Surface Area and Volume
Policy 1. The surface area of the Bay and the total volume of water should be kept as large as
possible in order to maximize active oxygen interchange, vigorous circulation, and effective tidal
action. Filling and diking that reduce surface area and water volume should therefore be allowed only
for purposes providing substantial public benefits and only if there is no reasonable alternative.
Policy 2. Water circulation in the Bay should be maintained, and improved as much as possible. Any
proposed fills, dikes, or piers should be thoroughly evaluated to determine their effects upon water
circulation and then modified as necessary to improve circulation or at least to minimize any harmful
effects.
Safety of Fills
Policy 4. To prevent damage from flooding, structures on fill or near the shoreline should have
adequate flood protection including consideration of future relative sea-level rise as determined by
competent engineers. As a general rule, structures on fill or near the shoreline should be above the
wave runup level or sufficiently set back from the edge of the shore so that the structure is not subject
to dynamic wave energy. In all cases, the bottom floor level of structures should be above the highest

estimated tide elevation. Exceptions to the general height rule may be made for developments
specifically designed to tolerate periodic flooding.
In October 2011, BCDC adopted an amendment to the Bay Plan based on sea-level rise information
presented in the staff background report entitled, Living with a Rising Bay: Vulnerability and Adaptation
in San Francisco Bay and on its Shoreline, dated April 7, 2009. This report identifies vulnerabilities in
the Bay Area’s economic and environmental systems, as well as the potential impacts of climate change
on public health and safety.
The project area is in BCDC’s detailed Northeastern Waterfront planning area, as defined in the San
Francisco Waterfront Special Area Plan; this area extends from Pier 35 to China Basin (BCDC, 2000). A
portion of the project area is within the footprint of existing piers, with the remainder located in open
water areas, as defined in the Special Area Plan. Refer to Section 3.3, Land Use and Land Use Planning,
for the Bay Plan and Special Area Plan policies related to fill in San Francisco Bay for pier repair/
replacement and new fill in open water areas.
Port’s Stormwater Management Program
The Port has primary land use jurisdiction over all development of property in and around the Ferry
Building area, including the project site. The Port administers a Stormwater Management Program
(SWMP), developed in accordance with federal CWA requirements and the California Statewide General
Permit for Stormwater Discharges Associated with Small Municipalities (“Phase II General Permit”)
(Port, 2003). The Port’s SWMP targets those areas of the San Francisco waterfront that drain directly
into San Francisco Bay, and not into combined sewer systems. Based on activities that occur along San
Francisco waterfront, the pollutants of concern targeted by the SWMP include suspended solids
(sediments), litter, heavy metals, and petroleum hydrocarbons. Additionally, the SWMP specifies
construction and operational practices for existing and newly constructed facilities on Port properties to
manage and treat stormwater runoff so as to comply with applicable stormwater regulations of the San
Francisco Bay RWQCB, as articulated through the San Francisco Stormwater Design Guidelines.
In accordance with the Stormwater Design Guidelines, all new development and redevelopment projects
greater than 5,000 square feet are required to develop and submit for approval a Stormwater Control Plan
that specifies how the project will comply with San Francisco’s post‐construction stormwater control
requirements.
Dredged Material Management Office
The Dredged Material Management Office (DMMO) is a joint program of the BCDC, San Francisco Bay
RWQCB, California State Lands Commission (CSLC), the San Francisco District Corps, and the
U.S. EPA. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service also participate by providing advice and expertise to the process. The
purpose of the DMMO is to cooperatively review sediment quality sampling plans, analyze the results of
sediment quality sampling, and make suitability determinations for material proposed for disposal in San
Francisco Bay. This interagency group’s goal is to increase efficiency and coordination between the
member agencies, and to foster a comprehensive and consolidated approach to handling dredged material
management issues. Applicants using DMMO fill out one application form, which the agencies then
jointly review at bi-weekly meetings before issuing their respective authorizations. Refer to Section 3.12,
Hazards and Hazardous Materials, for additional information.
3.11.3 Impact Evaluation
This section includes an analysis and determination of the potential adverse and beneficial project impacts
of the proposed project on hydrology and water resources.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

The analysis considered whether the project would:


Violate any water quality standards or waste discharge requirements, or substantially degrade water
quality due to mobilization of contaminated sediments or release of hazardous materials (e.g.,
creosote) during dredging, demolition, and construction activities;



Violate any water quality standards or waste discharge requirements, or substantially degrade water
quality due to fuel spills from vessel operations, discharge of pollutants (including trash and litter),
and maintenance dredging;



Increase San Francisco Bay fill enough that the project would be inconsistent with BCDC Bay Plan
policies, and would compromise public benefits;



Expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury, or death involving inundation by
tsunami;



Expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury, or death involving flooding, including
future flood risks (sea-level rise induced by climate change); or



Result in significant wake-wash impacts to shorelines or to small vessels.

To evaluate potential impacts on hydrology and water resources, both quantitative and qualitative
analyses were performed. The project description, and preliminary design plans and reports for the
project, were compared with information on existing and anticipated future conditions, such as sea-level
rise. The applicable federal, state, and local statutes regulating water resources, described in the Affected
Environment section, establish water quality standards for the purpose of protecting San Francisco Bay.
The analysis evaluated the proposed project’s consistency with water resource plans and policies,
including the project’s impacts on surface water quality, filling of San Francisco Bay, flooding due to
tsunami or sea-level rise, and wave activity. Actions required under existing regulations and programs,
and BMPs that address potential water resource impacts, are described as appropriate.
Due to the nature of the proposed project, there would be no project impacts related to the following
issues:


Substantially deplete groundwater supplies or interfere with groundwater recharge. The project
would not involve excavation to depths that would affect aquifer systems or groundwater movement,
and would not involve the construction of substantial new impervious surfaces that would impede
groundwater recharge. Therefore, no impacts related to groundwater would occur.



Substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site or area. All runoff from the site discharges
directly into San Francisco Bay, and there are no other natural drainage features in or adjacent to the
site. The project would involve minor grading or changes in drainage patterns of the site. This
includes minor grade adjustments to collect stormwater from portions of the project area that
currently discharges directly to San Francisco Bay, and redirect it to new stormwater treatment units.
The treatment of a portion of the project area’s stormwater prior to discharge to San Francisco Bay
would be considered beneficial. The project would not involve the construction of substantial new
impervious surfaces that would increase the amount of runoff, resulting in erosion or siltation, or
affecting flooding on or off the site. Therefore, impacts related to alteration of existing drainage
patterns are not discussed further.



Place housing within a 100-year flood hazard area as mapped on a federal Flood Hazard Boundary or
Flood Insurance Rate Map. The project would not include the construction of housing.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury, or death involving mudflow, failure of
a levee, or failure of a dam. The project is not near geologic or topographic conditions that would
generate mudflows. There are no levees or dams in the vicinity the project, and the project is not
located in a dam inundation zone.

Direct Impacts
Impact 3.11-1: Potential Impacts of Maintenance Dredging on Water Quality
No Action Alternative
Regular maintenance dredging is not currently required to maintain operations at existing Gates B and E.
Because patterns of sediment accumulation in the area of the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal
(Ferry Terminal) would be expected to be similar to historically observed patterns, regular maintenance
dredging would not be anticipated for the No Action Alternative. Therefore, there would be no impact.
Action Alternative
For the Action Alternative, some dredging would likely be required on a regular maintenance cycle
beneath the floats at the new Gates F and G, due to their proximity to the Pier 14 breakwater. It is
expected that this minor maintenance dredging would be required at Gates F and G every 3 to 4 years, and
would require removal of approximately 5,000 to 10,000 cubic yards (cy) of material. Estimated total
volume of material over 50 years of operations would be 62,500 to 166,650 cy. It is not anticipated that a
regular maintenance cycle of dredging would be required at Gate A.
In 1994, the U.S. EPA designated the “Deep Ocean Disposal Site,” which is 50 miles outside of the
Golden Gate. The U.S. EPA manages the site and has set a yearly capacity of 4.8 million cubic yards of
dredged material (BCDC, 2008). There are also four disposal sites in the San Francisco Bay Estuary,
including the Suisun Bay Channel, Alcatraz Island, San Pablo Bay, and Carquinez Strait. The volume of
dredged material that would require disposal would be negligible compared to the total yearly capacity of
these disposal sites (i.e., 10,000 cy, compared to more than 7 million cy or approximately 0.1 percent).
Dredging and disposal of dredged materials would be conducted in cooperation with the San Francisco
DMMO. Coordination through the DMMO addresses (1) a Section 404 or Section 10 dredging
authorization by the San Francisco District of the Corps; (2) an administrative dredging permit from the
BCDC; (3) the San Francisco RWQCB water quality certification or waste discharge requirements; and
(4) a dredging project lease from the CSLC (if required). The Water Emergency Transportation Authority
(WETA) would either acquire and comply with the requirements of the Dredging – Dredge Material
Reuse/Disposal project-specific permit that would be issued by the Corps, or coordinate with the Port to
manage dredging and dredge spoils disposal under an existing applicable Corps permit for the Port’s
ongoing maintenance dredging. Requirements would include development of a sampling plan, sediment
characterization, a sediment removal plan, and disposal in accordance with the Long-Term Management
Strategy to ensure beneficial reuse, as appropriate. The permits issued by the DMMO will require
dredging BMPs, which may include scheduling of dredging operations to avoid adverse effects on local
biological resources (e.g., during spawning periods), use of silt curtains and/or gunderbooms, and
mechanical/hydraulic dredge operation controls (e.g., reduced cutterhead rotation speeds, increased cycle
times). Therefore, the impact is not anticipated to be adverse, and the effects to water quality would be
minimal due to low volume of dredged material, infrequent dredging operations, and in-place
requirements for implementation of dredging BMPs.
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Determination. The project’s impact to water quality as a
result of maintenance dredging would not be adverse.

California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Determination. The project’s potential to impact
water quality as a result of maintenance dredging would be less than significant.
Impact 3.11-2: Potential Degradation of Water Quality Caused by Operation of Project
Improvements
No Action Alternative
Stormwater runoff in the project area currently drains directly to San Francisco Bay, and would continue
to do so under the No Action Alternative. There would be no physical changes, and WETA would
continue to operate the facilities in compliance with the Port’s Stormwater Management Program.
WETA would continue to perform regular maintenance and cleaning of the existing facilities (e.g., gates),
as well as general site maintenance activities (e.g., wash-down; litter removal, and trash receptacle
management). As part of the No Action Alternative, there would be increases in the number of vessels
and passengers using the existing facilities. However, WETA would implement BMPs to prevent and/or
minimize the discharge of pollutants (e.g., fuel spills and litter) to San Francisco Bay. Therefore, there
would be no change with respect to water quality impacts due to operations.
Action Alternative
Stormwater resulting from the project improvements would be managed in a manner consistent with the
requirements of the Port’s Stormwater Management Program, and the water quality policies set forth in
the BCDC’s San Francisco Bay Plan, as detailed below. The Port’s Stormwater Management Program
addresses federal CWA requirements.
The Embarcadero Plaza would be designed to drain predominantly to the west (to conform to the grade
changes in the project area). Runoff would be conveyed to a stormwater treatment system, such as a
media filter (or sand filter). Alternatively, a landscaped stormwater bioretention planter and water quality
treatment area adjacent to the Embarcadero Promenade and the Pier 14 breakwater could be installed to
treat stormwater from the Embarcadero Plaza before it enters San Francisco Bay. In addition,
bioretention planters could be located along the southern side of the new Gate A Access Pier to capture
stormwater from the new pier, and along the East Bayside Promenade to capture runoff from the new
promenade. The bioretention planters would be placed so that their bottoms are above the highest
estimated tide. The specific type, design, and location of stormwater filters and/or treatment units would
be determined during final design in coordination with the Port and the permitting agencies.
In addition, the project is designed in response to state, regional, and local standards for stormwater
management and water quality, and would also include sustainable construction materials and methods, as
required by the San Francisco Green Building Ordinance, Chapter 13 of the San Francisco Building Code.
As a part of the final design, WETA would develop a stormwater control plan, in compliance with the
Port’s Stormwater Management Program. The Plan would designate responsibility and a schedule for
regular maintenance and cleaning of the existing and new facilities (e.g., canopies), as well as general site
maintenance activities (e.g., wash-down; litter removal and trash receptacle management; and lighting
and landscape management).
The project would remove deck and pier areas that are or have been used for vehicle access and parking.
These areas drain directly to San Francisco Bay, and were constructed prior to current federal and state
water quality regulations. The removal of these auto-oriented and vehicular access areas would remove a
potential source of pollutants (e.g., litter, oil, and grease from vehicles). In addition to removing these
potential pollutant sources, all of the new deck and pile construction to be undertaken as part of the
project would be designed according to current standards, based on the Stormwater Design Guidelines
established by the Port.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

As discussed in Section 3.12, Hazards and Hazardous Materials, the project would not include any regular
use, storage, or transport of hazardous materials or chemicals, other than the fuel on the vessels. There
would be no fueling at the project facilities.
BMPs would be implemented during operations. These would include, but would not be limited to, the
following:




Develop spill prevention and emergency response plan to handle potential fuel or other spills;
Practice good housekeeping (e.g., provide covered trash bins on vessels and at the Ferry Terminal,
store hazardous materials in centralized locations protected from rainfall); and
Conduct regular sweeping of gates, plaza, and promenade.

The proposed project would be designed, constructed, and maintained to prevent or minimize the
discharge of pollutants into San Francisco Bay. Effects on water quality during project operations would
be minimal with implementation of BMPs and adherence to water quality regulations.
NEPA Determination. The project’s impact to water quality as a result of project operation would not
be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to impact water quality as a result of project operation
would be less than significant.
Impact 3.11-3: Substantially Increase San Francisco Bay Fill and Compromise Water
Quality
No Action Alternative
The No Action Alternative would not place new fill 1 in San Francisco Bay, nor would it remove fill
through demolition of existing deck and pile structures. Therefore, the No Action Alternative would have
no impact on the amount of fill in San Francisco Bay, or policies related to water surface area, volume,
and quality.
Action Alternative
The Action Alternative includes demolition existing deck and pile structures, and placement of new fill in
San Francisco Bay. Table 2-2 summarizes the amount of fill removed by demolition, and the amount of
fill added by new construction. The table also provides details on the type of fill, which includes fill in
San Francisco Bay (i.e., due to piles), floating fill, and shadow fill.
Filling reduces the surface area of San Francisco Bay, and the volume of water in the Bay. This can
reduce San Francisco Bay’s ability to maintain adequate oxygen levels in the water, circulation, and tidal
interchange. Both the Corps and BCDC have policies and regulations regarding the placement of new fill
in San Francisco Bay.
In the North Basin, fill proposed by the project at Gate A includes a new access pier, gangway, float, and
associated piles. A portion of the new fill would be considered replacement of existing fill, because it
would be in the same location as the former Pier ½. 2 In the North Basin, there would be a total net

As noted in Section 2.2, Pier ½ was removed as part of the America’s Cup Project prior to the initiation of the proposed
project.

increase in the amount of fill of approximately 15,495 square feet. With respect to the amount of fill into
San Francisco Bay from piles, there would be a net increase of approximately 295 square feet.
In the South Basin, existing deck and pile structure would be removed (including Pier 2). Pier 2 is also
designated for removal in BCDC’s Special Area Plan (BCDC, 2000), and the Port has determined that the
substructure is in need of repair. Fill would be associated with Gates F and G, the Embarcadero Plaza,
and the East Bayside Promenade. There would be a net increase in the total amount of fill in the South
Basin of approximately 24,440 square feet. With respect to the amount of fill into San Francisco Bay
from piles, there would be a net increase of approximately 50 square feet.
Placement of new structures in navigable waters of the United States is regulated by the Corps in
accordance with their authorization under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, and under
Section 404 of the CWA. The Section 10 regulations prohibit unauthorized obstruction or alteration of
the navigable waters of the United States, and CWA Section 404 regulates the placement of fill material,
including piers, into waters of the United States. As such, placement of new piles as part of the project
would require a permit from the Corps pursuant to Section 10 and Section 404. The Corps would assess
the public benefits that would result from the project, to justify and permit the placement of new fill. As
described in detail in Impact 3.3-2, the proposed fill would be consistent with the Public Trust Doctrine,
would provide public access to San Francisco Bay, would support the development of water-related uses,
and would improve public transportation in the region, providing public benefit. The proposed project
has also been designed to minimize the amount of fill necessary to meet the project’s purpose and need.
It is anticipated the Corps permit would require implementation of BMPs during construction as a part of
the permit approval, as described under Impact 3.11-7.
As set forth in BCDC’s policies and discussed in Section 3.2, Land Use, filling that reduces surface area
and water volume should be allowed only for the purpose of providing substantial public benefits.
Overall, the project would result in a total net increase in fill surface area of approximately 39,935 square
feet, all of which is associated with water transit service, public access, and emergency evacuation needs.
This overall increase accounts for fill in San Francisco Bay, floating fill, and shadow fill, and would be
negligible in comparison to the total surface area of San Francisco Bay (i.e., approximately 0.9 acre of fill
compared to approximately 327,000 acres of open waters in San Francisco Bay [BCDC, 2008]). With
respect to fill in San Francisco Bay due to piles, there would be an overall net increase of approximately
345 square feet (or approximately 0.008 acre). With this slight increase in the amount of fill into San
Francisco Bay, along with the design and arrangement of the piles and facilities, the project would not
adversely affect oxygen levels, water circulation, or tidal interchange in San Francisco Bay. Therefore,
the project would be consistent with the BCDC’s Bay Plan policies with respect to water surface area,
volume, and quality, and there would be no need to remove fill from elsewhere along the waterfront (also
see discussion in Section 3.3, Land Use).
NEPA Determination. The project’s potential to compromise water surface area, volume, and quality
due to placement of fill in San Francisco Bay would not be adverse, and would be consistent with the
Corps’ Section 10 and Section 404 policies as well as BCDC’s coastal zone management policies.
CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to compromise water surface area, volume, and quality
due to placement of fill in San Francisco Bay would be consistent with the Corps’ Section 10 and
Section 404 policies as well as BCDC’s coastal zone management policies, and would be less than
significant.
Impact 3.11-4: Potential Impact to People and Structures from Tsunami
As described in Section 3.11.2, the project area is located within the predicted tsunami inundation area, so
that project operations, passengers, and project facilities could be impacted by a tsunami. Although the
threat of a tsunami is considered to be a rare and infrequent event, CCSF has established a tsunami

warning system. This system consists of sirens and loudspeakers to warn people of an impending
tsunami.
No Action Alternative
The No Action Alternative maintains the existing Ferry Terminal gate configuration and circulation areas,
including the function, uses, and design of public spaces in the project area. No new gates or additional
boarding capacity would be provided to accommodate new WETA services, or the expansion of existing
WETA services, as part of the No Action Alternative. Similarly, there would be no implementation of
circulation and boarding improvements to respond to emergency planning requirements. Under the No
Action Alternative, it is expected that the existing gates and related facilities would be maintained in
approximately their current condition, and their susceptibility to tsunami damage would be unchanged.
Action Alternative
The Action Alternative is the expansion and improvement of the Ferry Terminal at the Ferry Building,
which includes construction of three new gates and overwater berthing facilities, in addition to supportive
landside improvements such as improved passenger boarding areas, additional passenger waiting and
queuing areas, and circulation improvements. The new deck and piles structures (i.e., Embarcadero
Plaza, East Bayside Promenade, Gate A Access Pier, and North Basin Marginal Wharf improvements)
would all be constructed to Essential Facility standards, thereby providing improved protection from a
tsunami, and additional areas for emergency evacuation staging.
Activation of the existing San Francisco tsunami warning system would allow for evacuation of people
prior to the arrival of a tsunami. Although the Action Alternative would include improvements to lessen
potential damage, the likelihood of a tsunami occurring that could result in substantial damage to existing,
improved, and new facilities is very low. Therefore, effects due to inundation or damage from a tsunami
would be minimal.
NEPA Determination. The project’s potential to impact operations, people, and structures from a
tsunami would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to impact operations, people, and structures from a
tsunami would be less than significant.
Impact 3.11-5: Potential Flooding Impacts to New Project Facilities
No Action Alternative
The still water level (SWL) resulting from a 100-year storm event is estimated to be approximately
9.2 feet (mean lower low water [MLLW]) (ROMA, 2012). Taking into account a predicted sea-level rise
of 16 inches by 2050 (BCDC, 2011), the SWL for the 100-year storm event is estimated to be 10.5 feet
(MLLW). With the exception of the area near the Agriculture Building, which often experiences flooding
during storm events, the existing features, including the Ferry Building, are above the 100-year SWL of
9.2 feet (MLLW). Recent preliminary FEMA flood maps (CCSF, 2008a) show the Agriculture Building
and the apron around it as a Special Flood Hazard Area. Considering sea-level rise, the area near the
Agriculture Building could be flooded during a 100-year event in 2050. The No Action Alternative
would not result in any physical changes to the project area. The flooding and sea-level rise effects on
operations would remain adverse.

Action Alternative
For the Action Alternative, the new gates would be built at 13 to 13.5 feet above MLLW, which would
provide approximately 3.8 to 4.3 feet of freeboard above a 100-year storm SWL of 9.2 feet MLLW, or
approximately 2.5 to 3 feet of freeboard above a 100-year storm SWL, with anticipated sea-level rise of
16 inches by 2050 (to an elevation of 10.5 feet MLLW). Floating berthing facilities would be used to
accommodate tidal variations and sea-level rise.
Elevations for new decks would range from 12.2 feet to 13.2 feet MLLW, which would provide a
freeboard allowance of 3 to 4 feet above the 100-year SWL of 9.2 feet, or 1.7 to 2.7 feet above the
100-year SWL, with sea-level rise in 2050 of 10.5 feet.
As part of the proposed project, a portion of the North Basin marginal wharf would be repaired and
strengthened. At the Agriculture Building, the South Apron would be strengthened. However, the
Agriculture building would remain as it is currently, susceptible to being flooded during a 100-year event
in 2050.
NEPA Determination. Because the project would be designed to address flooding and sea-level rise,
and to provide sufficient freeboard for new structures, effects on operations due to flooding would not be
adverse.
CEQA Determination. The impacts from flooding and sea-level rise on the project’s operations would
be less than significant.
Impact 3.11-6: Potential Impacts to Shoreline and Project Area Facilities from Wake
Wash
Vessel operations could create wakes that could potentially damage the shoreline and facilities at the
Ferry Terminal, or damage other vessels (i.e., vessels docked, approaching, or leaving the other gates).
No Action Alternative
The existing shoreline within the project area consists of manmade structures, which would not be
susceptible to erosion that could be induced by wake-wash waves. There would be no changes to the
shoreline or facilities at the Ferry Terminal as part of the No Action Alternative, but there would be
increased frequency of trips. As described in Table 2-3, Vessel Characteristics, new service would be
provided by high-speed catamarans, which have lower wake heights and energies compared with
conventional submerged-hull vessels. Currently, vessels are operated under self-imposed procedures to
limit wave impacts to existing berthing facilities and vessels, and to approach berths slowly for passenger
safety. The movement of ferry vessels is also very unlikely to affect the pilings under the Ferry Building
or the Agriculture Building. There is no evidence that existing vessel traffic near the Ferry Building has
affected the nearby structures. The piles supporting the existing buildings are designed to withstand
extreme loads, such as those generated by winter storms and seismic events. 3 Because the vessels would
have the same or lower design wash heights as those currently in use, effects on operations would be
negligible and not adverse.
Action Alternative
As part of the Action Alternative, improvements would be made along the shoreline, and new gates would
be installed. New and improved facilities would be designed to withstand wake-wash impacts. As
3

The energy in waves is proportional to the square of the wave height. This means that the energy in an extreme 8-foot-high
winter storm wave is 16 times greater than the energy in a nominal 2-foot-high wave from a vessel approaching the Ferry
Terminal berths.

described above for the No Action Alternative, vessels would be operated to minimize wake-wash
impacts. Because the vessels would have the same or lower design wash heights as those currently in use,
effects on operations would be negligible and not adverse. Additionally, because vessels are shallowdraft and operate at slow speeds near the Ferry Terminal, there would be no scour impacts on Bay Area
Rapid Transit facilities or other structures.
NEPA Determination. The project would not result in adverse impacts on the shoreline and vessels due
to wake wash from operations.
CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to impact the shoreline and vessels due to wake wash
from operations would be less than significant.
Indirect Impacts
No indirect impacts have been identified.
Construction Impacts
The No Action Alternative would not result in any physical changes to the Ferry Terminal, and no
construction activities would be required. Therefore, there would be no construction impacts to water
quality or hydrology.
Impact 3.11-7: Potential Impacts of Dredging and Pile Removal and Placement Activities
on Water Quality
Construction activities such as dredging, pile removal, and pile placement would disturb sediment and
temporarily increase turbidity levels locally in San Francisco Bay.
The proposed project would require initial dredging of up to approximately 33,000 cy of sediment in the
vicinity of Gates A, F, and G, and offsite reuse or disposal of the dredged sediment. It is estimated that
dredging activities would occur over a 1-month period in the vicinity of Gate A; and over 2 months at
Gates F and G. Dredging would cause a resuspension of sediments and a temporary decrease in water
clarity locally. Some resuspension of sediments could also occur during pile removal and placement and
other in-water activities that disturb the San Francisco Bay floor.
Excessive increases in turbidity could violate water quality objectives. In addition, turbidity reduces
water clarity and light available for photosynthesis, and can have adverse effects on aquatic organisms
(refer to Section 3.9 Biological Resources, for additional discussion). Concentrations of other pollutants
(such as metals and certain pesticides) associated with sediment particles could also increase, because
contaminated sediments are known to occur along the San Francisco Bay shoreline. Disturbance of
contaminated sediment could impact water quality. Although these effects are short term and greatly
diminish with distance from the activity, sediment and sediment-borne pollutants may be mobilized away
from the project site under suitable hydrologic and hydraulic conditions.
All in‐water construction activities would require permits and approvals to comply with Corps, U.S. EPA,
RWQCB, and BCDC regulations and provisions. Compliance with these permits would require the
implementation of BMPs that would avoid or reduce potential impacts related to resuspended sediments,
as described in detail below.
As part of the permitting process, WETA would be required to:


Prepare a sampling and analysis plan in accordance with U.S. EPA guidance to characterize the
material to be dredged. The plan would describe sampling that would be conducted, and quality
assurance procedures that would be implemented, to ensure the collection of data of appropriate

quality to support a decision regarding a suitable disposal method. The plan, which would be
reviewed by all participating DMMO agencies, including the RWQCB, CSLC, the Corps, and the
U.S. EPA, must be approved by the DMMO.


Sample the sediments in accordance with the approved sampling and analysis plan, and submit a
report to the DMMO documenting the sampling event. Based on this report, the DMMO would
determine the suitable disposal method for the dredged sediments. WETA would then submit a
Consolidated Dredging‐Dredged Material Reuse-Disposal Application to the DMMO, detailing
proposed disposal method and location. The DMMO agencies would review the permit application,
and approve or deny the permit.



Comply with the water quality protection BMPs specified by the DMMO agencies. The RWQCB
water quality certification would specify methods for ensuring the protection of water quality during
construction activities in San Francisco Bay. Any conditions of water quality certification would then
be incorporated into the Corps Section 404/10 permit authorized for the project. In place of this water
quality certification, the RWQCB could, at its discretion, issue waste discharge requirements
specifying equivalent measures for the protection of water quality during construction. Also, the
project sponsor would be required to adhere to policies and requirements set forth by BCDC in order
to obtain a BCDC Major Permit to conduct construction and dredge and fill operations within
BCDC’s jurisdiction.

Dredging and pile-driving activities would result in short-term effects on water quality, which would be
minimized with implementation of BMPs required through the adherence to water quality permits and
approvals.
NEPA Determination. The project would not have adverse impacts to water quality as a result of
dredging and pile removal and placement.
CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to impact water quality as a result of dredging and pile
removal and placement would be less than significant.
Impact 3.11-8: Potential Degradation of Water Quality Caused by Demolition and
Construction Activities
The project proposes in- and over-water demolition and construction activities. However, because the
project would not disturb more than 1 acre of land, it would not be subject to the requirements of the
Construction General Permit.
These activities would include the use of a variety of diesel-powered equipment. Two types of barges
would be required; one for materials storage, and one outfitted with demolition equipment (crane,
clamshell bucket for pulling of piles, and excavator for removal of the deck). Diesel-powered tug boats
would bring the barges to the project area, where they would be anchored. Spills of diesel fuel, hydraulic
oil, and lubricants could occur, potentially impacting water quality. As discussed in Section 3.12,
Hazards and Hazardous Materials, under Mitigation Measure HAZ-1, Prepare a Hazardous Materials
Management Plan, WETA would prepare a spill prevention plan to address potential spills or exposure to
contaminants, including measures for spill control, containment prevention, cleanup, wastewater
management, and other foreseeable hazards. The equipment maintenance and refueling restrictions,
hazardous materials measures, and site reclamation measures included in these measures would reduce
the potential effects related to chemical spills to a negligible level.
Demolition activities would also require the removal of 350 piles and 20,500 square feet of decking in the
South Basin. Piles and decking have been treated with creosote and may contain other potentially
hazardous substances. During demolition and removal of these elements, it is possible that these

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

materials could be crushed and/or splintered as they are removed, potentially releasing into the water
broken fragments and/or debris that contain creosote or other potentially hazardous substances.
Construction activities would include placement of concrete or steel piles and cast-in-place or precast
concrete decking in both the North Basin and South Basin. These construction activities could place wet
and/or fresh concrete and potentially other caustic cementitious materials (e.g., mortar, grout, cement, or
slurry) directly over San Francisco Bay. Direct water contact with wet cement and/or discharges of
cement washout wastewater can result in substantially increased pH levels and other water quality
degradation.
Trash and sanitary wastes are other common sources of potentially harmful materials on construction
sites. In addition, construction equipment, materials, and demolition debris could be on site during
construction. Stormwater would likely come into contact with these materials and equipment, which
could entrain pollutants that could be discharged to San Francisco Bay. The potential for degradation of
water quality from discharge of construction-related materials and chemicals, either directly or conveyed
via stormwater discharges, could be substantial.
Project construction would, however, require compliance with the 401 Certification, 404 Corps Permit,
Section 10 Corps Permit, and a BCDC Major Permit. These regulatory requirements would establish
BMPs designed to protect water quality for all demolition and construction activities, including work over
water, such as:


Training workers to identify and prevent releases of pollutants to working surfaces or directly to San
Francisco Bay;



Using containment booms to capture any pile fragments and floating demolition debris, or other
measures (as required by the resource agencies) to contained suspended sediment;



Storing hazardous materials in centralized areas that are protected from contact with stormwater, and
are provided with secondary containment;



Collecting solid waste in designated areas, and storing it in watertight containers in a covered area, or
with secondary containment;



Removing solid waste from the site regularly;



Using drip pans and absorbent materials for equipment and vehicles, and ensuring that an adequate
supply of spill cleanup materials is available;



Maintaining all vehicles and equipment in good working order with no observable leaks or drips;



Identifying types of spill control measures to be employed, including the storage of such materials
and equipment, and ensuring that staff is trained regarding the use of the materials, deployment and
access of control measures, and reporting measures; and



Controlling discharge of cement and concrete materials and washwater, and limiting direct contact of
freshly poured concrete with San Francisco Bay.

The potential effects on water quality from demolition and construction activities would be minimized
with implementation of BMPs, and adherence to water quality permits and approvals.
NEPA Determination. The project’s potential to impact water quality as a result of in-water and overwater demolition and construction activities would not be adverse.

CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to impact water quality as a result of in-water and overwater demolition and construction activities would be less than significant.
Cumulative Impacts
Impact 3.11-9: Potential to Result in Cumulative Impacts to Hydrology or Water Quality
The geographic area of potential water quality and hydrology cumulative impacts is the central San
Francisco Bay, which is identified as an impaired water body on the basis of several compounds and
parameters.
The proposed project would result in water quality impacts related to construction activities in and over
the waters of San Francisco Bay, including dredging. Other projects listed in Table 3.1-1 that are located
along the waterfront, such as the America’s Cup Project waterfront improvements, Port maintenance
dredging, the Bay Bridge Seismic Safety Project, the Pier 36/Brannan Street Wharf project, and the
Pier 15 to 17 Exploratorium Relocation Project, could also involve similar activities that could affect
water quality in central San Francisco Bay. Water quality impacts could include increases in turbidity;
disturbance and release of contaminated sediments; or accidental release of hazardous materials such as
diesel fuel from construction equipment. The in- and over-water construction activities associated with
these projects could result in potentially adverse cumulative water impacts.
The project’s contribution to cumulative impacts from construction would not be cumulatively
considerable, however, because water quality impacts related to the proposed project construction
activities would be temporary, and WETA would implement water quality control measures required for
compliance with existing regulations and required permits from the Corps, RWQCB, and BCDC,
minimizing any potential for the project to adversely affect water quality. In addition, WETA would
implement Mitigation Measure HAZ-1, implementation of a hazardous material management program, to
further reduce the risk that construction activities could affect water quality.
During operations, the proposed project could result in water quality impacts to San Francisco Bay from
maintenance dredging, stormwater discharges, spills, or litter. Similar activities that could affect water
quality would be associated with the America’s Cup Project waterfront improvements, Port maintenance
dredging, the Bay Bridge Seismic Safety Project, the Pier 36/Brannan Street Wharf project, and the
Pier 15 to 17 Exploratorium Relocation Project. Water quality impacts could include increases in
turbidity; disturbance and release of contaminated sediments; or discharge of contaminants in stormwater.
Water quality impacts from these projects could result in a potentially adverse cumulative water impacts.
However, maintenance dredging activities for the project would be small and infrequent (5,000 to
10,000 cubic yards of material every 3 or 4 years) in comparison to the ongoing maintenance dredging
programs in San Francisco Bay. The proposed project would be designed to capture and treat all
stormwater runoff in compliance with the necessary permits. In addition, the proposed project would not
require any fueling or sanitary waste disposal in the project area, and would implement a site maintenance
plan to reduce litter. Therefore, the potential for project operations to adversely affect water quality
would be small, and the proposed project’s contribution to cumulative impacts from operations would not
be cumulatively considerable.
The proposed project would result in the additional of permanent fill in San Francisco Bay. Projects, such
as the America’s Cup project, San Francisco/Oakland Bay Bridge Seismic Safety projects, Brannan Street
Wharf, Pier 27 Cruise Ship Terminal project, the Piers 15 and 17 Exploratorium Relocation, and Pier 70
Area (listed in Table 3.1-1), could also result in additional fill in San Francisco Bay, which could
cumulatively affect the hydrology and surface area of the Bay. However the amount of fill that could
result from these projects is still small when compared to the overall surface area of San Francisco Bay,
and would therefore be unlikely to affect the hydrology and water quality of the Bay as a whole. In
addition, BCDC regulates the placement of new fill in San Francisco Bay to ensure that changes in Bay

fill are consistent with the Bay Plan. As part of the permitting and approvals process for individual
projects, potential fill impacts would be evaluated and project consistency with the BCDC plans would be
ensured by the lead agency and BCDC. Mitigation of proposed new fill would be required, as necessary.
Therefore, the reasonably foreseeable projects, in combination with the proposed project, would not result
in adverse cumulative impacts related to an increase in fill in San Francisco Bay.
Impacts related to tsunami inundation, flooding, sea-level rise, or wake wash from vessels would be sitespecific, and the project’s impact would not be adverse; therefore, the proposed project would not
contribute to cumulative impacts related to these topics during project operations.
NEPA Determination. The proposed project, in combination with other reasonably foreseeable projects,
has the potential to adversely cumulatively impact water quality. However, the project’s contribution to
cumulative water quality impacts would not be considerable.
CEQA Determination. The proposed project, in combination with other reasonably foreseeable projects,
has the potential to cumulatively impact water quality. However, the project’s contribution to cumulative
water quality impacts would not be considerable, and therefore would be less than significant.
3.11.4 Mitigation Measures
Mitigation measures are not required for hydrology and water quality.

HAZARDS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

3.12.1 Introduction to the Analysis
This section describes the potential for hazardous materials1 and other hazards to affect human health and
safety as a result of construction and operation of the proposed project. Operational effects of the proposed
project would be related to the use of small quantities of diesel fuel to power a back-up generator for the
gates. Construction effects would be related to demolition of existing facilities. Impacts related to release
of fuel from vessels during operation, dredging, and driving piles into San Francisco Bay sediments are
discussed in Section 3.11, Water Resources.
Potential public health and safety impacts from
implementation of the proposed project would include accidental release of hazardous materials used and
stored during construction activities, or during demolition, transport, and disposal of structures containing
hazardous materials. These project impacts would be reduced through implementation of Mitigation
Measure HAZ-1. Additionally, the No Action Alternative was identified as having the potential to result in
an adverse impact, because it would impede the Water Emergency Transportation Authority’s (WETA)
ability to meet its own emergency operation and evacuation responsibilities during a major catastrophic
event.
3.12.2 Affected Environment
This section summarizes the hazardous materials setting and regulatory framework for hazardous materials
and hazardous waste. The evaluation was based on the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA)
prepared for the project area (BASELINE, 2012), other published materials, a site reconnaissance, and
interviews with persons knowledgeable about the site.
Hazardous Materials Setting
This section describes the existing physical hazardous materials setting at the Downtown San Francisco
Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal). Water transit facilities at the end of Market Street in San Francisco
have been in place since at least 1887, and the use, storage, and generation of hazardous waste have
occurred throughout those years of operation. A Phase I ESA for the project site has been completed
(BASELINE, 2012). The findings from this investigation, as they relate to soil, groundwater, and surface
water quality, are described below.
The Phase I ESA was completed for the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project
(project), and included a review of historical land use information such as historical topographic maps,
aerial photographs, and Sanborn Maps; a visual site reconnaissance; an interview with a site owner
representative; a review of environmental records from local, state, and federal sources provided by
Environmental Data Resources, Inc. (EDR); and the development of recommendations for further
actions.2 The findings from these activities are described below.

Historical Land Uses and Associated Hazardous Materials Uses at and Adjacent to the Ferry
Terminal. Water transit facilities at the Ferry Terminal have been in place since at least 1887, when
eight ferry slips were in use. The current San Francisco Ferry Building (Ferry Building) was built

The California Health and Safety Code defines a hazardous material as, “...any material that, because of its quantity,
concentration, or physical or chemical characteristics, poses a significant present or potential hazard to human health and
safety, or to the environment. Hazardous materials include, but are not limited to, hazardous substances, hazardous waste,
radioactive materials, and any material which a handler or the administering agency has a reasonable basis for believing that it
would be injurious to the health and safety of persons or harmful to the environment if released into the workplace or the
environment” (California Health and Safety Code, Section 25501).
Phase I Environmental Site Assessment activities were performed in accordance with the Standard Practice for Environmental
Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process, established by the American Society for Testing and
Materials International in Method E1527-05 (ASTM Standard).

between 1896 and 1898 on a foundation of wood piles and concrete arches on the San Francisco Bay
side of a seawall (Olmsted and Port, 1998). The seawall is along the western side of the Ferry Building.
Former tidal flats west of the seawall were reclaimed by infilling sometime between 1851 and 1898.
The Ferry Building survived the 1906 earthquake, although most of the downtown commercial
buildings at the end of Market Street were destroyed. Reconstruction of the downtown area included
an electric streetcar route terminating at the Ferry Building, and stores and hotels near the end of
Market Street. Mission Street Wharf No. 1, also known as Pier No. 2, was largely removed by 1913,
and the Agriculture Building was built in 1915. Wharf configurations have changed many times
since 1898, and the number of ferry slips has ranged from eight to eleven, until the Ferry Plaza was
constructed over the Transbay Tube in the 1960s.
Because water transit service was initiated in the late 1880s, it is likely that hazardous materials were
used on site. Historical records of the identity, location, and quantities of hazardous materials used
were not available for review during the Phase I ESA. Historic site uses that may have required the
use and storage of hazardous materials include the generation of steam heat; the fueling of fire pumps
with fuel oil; and the presence of a planing mill, testing laboratory, machine shop, paint shop, and
auto service facility. Additionally, vessels may have fueled at the Ferry Terminal in the past.
Historic hazardous materials use may have included petroleum hydrocarbons, volatile organics, semivolatile organics, and metals, and may have affected sediment below the proposed project site.
Historical land uses adjacent to the project site include commercial service-oriented businesses
(including a facility for automotive repair and fueling, a drug store, post office, restaurant, and dry
cleaner), some of which may have used hazardous materials, including petroleum hydrocarbons,
volatile organics, semi-volatile organics, and metals.


Site Reconnaissance. A visual reconnaissance of publicly accessible areas of the project area,
project site, and adjacent properties was conducted for the Phase I ESA in June 2011. At the time of
the site visit, the restaurants and culinary stores on the ground floor of the Ferry Building were
crowded with customers. Gates B, C, D, and E were behind the Ferry Building. Two additional
restaurants were present on the Ferry Plaza and Pier 2. Some delivery vehicles were present, and cars
were parked in Sinbad’s Restaurant parking lot on Pier 2. The open water area, surrounded by
railings, was present just south of the Ferry Building, and the Agriculture Building was south of the
lagoon. Pier ½, north of the Ferry Building, was not open to the public. Multiple old pilings
indicated the former extent of Pier ½. 3
Adjacent land uses are similar to historical land uses, as described above. Outside the main Ferry
Building entrance is a wide sidewalk (the Embarcadero Promenade), The Embarcadero (a divided
roadway), and streetcar rails with a platform bisecting The Embarcadero. High-rise office buildings
and parks of downtown San Francisco are present west of The Embarcadero. Pier 1, north of Pier ½,
was developed as the Port of San Francisco (Port) offices. Pier 14 is south of the project site. No
evidence of significant quantities of hazardous materials use or storage was observed during the site
visit, with the exception of fuel tanks carried by the vessels, and pilings covered with creosote.
There are two curb cuts and driveways south of the Ferry Building that provide emergency vehicle
access to the eastern side of the Ferry Building and the facilities located on the Ferry Plaza (Gates C
and D, the Carnelian by the Bay, and Bay Area Rapid Transit [BART] facilities). The driveway just
south of the Ferry Building also serves as a fire lane. Two additional curb cuts and emergency
vehicle access points are north of the Ferry Building.

As discussed in Section 2.2 of Chapter 2, Alternatives, Pier ½ and the restaurant on Pier 2, Sinbad’s, will be removed as a part
of the America’s Cup Project prior to initiation of Water Emergency Transportation Authority’s proposed project. At the time
of the site reconnaissance, the structures were located within the project area, so they are discussed here.

BART has evacuation facilities on the Ferry Plaza; in the case of an emergency in the Transbay Tube,
passengers would be evacuated to the Ferry Plaza.


Interviews with Persons Knowledgeable about the Site. A Port representative, Ms. Carol Bach,
was interviewed on June 13, 2011, during the site reconnaissance, and provided the following
information (BASELINE, 2012). Ms. Bach was not aware of hazardous materials use or storage on
site, with the exception of creosote-coated pilings, and two 70-gallon diesel fuel tanks to power backup generators for the float system for each floating gate (Gates B and E). Vessels are not currently
fueled on site, and historical fueling procedures were not known. The Ferry Building has had some
issues with broken sewage pipes. Sewage discharges landward into the City and County of San
Francisco (CCSF) combined storm and sewage system. Unauthorized graywater discharges into San
Francisco Bay by restaurants have been reported. The COSCO Busan oil spill of November 2007,
which originated at the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, reached the Ferry Terminal, and oil
(bunker fuel) that adhered to pilings was cleaned up by the Coast Guard.



Regulatory Agency Database Review. A search of regulatory agency databases pertaining to
hazardous material use and releases on properties at and near the project site was completed for the
Phase I ESA (BASELINE, 2012). The search included sites within 750 feet of the project site that
were topographically upgradient (i.e., where a release could affect the project site). The project site
and 27 other sites were identified on regulatory agency databases for hazardous materials storage,
generation, or releases. The majority of these sites was listed due to hazardous materials use with no
record of hazardous materials release. Six of those sites, including the proposed project site, were
listed as having had a hazardous materials release from underground storage tanks (USTs) in the past.
All six sites have been closed by regulatory agencies, indicating remediation has been completed or is
not required. None of these sites with hazardous materials releases would be expected to impact
sediment or surface water beneath the proposed project site.
The project site was listed on several databases related to USTs, oil spills, hazardous materials
disposal, and air pollution. These listings are provided in Table 3.12-1.
There were six oil spills listed by EDR that originated from the Ferry Terminal area. These were releases
of unidentified oil and hydraulic oil to San Francisco Bay waters. Because these spills affected surface
water at the project site, they have the potential to have affected sediments below the project site.
Additional spills originating off site also have the potential to affect sediments below the project site.
An oil spill on February 11, 1987, occurred between San Francisco Bay and the Ferry Building, and
was listed by EDR. The COSCO Busan oil spill of November 2007 reached the project site, and was
cleaned up by the Coast Guard, as reported by Port staff (Bach, 2011).

San Francisco Bay Sediment Sampling
The San Francisco Estuary Institute has a regional monitoring station approximately 2,000 feet south of the
Ferry Building and north of the Bay Bridge in San Francisco Bay. Sediment sampled at this location regularly
tests positive for polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are associated with petroleum
hydrocarbon use, including wood piling preservation (SFEI, 2011).
Chemical testing of sediments below the project site was conducted in 1995. Results of these studies were
summarized in the Environmental Assessment and Initial Study prepared in support of the first phase of the
proposed project in 1997 (SF Planning et al., 1997). Samples from the north and south terminal areas were
reported to contain concentrations of PAH that were elevated, but considered typical of industrial
concentrations in San Francisco Bay. One sample collected alongside Pier 1 and near the shoreline showed
“very severe” PAH contamination (e.g., naphthalene, acenaphthene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene).

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Previous Asbestos and Lead Sampling
The Port maintains a listing of environmental reports for the project site. Although asbestos and lead
sampling reports were listed for the Ferry Building and the Agriculture Building, no reports were listed on
the portion of the project site proposed for demolition (the deck and pile structures between the Ferry
Building and Agriculture Building). Structures constructed prior to 1981 may contain asbestos, and
structures painted prior to 1978 may have lead paint. Based on the age of some of the deck and pile
structures to be disturbed (demolished or repaired) by the project, asbestos and lead could be present on site.
Preserved Wood
Piles in the project area (i.e., those that support the existing piers), as well as cluster piles east of Pier ½,
may have been preserved with creosote. The Port listing of environmental reports did not include
chemical analysis of the piles.
Regulatory Framework
The following section describes the regulatory framework for hazardous materials and hazardous waste
management at the Ferry Terminal. Nonhazardous solid waste is discussed in Section 3.15, Utilities and
Public Services. Several laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels affect the management
of hazardous materials and hazardous wastes.4
Federal
United States Environmental Protection Agency
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) is the lead agency responsible for enforcing
federal laws and regulations governing hazardous materials that affect public health or the environment.
The major federal laws and regulations enforced by the U.S. EPA include: the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act; and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act. In California,
the U.S. EPA has granted most enforcement authority over federal hazardous materials regulations to the
California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal/EPA).
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) regulates water quality and potentially hazardous discharges
through the Rivers and Harbors Acts of 1890 (superseded) and 1899 (33 United States Code 401, et seq.),
and the Clean Water Act (33 United States Code § 1257, et seq.). The provisions of each are described in
more detail in Section 3.11, Hydrology and Water Quality.
State
California Environmental Protection Agency
Under the authority of Cal/EPA, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) and the San
Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) are responsible for overseeing the
cleanup of contaminated sites in the City of San Francisco. The DTSC also regulates disposal of
hazardous wastes under California’s Hazardous Waste Control Law.

4

“Hazardous waste is a waste with properties that make it potentially dangerous or harmful to human health or the
environment” (DTSC, 2011).

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

The owner of the property where hazardous waste is generated must have a Hazardous Waste Generator
Number assigned by and registered with DTSC. The contractor and/or hauler of the material is required
to file a Hazardous Waste Manifest that details the hauling and disposal of site hazardous materials.
Wood treated with preservation chemicals and removed from service contains hazardous chemicals that
pose a risk to human health and the environment. The DTSC has developed Alternative Management
Standards for Treated Wood Waste, which simplify and facilitate safe and economical waste disposal
(DTSC, 2008). Structures in the project area contain treated wood, and their demolition and disposal
would be subject to DTSC’s guidelines.
Fluorescent lighting tubes and ballasts, computer displays, and several other common items containing
hazardous materials are regulated as “universal wastes” by Cal/EPA. These building materials may be
encountered by workers prior to building demolition and renovation activities. Universal waste
regulations allow common, low-hazard wastes to be managed under less stringent requirements than other
hazardous wastes.
California Division of Occupational Safety and Health
The California Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health
(Cal/OSHA), enforces state worker health and safety regulations related to construction activities.
Regulations include exposure limits, protective clothing, and training requirements to prevent exposure to
hazardous materials. Cal/OSHA also enforces occupational health and safety regulations specific to lead
and asbestos investigations and abatement that equal or exceed federal requirements. 5 Where there is
asbestos-related work involving 100 square feet or more of asbestos- containing material, asbestos
abatement contractors must follow state regulations contained in 8 California Code of Regulations 1529
and 8 California Code of Regulations 341.6 through 341.14. Asbestos removal contractors must be
certified as such by the Contractors Licensing Board of the State of California. Workers conducting
asbestos abatement must be trained in accordance with state and federal Division of Occupational Safety
and Health regulations, and the local office of Cal/OSHA must be notified of proposed asbestos
abatement. Due to their age, some of the structures proposed for demolition for the project may contain
asbestos.
Regional
Dredged Material Management Office
In 1990, the U.S. EPA, the Corps, the RWQCB, San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development
Commission (BCDC), and the State Water Resources Control Board joined with navigation interests,
fishing groups, environmental organizations, and other interested parties to form the Long-Term
Management Strategy (LTMS) program for dredged material from San Francisco Bay. The LTMS
provides the basis for uniform federal and state dredged material disposal policies and regulations. The
California Coastal Conservancy, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service also participate in the LTMS, as necessary, to implement beneficial reuse options. The goals of
the LTMS are to manage dredging and disposal in an economically and environmentally sound manner,
maximize the beneficial use of dredged material, and develop a coordinated permit application review
process for dredging and disposal projects. Specific guidance for conducting dredging and material
disposal activities is summarized in the Long-Term Management Strategy Management Plan (Corps,
U.S. EPA, BCDC, and RWQCB, 2001).
The Dredged Material Management Office (DMMO) was established as part of the LTMS to consolidate
the processing of dredging permit applications by the staff of the LTMS agencies and the State Lands
5

California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Sections 1529, 1532.1, and 5192.

Commission. The DMMO provides a single application form that meets the requirements of its member
agencies, and unifies processing of applications for dredging permits. The proposed project would
involve both construction and maintenance dredging. These activities would require permitting from the
DMMO.
The process for obtaining approvals for dredging or dredge materials disposal has three phases:
(1) suitability determination; (2) permit process; and (3) episode approval. The suitability determination
process occurs at the DMMO level. The DMMO member agencies make a joint recommendation to the
individual member agencies on whether the sediments to be dredged are appropriate, in terms of potential
for environmental impacts, for the proposed disposal or reuse site. The recommendation is usually based
on the results of sediment testing. The applicant must submit results from recent sediment testing, or
submit sufficient data to support a finding by the agencies that the sediments are suitable for the proposed
disposal environment. The applicant should submit to the DMMO either a sediment Sampling and
Analysis Plan and Quality Assurance Project Plan, or a written request (with supporting information) for
an exclusion from testing requirements based on factors such as previous testing history and physical
characteristics of the material proposed for dredging. The applicant must submit the sampling results to
the DMMO for review, and the DMMO will make a determination about where the materials can be
disposed.
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and BCDC’s Bay Plan do not authorize aquatic disposal of
dredged material unless an analysis of potential alternatives is first performed, and the alternatives prove
to be either environmentally unacceptable or infeasible. To be approved under Section 404 of the CWA,
projects proposing to discharge dredged material to waters of the United States must be shown to have no
practicable alternative to the proposed discharge that would have less impact on the aquatic ecosystem.
Applicants for permits for such discharges must submit a written analysis of the alternatives to the
DMMO.
Although the DMMO provides initial review of permit applications and suitability recommendations,
applicants must eventually obtain separate approval from the appropriate DMMO member agencies (such
as a CWA Section 404 Permit from the Corps, a CWA Section 401 Certification from the RWQCB, and
approval by BCDC); each agency issues permit conditions and specific requirements about how the
project is to be performed.
Some permits for maintenance dredging projects authorize multiple dredging and disposal episodes over a
period of several years. Such permits require that permittees obtain formal approval, after a
recommendation of suitability by the DMMO, for each dredging episode under the permit. Episode
approvals, when appropriate, are issued by the individual DMMO member agencies.
Local
San Francisco Department of Public Health
The San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) enforces most regulations pertaining to
hazardous materials in the City of San Francisco. The SFDPH regulates site mitigation under their Site
Mitigation Program, and the SFDPH Hazardous Materials Unified Program Agency (HMUPA) regulates
hazardous waste storage, generation, and accidental release under the Certified Unified Program Agency
program. 6 The hazardous materials programs administered by the SFDPH and potentially applicable to
the project are described briefly below.

6

The Certified Unified Program Agency program was established under California Senate Bill 1082 to reduce the cost and
improve the efficiency of hazardous materials regulations.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation



Hazardous Materials Plan. Businesses that handle hazardous materials in excess of specified
quantities must report their chemical inventories to the HMUPA by preparing a Hazardous Materials
Plan, to inform the community about chemical use, storage, handling, and disposal practices. The
Hazardous Materials Plan is also intended to provide essential information to fire fighters, health
officials, planners, elected officials, workers, and their representatives so that they can plan for and
respond to potential exposures to hazardous materials. Any hazardous materials use, storage,
handling, or disposal by the project will be subject to these reporting requirements.



California Accidental Release Prevention Program. Under this program, businesses that use large
quantities of acutely hazardous materials must prepare a detailed engineering analysis of the potential
accident factors present at a business, and the mitigation measures that can be implemented to reduce
this accident potential.

City of San Francisco Maher Ordinance
CCSF has adopted an ordinance (Maher Ordinance, 253-86, signed by the mayor on June 27, 1986) that
requires analysis of soil for chemical compounds in specified areas, and on sites specifically designated
by the Director of Public Works, when more than 50 cubic yards of soil are to be disturbed. The
ordinance includes sites bayward of the 1851 high tide line (SFDPH, 2011). Although the project site is
bayward of the 1851 high tide line, it is east of the historic fill area bounded by the seawall. According to
the SFDPH, the Maher Ordinance was not intended to apply to sediments, only manmade fills; therefore,
the proposed project is not subject to Maher Ordinance requirements (Cushing, 2011).
Bay Area Air Quality Management District
Section 19827.5 of the California Health and Safety Code, adopted January 1, 1991, requires that local
agencies not issue demolition or alteration permits until an applicant has demonstrated compliance with
notification requirements under applicable federal regulations regarding hazardous air pollutants,
including asbestos. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) has the authority to
regulate airborne pollutants, including asbestos, through both inspection and law enforcement, and is to
be notified 10 days in advance of any proposed demolition or abatement work.
Notification includes the names and addresses of operations and persons responsible; description and
location of the structure to be demolished/altered, including size, age, and prior use, and the approximate
amount of friable asbestos; scheduled starting and completion dates of demolition or abatement; the
nature of planned work and methods to be employed; the procedures to be employed to meet BAAQMD
requirements; and the name and location of the waste disposal site to be used. The BAAQMD randomly
inspects asbestos removal operations. In addition, the BAAQMD will inspect any removal operations for
which a complaint has been received. Due to their age, some of the structures that would be demolished
as part of the proposed project could contain asbestos.
Port of San Francisco
The Port has regulatory review responsibilities to ensure that new construction, alterations, and public
improvements comply with applicable use, design review, environmental, and other government
regulations. The Port requires compliance with their building code, and is the permitting agency for
construction and demolition on Port property. The Port has the authority to require hazardous materials
handling and storage plans.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation



Create a significant hazard to the public or the environment through the routine transport, use, or
disposal of hazardous materials or wastes;



Create a significant hazard to the public or the environment through reasonably foreseeable upset and
accident conditions involving the release of hazardous materials into the environment;



Emit hazardous emissions or handle hazardous or acutely hazardous materials, substances, or waste
within ¼ mile of an existing or proposed school;



Create a significant hazard to the public or the environment from existing hazardous materials
contamination by exposing future occupants or users of the site to contamination in excess of
applicable environmental screening levels;



Be located on a site that is included on a list of hazardous material sites compiled pursuant to
Government Code Section 65962.5; and as a result, create a significant hazard to the public or the
environment;



Be located in an adopted airport land use plan for a public-use airport, resulting in a safety hazard for
people residing and working in the project area;



Expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury, or death involving wildland fires,
including where wildland is adjacent to urbanized areas or where residences are intermixed with
wildland; and



Impair implementation of or physically interfere with an adopted emergency response plan or
emergency evacuation plan.

The following analysis evaluates the proposed project’s potential effects related to hazards and hazardous
materials. To determine potential impacts of the project related to hazards and hazardous materials, the
project components were evaluated to determine their potential to cause workers, the public, and/or the
environment to come into contact with hazardous materials during both the construction and operation
periods. Available reports, maps, and other documents—including the Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment for the project (BASELINE, 2012), and Hazardous Materials Plans for project area facilities,
as available—were reviewed to identify potential hazards and hazardous materials in the project area. In
addition, existing emergency response plans that involve the Ferry Terminal and the immediate vicinity
were reviewed, if available. The project’s potential to adversely affect adopted emergency response
plans, both during construction and operation, was evaluated.
Demolition, construction, and operation activities would take place bayward of the seawall; therefore, the
potential impacts related to release of hazardous materials to land are anticipated to not be adverse.
Because demolition, construction, and operation activities would take place over water, releases of
hazardous materials could adversely affect water quality in San Francisco Bay; these potential effects are
discussed in Section 3.11, Water Resources. This section focuses on potential adverse effects to human
health associated with hazardous materials handling.
In addition, the proposed project site is not in an area covered by an adopted airport land use plan;
therefore, no adverse impacts would be expected. The project site is surrounded by urbanized areas and
San Francisco Bay, and is not in a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection fire hazard zone
(CAL FIRE, 2007); therefore, no adverse impacts due to wildland fires would be expected.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Direct Impacts
Impact 3.12-1: Potential Public or Environmental Exposure from the Routine Transport,
Use, and Disposal of Hazardous Materials
No Action Alternative
This alternative would not involve modification of the Ferry Terminal facilities. New and existing
WETA services would be accommodated at the existing gates available to WETA at the Ferry Terminal
(Gates B and E) without any changes or improvements. No changes to hazardous materials usage at the
Ferry Terminal gates would be expected under the No Action Alternative.
Action Alternative
This alternative would include modification of the Ferry Terminal facilities. Impacts from hazardous
materials release during operation at the proposed new gates (Gates A, F, and G) could occur.
Refueling is not currently conducted at the Ferry Terminal, and is not proposed by the project. However,
emergency power would be provided on site through one centrally located back-up generator; diesel tanks
for storage of fuel for the back-up generator may also be required. No other hazardous materials or fuels
would be used or stored on site. If hazardous materials (i.e., diesel fuel), were used above CCSF’s
threshold quantities (500 pounds or 55 gallons), WETA would be required to comply with CCSF’s
hazardous materials handling requirements, specified in Article 21 of the San Francisco Health Code, and
prepare a Hazardous Materials Plan as required by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The
use of a back-up generator would require a certificate of registration in accordance with additional
regulations specified in Article 30 of the San Francisco Health Code. Transportation of hazardous
materials such as diesel fuel is regulated by the California Highway Patrol and the California Department
of Transportation. The proposed project would comply with these standards, including display of proper
placards on vehicles containing hazardous materials, and appropriate licensing of drivers.
The Port would review and approve the project for a building permit before construction could
commence. This review process would ensure compliance with the Port Building Code, and additional
review by the Port Fire Marshall and Port’s Environmental Specialist would ensure compliance with the
Fire Code and environmental concerns pertinent to the Port’s jurisdictional area. Depending on the nature
and extent of potential environmental risk from ongoing operations, the Port may require the facility
operator to develop an Operations Plan for review and approval by Port environmental staff. The
Operations Plan would specify fuel use and storage procedures designed to prevent fuel spills while using
or refilling the back-up generator, and would be a condition of the lease for the subject facility.
Implementation of these existing requirements would minimize potential exposure of site personnel and
the public to routine transport, use, and disposal of hazardous materials, and would also protect against
potential environmental contamination. Therefore, no adverse impact would be expected.
NEPA Determination. The project’s impact on the public or the environment through the routine use,
transport, or disposal of hazardous materials or wastes associated with operation activities would not be
adverse.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Determination. The impact on the public or the
environment through the routine use, transport, or disposal of hazardous materials or wastes associated
with operation activities would be less than significant.

Impact 3.12-2: Project Would Be Included on a Government List of Hazardous Materials
Sites
No Action Alternative
This alternative would not involve modification of the Ferry Terminal facilities. New and existing
WETA services would be accommodated at the existing gates available to WETA at the Ferry Terminal
(Gates B and E) without any changes or improvements. No changes to the location of the project on a
government list of hazardous materials sites at the Ferry Terminal gates would be expected under the No
Action Alternative.
Action Alternative
Hazardous materials have reportedly been released to soil and sediment at the project site from past and
current site uses. The Ferry Building is on the State Water Resources Control Board Leaking
Underground Storage Tank list; however, the case was closed in 1996, indicating remediation was
complete or not required. Several oil spills were reported on the U.S. EPA Emergency Response
Notification System list in the Ferry Terminal area from 1987 to 2008. The Phase I ESA prepared for the
project in 2012 reported that no active investigations of hazardous materials release sites in the project
site, or within 750 feet of the project site, were identified on the list of hazardous materials sites compiled
pursuant to Government Code Section 65962.5. Historical site uses may have affected sediment below
the site, and elevated PAH concentrations in sediment below the site were reported in 1995 (BASELINE,
2012). These releases or potential releases are considered not adverse because regulatory agencies have
not taken, or propose to take, enforcement action. Routine dredging and sediment disposal would be
conducted in compliance with the 404 Corps Permit, as discussed in Section 3.11. Dredging and disposal
of dredged materials would be conducted in coordination with the DMMO. WETA would either acquire
(and comply with the requirements of) a Dredging – Dredge Material Reuse/Disposal project-specific
permit that would be issued by the Corps, or coordinate with the Port to manage dredging and dredge
spoils disposal under an existing applicable permit. Requirements would include development of a
sampling plan, sediment characterization, a sediment removal plan, and handling and disposal in
accordance with the applicable permit. Adherence to the new Corps or existing Port dredge material
disposal permit would minimize the potential for emissions of hazardous materials due to the transport of
dredge materials.
NEPA Determination. The impact on the public or the environment due to location of the project on a
government list of hazardous materials sites would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The impact on the public or the environment due to location of the project on a
government list of hazardous materials sites would be less than significant.
Impact 3.12-3: Emission of Hazardous Materials within ¼ Mile of a School
No Action Alternative
This alternative would not involve modification of the Ferry Terminal facilities. New and existing
WETA services would be accommodated at the existing gates available to WETA at the Ferry Terminal
(Gates B and E) without any changes or improvements. No changes to the emissions of hazardous
materials at the Ferry Terminal gates would be expected under the No Action Alternative.
Action Alternative
A search of governmental databases and local maps indicates that there are 16 schools and educational
facilities within ¼ mile of the proposed project. However, as discussed above in Impact 3.12-1,

adherence to San Francisco Health Code Articles 21 and 30, SFDPH requirements, and the Port
Operations Plan, if required, would minimize the potential for emissions of hazardous materials due to the
use and transport of diesel fuel required by the back-up generator. In addition, as discussed above in
Impact 3.12-2, adherence to the new Corps or existing Port dredge material disposal permit would
minimize the potential for emissions of hazardous materials due to the transport of dredge materials.
Therefore, no adverse impact to schools would be expected.
NEPA Determination. The potential impact on the public within ¼ mile of a school due to the handling
of hazardous materials associated with operation activities would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The potential impact on the public within ¼ mile of a school due to the handling
of hazardous materials associated with operation activities would be less than significant.
Impact 3.12-4: Potential Impacts to Implementation of an Adopted Emergency Response
Plan
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, new and existing WETA services would be accommodated at the
existing gates available to WETA at the Ferry Terminal (Gates B and E) without any changes or
improvements. No changes to the implementation of an adopted emergency response plan would be
expected under the No Action Alternative. This alternative would inhibit WETA’s ability to meet their
emergency operation and evacuation responsibilities during a major catastrophic event, because only two
gates would be available for vessel evacuation. As a result, the No Action Alternative would result in
adverse and potentially significant impacts to emergency operation.
Action Alternative
The proposed project would not be expected to impair implementation of, or interfere with, any
emergency operation or evacuation plans in the vicinity of the project site. Existing vehicular access for
the fire lane would be maintained. Additionally, BART’s evacuation route on the Ferry Plaza would be
maintained and would not be impacted. Implementation of the proposed project would improve WETA’s
ability to respond to emergencies by increasing the Ferry Terminal’s capacity for implementing a major
evacuation. The project would construct all new facilities to California Building Code Essential Facilities
standards, which would help ensure that the project facilities would remain operational in the event of
extreme environmental events. The Action Alternative would have a beneficial impact on emergency
operation.
NEPA Determination. The project would have a beneficial impact on emergency operation.
CEQA Determination. The impact to emergency response plans during operation would be less than
significant.
Indirect Impacts
No indirect impacts from hazards and hazardous materials for the Action or No Action Alternatives have
been identified.
Construction Impacts
Impacts to water quality related to construction activities (i.e., dredging and pile driving) are discussed in
Section 3.11, Water Resources.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Impacts on schools and emergency response from project construction would be similar to those
described under Direct Impacts above. Adherence during construction to San Francisco Health Code
Articles 21 and 30, SFDPH requirements, and the required Port Operations Plan would minimize the
potential for emissions of hazardous materials; therefore, no adverse impact to schools would be
expected. Additionally, construction activities would not be expected to impair implementation of, or
interfere with, any emergency operation or evacuation plans in the vicinity of the project site.
The No Action Alternative would not result in any physical changes to the Ferry Terminal, and no
construction activities would be required. Therefore, there would be no construction impacts to hazards
and hazardous materials.
Impact 3.12-5: Upset and Accidents Involving Hazardous Materials Use and Storage
During Construction Activities
This project would include demolition, removal, repair, and replacement of existing facilities, as well as
construction of new facilities. Portions of the existing deck and pile structures in the South Basin would
be removed. Three new gates (Gates A, F, and G) and new circulation areas would be constructed. Most
of the demolition and construction areas would be accessed from barges in the construction zone on San
Francisco Bay, identified on Figure 2-9. Construction and demolition activities would include the use of
a variety of types of diesel-powered equipment, including barges, tugboats, cranes, clamshell dredges, and
excavators. Impacts related to hazardous materials use, storage, and disposal during construction could
potentially create a hazard to the public or the environment.
Hazardous materials (e.g., diesel fuel, hydraulic oil, lubricants, paints, or other hazardous materials)
would be transported and used on site for proposed construction activities. In addition, construction
vehicles and equipment would be used on site that could accidentally release hazardous materials, such as
oils, grease, or fuels. Demolition activities would require the removal and potential temporary storage of
piles that have been treated with creosote, or that contain other potentially hazardous substances.
Accidental releases of hazardous materials could result in adverse health effects to construction workers,
the public, and the environment. This potential impact would be considered adverse. Mitigation
Measure HAZ-1, Prepare a Hazardous Materials Management Plan (HMMP), requires WETA to prepare
a HMMP to address potential spills or exposures to contaminants during project construction, including
measures for appropriate material storage; spill control, containment, and cleanup; emergency
preparedness; and worker training.
NEPA Determination. The public or the environment could be adversely impacted as a result of
hazardous materials use and storage associated with construction activities. Implementation of Mitigation
Measure HAZ-1, Prepare a Hazardous Materials Management Plan, would reduce this impact; therefore,
impacts would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The impact on the public or the environment as a result of hazardous materials
use and storage associated with construction activities is considered potentially significant.
Implementation of Mitigation Measure HAZ-1, Prepare a Hazardous Materials Management Plan, would
reduce this impact to a less-than-significant level.
Impact 3.12-6: Demolition, Transport, and Disposal of Structures and Dredge Material
Containing Hazardous Materials
Structures constructed prior to 1981 may contain asbestos, and structures painted prior to 1978 may have
lead paint. Based on the age of some of the deck and pile structures to be demolished or repaired,
asbestos and lead could be present on site. If this material is present and not properly abated prior to
demolition, it could potentially expose the public and the environment to these contaminants. Wood
treated with preservation chemicals and removed from service, such as creosote-covered pilings, contains

hazardous chemicals that pose a risk to human health and the environment. Impacts to human health or
the environment related to demolition, transport, and disposal of these hazardous wastes during
construction could occur. This impact would be considered adverse. Mitigation Measure HAZ-1,
Prepare a Hazardous Materials Management Plan, would require WETA to prepare an HMMP to address
potential exposure to contaminants during project demolition and construction, including measures for
appropriate material containment, cleanup, emergency preparedness, and worker training.
Dredge spoils may be impacted with PAHs, as described in Section 3.12.2. As discussed above in
Impact 3.12-2, adherence to the new Corps or existing Port dredge material disposal permit would
minimize the potential for emissions of hazardous materials due to the transport of dredge materials.
Impacts to human health or the environment related to dredging would not be adverse and would be less
than significant.
NEPA Determination. The public or the environment could be adversely impacted as a result of
demolition, transport, and disposal of structures containing hazardous materials during construction
activities. Implementation of Mitigation Measure HAZ-1, Prepare a Hazardous Material Management
Plan, would reduce this impact; therefore, impacts would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. The impact on the public or the environment as a result of demolition, transport,
and disposal of structures containing hazardous materials during construction activities is considered
potentially significant. Implementation of Mitigation Measure HAZ-1, Prepare a Hazardous Material
Management Plan, would reduce this impact to a less-than-significant level.
Cumulative Impacts
Impact 3.12-7: Potential to Result in Cumulative Impacts from Hazards and Hazardous
Materials
The geographic area of cumulative impacts to potential hazardous materials is central San Francisco Bay
and the northeastern waterfront area. The proposed project’s construction activities have the potential to
expose the public, construction workers, and/or the environment to hazardous materials. Project
construction activities would require the use, transport, and disposal of a hazardous materials (such as
diesel fuel and lubricants for construction equipment) and wastes (such as dredging spoils and demolition
waste). The reasonably foreseeable projects in the vicinity of the site that are listed in Table 3-1 may also
result in similar releases or risks. However, the implementation of standard construction practices, and
compliance with necessary regulatory requirements (e.g., dredging permits, building permits, California
Highway Patrol requirements) would reduce the risk for exposure and, if a hazardous materials release
occurred during construction, would ensure that the issue would be abated and would not combine to
create a cumulative construction impact. Therefore, there would be no cumulative adverse impacts from
construction activities.
Operation of the proposed project would require the routine use and transport of some hazardous
materials. Although the quantity and frequency would be minor, the use of diesel fuel for the emergency
generator and the disposal of dredge spoils from maintenance dredging have the potential to expose the
public and/or the environment to hazardous materials. The reasonably foreseeable projects in the vicinity
of the site that are listed in Table 3-1 may also require the ongoing use and transport of hazardous
materials that could pose a risk to the public. Each project would be subject to CEQA, and would be
required to consider best management practices and mitigation measures that would reduce potential
impacts to a less-than-significant level, such as those that would apply to the proposed project. In
addition, each project would be subject to the requirements of dredging permits, building permits, and
California Highway Patrol requirements. In addition, each project would be subject to the CCSF’s
hazardous materials handling requirements, specified in Article 21 of the San Francisco Health Code,
which requires the preparation of a Hazardous Materials Plan. These regulatory requirements would

reduce the risk that the public or the environment would be exposed to hazardous materials or wastes
from ongoing project operations. Therefore, no cumulative adverse impacts from hazards and hazardous
materials would be anticipated.
NEPA Determination. The project would not contribute to cumulative adverse hazards or hazardous
materials impacts.
CEQA Determination. The project would not contribute to cumulative adverse hazards or hazardous
materials impacts, and would therefore be less than significant.
3.12.4 Mitigation Measures
Mitigation Measure HAZ-1: Prepare a Hazardous Materials Management Plan
WETA will prepare an HMMP for review and approval by the Port prior to moving equipment to the
project site for construction and demolition activities. The requirements of the HMMP for the project will
govern the onsite management of hazardous materials, including spill prevention;, and the offsite disposal
of hazardous wastes. The HMMP, at a minimum, will include the following requirements:


Hazardous Materials Storage and Disposal. The construction contractor will be responsible for the
proper storage and disposal of any hazardous materials or wastes in accordance with all federal, state,
and local laws and regulations. This may involve obtaining permits from the local regulatory agency
for the storage of hazardous materials, and obtaining a Waste Generators Identification Number from
the state for disposal of any hazardous wastes generated at the site. The HMMP shall include
requirements for appropriate material storage; spill control, containment, and cleanup; vehicle and
construction equipment inspections; emergency preparedness; and worker training.



Lead and Asbestos Management. Prior to any demolition activities, a lead-based paint and asbestos
survey of the structures shall be conducted. Based on the results of the survey, it will be determined
if any lead-based paint or asbestos is present that requires abatement prior to demolition of the
structures. Results of this survey shall be included in the HMMP. Any abatement required shall be
completed in accordance with all federal, state, and local regulatory requirements by properly
licensed abatement contractors, before demolition of the structures.



Wood Waste Management. Procedures for implementation of DTSC’s Alternative Management
Standards for Treated Wood Waste will be included in the HMMP, including employee training in
waste management, segregation of the wood waste from other wastes, appropriate storage and
labeling, and transportation to an authorized treated wood waste facility.



Universal Waste Management. A survey of common items that are regulated as “universal wastes”
by the State of California (e.g., fluorescent lighting tubes and ballasts, and mercury thermometers)
shall also be conducted. Provisions for abatement and removal of these materials prior to demolition
in accordance with Cal/OSHA regulations shall be addressed in the HMMP.



Reporting. The findings of the hazardous materials abatement activities shall be documented by a
qualified environmental professional, and submitted to the Port and the SFDPH prior to the issuance
of construction and demolition permits.

GEOLOGY, SOILS, AND SEISMICITY

3.13.1 Introduction to the Analysis
This analysis evaluates the proposed project’s potential effects related to geology, soils, and seismicity.
Potential seismic impacts are assessed with respect to exposure of people or structures to geologic
hazards, including fault rupture, seismic shaking, liquefaction, and other earthquake-related ground
failures, and earthquake-induced landslides. In addition, the impact analysis assesses potential impacts
related to unstable geologic units, as well as soil erosion and loss of topsoil. Overall, compliance with the
Port of San Francisco (Port) building requirements and California Building Code (CBC), as well as with
project-specific plans prepared for the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project
(project), would ensure that all impacts related to geology and soils would not be adverse, as discussed
below.
3.13.2 Affected Environment
This section addresses the geologic environment and the potential geologic and seismic hazard impacts
related to the proposed project. It includes the baseline geologic, geomorphic, and seismic conditions for
the Bay Area. Potential geologic and seismic hazards are also discussed, because they might pertain to
implementation of the proposed project.
Geological Setting
Study Area
The study area for geology and seismic hazards for the proposed project is the geologic and tectonic
setting of the Bay Area. The study area is a broad geographic area, because of the potential for regional
geologic features to affect the proposed project. From the edge of the continental shelf near the Farallon
Islands, it extends inland to the western margin of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley; and from the
southern end of the Santa Clara Valley, it extends northward to the northern end of the Sonoma Valley.
This region incorporates all the major tectonic elements that define the structure and geologic
characteristics of or affecting the Bay Area.
The project area is defined as the area between Pier 1 on the north and Pier 14 on the south, including the
San Francisco Ferry Building (Ferry Building), the Agriculture Building, and existing water transit gates.
The landward limit of the project area approximately corresponds to the eastern edge of The
Embarcadero.
Regional Geological Setting
The Bay Area has a structurally controlled topography that consists primarily of north- to northwesttrending mountain ranges and intervening valleys that are characteristic of the Coast Ranges geomorphic
province. This fabric is subparallel to the San Andreas Fault. The Coast Ranges consist of the
Mendocino Range to the north of San Francisco Bay, the Santa Cruz Mountains west and south of San
Francisco Bay, and the Diablo Range to the east of San Francisco Bay. The Coast Ranges are composed
of a thick sequence of late Mesozoic (200 to 70 million years old) and Cenozoic (less than 70 million
years old) sedimentary strata. The northern part of the Coast Range is dominated by the landslide-prone
Franciscan assemblage.
San Francisco Bay is a topographic trough formed by a combination of warping and faulting, and is
underlain by a down-dropped or tilted block (the Bay Block) (Olson and Zoback, 1998). This trough in
the Coast Ranges allows the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers to drain to the ocean. San Francisco
Bay is about 55 miles long, and from 3 to 5 miles wide. Constrictions divide San Francisco Bay into

Consequences, and Mitigation

Suisun, San Pablo, and the North and South San Francisco bays. San Francisco Bay is relatively shallow,
with depths of less than about 10 feet, except in locations of drowned drainage channels. The deepest
point is in the main channel through the Golden Gate, at a depth of approximately 350 feet below sea
level.
The geology of the Bay Area is made up primarily of three different geologic provinces: the Salinian
block, the Franciscan complex, and the Great Valley sequence. The Salinian block is west of the San
Andreas Fault. It is composed primarily of granitic plutonic rocks, which are similar to those found in the
Sierra Nevada, and are believed to be rocks of the Sierra Nevada Batholith that have been displaced along
the San Andreas Fault. To the east of the San Andreas Fault, and bounded on the east by the Hayward
Fault, is the Mesozoic Franciscan complex. The Franciscan rocks represent pieces of former oceanic
crust that have accreted to North America by subduction and collision. These rocks are primarily deep
marine sandstone and shale. However, chert and limestone are also found within the assemblage. Some
of the rocks of the Franciscan complex (dominantly sheared shale of the mélange unit) are prone to
landslides. To the east of the Hayward Fault is the Great Valley sequence. This is composed primarily of
Cretaceous and Tertiary marine sedimentary rocks in the Bay Area. Some of these rocks (dominantly
claystones) are also prone to landsliding. Figure 3.13-1 illustrates regional geology.
Recent Geologic History
San Francisco Bay is California’s largest estuarine environment, and its configuration—and the
surrounding landscape—has been shaped by a combination of tectonic activity, recent sea level changes,
and human activities since 1850. Since the formation of the Sacramento-San Joaquin drainage outlet
through San Francisco Bay, approximately 400,000 years ago, the deposition has fluctuated between
estuarine (periods of high sea level) and alluvial (periods of low sea level) (Sloan, 1992).
The present San Francisco Bay estuary formed less than 10,000 years ago as the global climate warmed
and sea levels rose. Marine water re-entered San Francisco Bay approximately 10,000 years ago, and by
about 4,000 years ago had reached its present level. With the establishment of estuarine conditions,
sedimentation in San Francisco Bay changed from alluvial sands and silts to dark-colored estuarine clays
and silts, commonly called Bay Mud. Deposition of sandier sediment was confined to channels.
Since approximately 1850, human activities have made significant modifications to San Francisco Bay,
causing changes in the patterns of circulation and sedimentation. Between 1856 and 1900, hydraulic
mining in the Sierra foothills deposited several feet of sediment throughout San Francisco Bay. Starting
in the 1800s, the construction of levees and dikes altered the patterns of drainage and annual flooding in
the Sacramento River Delta. Also, the placement of fill at numerous localities around the San Francisco
Bay margins has dramatically altered the shoreline profile during historic time (WETA, 2003a).
Site Geology and Soils
The project area has been developed over the years by artificial filling of the waterfront and the
construction of various seawalls to enable construction of piers, buildings, and roadways. Numerous
geotechnical borings have been drilled and sampled to evaluate subsurface conditions at the locations of
the Ferry Building, the San Francisco Municipal Railway Metro Turnaround, piers, and potential
commercial buildings. The landward portion of the project area aligns with the seawall. The offshore
portion of the site is underlain by relatively soft recent deposits (Younger Bay Mud) on the order of
100 feet thick, overlying a thin accumulation of Bay sediments and Old Bay Clay at an approximate
thickness of 60 feet. Bedrock of the Franciscan Assemblage is at a depth of approximately 250 feet
below the mudline (the bottom of San Francisco Bay).

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Seismicity
The study area lies within the right-lateral San Andreas Fault system, which accommodates the majority
of the plate motion between the Pacific and North American plates. Compressional tectonics reflected in
the Coast Ranges also result in folds and thrusts sub-parallel to the San Andreas Fault system, and local
bends in the fault may also produce secondary zones of deformation. Faults of the San Andreas system
form the major structural features in the study area.
Significant Faults
Active faults in the study area are shown on Figure 3.13-2 as named structures; other faults are also
shown without names. The project area is approximately equidistant (about 9.5 miles) from the San
Andreas and Hayward Faults, to the southwest and northeast, respectively. The San Andreas Fault is
approximately 9.5 miles to the southwest of the site. Both the San Andreas and Hayward Faults have
generated major historical earthquakes, and are considered to have a moderate to high probability of
producing another major earthquake within the next 30 years.
The most significant Quaternary faults in the vicinity of the study area are shown on Figure 3.13-2.
Maximum earthquake magnitude estimates provided are based on those reported by the Working Group
on California Earthquake Probabilities (WGCEP) (WGCEP, 1999). Fault data were obtained from
Bortugno et al. (Bortugno et al., 1991), and the WGCEP (WGCEP, 1999). The following paragraphs
briefly describe each of the major faults, from west to east (Figure 13.3-2).
San Gregorio Fault
The San Gregorio Fault is a major Holocene active fault that lies west of the San Andreas Fault. The fault
is approximately 78 miles long, extending from the Big Sur area northward to the area offshore of Bolinas
Bay. Most of the fault lies offshore; however, in several areas the fault lies onshore and has been actively
investigated (Simpson et al., 1992). The fault has an estimated Quaternary slip rate of 0.2 inch/year.
Estimates of earthquake recurrence intervals on the fault range from 350 to 680 years, based on offset
archeological remains at Seal Cove (Simpson et al., 1992). The San Gregorio Fault is approximately
35 miles from the project area, and the maximum earthquake magnitude for the fault is estimated to be
approximately Moment Magnitude (MW) 1 7.3.
San Andreas Fault
The San Andreas Fault is the largest active fault in California, and extends from the Gulf of California on
the south approximately 750 miles to Cape Mendocino on the north. It was the source of the 1906
MW 7.9 San Francisco earthquake (Wallace, 1990), which ruptured approximately 280 miles of the fault
from San Juan Batista to Shelter Cove. The fault is about 9.5 miles southwest of the project area at its
closest approach.
The San Andreas Fault can be divided into a number of segments, based on differences in
geomorphology, geometry, paleoseismic chronology, seismicity, and historic displacements. In the Bay
Area, these segments include the southern Santa Cruz Mountains, possible source of the 1989 MW 7.0
Loma Prieta earthquake; the Peninsula segment; and the North Coast segment. These segments have been
assigned maximum earthquakes of MW 7, MW 7.1, and MW 7.9, respectively, by the WGCEP (WGCEP,
1999).

MW is a measure of the amount of energy released by the earthquake.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Hayward Fault
The Hayward Fault is about 62 miles long and has been divided into two fault segments: a longer
southern segment, and a shorter northern segment. The fault demonstrates systematic right-lateral creep
along its entire length (Lienkaemper et al., 1991). This structure is considered to be the most likely
source of the next major earthquake in the Bay Area (WGCEP, 1999), and is approximately 9.5 miles
northeast of the project area. The Local Magnitude (ML) 2 6.8 event in October 1868 was the last major
earthquake on the Hayward Fault, and occurred along the southern segment near Fremont. The WGCEP
has assigned maximum earthquakes of MW 6.9 for both the northern and southern segments of the
Hayward Fault (WGCEP, 1999).
Rodgers Creek Fault
The Rodgers Creek Fault is a 38-mile-long northwest-striking, right-lateral strike-slip fault that extends
northward from the projection of the Hayward Fault on the southern side of San Pablo Bay.
The Rodgers Creek Fault has a long-term geological slip rate similar to the Hayward Fault, and produced
a large-magnitude historical earthquake in the late 1800s. Investigations by Schwartz, et al., identified
evidence for three earthquakes in the last 925 to 1,000 years, yielding an earthquake recurrence interval of
230 years for an earthquake of MW 7.0 (Schwartz et al., 1992). The fault is about 25 miles to the north of
the project area at its closest approach.
Concord-Green Valley Fault Zone
The Concord-Green Valley Fault is a northwest-striking, right-lateral strike-slip fault zone that extends
from the Walnut Creek area across Suisun Bay and continues to the north. The Concord Fault extends for
approximately 12 miles, from the northern slopes of Mount Diablo to Suisun Bay; and the Green Valley
Fault continues to the north for about 28 miles. The Concord Fault is an actively creeping structure that
has a long-term creep rate of approximately 0.2 inch/year. It is estimated that rupture of both faults would
produce a maximum earthquake of about MW 6.9, with a recurrence interval of approximately 180 years
(WGCEP, 1999). At its closest point, the Concord Fault is approximately 22 miles from the site.
Fault Rupture
Other active faults—the West Napa, Foothill, Greenville, and Calaveras—are shown on Figure 3.13-2,
but are sufficiently far from the project area that they are not discussed in this text. The closest faults to
the project area zoned under the Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act are the San Andreas Fault and
the Hayward Fault, approximately 9.5 miles from the project area. The Act requires the California
Geological Survey to designate faults considered active or potentially active, and to establish zones within
which studies are required for structures involving human occupancy. Based on the absence of zoned
faults, the hazard from ground rupture is considered very low to negligible.
Seismic Shaking
Seismically induced strong ground shaking is potentially a significant geologic hazard expected in the
project area. Both the San Andreas and Hayward faults have generated major historical earthquakes and
are considered to have a moderate probability of producing another major earthquake within the next
30 years. The project area has experienced strong ground motions in the past, and will do so in the future.
The highest peak acceleration is expected to occur from a MW 7.9 maximum credible earthquake event on
the San Andreas Fault at a distance of approximately 9.5 miles from the project area. Strong ground
shaking could either be amplified or dampened, depending on the engineering properties of the soils.
2

ML is based on the measurement of the earthquake from a distance of 100 kilometers from the epicenter.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Liquefaction and Lateral Spreading
Liquefaction of soils occurs when loose, cohesionless soils become saturated, temporarily losing shear
strength during strong ground shaking. Significant factors that affect soil liquefaction potential are grainsize distribution, relative density, degree of saturation, the initial stresses acting on the soils, and the
characteristics of the earthquake (such as the intensity and duration of the ground shaking). The project
area is potentially prone to liquefaction (State of California, 2003).
In addition to liquefaction, other potential hazards in the project area include compaction consolidation
(settlement) and seismically induced settlement. Dissipation of excess pore pressure generated by ground
shaking could produce volume changes within the liquefied soil layers, which would be manifested at the
ground surface as settlement.
Subsidence
Subsidence of the land surface can occur from tectonic deformation, consolidation, hydrocompaction,
collapse of underground cavities, oxidation of organic-rich soils, rapid sedimentation, and activities of
man, such as the withdrawal of groundwater. Around the margins of San Francisco Bay, settlement
commonly occurs in areas of manmade fill underlain by Young Bay Mud through consolidation of the
Bay Mud, and consequent subsidence of the overlying materials. Areas that are underlain by bedrock and
dense fill have a low susceptibility to subsidence. Areas underlain by Bay Mud, estuarine sediments,
organic rubbish, or thick organic deposits, such as the project area, may be moderately to highly
susceptible to subsidence. Settlement is discussed in Liquefaction and Lateral Spreading, above.
Expansive Soils
No expansive soil underlies the project area. Therefore, the hazard from expansive soil is considered low.
Geologic Resources
The following sections discuss geologic resources in the vicinity of the study area.
Sand and Gravel Aggregate Resources
In 1987, the California Division of Mines and Geology published a comprehensive mineral land
classification for aggregate materials in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area (Stinson et al., 1987).
Lands were classified in the following categories:


MRZ-1: Areas where adequate information indicates that no significant mineral deposits are present,
or where it is judged that little likelihood exists for their presence.



MRZ-2: Areas where adequate information indicates that significant mineral deposits are present, or
where it is judged that a high likelihood for their presence exists.



MRZ-3: Areas containing mineral deposits the significance of which cannot be evaluated from
available data.

According to these definitions, the project area is classified as MRZ-1.
Oil and Gas Resources
No oil and gas reserves have been identified or are under production in the study area.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Regulatory Setting
Regulatory requirements potentially applicable to geology and geologic hazards are summarized below.
Federal
There are no applicable federal regulations.
State
2001 California Building Code
The CBC contains the minimum standards for design and construction in California. Local standards
other than the CBC may be adopted if those standards are stricter. The CBC involves the standards
associated with seismic engineering detailed in the Uniform Building Code of 1997.
California Public Resources Code Section 25523(a); 20 California Code of Regulations 1752(b) and
(c); 1972 Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (amended 1994)
The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act was passed in 1972 to mitigate the hazard of surface
faulting to structures for human occupancy. Because of the project area’s location outside of mapped
Alquist-Priolo zones, further study would not be required.
California Public Resources Code Chapter 7.8, 1990 Seismic Hazards Mapping Act
The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990 allows the lead agency to withhold permits until geologic
investigations are conducted, and mitigation measures are incorporated into plans. The Seismic Hazards
Mapping Act addresses not only seismically induced hazards, but also expansive soils, settlement, and
slope stability.
Port of San Francisco
The Port Planning and Development Division has regulatory review responsibilities to ensure that new
construction, alterations, and public improvements comply with applicable use, design review,
environmental, and other government regulations. The Port requires compliance with their building code,
and is the permitting agency for construction and demolition on Port property.
3.13.3 Impact Evaluation
This section includes an analysis and determination of the potential adverse impacts of the proposed
project on people or structures due the geological features of the project area.
The analysis considers whether the proposed project would:


Expose people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects, including risk of loss, injury, or
death, involving rupture of known earthquake fault; strong seismic ground shaking; seismic-related
ground failure, including liquefaction; or landslides;



Result in substantial soil erosion or the loss of topsoil;



Be located on a geological unit or soil that is unstable, or that would become unstable as a result of
the project, and potentially result in onsite or offsite landslide, lateral spreading, subsidence,
liquefaction, or collapse;



3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Be located on expansive soil, as defined in Table 18-1-B of the Uniform Building Code (UBC, 1997),
creating substantial risks to life or property.

Extensive existing information and studies are available for the project area, including site-specific data.
These resources were used to identify the existing geologic and seismic setting for the project area, and to
determine the susceptibility of the area to geologic hazards such as liquefaction.
The project area is not in an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone, and no active or potentially active
faults exist within or in the immediate vicinity of the project area. No impact is expected. The proposed
project area is over water; therefore, soil erosion or the loss of topsoil due to proposed structures would
not occur. No significant mineral resources are within the project area; therefore, there would be no
impact to mineral resources from implementation of the proposed project. Because there is no potential
for project impacts related to faults; soil erosion and topsoil loss; or mineral resources, these areas are not
discussed in detail in this section.
Impacts from tsunami and seiche are discussed in Section 3.11, Hydrology and Water Quality.
Direct Impacts
Impact 3.13-1: Increased Risks to People and Structures During a Seismic Event, Fault
Rupture, or Seismic Shaking
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no modifications would be made to the existing Downtown San
Francisco Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal) facilities to accommodate new or existing Water Emergency
Transportation Authority (WETA) services. The Port is responsible for the maintenance and safety of the
terminal facilities. The majority of the areas around the Ferry Building were not constructed to Essential
Facility Standards; consequently, a seismic event could have the potential to result in risk to people and
structures. Therefore, the No Action Alternative may result in adverse impacts with regard to increased
risk to people or structures.
Action Alternative
The project area has been developed by artificial filling on the waterfront, and construction of various
seawalls to enable construction of piers, buildings, and roadways. The project area is underlain by
relatively soft recent deposits (Younger Bay Mud) on the order of 100 feet thick. Placement of new
structures in the soft Bay Mud could possibly increase the impact of seismic shaking, liquefaction, and
subsidence to people or structures in the project area. However, all of the proposed project structures
would be pile-supported, with the piles driven through the mud layer to the sand layer beneath.
Therefore, no adverse impact would be expected. Seismically induced strong ground shaking is
potentially a significant geologic hazard in the project area. Strong ground shaking could either be
amplified or dampened, depending on the engineering properties of the soils. Both the San Andreas and
Hayward faults have generated major historical earthquakes, and are considered to have a moderate
probability of producing another major earthquake within the next 30 years. The engineering properties
of the soils affect the amplification or dampening of ground shaking during a seismic event. The risk to
people and buildings would be reduced through the proposed project’s compliance with applicable
building codes and earthquake standards.
Soil liquefaction is affected by grain-size distribution, relative density, degree of saturation, the initial
stresses acting on the soils, and the characteristics of the earthquake (e.g., the intensity and duration of
ground shaking). The project area could be impacted due to liquefaction. However, the project would

Consequences, and Mitigation

follow all applicable regulatory standards, and therefore would not result in increased risk of liquefaction
and lateral spreading.
As a part of final design and construction, a site-specific geotechnical investigation would be performed
to inform the design and engineering required to comply with applicable building code standards. A
geotechnical investigation would entail the drilling of soil borings to characterize soil properties, and to
provide engineers with information necessary to determine construction measures that would minimize
risk to structures and people due to seismic shaking, subsidence, and liquefaction. Therefore, no adverse
impact would be expected.
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Determination: The project would not have adverse
impacts related to damage to structures and humans from seismic shaking, liquefaction, and subsidence.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Determination: The potential for damage to
structures and humans from seismic shaking, liquefaction, and subsidence would be less than significant.
Impact 3.13-2: Potential Impacts to Sediment or Geology from Maintenance Dredging
No Action Alternative
Regular maintenance dredging is not currently required to maintain operations at existing Gates B and E.
Because patterns of sediment accumulation in the Ferry Terminal area would be expected to be similar to
historically observed patterns, regular maintenance dredging would not be anticipated for the No Action
Alternative. Therefore, there would be no impact.
Action Alternative
For the Action Alternative, some dredging would likely be required on a regular maintenance cycle
beneath the floats at the new Gates F and G, due to their proximity to the Pier 14 breakwater. It is
expected that this minor maintenance dredging would be required at Gates F and G every 3 to 4 years, and
would require removal of approximately 5,000 to 10,000 cubic yards (cy) of material. However, this
amount of material removal would be negligible in the context of San Francisco Bay. In addition, as
discussed in Section 3.11, Hydrology and Water Quality, the project would comply with the guidance and
requirements of the Dredge Materials Management Office (DMMO), which would encourage beneficial
reuse of dredged materials.
In 1994, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated the “Deep Ocean Disposal Site,” which is
50 miles outside of the Golden Gate. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency manages the site, and
has set a yearly capacity of 4.8 million cy of dredged material (BCDC, 2008). There are also four
disposal sites in the San Francisco Bay Estuary, including the Suisun Bay Channel, Alcatraz Island, San
Pablo Bay, and Carquinez Strait. The volume of dredged material that would require disposal would be
negligible compared to the total yearly capacity of these disposal sites (i.e., 10,000 cy, compared to more
than 7 million cy, or approximately 0.1 percent).
NEPA Determination. The project would not have adverse impacts on geology and soils as a result of
maintenance dredging.
CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to impact to geology and soils as a result of maintenance
dredging would be less than significant.
Indirect Impacts
No project-related indirect impacts due to geology, soils, or seismicity have been identified.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Construction Impacts
The No Action Alternative would not result in any physical changes to the Ferry Terminal, and no
construction activities would be required. Therefore, there would be no construction impacts to geology,
soils, or seismicity.
Impact 3.13-3: Potential Impacts to Sediment or Geology from Construction Activities
The project improvements would be constructed on piles over San Francisco Bay, and would generally
not affect sediment or geology. Project construction would require dredging and removal of up to
33,000 cy of material for the new Gates A, F, and G. However, this amount of material removal would be
negligible in the context of San Francisco Bay. In addition—as discussed under Impact 3.13-2 and in
Section 3.11, Hydrology and Water Quality—the project would comply with the guidance and
requirements of the DMMO, which would encourage beneficial reuse of dredged materials.
Project construction would also require pile driving. Vibration from pile driving is analyzed in detail in
Section 3.7, Noise and Vibration. Vibration would be very unlikely to affect settlement of the existing
buildings in the project area (e.g., the Ferry Building and the Agriculture Building), or the slope or
stability of the Bay Mud at the project site. The piles that support the existing buildings are designed to
withstand extreme loads, such as those generated by storms and/or seismic events, and therefore would
not be affected by temporary vibration occurring at some distance (more than 20 feet away).
Due to the regular matrix of piles under the existing building, the construction is also very unlikely to
cause any movement of sediment under buildings. Large storms and tides regularly resuspend large
sediment loads in San Francisco Bay. After large storms, suspended sediment tends to be deposited in
relatively quiescent areas—for example, under pile-supported structures—leading to a build-up of
sediment. Therefore, project construction would not adversely affect sediments, sediment stability, or
geology in the project area.
NEPA Determination: The project’s construction impacts on geology and sediments would not be
adverse.
CEQA Determination: The project’s construction impacts on geology and sediments would be less than
significant.
Cumulative Impacts
Impact 3.13-4: Potential to Result in Cumulative Impacts to Geology, Soils, and
Seismicity
The proposed project would improve the seismic safety of the facilities in the project area, and therefore
would not contribute to cumulative impacts related to risks to people and structures during a seismic
event. It would be expected that the development of the proposed project and other reasonably
foreseeable projects would improve seismic preparedness along the waterfront, and no cumulative seismic
impacts would be expected. The proposed project has the potential to affect sediments and geology from
dredging (both during construction and maintenance dredging), and also from construction activities
requiring pile driving. Other reasonably foreseeable projects listed in Table 3.1-1, such as the Port
Maintenance Dredging Program, the Golden Gate Transit Ferry Terminal Improvements, and the
Agriculture Building Rehabilitation and Seismic Upgrade, could also require dredging or installation,
repair, or replacement of piles in the immediate vicinity of the proposed project. The cumulative effect of
dredging activities in San Francisco Bay could impact sediment volume, and transport in San Francisco
Bay. However, dredging activities for the project would be small and infrequent (33,000 cy of material
during construction, and 5,000 to 10,000 cy of material every 3 or 4 years) in comparison to the ongoing

maintenance dredging programs in San Francisco Bay. In 2010, approximately 2,000,000 cy of material
was dredged for maintenance dredging projects in San Francisco Bay (DMMO, 2011). In addition, the
project would comply with the guidelines of the DMMO, which encourages beneficial reuse of dredged
material. Therefore, there would be no adverse cumulative impacts to geology and sediments from
dredging activities.
The project’s potential effects on sediments and geology from construction activities such as pile driving
would be minimal, localized, and unlikely to affect settlement of the existing buildings in the project area
(e.g., the Ferry Building and the Agriculture Building), or the slope or stability of the Bay Mud at the
project site. The Golden Gate Transit Ferry Terminal Improvements and the Agriculture Building
Rehabilitation and Seismic Upgrade may also require pile driving, but it is not expected that construction
activities for these projects would overlap. For the same reasons described for the proposed project, these
projects would also be unlikely to affect settlement of stability of the geology, sediments and piles in the
project area. Therefore, there would be no adverse cumulative impacts to geology and sediments from
these activities.
NEPA Determination. The project would not contribute to cumulative impacts on geology, soils, and
seismicity.
CEQA Determination. The project would not contribute to cumulative impacts on geology, soils, and
seismicity, and would be less than significant.
3.13.4 Mitigation Measures
Mitigation measures would not be required for geological, soil, or seismic impacts.

ENERGY CONSUMPTION

3.14.1 Introduction to the Analysis
This section discusses the potential impacts on energy consumption of the Downtown San Francisco
Ferry Terminal Expansion Project (proposed project) alternatives. For the purposes of this section,
energy resources are described in terms of electricity and fuel. The analysis focused on the project’s
potential to increase demand on existing resources and the potential to result in a wasteful, inefficient, or
unnecessary consumption of energy. The analysis has determined that no adverse impacts to energy
consumption would occur as a result of the No Action and proposed project.
3.14.2 Affected Environment
This section provides an overview of existing energy service providers and energy consumption in the
project area.
Existing Setting
Electric
The City and County of San Francisco (CCSF) receives most of its electricity from Pacific Gas and
Electric (PG&E), which also provides natural gas and electricity to most of Northern California.
However, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) provides electric power, generated by
its hydroelectric facilities in the eastern part of California, to municipal facilities that include CCSF
buildings, San Francisco Airport, and the Muni system. Power is also provided by SFPUC to the Port of
San Francisco (Port) for its facilities along the waterfront. SFPUC power supplies approximately
17 percent of electric use in San Francisco (SFPUC, 2011a). The remaining 83 percent comes from
PG&E and various energy service providers for nonmunicipal users (SFPUC, 2011a). Electricity is
supplied to the project area by SFPUC, but the electricity is distributed within San Francisco on
transmission lines owned and operated by PG&E.
The PG&E transmission lines are underground in the vicinity of the project area, accessed by a manholes
and subsurface vaults. The nearest vaults are on the eastern side of The Embarcadero, in the street in
front of the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal). No overhead transmission lines
exist in the project area.
Total electricity use in San Francisco is currently approximately 6,000 gigawatt hours (GWh) per year,
and is forecast to grow at a rate of 1.3 percent per year, reaching approximately 8,000 GWh per year by
2030 (SFPUC, 2011a). SFPUC currently generates approximately 1,600 GWh per year (SFPUC, 2011d).
Transportation Fuels
According to the State Alternative Fuels Plan (2007) prepared by the California Energy Commission
(CEC) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB), California’s transportation sector is more than
95 percent dependent on petroleum. More than 60 percent of the nation’s petroleum consumption comes
from foreign sources. California’s transportation sector uses roughly half of the energy consumed in the
state. In 2006, Californians consumed an estimated 20 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel on the
state’s roadways, an increase of nearly 50 percent over the last 20 years (CEC, 2007).
Gas
PG&E provides natural gas to the project area and its vicinity. PG&E manhole and subsurface vaults are
on the eastern side of The Embarcadero in the street, and in the area in front of the Ferry Terminal.

Consequences, and Mitigation

Regulatory Setting
Federal
The National Energy Conservation Policy Act identifies federal energy management goals and
requirements. Signed into law in 1978, it has been updated and amended by subsequent laws and
regulations, including the National Energy Policy Act of 2005, Executive Order 13423 (Strengthening
Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management), and Executive Order 13514 (Federal
Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance).
Energy consumption is addressed in the Council on Environmental Quality’s regulations for implementing
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Section 1502.16 (e) states that an EIS shall include
“energy requirements and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures.”
State
California Environmental Quality Act
At the state level, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (California Public Resources Code
Sections 21000-21178) and the CEQA Guidelines (14 California Code of Regulations) require that the
potential energy impacts of a proposed project be discussed and addressed, with particular emphasis on
avoiding or reducing inefficient, wasteful, and unnecessary consumption of energy.
California Greenhouse Gas Bill (Assembly Bill 32)
The Global Warming Solutions Act was signed into law in 2006, it was intended to reduce production of
greenhouse gases (GHGs) in California. Pursuant to Assembly Bill (AB) 32, CARB adopted a Scoping
Plan in December 2008, outlining measures to meet the 2020 GHG reduction limits set by AB 32. To
meet these goals, California must reduce its GHG emissions by 30 percent below projected 2020 business
as usual emissions levels, or about 15 percent from today’s levels (CARB, 2008).
State Alternative Fuels Plan (Assembly Bill 1007)
The State Alternative Fuels Plan was prepared by the CEC in partnership with the CARB to increase the
use of alternative fuels in California.
Local
San Francisco Electricity Resource Plan
The Electricity Resource Plan for San Francisco was prepared by SFPUC and adopted by the Board of
Supervisors in 2002. It is an action plan to meet the growth in demand for electricity by using reliable,
affordable, and sustainable sources of electricity.
San Francisco General Plan
The San Francisco General Plan Environmental Protection Element includes the following objectives and
policies related to energy consumption and efficiency:
Objective 12: Establish CCSF as a model for energy management.
Policy 14.1: Increase the energy efficiency of existing commercial and industrial buildings through costeffective energy management measures.
Policy 14.5: Encourage use of integrated energy systems.

Objective 16: Promote the use of renewable energy sources.
Policy 17.1: Support continuation of state and federal tax incentives and credits for conservation and
renewable energy technologies.
San Francisco Green Building Code
CCSF’s Green Building Code is Chapter 13C of the San Francisco Building Code. The purpose of the
Green Building Code is to promote the health, safety, and welfare of San Francisco residents, workers,
and visitors by minimizing the use and waste of energy, water, and other resources in the construction and
operation of the CCSF’s building stock, and by providing a healthy indoor environment.
3.14.3 Impact Evaluation
This analysis considered whether the project would:



Result in a wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary consumption of energy; or
Result in a significant demand on regional energy supply or requirement of substantial additional
capacity.

The following methods of analysis were used to determine the project’s effects on energy consumption
and energy resources.


The project description was reviewed to determine, quantitatively, the amount of energy that would
be required during operation of the new project components (additional lighting and energy required
for gate operation).



Energy-saving measures incorporated into the project design were also considered.



The analysis considered whether energy consumption would be significant in comparison with
current energy use and energy availability in the project area.



Measures to reduce energy use during operation were identified, if appropriate.



Energy use during project construction was described qualitatively, and measures to reduce energy
consumption during construction were identified, if appropriate.

The proposed project improvements would facilitate an increase in water transit services in San Francisco
Bay. The Program Environmental Impact Report for WETA’s Implementation and Operations Plan
(WETA, 2003a) analyzed the impacts associated with the increase in service. Water transit would
provide an alternative for daily commuters. This would reduce the number of daily vehicles on the road,
thereby reducing transportation fuel consumption. Water transit as an alternative form of commuting
would be consistent with the goals and objectives of the State Alternative Fuels Plan. The analysis below
assesses the impacts associated with the facility improvement at the Ferry Terminal.
Direct Impacts
Impact 3.14-1: Wasteful, Inefficient, or Unnecessary Consumption of Energy during
Project Operation
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no modifications would be made to the existing Ferry Terminal
facilities to accommodate new or existing Water Emergency Transportation Authority (WETA) services.

Water Emergency Transportation Authority
Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

An increase in fuel and electrical power consumption at the Ferry Terminal facilities would not occur.
Therefore, the No Action Alternative would have no effect or impact with regard to the wasteful,
inefficient, or unnecessary consumption of energy resources.
Action Alternative
The proposed project would require the installation of lighting for the gates and circulation areas. The
total energy requirements for the additional lighting would be approximately 142,000 kilowatt hours
(kWh) per year. To offset this demand, the proposed project could include photovoltaic cells in the
weather protection canopies along the Gate A Access Pier, Gate B queuing area, and perpendicular to
Gates E, F, and G. The energy generated from the photovoltaics would be expected to exceed the energy
demand for the project lighting. Approximately 200,000 kWh could be generated on site. With the use of
photovoltaic cells, the project would be a zero net energy project.
Should the final design not include the photovoltaic cells, the 142,000 kWh of energy would be provided
by the SFPUC, which currently provides electricity to the project area. The energy required for lighting
would be a small portion of the anticipated forecast for future energy consumption in San Francisco, and
the amount of energy produced by the SFPUC (0.002 percent and 0.01 percent, respectively).
Additionally, the project would be required to comply with CCSF’s Green Building Standards. Such
requirements include using fluorescent lighting fixtures with efficient lamps, or having exterior lights
controlled by a photocell or automatic timer to prevent lights from operating during daylight hours.
Additionally, outdoor lighting would be focused and directed, as possible, allowing for efficient lighting
and more efficient usage of electricity. Therefore, it is anticipated that energy consumption from the use
of lighting would not result in the wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary consumption of energy resources.
Emergency power would be required on site; it would be provided by a centrally located generator
serving the Port and WETA facilities. The exact size and location of the generator would be determined
in consultation with the Port at a later date. The generators would only be used during emergencies, and
would not result in a significant increase of fuel by the project.
Maintenance dredging would be infrequent as well as short in duration (on the order of a few weeks every
3 to 4 years), and therefore would not result in a significant increase of fuel use by the project.
NEPA Determination. The project would not result in adverse impacts due to wasteful, inefficient, or
unnecessary consumption of energy.
CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to result in wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary
consumption of energy would be less than significant.
Indirect Impacts
Impact 3.14-2: Significant Demand on Regional Energy Supply or Requirement of
Substantial Additional Capacity
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no modifications would be made to existing Ferry Terminal facilities to
accommodate new or existing WETA services. An increase in energy consumption would not occur.
Therefore, the No Action Alternative would have no impact on regional energy supply, and would not
require substantial additional capacity.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Action Alternative
The majority of energy consumed by the proposed project would be from nighttime lighting. The use of
photovoltaic cells at Gates A, B, E, F, and G would generate more electricity than the project would
require for lighting. The project also has energy-saving measures incorporated into its design, such as
maximizing energy efficiency in the lighting plan—which is consistent with City of San Francisco’s
Electricity Resource Plan and General Plan. The proposed project would be a zero net energy project,
should photovoltaic cells be included in the final design. Therefore, if photovoltaic cells are used, the
Action Alternative would not require any additional energy supply.
As discussed above, should photovoltaic cells not be included in the final design, the amount of energy
that would be required by the project would be a small portion of the anticipated future demand in San
Francisco. The SFPUC, which provides the electricity for the project area, has sufficient supply to serve
the project’s energy needs, and the project would not increase regional demand or require additional
electricity production.
NEPA Determination. The project would not have an adverse impact on regional energy supply, or
require substantial additional capacity.
CEQA Determination. The proposed project would have a less-than-significant impact on regional
energy supply, and would not require additional capacity.
Construction Impacts
The No Action Alternative would not result in any physical changes to the Ferry Terminal, and no
construction activities would be required. Therefore, there would not be any adverse construction-related
impacts on energy consumption.
Impact 3.14-3: Energy Consumption Increases Related to Project Construction
Under the proposed project, improvements to the North Basin could be constructed within 14 months,
while construction of the South Basin could be completed within 2 years. Construction would include
demolition; construction of piers and berthing structures; and circulation improvements. Because night
work is not anticipated, minimal lighting, if any, would be required. Onsite power could be provided by
the Port during construction. Generators for equipment operation could also be used; they would be
located on the construction barges, and on the landside structural improvements when completed.
Common construction practices used for similar projects would be implemented. The use of equipment
that would require significant amounts of fuel is not anticipated. All reasonable energy conservation
practices would be used to minimize the costs associated with energy use, consistent with state and local
requirements such as the San Francisco Green Building Ordinance. For example, measures that would be
taken would reduce both air quality and energy/fuel impacts. Such measures, as contained in Mitigation
Measure AQ-2, Implement Bay Area Air Quality Management District-recommended Best Management
Practices, would include reducing the maximum idling time of diesel equipment to 2 minutes.
Furthermore, under the San Francisco Green Building Ordinance, the proposed project is required to have
construction and demolition debris transported by registered transporters, and taken to registered facilities
that process and divert debris from landfills. Registered transporters that serve CCSF use trucks that run
on alternative fuels (Recology, 2012).
NEPA Determination. The increase in electricity and fuel consumption during construction would not
have adverse impacts to energy and fuel consumption.

Consequences, and Mitigation

CEQA Determination. The proposed project would result in a less-than-significant impact to energy
consumption during construction activities.
Cumulative Impacts
Impact 3.14-4. Potential to Result in Cumulative Impacts on Energy Consumption
The geographical context of the cumulative energy impacts analysis is the city and county of San
Francisco. The proposed project would require the use of fuel and energy for project construction. The
reasonably foreseeable projects listed in Table 3.1-1 would also involve construction activities that would
require the use of fuel, water, and energy during construction.
The proposed project, in combination with other projects within the area, could have the potential to result
in cumulative energy impacts related to the wasteful use of fuel for construction activities. However, the
projects would be required to comply with energy use consistent with federal, state, and local
requirements, such as the methods established by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. The
federal, state, and local requirements and policies encourage sustainable construction practices related to
energy efficiency and conservation; therefore, energy consumption would be expected to be reduced. For
example, compliant with these policies, the proposed project would reduce idling time during
construction, and implement other methods such as maintaining and properly tuning construction
equipment in accordance with manufacturer’s specifications, shutting equipment off when not in use, and
the use of alternative fuels in transport vehicles. The other reasonably foreseeable projects would be
expected to implement similar best management practices during construction. Therefore, there would be
no cumulative adverse impacts from wasteful use of energy resources during construction.
If it incorporates photovoltaic cells at onsite facilities, the project would not contribute to future energy
and fuel demand, and would not contribute to cumulative energy impacts. However, if photovoltaic cells
were not used, additional energy would be required for project operations. The reasonably foreseeable
projects listed in Table 3.1-1 would also result in an increase in energy demand in the study area that
could be cumulatively adverse. However, the proposed project’s energy consumption would be minor
when compared to the future energy demand in San Francisco (e.g., 0.002 percent). The proposed
project’s operational energy demand, which would be required to support nighttime lighting of the
facilities, would also be minor compared to some of the other reasonably foreseeable projects, such as the
development of new residential or mixed use buildings, and developments such as the Cruise Terminal
and Exploratorium. In addition, the proposed project would incorporate practices to further reduce energy
consumption, such as using fluorescent lighting fixtures with efficient lamps, or having exterior lights
directed or controlled by a photocell or automatic timer. Therefore, the proposed project’s contribution to
adverse cumulative energy impacts would not be considerable.
NEPA Determination. The project’s contribution to cumulative energy consumption impacts would not
be considerable.
CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to result in cumulative energy and fuel impacts during
construction and operation would be less than significant.
3.14.4 Mitigation Measures
Mitigation measures are not required for energy resources.

UTILITIES AND PUBLIC SERVICES

3.15.1 Introduction to the Analysis
This section discusses the potential impacts of the No Action Alternative and the proposed project on
utilities and public services. The analysis focused on the project’s potential to increase demand on
utilities (water, wastewater, telecommunications, and solid waste) and public services (law enforcement,
fire protection, and emergency service). The analysis has determined that the only potential adverse
effect to utilities or public service would be the potential physical disruption to underground utilities in
the project area from construction activities. This effect would be reduced through the implementation of
mitigation, described in this section. The proposed project would not increase demand on utilities or
public services. The proposed project would not induce a permanent increase in population that would
impact schools or parks.
3.15.2 Affected Environment
This section provides an overview of existing utilities and public services in the Downtown San Francisco
Ferry Terminal Expansion Project (project) area. The project area is shown on Figure 1-1. The utility
and public service providers that serve the project area are also discussed.
Utilities discussed in this section include water, wastewater (sanitary and storm sewers),
telecommunications, and solid waste. Public services discussed in this section include law enforcement,
fire protection, and emergency medical services. Natural gas and electricity are discussed in Section 3.14,
Energy Consumption.
The utilities in and/or serving the proposed project area are provided by the following service providers:





Domestic Water – San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC);
Wastewater and Storm Drainage – City of San Francisco;
Telecommunication – Landline: AT&T telephone services; Cell phone: multiple service providers);
and
Solid Waste (nonhazardous) – Recology.

Existing Setting – Utilities
Domestic Water
The SFPUC provides water services to approximately 2.5 million people in San Francisco, Santa Clara,
Alameda, and San Mateo counties. Eighty‐five percent of the water delivered to SFPUC customers
comes from Sierra Nevada snowmelt, stored in the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir on the Tuolumne River in
Yosemite National Park. The remaining water supply is generated from runoff in the Alameda and
Peninsula watersheds, captured in reservoirs located in San Mateo and Alameda counties. Deliveries
from the regional water system are limited to an average annual of 265 million gallons per day through
2018. The 2010 SFPUC Urban Water Management Plan assumed that the 265-million-gallon-per-day
supply limitation would extend to 2035 (SFPUC, 2011b).
Water to the eastern side of the city distribution system, where the project would be located, is fed by two
pipelines that terminate at University Mound Reservoir. Adjacent to the project area, water manholes
connecting to the CCSF’s water transmission system are located below the street in The Embarcadero,
and in the ground along the Embarcadero Promenade.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Sanitary Sewer and Storm Drainage
The City of San Francisco manages a combined stormwater and sanitary sewer system that serves
approximately 10 percent of the city, including the study area. This system includes large storage and
transport boxes that temporarily retain combined stormwater and sewage flows that exceed the capacity of
the wastewater treatment facilities. Along The Embarcadero in the vicinity of the project area,
stormwater is collected via drains at the side of the road. Adjacent to the project area along The
Embarcadero, there are approximately ten storm drains that flow to a storage and transport box below the
street.
Wastewater from the project area (e.g., inside the San Francisco Ferry Building [Ferry Building] and the
Agriculture Building) is collected and treated in the City’s wastewater treatment facilities. The closest
treatment facility is located approximately 2 miles from the project site, at the North Point Wet Weather
facility along The Embarcadero. The existing wastewater facilities treat approximately 40 billion gallons
per year of wastewater (SFPUC, 2010c). Stormwater runoff from most of the project area pier structures
(e.g., existing gates, the Ferry Plaza, and circulation areas) drains directly into San Francisco Bay
(ROMA, 2012).
Telecommunications
AT&T provides landline telecommunication services in the project area. Telecommunication wires are
below ground on The Embarcadero.
There are 21 cell phone towers in San Francisco registered with the Federal Communications
Commission. The closest tower (owned by Verizon Wireless) is approximately 1,500 feet west of the
project area, at 222 Front Street (City Data, 2011). Verizon Wireless is just one of the several carriers
providing communication services in the areas.
Solid Waste (Nonhazardous)
San Francisco diverts approximately 77 percent of its waste, the highest landfill-avoidance rate for any
large city in the United States (NYT, 2010).
Recology provides recycling, compost, and landfill collection at commercial and residential locations in
San Francisco, including the project area. Collection services are currently provided for the project area
and the existing businesses in the project area (e.g., restaurants and retail businesses in the Ferry
Building). Recology recycles the majority of material it hauls. Material is processed at the transfer
station at 501 Tunnel Avenue, or at the Pier 96 sorting facility. The remaining materials not diverted as
recycling or compost are sent to the Altamont Landfill in Alameda County (Recology, 2011). The
Altamont Landfill, as of October 2011, has a remaining capacity of approximately 46 million cubic yards
(74 percent of its permitted capacity) (CalRecycle, 2011). The landfill is projected to close in 2025
(CalRecycle, 2011). The Altamont Landfill would accept both project construction and operational
waste. Operational uses may include trash generated by existing commuters, such as cups, paper
products, and other miscellaneous objects.
See Section 3.12, Hazards and Hazardous Materials, for a discussion of the handling and disposal of
potentially hazardous waste.
Existing Setting – Public Services
As discussed further in Section 3.2, Transportation and Circulation, emergency vehicle access at the
project site is available along The Embarcadero curbside. There are two curb cuts and driveways south of
the Ferry Building that provide emergency vehicle access to the eastern side of the Ferry Building and the

facilities located on the Ferry Plaza (Gates C and D, the Carnelian by the Bay, and Bay Area Rapid
Transit [BART] facilities). The driveway just south of the Ferry Building also serves as a fire lane. Two
additional curb cuts and emergency vehicle access points are north of the Ferry Building.
BART has evacuation facilities on the Ferry Plaza; in the case of an emergency in the Transbay Tube,
passengers would be evacuated to the Ferry Plaza.
Law Enforcement Services
San Francisco Police Department
The San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) provides law enforcement services in the City and County
of San Francisco (CCSF). Patrol functions are performed by the police officers of the Field Operations
Bureau from ten district stations. The project is in the Southern District, supported by the Southern
Station at 850 Bryant Street near Seventh Street (approximately 2 miles away). Immediately to the north
and west is the Central District area, supported by the Central Station at 766 Vallejo Street near Powell
Street (approximately 1 mile away). The next closest station is in the Tenderloin District at 301 Eddy
Street (approximately 2 miles away).
The Port of San Francisco (Port) employs one police officer based at Pier 26. The officer responds to
complaints and actively patrols Port property from Aquatic Park to the north and Pier 90 to the south,
from 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM, Monday through Friday. SFPD provides backup to the Port’s officer and law
enforcement services after 4:00 PM and on weekends.
San Francisco Sheriff’s Department
The San Francisco Sheriff’s Department (SFSD) manages the six San Francisco County jails, makes
arrests on warrants, transports fugitives, and provides security to the civil and criminal courts and City
Hall. There are approximately 850 sworn and 100 civilian members. In addition, the SFSD augments
law enforcement at the request of the SFPD. The SFSD works with SFPD and the State Department of
Corrections when arresting state parolees, and works with SFPD during natural disasters and civic
emergencies.
Fire Protection Services
U.S. Coast Guard
Per the U.S. Coast Guard’s (USCG) Sector San Francisco Marine Firefighting Contingency Plan (USCG,
2008), the USCG’s Captain of the Port (COTP) for the San Francisco sector works with Port authorities
and local governments in their area of jurisdiction to maintain current and effective contingency plans.
The COTP is supported in the maintenance of these plans by the San Francisco law enforcement and
safety/emergency agencies to ensure coordination of federal, state, municipal, and commercial resources
that respond to fires and other incidents. For this reason, firefighting is considered a state and local
function.
However, the responsibilities of the COTP during a major fire aboard a vessel or waterfront facility
include:




Establishing and coordinating a Unified Command in accordance with the USCG Incident
Management Handbook;
Assuming Incident Commander for a burning vessel underway or at anchor when the fire department
with jurisdiction is either not on scene or unable to respond, or no fire department has jurisdiction;
Assuming operational control of all USCG forces on scene;

San Francisco Fire Department
The San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) provides fire protection and emergency medical services for
approximately 1.5 million people, including the residents, visitors, and workers of CCSF. This includes
property under the jurisdiction of the Port, including the project area.
The Port Fire Marshal is the SFFD’s liaison to the Port. The Fire Marshal conducts construction and
referral inspections, plan review, and pier surveys; and issues permits along the Port’s waterfront
jurisdiction.
The following SFFD stations would provide the first response for fire suppression, rescue, and emergency
medical service in the project area:





Station 1 at 676 Howard Street at Third Street (approximately 1 mile away);
Station 2 at 1340 Powell Street at Broadway (approximately 1 mile away);
Station 13 at 530 Sansome Street at Washington Street (less than 1 mile away); and
Station 35, Pier 22½ (less than 1 mile away).

Emergency Medical Services
The closest hospital is Saint Francis Memorial Hospital, at 900 Hyde Street (approximately 2 miles
away). Saint Francis Memorial Hospital treats more than 1,000,000 people every year. Saint Francis is a
fully accredited community-based hospital, with 359 licensed beds (SFMH, 2012).
Emergency medical transportation to San Francisco hospitals is provided by a fleet of public and private
ambulance services. SFFD also provides emergency medical services and transport in the project area.
Regulatory Setting
Federal

State
California Environmental Quality Act
At the state level, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (California Public Resources Code
Sections 21000-21178) and the CEQA Guidelines (14 California Code of Regulations 15000-15387) are
the primary policies that require projects to analyze potential impacts to utilities and public services.
California Fire Code
State fire regulations are set forth in Sections 13000, et seq., of the California Health and Safety Code,
which includes regulations concerning building standards (as set forth in Title 24 of the California Code
of Regulations, the California Building Code), fire protection and notification systems, fire protection
devices (such as fire extinguishers and smoke alarms), high‐rise building and child-care facility standards,
and fire suppression training. California Fire Code Section 403.2 addresses public safety for both indoor
and outdoor gatherings, including emergency vehicle ingress and egress, fire protection, emergency
medical services, public assembly areas and the directing of both attendees and vehicles (including the
parking of vehicles), vendor and food concession distribution, and the need for law enforcement and fire
and emergency medical services personnel at events.
California Integrated Waste Management Act (Assembly Bill 939)
The California Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 established the Integrated Waste Management
Board, required the implementation of integrated waste management plans, and mandated that, beginning
in 2000, local jurisdictions divert at least 50 percent of all solid waste, with 1990 as the baseline level, and
divert at least 75 percent of all solid waste by 2010.

width are exempt from drainage requirements without area limitations.
San Francisco Stormwater Management Ordinance (Ordinance Number 83-10). Ordinance
Number 83-10 requires the development and maintenance of stormwater management controls for
specified activities that disturb 5,000 square feet or more of the ground surface, and are subject to
building, planning, and subdivision approvals.
San Francisco Stormwater Design Guidelines. The SFPUC and the Port partnered to develop the San
Francisco Stormwater Design Guidelines. The guidelines require new developments and redevelopment
that disturb 5,000 square feet or more of the ground surface to manage stormwater on site. A Stormwater
Control Plan reviewed and stamped by a licensed landscape architect, architect, or engineer is required to
be submitted and approved by the Port and SFPUC (Port, 2003).
Solid Waste
San Francisco Construction and Demolition Debris Recovery Program (Ordinance Number 27-06).
CCSF adopted the ordinance to create a mandatory program to maximize the recycling of mixed
construction and demolition debris. The ordinance requires that mixed construction and demolition debris
be transported off site by a registered transporter, and taken to a registered facility that can process and
divert from landfill a minimum of 65 percent of the material generated from construction, demolition, or
remodeling projects.
Zero Waste to Landfill Resolution. The Board of Supervisors adopted a goal of 75 percent landfill
diversion by the year 2010, and a goal of zero waste by 2020, through Resolution Number 530-04 and
Resolution Number 002-03, respectively.
San Francisco Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance (Ordinance Number 100-09). As
stated above, the Board of Supervisors adopted the goal of zero waste by 2020. Therefore, in 2009, the
board passed the Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance, requiring everyone in San Francisco
to separate their refuse into recyclables, compostables, and landfill trash, and participate in recycling and
composting programs.
Port of San Francisco Lease Requirements. All Port leases include provisions requiring that Port
tenants comply with federal, state, and local regulations. When an illicit discharge is found, Port Real
Estate initiates enforcement of the lease provisions. Targeted discharges include sanitary waste,
hazardous materials, wash water, and construction-related materials.

Fire Protection
San Francisco Fire Code. The San Francisco Fire Code was revised in 2007 to regulate and govern the
safeguarding of life and property from fire and explosion hazards arising from the storage, handling, and
use of hazardous substances, materials, and devices, and from conditions hazardous to life or property in
the occupancy of buildings and premises; to provide for the issuance of permits, inspections, and other
SFFD services; and to provide for the assessment and collection of fees for those permits, inspections,
and services. The SFFD reviews building plans to ensure that fire and life safety is provided and
maintained in the buildings that fall under its jurisdiction. The SFFD building plan review applies to the
following occupancy types that are relevant to the proposed project:





Assembly occupancies (including restaurants and other gathering places for 50 or more occupants);
Storage occupancies where the potential exists for high‐piled storage, as defined by Fire Code;
Institutional occupancies; and
Fire alarm and fire suppression systems.

In coordination with the San Francisco Department of Building Inspection and the Port Building
Department, the SFFD conducts plan checks to ensure that all structures, occupancies, and systems
outlined above are designed in accordance with the San Francisco Building Code prior to the issuance of
a building permit.
Emergency Medical
San Francisco General Plan Policy 2.1: Ensure that new construction meets current structural and life
safety standards.
San Francisco General Plan Policy 3.1: Promote greater public awareness of disaster risks, personal
and business risk reduction, and personal and neighborhood emergency response.
3.15.3 Impact Evaluation
The analysis considered whether the project would:


Exceed wastewater treatment requirements of the Regional Water Quality Control Board;



Require or result in the construction of new water or wastewater treatment facilities or expansion of
existing facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts;



Require or result in the construction of new stormwater drainage facilities or expansion of existing
facilities, the construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts;



Require water from sources without sufficient supplies to serve the project from existing entitlements
and resources, or result in new or expanded entitlements;



Result in a determination by the wastewater treatment provider that serves or may serve the project
that it has inadequate capacity to serve the project’s projected demand, in addition to the provider’s
existing commitments;



Be served by a landfill with insufficient permitted capacity to accommodate the project’s solid waste
disposal needs;



3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Result in substantial adverse physical impacts or significant environmental impacts associated with
the construction of new or physically altered governmental facilities (police protection and fire
protection) required to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times, or other performance
objectives.

The following analysis assessed whether the implementation of the proposed project would directly or
indirectly impact existing utilities (domestic water, sanitary sewer, storm drainage, and
telecommunications) that serve the project area. Energy consumption is discussed separately in
Section 3.14, Energy Consumption. For each utility, the analysis considered whether the project would
have direct physical effects on the utility service, and whether the future demand on these services
resulting from the implementation of the project would result in the deterioration of existing service
levels.
In addition, the analysis in this section focused on whether the implementation of the proposed project
would impact public services (fire protection and police protection,) in the vicinity of the project. The
proposed project would not induce a permanent or temporary increase in population that would impact
schools or parks; therefore, there would be no impact, and these resources are not discussed in detail in
this section. A discussion of parklands and recreation is available in Section 3.4, Parklands and
Recreation.
Public services were analyzed to determine whether implementation of the proposed project would
require additional public services, or result in the deterioration of existing service levels. Public service
staffing and resources would also be evaluated against the size and complexity of the future public service
needs of the project. Both potential short-term construction impacts and long-term requirements of the
project for each public service were evaluated.
Direct Impacts
Impact 3.15-1: Require the Construction of New or Physically Altered Governmental
Facilities
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no modifications would be made to the existing Downtown San
Francisco Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal) facilities to accommodate new or existing Water Emergency
Transportation Authority (WETA) services. Therefore, the No Action Alternative would have no impact
to public services (fire and police protection, emergency medical, schools, parks, or other public
facilities), service ratios, response times, or performance objectives.
Action Alternative
The proposed project would not induce a permanent increase in population that would impact schools or
parks, and therefore there would be no impact to these resources. Refer to Section 3.4, Parklands and
Recreation, for a discussion of the project’s potential to affect recreational resources. The proposed
project would result in an increase in the number of people in the project area on a daily basis, and
includes the construction of new facilities, some of which would expand public space. The project has
the potential to increase the service burden on the public services (such as police and fire protection and
emergency medical services) that are responsible for the project area. A more detailed discussion is
provided below for the each of these services.
Law Enforcement Services. As discussed under fire services, the proposed project would increase
pedestrian traffic in the area, but would not induce a permanent increase in population. The project area
and immediate vicinity already experience a significant amount of pedestrian and public use. The area

Consequences, and Mitigation

through which passengers would pass on the way to destinations, such as the Harry Bridges Plaza and
Justin Herman Plaza, are designed for high pedestrian traffic. The incremental increase in users from the
proposed project would not be anticipated to substantially increase demand for law enforcement services.
Police services at the Ferry Building and surrounding vicinity are currently provided by the SFPD, with
assistance from an officer employed by the Port. Additionally, the SFSD serves the area, as needed.
There are currently three police stations within less than a mile of the project, and the area is actively
patrolled by both the SFPD and the officer based at Pier 26. With existing police services in place, it is
anticipated that the proposed project would not significantly impact the response times for police services.
Fire Protection Services. The project would not induce a permanent increase in population that would
require the addition of fire protection services or facilities. The project would increase pedestrian traffic
in the project area and its immediate vicinity; however, the project area is in a developed area with
commercial and transit uses, and experiences a significant amount of pedestrian traffic and public use.
The incremental increase in users from the proposed project would not be anticipated to substantially
increase demand for fire protection services. A number of resources for fire protection are currently in
place to provide service to the area. Fire protection is provided by the USCG and the SFFD, and the Port
Fire Marshall works with the SFFD to provide additional service to the area. Three SFFD stations are in
the vicinity of the project, and if vessels or waterfront facilities were to catch fire, the USCG would
provide support. The USCG, SFFD, and Port operate under contingency plans, which establish protocols
and appropriate actions in the event of emergencies. With the existing fire resources in place, it is
anticipated that the proposed project would not adversely impact response times, service ratios, or
performance objectives; and would not require the construction of new, or physical alteration of existing,
fire protection facilities. In addition, the existing fire lane and fire protection service access from the
water or the land to the project area would not be modified by the proposed project improvements.
Emergency Services. Similar to police and fire services, it is expected that existing emergency services
would accommodate any emergencies that could occur in the project area; that the project would not
affect service ratios, response times, or performance objectives; and that the construction of new, or
physical alteration of existing, emergency services facilities would not be required. Saint Francis
Memorial Hospital is less than 3 miles from the proposed project, and the SFFD also provides emergency
services. In addition, the existing emergency evacuation routes and facilities on site (i.e., the Ferry Plaza)
would not be modified by the proposed project improvements.
NEPA Determination. The proposed project would have no impact to schools or park facilities. The
proposed project would not adversely impact police, fire, and emergency services.
CEQA Determination. The proposed project would have no impact to schools or park facilities. The
proposed project would have a less-than-significant impact to police, fire, and emergency services.
Impact 3.15-2: Potential to Significantly Affect Water, Wastewater, and Solid Waste
Supplies and/or Services
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no modifications would be made to the existing Ferry Terminal
facilities to accommodate new or existing WETA services. Therefore, the No Action Alternative would
have no impact to water or wastewater treatment. The increase in the number of passengers passing
through the Ferry Terminal due under the No Action Alternative would increase the quantity of solid
waste generated in the project area; however, the commercial and public spaces in the project area are
currently heavily used, and waste collection and disposal systems currently exist. Therefore, no adverse
impacts are anticipated as a result of the No Action Alternative.

Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Action Alternative
The project would only require a small amount of potable water, supplied at each gate for the purposes of
washing down berthing facilities and queuing areas, as necessary. The proposed project would not induce
permanent population growth that would, for example, require a significant increase in water supply to
provide sufficient water supply to a new community. Potable water is currently supplied to the project
area by SFPUC, and the proposed project would not generate a significant enough increase in water
demand to require new or expanded water entitlements.
In the project area, sanitary wastewater is generated inside the Ferry Building and the Agriculture
Building, which are currently served by CCSF’s wastewater treatment facilities. Runoff generated during
washing down of berthing facilities would not generate an increased demand on the existing wastewater
facilities, because it would not be handled by the sanitary wastewater facilities. A more detailed
discussion of the runoff generated by berthing facilities is available in Section 3.11, Hydrology and Water
Quality. The proposed project does not include additional facilities that would generate an increase in
wastewater; therefore, the project would have no adverse effect. Restrooms are provided for water transit
passengers on board each vessel, and the vessels would be serviced at other locations in the water transit
system (not at the Ferry Terminal); impacts on utilities at WETA’s maintenance facilities have been
addressed under separate environmental review processes for those facilities, and are not considered in
this document. The project would result in additional use of the Ferry Building area, which could result
in an increase in the use of the existing sanitary wastewater facilities at the Ferry Building or the
Agriculture Building. However, because there are facilities on each vessel, and the project would not
induce population growth in San Francisco, this would not affect the capacity of the sanitary system or
CCSF facilities.
The increase in the number of passengers passing through the Ferry Terminal due to the proposed project
would increase the quantity of solid waste generated in the project area. However, solid waste receptacles
are provided on board each water transit vessel, and the vessels would be serviced (and trash removed) at
other locations in the water transit system (not at the Ferry Terminal). The commercial and public spaces
in the project area are currently heavily used, and waste collection and disposal systems currently exist.
In addition, waste collected in San Francisco complies with CCSF’s stringent solid waste programs
requiring separation of refuse into recyclables, compostables, and landfill trash. The amount of solid
waste generated by the project in the project area would be expected to be small, and there are collection
and disposal systems in place that encourage recycling and composting.
NEPA Determination. The project would not adversely impact water supply, wastewater, and solid
waste facilities.
CEQA Determination. The project’s potential to impact water supply, wastewater, and solid waste
facilities would be less than significant.
Impact 3.15-3. Potential to Require New Stormwater Drainage Facilities
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, no modifications would be made to the existing Ferry Terminal
facilities to accommodate new or existing WETA services. No additional impervious surface area would
be developed. There would be no need for additional stormwater drainage facilities. Therefore, the No
Action Alternative would have no impact to stormwater drainage facilities.

Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Action Alternative
The proposed project would introduce approximately 60,000 square feet of additional impervious surfaces
(i.e., pier deck), a portion of which would require stormwater infrastructure upgrades. Stormwater would
be managed through the use of bioretention planters and/or media filters, as described in Chapter 2.0,
Alternatives.
Bioretention planters—each approximately 3 feet in width and 3 feet in depth, and composed of 1½ feet
of bioretention soil mix and 1 foot of drainage rock—would provide for ½ foot of ponding. Planters
would be placed above the highest estimated tide, along the south side of the new Gate A Access Pier, to
capture stormwater from the new pier; and along the East Bayside Promenade, to capture runoff from the
new promenade.
To conform to the grade changes in the project area, the Embarcadero Plaza would be designed to drain
predominantly to the west. Along the northern and western edges of the plaza area, a seismic joint would
also be required; it would allow seismic movement, and could also be designed to convey water for
stormwater treatment to a media filter (sand filter). Alternatively, a landscaped stormwater bioretention
and water quality treatment area adjacent to the promenade and the Pier 14 breakwater could be installed
to treat stormwater from the Embarcadero Plaza before it enters San Francisco Bay.
The proposed project would be developed in accordance with CCSF and the Port’s stormwater
management guidelines, and the specific stormwater management design would be determined as part of
the project’s final design. It is anticipated that with the proposed improvements to the onsite stormwater
drainage, facilities operated by CCSF would not be affected and stormwater would be managed on site.
NEPA Determination. The proposed project would not have adverse impacts on stormwater drainage
facilities.
CEQA Determination. The proposed project would have a less-than-significant impact on stormwater
drainage facilities.
Construction Impacts
The No Action Alternative would not result in any physical changes to the Ferry Terminal, and no
construction activities would be required. Therefore, there would be no construction impacts on utilities
and public services.
Impact 3.15-4: Insufficient Permitted Capacity of Solid Waste Landfill
The proposed project would be subject to the San Francisco Construction and Demolition Debris
Recovery Program (Ordinance Number 27-06), which requires that 65 percent of mixed construction and
demolition waste be diverted from landfills. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors also adopted a goal
of 75 percent landfill diversion by the year 2010, and a goal of zero waste by 2020, through Resolution
Number 530-04 and Resolution Number 002-03. A licensed solid waste hauler (e.g., Recology) would
provide the construction and demolition nonhazardous waste collection services for project construction
and demolition. Upon sorting at the transfer station, it is anticipated that construction waste generated by
the proposed project that could not be diverted (recycled or reused) would be accepted at the Altamont
Landfill, which has a remaining capacity of approximately 46 million cubic yards (75 percent of its
permitted capacity). It is anticipated that the proposed project would generate approximately 3,823 cubic
yards of construction and demolition waste. The Altamont Landfill would have sufficient capacity to
accommodate the proposed project.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

NEPA Determination. The project would not contribute to landfills with insufficient permitted capacity,
and therefore no adverse impacts would occur.
CEQA Determination. The proposed project’s impact on contributing to landfills with insufficient
permitted capacity would be less than significant.
Impact 3.15-5: Potential to Violate Federal, State, and Local Statutes and Regulations
Related to Solid Waste
As discussed above, the proposed project would be subject to Ordinance Number 27-06, which requires
that 65 percent of mixed construction and demolition debris be diverted from landfills; and Resolution
Number 530-04 and Resolution Number 002-03, which adopted a goal of 75 percent landfill diversion by
the year 2010, and a goal of zero waste by 2020. It is anticipated that demolition waste from the proposed
project would be disposed of at the nearest waste and recycling facility (identified in Section 3.15.2), in
accordance with CCSF requirements. The proposed project would comply with all pertinent federal,
state, and local requirements regarding solid waste.
NEPA Determination. The project would not violate federal, state, and local statutes and regulations
related to solid waste, and therefore no adverse impacts would occur.
CEQA Determination. The proposed project would have a less-than-significant impact on violating
federal, state, and local statutes and regulations related to solid waste.
Impact 3.15-6: Potential to Adversely Impact Existing Underground Utilities During
Construction Activities
Utilities for water, wastewater, and telecommunications are located underground along The Embarcadero;
and, in some instances, along the Embarcadero Promenade. The exact locations and depths of utility lines
are currently not known. If project construction were to disrupt or damage underground utilities in the
project area, this would be an adverse and potentially significant effect. To avoid disruption to public
services, WETA would, prior to the start of construction activities, comply with Mitigation
Measure UTIL-1, Consultation and Coordination with Utility Provider.
NEPA Determination. Project construction could disrupt or damage underground utilities in the project
area, a potentially adverse impact. With implementation of Mitigation Measure UTIL-1, disruption to
public utilities is unlikely to occur, and impacts from project construction would be reduced and would
not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. Project construction could disrupt or damage underground utilities in the project
area, a potentially significant impact. With implementation of Mitigation Measure UTIL-1, impacts to
underground utilities during project construction would be reduced to a less-than-significant level.
Cumulative Impacts
Impact 3.15-7: Potential to Result in Cumulative Impacts on Utilities and Public Services
The geographical context of cumulative public service impacts analysis is the City of San Francisco. The
proposed project could increase demand on utilities and public services in the study area. Although the
impacts from the proposed project would not be substantial and have been determined to be less than
significant and not adverse, other reasonably foreseeable projects in the study area (along and adjacent to
San Francisco’s eastern waterfront) could result in similar impacts. The other reasonably foreseeable
projects in the study area (refer to Table 3.1-1) comprise waterfront development, public facility
upgrades, and transportation developments that have been or are currently in the planning phase. The

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

proposed project, in combination with other projects in the area, could have the potential to result in
cumulatively adverse increases in demand on utilities (water, wastewater, and solid waste) and public
services (police, fire, and emergency medical).
Utilities
As stated above, the project area has existing water and wastewater facilities in the area. The proposed
project is not anticipated to significantly increase demand on water. The project design would address
stormwater generated from the project area. CCSF has a number of plans and policies to address water
and wastewater. The General Plan includes policies to maintain an adequate water distribution system
and stormwater management ordinances. There are also a number of building code requirements for
water conservation and wastewater management. Therefore, the proposed project would not contribute to
cumulative impacts associated with water, wastewater, or stormwater treatment in San Francisco.
The proposed project, and those listed in Table 3.1-1, would be subject to federal, state, and local
regulations for minimizing solid waste. As discussed above, CCSF has a stringent solid waste program.
The Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance requires the separation of refuse into recyclables,
compostable, and landfill trash. Solid waste for all of the reasonably foreseeable projects would be
managed according to CCSF’s ordinance reducing solid waste. In addition, the solid waste generated by
the proposed project would be minimal. Therefore, the proposed project’s contribution to cumulative
impacts on solid waste services and disposal capacity would not be considerable.
Public Services
San Francisco has an existing police and fire department, with stations throughout the city and several in
the project vicinity. Law enforcement is provided by the SFPD in conjunction with the SFSD. Fire
protection services are provided by the SFFD, and also the USCG. In the event of an emergency, medical
services can be provided by the SFFD and SFPD. There are also several hospitals in San Francisco, with
the nearest less than 3 miles from the project site. Additionally, the proposed project and other projects
listed in Table 3.1-1 would be subject to federal, state, and local regulations for providing adequate public
services to the community. The proposed project would not result in permanent population growth, and
would not contribute to impacts on schools and parklands. It is anticipated that the existing public
services provided would be sufficient to serve the project area. Therefore, project’s contribution to
cumulative public service impacts would not be considerable.

3.15.4 Mitigation Measures
Mitigation Measure UTIL-1: Consultation and Coordination with Utility Providers
Prior to the start of construction activities, WETA will consult with public utility providers who have
infrastructure in the immediate vicinity of the proposed project improvements, to determine the exact
location and depth of utility lines.

SOCIOECONOMICS

3.16.1 Introduction to the Analysis
Socioeconomic issues relevant to the evaluation of environmental impacts include labor force and
employment, population, poverty status, and housing. This section describes existing population,
economic, and housing conditions at varying geographic levels, including the region, the City and County
of San Francisco, and the immediate project vicinity. The proposed project would not affect population,
housing, poverty status, or employment because it neither constructs nor removes any new housing units,
and because it is likely that project-related construction jobs would be filled by workers who already
reside in the San Francisco Bay Area.
3.16.2 Affected Environment
This section presents socioeconomic data pertinent to the environmental analysis for the Water
Emergency Transportation Authority’s (WETA) proposed Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal
Expansion Project (project). Socioeconomic information is presented for the City and County of San
Francisco as a whole, and for the population residing within approximately ½ mile of the project site. For
information on regional growth trends and projections (including regional employment and housing data)
for the nine-county Bay Area, refer to Section 3.17, Regional Growth.
Existing Conditions
San Francisco Population
Table 3.16-1 presents information on population trends and projections in the City and County of San
Francisco, which represents approximately 11 percent of the Bay Area region’s residents. The city’s
population increased by 4.3 percent—from 776,733 in 2000 to approximately 810,000 in 2010. The
population is expected to increase an additional 19.6 percent to 969,000 by 2035, with the average
household size remaining stable at 2.28 persons. The city’s population is expected to increase
19.6 percent between 2010 and 2035, but the number of jobs in the city is expected to increase by
41.8 percent during the same time period, ensuring that the city will remain an important commute
destination for people living throughout the region—although approximately 25 percent of city residents
who are employed commute to work outside of the city (ABAG, 2009b; SF Planning, 2011a).

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

The 2010 census presents a portrait of the City and County of San Francisco’s population as racially
diverse, relatively affluent, and aging. Families with children represent a small proportion of all
households, and the city has the distinction of having the fewest children of any major city in the United
States (SF Planning, 2011a). In 2010, approximately 58 percent of the city’s population was minority. 1
This was comparable to the figures for the state and nation as a whole. California had a slightly higher
percentage of minority population in 2010 (60 percent), while the United States had a slightly lower
percentage (56 percent). In 2010, 11.9 percent of San Francisco’s population was living below the
poverty level—compared with 13.7 percent in California and 13.8 percent in the United States.
Project Area Population
Population residing in the project vicinity is relatively sparse. Figure 3.16-1 shows the 2010 census
blocks that lie completely or partially within a ¼-mile and ½-mile radius of the project area. As this
figure shows, there is no population residing in or immediately adjacent to the project area. Of the 132
census blocks that lie entirely or almost entirely within the ½-mile radius, more than half (53 percent) had
no resident population in 2010. Another 36 census blocks (27 percent) had populations of fewer than 10
persons. These zero or very low population census blocks are those that encompass the waterfront piers,
or that are developed with commercial buildings such as the San Francisco Ferry Building (Ferry
Building) itself, or with major downtown office and service centers such as the Embarcadero Center, One
Maritime Plaza, and One Market Plaza. Only 26 of the census blocks (20 percent) within ½ mile of the
project site had resident populations of ten or more persons, and the majority of these blocks were more
than ¼ mile from the project site. Most of the resident population is concentrated in several large
residential or mixed-use developments, including Golden Gateway Commons, The Gateway, and
Bridgeway Plaza north of Market Street; and Rincon Center, The Infinity, BayCrest, BridgeView
Condominiums, The Watermark, and Bayside Village south of Market Street. Table 3.16-2 (on the
following page) presents the total population by Census Tract and Block Group within a ½-mile radius of
the project area.
The project area lies partially in two Census Tracts: 105 and 615. In 2010, Census Tract 105 had a total
resident population of 2,685 persons, of whom 35 percent were minority. Census Tract 615 had a total
population of 11,502 residents, of whom 42 percent were minority. Both of these are well below the
citywide minority population (58 percent).
Figure 3.16-2 shows the percent of the population in each census block that is minority. 2
Of the 39 census blocks in Census Tract 105, 25 of them (64 percent) have either no population, or no
minority population. In ten of the remaining blocks (26 percent), minorities comprise less than 50 percent
of the population. Only four census blocks were identified as having residential populations that are
50 percent or more minority. Two of these are within ¼ mile of the project area—one just west of The
Embarcadero between Washington and Clay streets (a public open space that reported one resident in
2010); and the other on the southern side of Jackson Street, west of Drumm Street (a strip of townhomes
fronting on Jackson Street—part of the Gateway Apartments and Townhomes development—with 21
residents reported in 2010, of whom 11 were minority). The other two census blocks with more than 50
percent minority residents are more than ¼ mile from the project area, on the northern and southern sides
of Broadway Street, between Front and Battery streets. The block on the southern side of Broadway
reported a resident population of 147 persons in 2010, mostly living at 733 Front Street, a luxury
condominium development that was completely renovated in 2007 (Klampert, 2012). On the northern

side of Broadway Street is the Broadway Family Apartment Complex, which stretches between Battery
and Front streets, with an interior courtyard. This complex contains 81 housing units that are all
affordable to households earning 60 percent or less of the Area Median Income. This is a relatively new
housing complex that was constructed in 2008 (Saadani, 2012; CCDC, 2012a).
Census Tract 615 shows a similar pattern of minority population distribution. There are no census blocks
within ¼ mile of the project area that have minority populations greater than 50 percent. Several census
blocks have minority populations greater than 50 percent, but these are more than ¼ mile from the project
area, and for the most part represent new Class A condominium developments in the South of Market Area.
Interviews with property managers of residential complexes in the site vicinity indicate that the resident
population is racially quite mixed, reflecting the racial diversity of the city, although there are relatively
high proportions of young Asian professionals, and relatively few persons of Hispanic origin in residence
(Brooks, 2011; Dirienzo, 2011). The exception is the Broadway Family Housing complex, which is
occupied predominantly by low-income Asian households (Saadani, 2012).
Poverty
The U.S. Census Bureau uses the federal government’s official poverty threshold definition, which is
based on income, family size, and age. This nationwide poverty definition is adjusted annually to reflect

Consequences, and Mitigation

changes in the Consumer Price Index, but it is not adjusted for regional variations in cost of living
(U.S. Census Bureau, 2012).
The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that less than 12 percent of San Francisco’s population was living
below the poverty threshold in 2010. This is lower than both the statewide rate (14.2 percent) and the
nationwide rate (14.3 percent) in 2010. In the two census tracts that encompass the project site, the
poverty rates were approximately 6 percent (Census Tract 105) and 16 percent (Census Tract 615),
respectively. Census Tract 105 lies mostly within ¼ mile of the project area, stretching along the
waterfront from Mission Street north to Broadway. Census Tract 615 (whose boundaries changed in the
2010 census) stretches from Market and Mission streets southward, encompassing a considerable part of
the South of Market area east of Fourth Street.
Figure 3.16-3 shows the percent of persons living below the poverty threshold for individual block groups
in the census tracts, based on the 2006-2010 American Community Survey, which represents the most
recent estimates of poverty status available from the Census Bureau (U.S. Department of Commerce,
2011; SF Planning, 2010). These estimates, calculated as 5-year averages, are based on sample data that
the census bureau warns may be unreliable for geographic units smaller than census tracts as a whole, due
to small sample size (Gemignani, 2012). Nonetheless, the block group data can be used to identify
general patterns of where poverty may be concentrated.
As can be seen from Figure 3.16-3, most of the population within ¼ mile of the project area had a
percentage of persons living below the poverty threshold that was well below the citywide average. Only
a very small portion of the area (the block group west of Drumm Street) had a higher rate of poverty than
the City and County of San Francisco as a whole, and this is likely to be a statistical anomaly, reflecting
poverty rates in portions of the Tenderloin and Chinatown that lie further west in this census block, rather
than any resident population in the commercial developments in and adjacent to the Embarcadero Center. 3
Employment
San Francisco is the most urbanized of the nine Bay Area counties, and it has served as a primary
employment hub for the region since the 1849 Gold Rush. In San Francisco, the number of employed
residents declined between 2000 and 2010, as did the mean household income. The number of employed
residents in the city is expected to increase from 411,900 in 2010 to 520,700 in 2030, with the mean
household income increasing from $102,200 to $126,700 during the same time period (ABAG, 2009b).
San Francisco’s labor force decreased from 473,000 in 2000 to 420,500 in 2005; and increased to 459,800
by 2009. Total employment declined from a peak of more than 608,000 jobs in 2000 to fewer than
549,000 jobs in 2009, a 9.7 percent decline, while the local unemployment rate rose from 3.4 percent in
2000 to 8.9 percent in 2009. The unemployment rate rose further, to 9.5 percent in 2010, compared with
12.4 percent statewide. San Francisco’s share of regional jobs has remained around 16 to 17 percent
since 2000 (California EDD, 2011; SF Planning, 2010).
As shown in Table 3.16-1, total jobs declined from 643,000 to 569,000 between 2000 and 2010, but are
expected to increase substantially by 2030 to 748,000, with Professional and Managerial Services
remaining the sector employing the largest number of people, followed by the Health and Educational
Services sector (ABAG, 2009b).

3

Representatives of the State Census Data Center in Sacramento and the U.S. Census Bureau’s Regional office in Seattle were
unable to explain why small numbers (1-4) of residents were showing up in the Embarcadero Center blocks, because the 2010
census did not enumerate homeless persons. A property management representative for the Embarcadero Center confirmed
that there are no residences or residential uses of any kind in the Embarcadero Center (Farnam, 2012; Fitzpatrick, 2012;
Gemignani, 2012).

Downtown San Francisco
Ferry Terminal Expansion Project
San Francisco, California

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

In 2000, 280,000 people commuted into San Francisco daily for work. By 2020, this number is expected
to increase by 23.2 percent, to 345,000. Residents of the region commute to San Francisco by private
automobile, or by regional transit systems, including ferries, Bay Area Rapid Transit, and Caltrain.
Although more than 40 percent of all San Francisco business establishments are very small, home-based
businesses with four or fewer employees, the larger employers (those with 50 or more employees) and
most jobs are concentrated in the downtown Financial District and South of Market District, which are
accessible from the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal) (ABAG, 2009b; SF
Planning, 2010).
Housing
In 2009, there were an estimated 365,050 housing units (or just over 13 percent of all housing units in the
region) in the City and County of San Francisco (ABAG, 2009a). Housing costs in San Francisco are
among the highest in the region, and are substantially above comparable costs in the state and nation, as
shown in Table 3.16-3.

Source: SF Planning, 2011a.

Most of the housing units within ½ mile of the project site are concentrated in several major residential or
mixed-use developments, including Golden Gateway Commons, The Gateway, and Bridgeway Plaza
north of Market Street; and The Infinity, BayCrest Condominiums, BridgeView Condominiums, The
Watermark, and Bayside Village south of Market Street. Most of these developments offer high-end or
luxury condominiums or rental units close to job centers in the downtown, although some also contain a
small percentage of below-market-rate units, as required under their development agreements. The
Broadway Family Apartments complex at 810 Battery Street is the exception, providing affordable
housing to families earning 60 percent or less of the Area Median Income.
Future planned developments, such as the proposed seven-tower Transbay Redevelopment District, and
development at 8 Washington, are likely to bring additional residential population to the project area in
the future. It is expected that most of these new units will be similar to those recently constructed in the
project area—i.e., smaller luxury condominium and apartment units that will attract a racially mixed and
relatively affluent population of younger professionals, although the Chinatown Community
Development Center is planning to construct a 75-unit family housing development in the near future at
235 Broadway (CCDC, 2012b).
Regulatory Setting
Both the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) require consideration of social and economic impacts. Local jurisdictions also adopt goals and
policies that can address population growth and distribution, or quality-of-life issues related to proposed
transportation improvement projects. In addition, other legislation specifically requires analysis of
potential environmental justice impacts. Relevant laws and guidelines are summarized below.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Federal
NEPA calls for the integrated use of social sciences to assess the potential impacts of federal projects on
the “human environment.” Regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality for
implementing NEPA suggest that the “human environment” should be interpreted comprehensively to
include “the natural and physical environment and the relationship of people with that environment”
(40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 1508.14). Agencies are directed to assess economic and social
effects of projects, whether direct, indirect, or cumulative (40 CFR 1508.8).
The Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act (42 United States Code,
Chapter 61) aims to ensure that persons displaced as a result of a federal action, or an undertaking
involving federal funds, are treated fairly, consistently, and equitably, so that such persons will not suffer
disproportionate injuries as a result of projects designed for the benefit of the public as a whole.
State
CEQA defines the “environment” as primarily physical conditions (including land, air, water, minerals,
flora, fauna, noise, and objects of historic or aesthetic significance) that do not include social or economic
resources (CEQA Section 21060.5). CEQA does not treat social and economic changes that might result
from a project as significant environmental effects in and of themselves, although they may be used to
determine the significance of a physical change in the environment (CEQA Guidelines Sections 15064[e],
15131, and 15360). CEQA requires that environmental documents “discuss the ways in which the
proposed project could foster economic or population growth, or the construction of additional housing,
either directly or indirectly, in the surrounding environment” (CEQA Guidelines, Section 15126.2[d]).
The California Relocation Act (Government Code Section 7260 et seq.), in parallel with the comparable
federal law, requires state and local governments to provide relocation assistance and benefits to persons
displaced by projects undertaken by state entities that do not involve federal funds.
Local
The project site lies in the jurisdiction of the City and County of San Francisco (CCSF). State law
requires that each local jurisdiction adopt a comprehensive general plan to guide its physical
development. CCSF’s General Plan is the official city policy document guiding planned development in
its jurisdiction. The Commerce and Industry Element and the Housing Element of the CCSF’s General
Plan include policies and objectives pertaining to employment, population, and housing issues. The
Commerce and Industry Element encourages economic development and contains policies to manage
economic growth in the city. The Housing Element evaluates housing needs in comparison to land
development capacity, and provides policies aimed at improving capacity and fostering affordable
housing development.
The San Francisco Sustainability Plan, adopted in 1997, contains policy guidance in ten specific
environmental issue areas and five general areas, including economic development and environmental
justice. In addition, Chapter 6.22 and Chapter 83 of the San Francisco Administrative Code address
requirements for local hiring for certain activities taking place in the city, including infrastructure
improvement projects.
3.16.3 Impact Evaluation
This section includes an analysis and determination of the potential adverse and beneficial impacts of the
proposed project on socioeconomic conditions in the region and the project area. It identifies potential
impacts on established neighborhoods; population and housing; and employment and income that would

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

result from implementation of either of the project alternatives. For an analysis of Environmental Justice
impacts, refer to Section 3.17, Environmental Justice.
The analysis considers whether the project would:


Result in adverse changes in the character and cohesion of an established neighborhood, such as
increased noise, traffic, access restrictions, parking loss or intrusion, or pedestrian safety hazards, so
that the integrity of the neighborhood as a whole is changed (but not necessarily individual
properties);



Displace homes or businesses without adequate replacement resources; or



Disrupt or divide the physical arrangement of an established community, or remove neighborhood
amenities.

To assess whether the project would result in any of the above, and based on a review of the project
description and details of the project implementation, the socioeconomics analysis determined whether
the project would result in displacement of homes or businesses without adequate replacement resources;
considered whether the project would result in the loss of community facilities or amenities; and
determined whether the project would split or alter the character of the existing community, impede
access to key community facilities or amenities, or otherwise result in a deterioration in quality of living.
Direct Impacts
Impact 3.16-1: Potential to Cause Adverse Changes in the Character and Cohesion of or
Physically Divide or Disrupt an Established Neighborhood
No Action Alternative
The No Action Alternative would not involve making any improvements to existing facilities at the Ferry
Terminal. All planned new and expanded routes would be accommodated at the existing Ferry Terminal
facilities. This could result in some change in the character of the Ferry Terminal area. With the
increased use that is projected to occur (in the absence of the proposed improvements), the Ferry
Terminal area could become a less enjoyable place for business patrons and pedestrians to use, due to
overcrowding of plazas, walkways, and queuing areas. As a result, shops, restaurants, and ferries could
become more difficult to access easily, although the character of the area as a waterfront transportation
hub would not change. This would be a negligible impact.
Action Alternative
The proposed project would result in changes to Ferry Terminal facilities along the waterfront, behind the
existing Ferry Building and adjacent plazas, where water transit gates and pedestrian walkways along the
waterfront currently exist. Traffic impacts and noise impacts are summarized in Section 3.2,
Transportation and Circulation; and Section 3.7, Noise and Vibration, respectively. The proposed project
would not change the character of the area; in fact, the proposed improvements would contribute to the
water-oriented public facilities and activities already established in this area. Although the proposed
project would result in greater pedestrian traffic through, and pedestrian use of, the project area, this area
is currently a developed and highly active commercial, transportation, and public space. The proposed
project would improve pedestrian circulation and flow in the project area by expanding the circulation
areas available around the Ferry Building and the water transit gates. This would address the
overcrowding of plazas, walkways, and queuing areas discussed above for the No Action Alternative.
These enhancements to circulation and addition of other amenities (e.g., better signage and weather

R:\13 WETA\DTFX\Draft 0413\3_16_Socio.docx

Consequences, and Mitigation

protection) would enhance user enjoyment of the area, including those users accessing the retail uses
within the Ferry Building.
Access to the project area, including the businesses within the project area, would not be blocked or
modified by implementation of the proposed project. Project improvements would be constructed on
areas that are currently open water or serve as access to water transit gates (see Figure 2-9, Construction
Zone). The project would not affect the areas used to access the businesses in the project area (i.e., the
areas in front of and along the sides of the Ferry Building; the Ferry Plaza behind the Ferry Building; and
the access to the Agriculture Building). Therefore, the project would not disrupt or divide the physical
arrangement of an established community, or remove neighborhood amenities.
The project would not adversely affect an existing residential community, because no residential
community exists at the project site, and the closest residential uses are west of The Embarcadero.
The project’s public space and circulation improvements (e.g., creation of the Embarcadero Plaza) could
benefit community cohesion by making the Ferry Terminal area an even more attractive place to visit,
which would further support the businesses operating in the project area.
NEPA Determination. The proposed project would not impact community character or community
cohesion, or result in the physical division of a community.
CEQA Determination. The proposed project would have no impact on community character or
cohesion community cohesion, or result in the physical division of a community.
Impact 3.16-2: Potential to Displace Homes or Businesses without Adequate
Replacement Resources
No Action Alternative
The No Action Alternative would not involve making any improvements to existing facilities at the Ferry
Terminal. All planned new and expanded routes would be accommodated at the existing Ferry Terminal
facilities. No homes are in the project area. No businesses would be displaced under the No Action
Alternative.
Action Alternative
The proposed project would not displace any homes or businesses in the project area. Sinbad’s bar and
restaurant is in the project area, where construction of the project improvements is proposed in the South
Basin. However, in April 2012, San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission
amended the Special Area Plan to permit temporary uses for America’s Cup race events, and to require
public benefits to mitigate impacts associated with the events, including a requirement that the America’s
Cup Project remove the restaurant at Pier 2 by March 2015. Therefore, Sinbad’s would be removed by
2015 as part of the America’s Cup Project, and would not be affected by the Action Alternative. A
portion of Pier 2 is currently being used for a limited amount of parking associated with Sinbad’s
restaurant. When the restaurant is removed, those parking spaces would also be vacated, and these spaces
would not be relocated in the project area. Because the number of spaces is minor and the business they
serve would be removed, the removal of these spaces would be considered negligible.
NEPA Determination. No homes or businesses would be displaced by the project; therefore, there
would be no impact.
CEQA Determination. No homes or businesses would be displaced by the project; therefore, there
would be no impact.

Indirect Impacts
Impact 3.16-3: Potential to Indirectly Economically Impact the Businesses in the Project
Area
No Action Alternative
Because the No Action Alternative would not involve any improvements to the Ferry Terminal, this
alternative would not result in indirect socioeconomic impacts.
Action Alternative
Businesses in the project area and its vicinity would benefit indirectly from both construction workforce
spending (e.g., meals and incidentals) and project operations. Implementation of the proposed project
would facilitate the full expansion of WETA’s regional services, and would be expected to increase water
transit passenger use of the Ferry Terminal. Ridership for WETA services would increase from 5,100
passengers a day to 25,700 passengers a day. The project would also improve the quality of amenities in
the project area (e.g., creation of the Embarcadero Plaza), making it an even more attractive place for
water transit passengers, or for city residents or tourists to visit. These would be beneficial indirect
impacts to local businesses.
Access to the businesses within the project area would not be blocked or modified by implementation of
the proposed project. Therefore, the project would not result in indirect adverse impacts to local
businesses.
NEPA Determination. The project would have indirect beneficial economic impacts to local businesses;
no adverse impacts would occur.
CEQA Determination. A CEQA determination is not applicable, because CEQA does not consider
economic benefits to be environmental impacts.
Construction Impacts
The No Action Alternative would not result in any physical changes to the Ferry Terminal, and no
construction activities would be required. Therefore, there would not be any adverse construction-related
impacts on socioeconomics.
Impact 3.16-4: Potential to Impact Businesses in the Project Area and the Region During
Construction
Project implementation would bring some economic benefits to the region as a result of expenditures for
construction materials purchasing and construction payroll. Construction employment would result in
payroll income for some households in the region, as well as indirect and induced economic benefits
associated with material purchasing and construction worker spending. Although the construction
workforce would be relatively small, and the amount of construction planned would be modest, these
would be beneficial impacts to the businesses in the project areas as well as to other businesses in the
region.
Project construction would not block or modify access to the Ferry Building, Ferry Plaza, or businesses in
the project area. In addition, signage with directions to the offices and businesses in the project area
would be provided, if necessary, to ensure that effects on normal business operations would be
minimized. Therefore, the project would not result in adverse impacts to local businesses during
construction.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

NEPA Determination. The project would have beneficial economic impacts to the region during
construction; no adverse impacts would occur.
CEQA Determination. A CEQA determination is not applicable, because CEQA does not consider
economic benefits to be environmental impacts.
Impact 3.16-5: Potential Impacts on Employment, Population, Housing, and Income
During Construction
The construction workforce required for demolition and construction activities would vary monthly, with
a maximum workforce of approximately 25 people. Some activities, such as dredging, would require a
much smaller number of workers (4 to 6 people). The Bay Area has a relatively large and diversified
resident labor force, with the skills and availability to meet all of the projected construction workforce
needs. This project would benefit employment during construction, and would not be expected to affect
population or housing in the region.
NEPA Determination. The proposed project would have a beneficial impact on employment and
income, and no impact on population and housing income in the region and the project area during
construction. No adverse impacts would occur.
CEQA Determination. The proposed project would have a beneficial impact on employment and
income, and no impact on population and housing income in the region and the project area during
construction.
Impact 3.16-6: Potential to Disrupt or Divide the Physical Arrangement of an Established
Community Temporarily During Construction
Construction noise, air quality, and traffic impacts are described in Section 3.7, Noise and Vibration;
Section 3.6, Air Quality and Global Climate Change; and Section 3.2, Transportation and Circulation,
respectively. Project construction would result in some noise, vibration, air quality emissions, and
construction-related traffic that could affect peoples’ ability to enjoy the outdoor amenities in the Ferry
Terminal vicinity during construction. However, as discussed in these sections, the effects would not be
significant; and mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce potential construction impacts.
As shown on Figure 2-9, and described in Section 2.4.5, Construction Staging, the majority of
construction would be conducted from barges, to limit the amount of Ferry Building area that would be
affected by construction activities. Project construction would not block or modify access to the Ferry
Building, Ferry Plaza, or businesses in the project area. In addition, signage with directions to the offices
and businesses in the project area would be provided, if necessary, to ensure that effects on normal
business operations would be minimized. Therefore, disruption to the physical arrangement of the area
and community would be minimal. There are no residences in the immediate project area; the nearest
residences are approximately 700 feet to the northwest.
NEPA Determination. Construction impacts on established community amenities would not be adverse.
CEQA Determination. Construction impacts on established community amenities would be less than
significant.
Cumulative Impacts
Impact 3.16-7. Potential to Result in Cumulative Impacts on Socioeconomics
Construction of the proposed project improvements would temporarily disrupt the project area, affecting
circulation and site access. Four other projects listed on Table 3.1-1 would also involve construction in
R:\13 WETA\DTFX\Draft 0413\3_16_Socio.docx

the project area: the Golden Gate Ferry Terminal Improvement, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Ferry
Plaza Physical Barrier Project, America’s Cup Project, and Agriculture Building Rehabilitation. Should
construction occur simultaneously, cumulative adverse impacts to the community and businesses in the
project area could occur. However, construction activities associated with the proposed project and these
other projects are unlikely to occur at the same time. The BART Ferry Plaza Physical Barrier Project and
America’s Cup improvements would be completed prior to initiation of construction of the proposed
project. The Agriculture Building Rehabilitation has not been planned in detail yet, and due to the
Agriculture Building’s location and space constraints on site, rehabilitation of the Agriculture Building
could not occur at the same time as the proposed project improvements. The Golden Gate Ferry Terminal
Improvements could overlap with the proposed project improvements, but this project would be expected
to be small in scale and limited in duration, and would be likely to only affect the Golden Gate Terminal.
Therefore is it unlikely that cumulative adverse impacts due to disruption of the project site during
construction would occur.
NEPA Determination. The project would not contribute to adverse cumulative impacts to
socioeconomic conditions.
CEQA Determination. Cumulative impacts to socioeconomic conditions would be less than significant.
3.16.4 Mitigation Measures
Mitigation measures would not be required for socioeconomic impacts.

ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

3.17.1 Introduction to the Analysis
In accordance with federal guidelines for environmental justice evaluations and Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) guidance, this section evaluates demographic data to determine whether or not
minority populations or low-income populations are present in the project vicinity.
In addition to evaluating the potential presence of environmental justice populations in the study area, this
section reviews the proposed project and its associated impacts to determine whether the project would
result in disproportionately high and adverse health or environmental effects on minority or low-income
populations. The analysis determined that there are no minority or low-income populations within ¼ mile
of the project site, but that there are minority or low-income populations located between ¼ mile and
½ mile of the project site. Findings from the environmental analysis indicate that minority or low-income
populations in the vicinity would not experience disproportionately high and adverse effects from the
project.
3.17.2 Affected Environment
Section 3.16 provides information on the demographic characteristics of the population residing in the
project vicinity, including current race, ethnicity, and poverty data.
Existing Conditions
To determine whether the project would disproportionately adversely affect a minority or low-income
population, the analysis first determined whether a minority or low-income population exists in the study
area (within ½ mile of the project area). Section 3.16, Socioeconomics, presents the most recent data
available on race, ethnicity, and poverty for the population residing in the vicinity of the project area.
Despite the fact that San Francisco’s citywide population is more than 50 percent minority, as a
conservative screening measure, census data were reviewed to identify any blocks in the vicinity of the
project area with minority populations greater than 50 percent, or areas where the percentage of the
population living below the poverty threshold is substantially greater than the citywide poverty rate (using
the federal government’s official poverty threshold definition, which is based on income, family size, and
age). In addition to reviewing the most current census data available, interviews with realtors and
property managers were conducted and visual field surveys were completed in an attempt to confirm or
better understand census findings, as well as to identify areas where environmental justice populations
might exist that may not have been indicated by the census data.
The census data indicate that there are some census blocks within ½ mile of the project area where the
majority of residents (>50 percent) are members of racial or ethnic minorities, indicating the potential
presence of minority or low-income populations, as defined under current federal agency guidance on
environmental justice evaluations.
Census data also indicate that the percentage of population living below the poverty threshold in the
vicinity of the project area is well below the citywide poverty rate, which is also below the state and
national poverty rates. Field research and interviews with property managers did not result in
identification of any low-income population clusters within ¼ mile of the project area.
Two census blocks within ¼ mile of the project area were identified as having greater than 50 percent
minority residents. One of these, however, is a public open space with a reported population of one
person in 2010. Because homeless persons were not counted in the 2010 census, this could represent a
counting error. In any case, one person would not be considered a population or a “community” for the

purpose of environmental justice analysis. The other census block—in which 11 of 21 persons were
reported as being minority in 2010—is a strip of townhouses fronting on Jackson Street, west of Drumm
Street. These townhomes are not an isolated or separate, cohesive community. Rather, they are an
integral part of the luxury housing development referred to as Golden Gateway Apartments and
Townhomes. The residential units (both the apartments and townhomes) in this development share the
same leasing office, management staff, and amenities (including access to the adjacent tennis and swim
club). The residential population of the Golden Gateway complex as a whole does not exceed 50 percent
minority, and is therefore not considered a minority population for the purpose of this environmental
justice analysis. Similarly, no low-income populations were identified within ¼ mile of the project area,
as described in Section 3.16, Socioeconomics.
Several census blocks located more than ¼ mile but less than ½ mile from the project area were identified
as housing populations that were more than 50 percent minority and/or low-income populations. Field
research and interviews resulted in the identification of a low-income Chinese family housing complex
recently completed by the Chinatown Community Development Center, amid luxury condominium
developments in the vicinity of Broadway between Battery and Front Streets, as well as several Class A
luxury condominium developments in the South of Market area with predominately Asian residents.
Regulatory Framework
Executive Order (EO) 12898, “Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations
and Low-Income Populations” (signed into law on February 11, 1994) requires that each federal agency
or its designee take the appropriate and necessary steps to identify and address “disproportionately high
and adverse” effects of federal projects on the health or environment of minority and low-income
populations to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law. EO 12898 requires that “each federal
agency shall make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as
appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs,
policies and activities on minority populations and low-income populations” [Subsection 1-101].
In April 1997, the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) issued the Order to Address
Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations (Order 5610.2). As the
U.S. DOT’s response to EO 12898, it generally describes the process for incorporating environmental
justice principles into U.S. DOT programs, policies, and activities. The objective of the order is to ensure
that the interests and well-being of minority and low-income populations are considered and addressed
during the decision making process for federally funded transportation projects. In May 2012, the
U.S. DOT issued an updated Departmental Order 5610.2(a) (Actions to Address Environmental Justice in
Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations). This Order updates the U.S. DOT’s original
Environmental Justice Order.
In August 2012, the FTA published its Environmental Justice Policy Guidance for Federal Transit
Administration Recipients (Circular FTA C 4703.1), to provide further guidance to transit agencies on
incorporating environmental justice principles into plans, projects, and activities that receive federal
funding from the FTA (FTA, 2012).
3.17.3 Impact Evaluation
This section determines whether environmental impacts associated with the project would be borne
disproportionately by minority or low-income populations. Screening to identify minority or low-income
populations was conducted consistent with the FTA’s Circular FTA C4703.1 (FTA, 2012). For the
purpose of this analysis, minority populations were considered to be residential populations comprising
50 percent or more minorities. Low-income populations were considered to be any readily identifiable
group of persons who live in geographic proximity, and whose median household income is at or below
the citywide poverty rate, as determined using the federal government’s official poverty threshold

definition. As identified in Section 3.16, Socioeconomics, several minority populations and one lowincome population (which was also a minority population) were identified. These are located between
¼ mile and ½ mile from the project area; specifically, in the vicinity of Broadway between Front and
Battery, near the intersection of Main and Harrison streets, and along Harrison Street between First and
Fremont streets (refer to the discussion of demographic and poverty data in Section 3.16,
Socioeconomics, and Figure 3.16-1).
Direct Impacts
Impact 3.17-1: Potential to Result in Disproportionately High or Adverse Direct Impacts
on Minority or Low-Income Populations
No Action Alternative
The No Action Alternative would not involve making improvements to existing facilities at the
Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal). The only potentially adverse impacts
identified for the No Action Alternative would result from the facilities at the Ferry Terminal not being
upgraded to Essential Facility Standards, thereby inhibiting the improvement of Water Emergency
Transportation Authority (WETA) emergency operations and seismic safety (refer to Impacts 3.12-4
and 3.13-1); and from pedestrian congestion in the project area, which would continue without the project
circulation improvements (refer to Impacts 3.3-1 and 3.4-2). However, these impacts would not be borne
disproportionately by minority or low-income populations. The circulation impacts would affect any user
of the Ferry Terminal area, which is broadly used by Bay Area residents and visitors. Similarly,
inhibiting improvement of WETA emergency operations has the potential to affect any worker, visitor, or
resident of San Francisco.
Action Alternative
No direct environmental impacts were identified that could not be reduced to less than significant and not
adverse with appropriate mitigation measures. Furthermore, none of the direct impacts identified would
occur in the areas where minority or low-income populations were identified.
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Determination. The project would not result in direct
high and disproportionate adverse impacts to any minority or low-income populations.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Determination. A CEQA determination is not
applicable. This analysis has been prepared to specifically address federal environmental justice analysis
requirements.
Indirect Impacts
Impact 3.17-2: Potential to Result in Disproportionately High or Adverse Indirect Impacts
on Minority or Low-Income Populations
No Action Alternative
Under the No Action Alternative, all planned new and expanded routes would be accommodated at the
existing Ferry Terminal facilities, resulting in more pedestrians using the transportation facilities and
public amenities in the project vicinity. This could alter the quality of the experience for transit users and
visitors, due to overcrowding of sidewalks and plaza areas, but indirect impacts would not involve any
disproportionately high and adverse direct impacts on minority or low-income populations.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Action Alternative
With the exception of Transportation and Circulation Impacts 3.2-2, 3.2-3, and 3.2-8, all indirect
environmental impacts would be less than significant and not adverse, or could be reduced to less than
significant and not adverse with appropriate mitigation measures. Therefore, for all project impacts
except Impacts 3.2-2, 3.2-3, and 3.2-8, the project would not result in high and disproportionate impacts
to any minority or low-income populations.
The three potentially adverse and significant indirect impacts identified Section 3.2, Transportation and
Circulation, are related to the addition of riders to the Muni F Market and Wharves line in the PM peak
hour; and to pedestrian traffic congestion at three crosswalks along The Embarcadero. As described in
Section 3.2, mitigation measures have been identified that could reduce some of these impacts. However,
because there is uncertainty as to whether fully mitigating these impacts is feasible, these impacts were
conservatively considered adverse and significant in this Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental
Impact Report. These impacts would affect passengers of the F Market and Wharves, as well as
pedestrians along The Embarcadero, both of which are broadly used by Bay Area residents and visitors,
and would not disproportionately impact minority or low-income populations in the project area.
NEPA Determination. The project would not result in indirect high and disproportionate adverse
impacts to any minority or low-income populations.
CEQA Determination. A CEQA determination is not applicable. This analysis has been prepared to
specifically address federal environmental justice analysis requirements.
Construction Impacts
The No Action Alternative would not result in any physical changes to the Ferry Terminal, and no
construction activities would be required. Therefore, there would be no high and disproportionate adverse
impacts to any minority or low-income populations during construction.
Impact 3.17-3: Potential to Result in Disproportionately High or Adverse Impacts on
Minority or Low-Income Populations During Construction
Most of the construction impacts would occur in the immediate project vicinity or adjacent offshore areas,
where there is no residential community. Because there are no minority or low-income populations
residing in the area where project impacts would be experienced, these impacts would not be borne
disproportionately by minority or low-income populations.
NEPA Determination. Project construction would not result in high and disproportionate adverse
impacts to any minority or low-income populations.
CEQA Determination. A CEQA determination is not applicable. This analysis has been prepared to
specifically address federal environmental justice analysis requirements.
Cumulative Impacts
Because the project would not cause any high and disproportionate adverse impacts to any minority or
low-income populations, it would not contribute to cumulative impacts to any minority or low-income
populations in the study region.
NEPA Determination. The project would not contribute to cumulative impacts to any minority or lowincome populations in the study region.

REGIONAL GROWTH

3.18.1 Introduction to the Analysis
The proposed project would not result in construction of any new homes or businesses, or removal of any
existing constraints to growth. It is in a predominately built-out area on the San Francisco waterfront that
currently functions as a ferry terminal, serving existing (and future proposed) commuter water transit
services that generally bring residents from other parts of the Bay Area to jobs and commercial facilities
in the downtown San Francisco area. Construction would not result in employment demand substantial
enough to stimulate population growth, and there would be no substantial permanent increase in
employment resulting from the project; therefore, there would be no direct, indirect, or cumulative
growth-inducement impacts associated with the project.
3.18.2 Affected Environment
This section describes regional population and employment growth trends and projections for the ninecounty San Francisco Bay Area. The nine Bay Area counties are Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa,
San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma.
Existing Conditions
Population
Table 3.18-1 presents information on population trends and projections in the nine Bay Area counties.
The region’s population increased by about 8.2 percent, from 6.8 million in 2000 to 7.3 million in 2010.
It is expected to increase by an additional 24 percent, to exceed 9.0 million by 2035 (ABAG, 2009b).

Employment
Over the past several decades, the Bay Area economy has been subject to several boom and bust cycles
associated with the “dot.com” or Internet bubble, the real estate credit bubble, and nationwide economic
recessions. The Bay Area labor force has fluctuated over the past decade, from 3.74 million in 2000, to
3.54 million in 2004-2005, to 3.68 million in 2009. The number of employed residents of the Bay Area

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

peaked in 2000 at 3.61 million, but declined by 8.4 percent, to 3.31 million in 2009. During the same
time period, unemployment rates increased sharply in the region, from around 4 percent in 2000, to
10.1 percent in 2009 (SF Planning, 2010).
Due to the national economic recession, the total number of jobs declined between 2000 and 2010, from
3.7 million to 3.5 million (ABAG, 2009b). Jobs are expected to increase, however, from approximately
3.5 million in 2010 to more than 4.7 million by 2030 (ABAG, 2009b). Over this time period, the Health
and Education Services sector is expected to displace Manufacturing and Wholesale as the sector
employing the most Bay Area residents.
Regulatory Framework
Federal
The Council on Environmental Quality National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations define
“indirect effects” to include “growth-inducing effects and other effects related to induced changes in the
pattern of land use, population density, or growth rate” (40 Code of Federal Regulations 1508,8[b]).
State
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires that environmental documents “discuss the
ways in which the proposed project could foster economic or population growth, or the construction of
additional housing, either directly or indirectly, in the surrounding environment” (CEQA Guidelines,
Section 15126.2[d]).
3.18.3 Impact Evaluation
The project would be considered to have an adverse impact under NEPA, or a significant impact under
CEQA, if it is determined that it would induce population growth in the project area or the region. The
project could induce growth if the labor requirements could not be filled by the existing regional labor
force; if it results in a permanent expansion of the local built environment that increases the capacity for
population growth; or if it removes existing constraints to population growth. If it is determined that the
project could be growth-inducing, associated impacts on local housing resources would be evaluated.
Direct Impacts
Impact 3.18-1: Potential to Induce Population Growth
No Action Alternative
The No Action Alternative would not involve any improvements to existing facilities at the Downtown
San Francisco Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal). All planned new and expanded routes would be
accommodated at the existing Ferry Terminal facilities. No homes or businesses would be affected, and
there would be no demand for labor associated with this alternative. The No Action Alternative would
not result in increased population growth, or remove constraints to growth; therefore, it would not be
growth-inducing.
Action Alternative
The Programmatic Environmental Impact Report for the Water Emergency Transportation Authority’s
(WETA’s) Implementation and Operations Plan indicated that adding new water transit services could be
growth-inducing for areas near new terminals, because new residents could be attracted to terminal areas
as a result of perceived quality-of-life improvement, or perceived increased job opportunities afforded by
expanded water transit services (WETA, 2003a). Such impacts would be limited, because the new

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

terminals would be located in areas that are currently developed with urban uses, or planned for future
urban development. Such impacts would be addressed when the planning staff of local jurisdictions make
land use and zoning decisions for new terminals. In addition, each new specific water transit route would
be subject to independent impact analysis. The Ferry Terminal is an existing terminal that serves the
needs of existing and new planned commuter water transit services. As such, it is primarily the
destination for commuters coming to San Francisco from other Bay Area locations to access jobs or
commercial amenities in the city. The Action Alternative would not result in the types of impacts
described above from the Programmatic Environmental Impact Report, because it would not generate
substantial new demand for travel from San Francisco to other destinations, and because it is located in a
waterfront area that is predominately built out. Additional development in the waterfront area would be
regulated by the plans and policies described in Section 3.3, Land Use and Land Use Planning.
Project operation would not result in any permanent increase in employment. As described in
Section 2.3.6, Operating Elements, no additional employees would be required at the Ferry Terminal. All
current and future WETA vessels will be stocked and serviced at other terminal locations. Vessel crews
would also board in the outlying terminal locations. Therefore, the project would not cause an inmigration of new workers to San Francisco to fill new jobs.
The project would result in new facilities and amenities at the Ferry Terminal, but it does not include
development of any new housing units, nor would it affect any existing constraints to growth and
development such as scarcity of buildable land, planning and zoning controls, or availability of sewer or
water services. It would improve the efficiency with which planned water transit services and ferry
passengers could be accommodated, as well as improving response to emergency planning requirements.
The people using the Ferry Terminal facilities on a daily basis are likely to be persons who already live in
the region, and would prefer an alternative to commuting by car or by bus, rather than new residents who
are attracted to the region because of improvements to the Ferry Terminal facilities. Therefore, project
construction and operation would not be considered growth-inducing.
NEPA Determination. Project operation would not have adverse impacts related to regional growth.
CEQA Determination. The proposed project would have less-than-significant direct impacts to regional
growth.
Indirect Impacts
No Action Alternative
The No Action Alternative would maintain existing Ferry Terminal gate configuration and circulation
areas. No new gates would be constructed. There would be no circulation and public space
improvements, and boarding improvements to respond to emergency planning requirements would not be
made, but all programmed improvements identified in the Regional Transportation Plan would be
implemented. Because the No Action Alternative would have no direct impacts on regional growth, it
would cause no indirect impacts to regional growth.
Action Alternative
Some indirect and induced economic effects would occur as a result of the project, but such impacts
would be negligible in the context of the regional economy. The project would not result in employment
demand substantial enough to stimulate population growth; therefore, there would be no indirect growthinducement impacts associated with the project.

3.0 Affected Environment,
Consequences, and Mitigation

Construction Impacts
The No Action Alternative would not result in any physical changes to the Ferry Terminal, and no
construction activities would be required. Therefore, there would be no construction impacts to regional
growth.
Impact 3.18-2: Potential for Construction to Induce Population Growth
The proposed project would involve a relatively small construction workforce (described in
Section 2.4.7), and the Bay Area has a relatively large resident labor force, with the skills and availability
to meet all of the projected construction workforce needs. Project construction would not induce
substantial population growth, because construction jobs would be filled by the existing, relatively large,
and diversified labor force available in the Bay Area, thereby avoiding substantial relocation to fill
temporary construction positions.
NEPA Determination. The proposed project would not have adverse impacts to regional growth due to
construction.
CEQA Determination. The proposed project would have less-than-significant impacts to regional
growth due to construction.
Cumulative Impacts
Impact 3.18-3: Potential to Result in Cumulative Impacts on Regional Growth
The proposed Ferry Terminal improvements would not contribute to cumulative growth-inducement
impacts, because the project itself would not be growth-inducing. Because the project does not include
any new home construction, it would not contribute to the expansion of existing housing resources, or the
associated incremental increase in population. Because the project would serve the needs of the existing
regional population, rather than stimulate regional population growth, it would not contribute to
cumulative growth-inducement effects of other projects.
NEPA Determination. The project would not contribute to adverse cumulative regional growth impacts.
CEQA Determination. The project would not contribute to cumulative regional growth impacts.
3.18.4 Mitigation Measures
No growth inducement impacts were identified; therefore, no mitigation measures are recommended.

CHAPTER 4

4.0 Other CEQA/NEPA
Considerations

OTHER CEQA/NEPA CONSIDERATIONS

ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE/SUPERIOR ALTERNATIVE

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires that “the alternative or alternatives which were
considered to be environmentally preferable be identified. Environmentally preferable is defined as the
alternative that will promote the national environmental policy expressed in Section 101 of the National
Policy Act, meaning the alternative that causes the least damage to the biological and physical
environment. In addition, it also means the alternative that best protects, preserves, and enhances historic,
cultural and natural resources” (CEQ, 1981). Although Council on Environmental Quality regulations
require the identification of the environmentally preferred alternative, it is not required that this
alternative be adopted.
The national environmental policy expressed in Section 101 of NEPA includes the following goals:







Fulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding
generations;
Ensure for all Americans safe, healthful, productive, and aesthetically and culturally pleasing
surroundings;
Attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation, risk of health or
safety, or other undesirable and unintended consequences;
Preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage; and maintain,
wherever possible, an environment that supports diversity and variety of individual choice;
Achieve a balance between population and resource use that will permit high standards of living and a
wide sharing of life’s amenities; and
Enhance the quality of renewable resources, and approach the maximum attainable recycling of
depletable resources (NEPA, Section 101[b]).

The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) does not provide specific direction regarding the
methodology of comparing alternatives and the proposed project. Each project must be evaluated for the
issues and impacts that are most important; this will vary depending on the project type and the
environmental setting.
The CEQA Guidelines (Section 15126.6[e][2]) state that “If the environmentally superior alternative is
the “No Project” alternative, the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) shall also identify an
environmentally superior alternative among the other alternatives.”
Under the No Action Alternative, there would be no implementation of facility improvements at the
Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal (Ferry Terminal). Therefore, only a small increase in water
transit service (i.e., only service that could be accommodated at the existing two gates that the Water
Emergency Transportation Authority (WETA) has access to) could be safely accommodated at the Ferry
Terminal over the long term. In addition, in the event of an emergency, WETA vessels deployed for
evacuation purposes would be required to use the existing two gates at the Ferry Terminal available to
WETA (Gates B and E). Existing Ferry Terminal and San Francisco Ferry Building (Ferry Building)
areas would be used for staging of evacuees (e.g., areas along The Embarcadero or the Ferry Plaza),
which are not built to Essential Facilities standards. 1 If areas of the Ferry Terminal not built to Essential
Facilities standards fail, or otherwise cannot be safely accessed, passengers would need to be staged

1

As defined by the California Building Code 2010 and the International Building Code 2009, Essential Facilities are buildings
and other structures that are intended to remain operational in the event of extreme environmental loading from flood, wind,
snow, or earthquakes.

Considerations

elsewhere, and alternative access to vessels would need to be provided, potentially hindering evacuation
activities.
The Action Alternative would accommodate the full expansion of water transit service outlined in
WETA’s Implementation and Operations Plan for the San Francisco Bay Area, by constructing three new
gates, overwater berthing facilities, and supportive landslide improvements (such as additional passenger
waiting and queuing areas, and circulation improvements). In addition, improvements constructed under
the Action Alternative would all be constructed to Essential Facilities standards, to ensure that the
improved circulation areas (e.g., the new Embarcadero Plaza) would be available for emergency
operations and evacuee queuing, if necessary.
Although the No Action Alternative would not result in any physical impacts to the environment, it would
not meet the purpose and need of the project; and over the long term, it would not improve alternative
transportation and emergency operations in the Bay Area. The No Action Alternative would not
accommodate the projected increases in transbay water transit trips that would help alleviate congestion
over the Bay Bridge and through the Bay Area Rapid Transit Transbay Tube. Furthermore, the No
Action Alternative would not address WETA and the Port of San Francisco’s emergency operation needs.
In addition, the No Action Alternative would be inconsistent with several of the plans and policies
adopted for the Ferry Terminal area that encourage an expansion in water transit services, and
improvements to public access and open space. Therefore, the No Action Alternative would not be
considered an environmentally preferred/superior alternative over the long term.
The Action Alternative would meet the purpose and need of the project. The only significant,
unavoidable, and adverse impacts that would result from implementation of the Action Alternative, in the
short or long term, would be transportation and circulation impacts, as described in Section 3.2. All other
impacts identified for the Action Alternative would be negligible, less than significant and not adverse, or
less than significant and not adverse with the implementation of mitigation measures. As described in
Section 2.7 of this document, other alternatives to the project have been previously evaluated. However,
these alternatives were found not to meet the project purpose and need, to not be feasible, to not be
consistent with other plans, or to exceed projected funding. A majority of the adverse impacts that would
result from the Action Alternative would be temporary construction impacts, which would be outweighed
by the long-term benefits of project implementation. The Action Alternative best meets the goals listed in
NEPA Section 101 because it facilitates beneficial use of the environment through water transit service,
without degradation or other undesirable consequences. Furthermore, it preserves important historic
aspects of our national heritage and achieves a balance between population and resource use, permitting a
wide sharing of San Francisco Bay as an amenity (through expanded use of the Ferry Terminal), and
reducing the use of depletable resources.
Therefore, the Action Alternative, as designed and with incorporation of the recommended mitigations, is
considered to be the environmentally preferable/superior alternative.
4.2

IRREVERSIBLE AND IRRETRIEVABLE COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES

Under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1502.16, NEPA requires that an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) describe the irreversible and irretrievable resource commitments related to the use of
nonrenewable resources that could result from the implementation of the proposed project. Irreversible
effects would primarily result from the use or destruction of a specific resource, such as energy and
minerals that could not be replaced within a reasonable time frame. Irretrievable resource commitments
would involve the loss in value of an affected resource that could not be restored as a result of the action;
an example of this is the extinction of a threatened or endangered species, or the disturbance of a cultural
resource. The proposed project would require the commitment of resources; primarily, the use of
nonrenewable resources such as fossil fuels, water, labor, and electricity, for project construction and
operation.
R:\13 WETA\DTFX\Draft 0413\4_0 Other CEQA.docx

Page 4-2

June 2013

Water Emergency Transportation Authority
Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project EIS/EIR

4.0 Other CEQA/NEPA
Considerations

Construction activities would require the use of fossil fuels for the operation of vehicles and equipment.
Construction of the project would also require a commitment of a variety of other nonrenewable or slowly
renewable natural resources, such as construction materials. Use of raw building materials for
construction would be an irretrievable commitment of resources from which these materials are produced.
Commitment of labor and fiscal resources for construction and operation is considered irretrievable.
However, project operation may be a zero-net energy project. It would incorporate green building
approaches to the design of the new facilities, and potentially include photovoltaic cells into the canopies
at Gates A, B, E, F, and G. The project’s minor, incremental, increased use of these resources, however,
would not significantly increase the overall commitment of resources associated with water transit
operation in the Bay Area, or development within San Francisco. The project would involve only minor,
incremental use of nonrenewable resources, and would not prevent sustainable development.
An irreversible loss of special-status species could occur, should the project result in incidental take of
federally listed fish species. The proposed project may result in a potential incidental take of federally
listed salmonids if dredging must be extended outside of the work window. In addition, the proposed
project may result in potential incidental take of green sturgeon and longfin smelt, regardless of when
dredging is conducted. However, measures have been identified in Section 3.9 that would minimize
impacts to these species; therefore, an irretrievable loss of these species’ populations is not expected.
4.3

SIGNIFICANT UNAVOIDABLE IMPACTS

Under 40 CFR 1502.16, NEPA requires that an EIS include a description of any significant unavoidable
impacts for which no mitigation, or only partial mitigation, is feasible.
Section 15126(b) of the CEQA Guidelines requires that an EIR “describe any significant impact,
including those which can be mitigated, but not reduced to a level of insignificance. Where there are
impacts that cannot be alleviated without imposing an alternative design, their implications and the
reasons why the project is being proposed, notwithstanding their effect, should be described.”
Three potentially adverse and significant indirect impacts are identified Section 3.2, Transportation and
Circulation, related to the addition of riders to the Muni F Market and Wharves line in the PM peak hour,
and to pedestrian traffic congestion at three crosswalks along The Embarcadero. These impacts are
summarized below:


Impact 3.2-2: Potential Impacts to Transit in Existing Conditions. Under Existing Conditions,
the project’s addition of riders to the Muni F Market and Wharves in the PM peak hour would result
in this transit line operating under overcrowded conditions.



Impact 3.2-3: Potential Impacts to Pedestrian Facilities in Existing Conditions. Increases in
pedestrian circulation associated with the project under Existing Conditions would result in
substantial overcrowding for three study area crosswalks.



Impact 3.2-8: Potential Cumulative Impacts to Pedestrian Facilities in Future (2035)
Conditions. Increases in pedestrian circulation associated with the project under Future (2035) Plus
Project conditions would result in substantial overcrowding for three study area crosswalks.

As described in Section 3.2, mitigation measures have been identified that could reduce some of these
impacts. However, because there is uncertainty as to whether fully mitigating these impacts is feasible,
these impacts were conservatively considered adverse and significant in this EIS/EIR.

4.0 Other CEQA/NEPA
Considerations

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL SHORT-TERM USES OF THE ENVIRONMENT
AND LONG-TERM PRODUCTIVITY

Under 40 CFR 1502.16, NEPA requires that an EIS consider the relationship between local short-term
uses of the environment, and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity.
Implementing the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project (project) would result in
short-term construction-related impacts on water quality, biological resources, and air quality. In
addition, the proposed project would include short-term construction-related impacts from noise,
vibration, and construction traffic.
Additional short-term adverse impacts include the potential for an increase in turbidity, suspended solids,
and sedimentation during construction; the potential for accidental spills or seepage of hazardous
materials during construction; and fish entrapment or mortality from in-water construction.
However, these potential adverse effects would be minimized by implementing the mitigation measures
discussed in Chapter 3 for construction-related impacts. Moreover, these short-term impacts are expected
to be outweighed by long-term beneficial effects of the proposed terminal improvements to accommodate
WETA’s expanded services and emergency operation capabilities in the Bay Area.
The project would result in a net increase of 345 square feet (0.008 acre) of permanent fill in San
Francisco Bay. The placement of piles would be in the existing Ferry Terminal area, which has a number
of structures already in place, and is considered a somewhat disturbed environment relative to other openwater portions of central San Francisco Bay. This small loss of benthic habitat would be considered
negligible in this environment. In addition, the new structures would be placed within the existing Ferry
Terminal area, where a number of overwater structures already exist. The increased area of shade that
would result from the project is small relative to the size of the surrounding open waters of San Francisco
Bay, and the impact on phytoplankton production and the food chain is expected to be negligible.
Therefore, the project would not be expected to impact the long-term productivity of the environment.

5.0 Public and Agency Involvement

PUBLIC AND AGENCY INVOLVEMENT

Since late 2010, several types of public and agency participation have occurred as a part of the project
design and the environmental review process, pursuant to the requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA), the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and 23 United States Code
(USC) 139. Among other requirements, 23 USC 139 mandates that the federal lead agency establish a
plan for coordinating public and agency participation in, and comment on, the environmental review
process for a project or category of projects. Stakeholders and public agencies, including those with
permitting authority for the project, have been engaged as indicated below.
From October through December 2010, prior to the initiation of the environmental review process, a
series of stakeholder interviews was conducted by the Water Emergency Transportation Authority
(WETA) and the design team. The purpose of this early outreach was to inform stakeholders about the
project, and obtain input relevant to the development of the preliminary project design.
Initiating the environmental review process, WETA and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
conducted a public and agency scoping process. The details of the scoping activities and comments
received are provided in the Scoping Summary Report, included as Appendix A, and summarized below.
As required by CEQA for the preparation of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR), WETA submitted a
Notice of Preparation and the accompanying Notice of Completion to the California State Clearinghouse
on March 24, 2011. The purpose of these notices was to alert potentially interested parties of the project,
and invite participation in the environmental review process, including public scoping. A condensed
scoping meeting notice, providing a brief project description, the dates for the public comment period and
scoping meetings, and a project site diagram indicating the location of the planned scoping meetings, was
also published in the San Francisco Examiner on March 31, 2011. In addition, project information was
provided to the publisher of Bay Crossings, who published a major article about the project in April 2011,
in both the printed and online editions of this periodical.
Pursuant to NEPA, the FTA published its Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) for the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project (project) in the Federal Register
on April 7, 2011. The Notice of Intent described the project purpose and need, location and
environmental setting, project alternatives, possible effects, and FTA procedures. The purpose of this
notice was also to alert potentially interested parties of the project, and invite participation in the
environmental review process, including public scoping.
In April 2011, copies of the scoping notice were mailed to approximately 500 interested parties, which
included owners and residents within 500 feet of the project area, Port of San Francisco (Port) tenants,
community organizations, public agencies and representatives, as well as a list of interested parties
developed in coordination with WETA and the Port. Scoping meetings were held on April 26, 2011, at
Pier 1, The Embarcadero, San Francisco, California. Approximately a dozen members of the public and
one agency staff representative attended the public and agency scoping meeting. Comments were
received at the meeting and throughout the scoping period, which ended on May 16, 2011.
WETA and FTA received three phone calls, three e-mail messages, and six letters during the scoping
period. Four of the correspondents were property owners, property managers, or tenants with real estate
interests in the project vicinity. Seven correspondents were public resource agencies. Copies of
electronic and printed mail correspondence received during the scoping period are included in the
Scoping Summary Report in Appendix A. In addition, another letter was received in February 2012. All
comments received, which are summarized in Table 5-1, were considered in the preparation of the
EIS/EIR.

Scoping Summary Report

INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE

The purpose of this report is to summarize the actions taken and results achieved during the scoping
process conducted to support the environmental analysis for the San Francisco Bay Area Water
Emergency Transportation Authority’s (WETA’s) Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion
Project. WETA is the local lead agency for this proposed project, and the Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) is the federal lead agency. The agencies determined that an Environmental Impact Statement/
Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR) would be jointly prepared to meet the requirements of both the
federal National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the California Environmental Protection Act
(CEQA).
The agencies performed a series of joint and separate actions to inform interested parties and members of
the public about the proposed project and to encourage comments on the scope of the planned
environmental analysis. The purpose of scoping is to solicit input from the public and agencies on the
appropriate scope, focus, and content of the environmental analysis. WETA and the FTA will consider
all of the input received during the scoping process in the preparation of the Draft EIS/EIR. The Draft
EIS/EIR will describe the existing environmental conditions of the area that could be affected by the
proposed project and evaluate the potential effects of the proposed project in accordance with CEQA and
NEPA. The comments provided by the public and agencies during scoping will help WETA and FTA to
identify pertinent issues, methods of analyses, and level of detail that should be addressed in the Draft
EIS/EIR. The scoping comments will also provide the basis for developing a reasonable range of feasible
alternatives that will be evaluated in the Draft EIS/EIR. In addition to facilitating public and regulatory
agency input on the scope and focus of the Draft EIS/EIR, scoping allows the lead agencies to explain the
environmental review process to the public, and to identify additional opportunities for public comment
and public involvement during the environmental review process.
Scoping activities were conducted during the spring of 2011. Information and outreach activities for the
project included publishing required notices through the California State Clearinghouse and in the Federal
Register, sending consultation letters to potentially interested resource agencies, publishing a scoping
notice in a local newspaper, mailing the notice to area residents and other interested parties, holding a
formal public comment period, conducting Scoping Meetings, and other measures that are described and
documented in this report.
Section 2 contains a brief overview of the project. Section 3 contains information about the CEQA
Notice of Preparation (NOP). Section 4 contains information about the NEPA Notice of Intent (NOI) to
Prepare an EIS. Section 5 describes measures that were taken to invite resource agency participation in
the scoping process. Section 6 describes public outreach activities. Section 7 describes the scoping
meetings that took place on April 26, 2011, and Section 8 summarizes scoping comments that were
received outside of the scoping meetings. Report appendices include copies of the NOP and NOI, proof
of publication of the scoping notice, scoping meeting transcripts, and correspondence and comments
received.

Scoping Summary Report

PROJECT OVERVIEW

WETA is proposing expansion and improvements to the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal at the
Port of San Francisco (Port) Ferry Building (see Figure 1). The project would expand the number of ferry
gates, improve pedestrian circulation and ferry patron boarding, and enhance emergency response
capabilities to evacuate people from San Francisco in the event of a major catastrophic event.
The project has the following objectives:


Accommodate WETA’s projected increase in water transit ridership and related vessel arrivals and
departures from the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal;






Provide a viable alternative mode of transportation that accommodates projected increases in
transbay trips, and helps alleviate congestion over the Bay Bridge and through the San Francisco
Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Transbay Tube;

Address WETA and the Port of San Francisco’s (Port) emergency operation needs;


Establish a circulation plan and improved signage that provides clear pedestrian routes for ferry to
bus and ferry to rail transfers, as well as safe routes for bikes, emergency vehicles, and delivery
trucks to enter, park and exit the area;



Provide necessary landside improvements, such as designated weather-protected areas for waiting
and queuing, ticket machines and fare collection equipment, improved lighting, and improved
boarding and arrival/departure information to serve water transit passengers and to enhance the
Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal as the central hub for water transit services on San
Francisco Bay; and

Enhance the area’s public access and open space with design features that create attractive, safe
daytime and nighttime public spaces for both water transit passengers and other users of the Ferry
Building area.

The planned improvements build on improvements that were completed by the Port in 2003 (referred to
as Phase I of the Ferry Terminal Expansion Project). The first phase of this project (referred to as
Phase II), which would begin in 2014 and be completed by 2017, would consist of demolition of Pier ½
and Pier 2, construction of three new ferry gates, installation of amenities such as weather-protected areas
for queuing, improvements to pedestrian circulation, and filling of the lagoon for future use as a staging
area for evacuees in the event of a major catastrophe. Full build out (Phase III) of the proposed
improvements is contingent on potential ridership demand at full build out of the proposed Treasure
Island redevelopment, expected to occur sometime between 2020 and 2030.
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate current conditions and proposed improvements.

Scoping Summary Report

NOTICE OF PREPARATION, NOTICE OF COMPLETION

WETA submitted a NOP and the accompanying NOC to the State Clearinghouse on March 24, 2011.
These documents are required as part of the CEQA process, to notify potentially interested parties of the
project and the pending environmental analysis. The State Clearinghouse posts available documents on
their website and also distributes the NOP to state agencies as requested by WETA and noted on the
NOC. The NOP provides a brief description of the proposed project, identifies some of the environmental
issues to be analyzed in the review process, announces dates for the public comment period and scoping
meetings, and identifies project contacts for additional information.
Copies of the NOP and NOC are contained in Appendix A, along with documentation of their posting on
the State Clearinghouse website.

AGENCY OUTREACH

The FTA sent a series of letters to federal, state, and local resource agencies to invite their participation in
the environmental review process for the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project.
Section 6002 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users
establishes an enhanced environmental review process for certain FTA projects, increasing the
transparency of the process, as well as the opportunities for participation. The requirements of
Section 6002 apply to this project. As part of the environmental review process for this project, the lead
agencies must identify, as early as practicable, any other federal and nonfederal agencies that may have an
interest in the project, and invite such agencies to become participating agencies in the environmental
review process. Nine letters were mailed on April 7, 2011, and an additional six letters were mailed to
agency staff on April 18, 2011. Representatives of the following agencies were invited to participate in
the scoping and environmental review process for this project:


PROJECT MAILING LIST

Scoping Summary Report

A project mailing list was developed so that the scoping notice could be mailed to property owners,
residents, or tenants in the vicinity of the project area, as well as other interested parties. The Port
cooperated with WETA by providing a preliminary mailing list database containing the names of local
government and agency staff, committee members, and members of the public who had expressed recent
interest in other Port planning projects in the vicinity of the Ferry Building. FTA and WETA staff and
consultants reviewed this preliminary list and added names of other potentially interested parties, based
on their knowledge of the project vicinity and stakeholders who had previously participated in earlier
planning stages of the project. Direct Mail Center was contracted to prepare a list of all property owners
and residents, tenants, or occupants within a 300-foot radius of the project site. Direct Mail Center mailed
copies of the scoping notice to all parties on the final project mailing list, which included names and
addresses for approximately 500 interested parties.

SCOPING MEETINGS

Scoping meetings were held on April 26, 2011, in the Bayside Conference Rooms at Pier 1, The
Embarcadero, San Francisco, California. An interagency scoping meeting was scheduled from 2:00 p.m.
to 4:00 p.m. at this location, and a public scoping meeting was scheduled from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at
the same location.
Aside from WETA staff and consultants, only one agency staff representative attended the afternoon
interagency scoping meeting. Approximately a dozen members of the public attended the evening
scoping meeting. The sign-in sheet from the public scoping meeting is included as Appendix H. Full
transcripts of both meetings are contained in Appendix I. The paragraphs below present a brief summary
of questions raised and comments made at these two meetings.
7.1

AGENCY SCOPING MEETING

The agency scoping meeting opened at 2:00 p.m. Parties present included the following:
John Sindzinski, Manager, Planning and Development, WETA
Mike Gougherty, Project Manager, WETA
Chad Mason, Planner/Analyst, WETA
James Hurley, Planner, Port of San Francisco
Boris Dramov, President, ROMA Design Group
Ian Austin, URS Corporation
Julie Bixby, URS Corporation
Mara Feeney, Mara Feeney & Associates

Joshua Widmann, Associate Planner, Golden Gate Bridge and Transportation District
The meeting began with introductions and a presentation by John Sindzinski about the purpose of the
meeting, the CEQA/NEPA processes, WETA and FTA roles, and a discussion of the scoping process.
Mike Gougherty then presented a summary of project goals and objectives, and project purpose and need.
He explained the proposed project in the context of other projects that are currently in progress or planned
along the San Francisco waterfront. He reviewed the project schedule and a list of anticipated
environmental issues to be addressed in the environmental analysis. He then asked if there were any
questions or comments about the presentation.
Mr. Widmann asked a number of clarification questions pertaining to the various phases of the project
timeline. He asked if the environmental document would discuss transportation issues such as ferry trips
per day and ridership projections. He asked how much ridership was expected to increase in the future,
and he asked that impacts on bicycle parking be considered in the environmental analysis. The agency
scoping meeting was adjourned at 2:35 p.m.
A separate meeting was held on May 4, 2011 at the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)
offices in Santa Rosa because a NMFS representative was not able to attend the Agency Scoping meeting

Scoping Summary Report

Mike Gougherty provided an overview of the proposed Downtown Ferry Terminal Expansion Project as
described in the project Fact Sheet. Korie Schaeffer made the following comments: NMFS will need
details of the square footage of new bay cover associated with the project (e.g., piers, ramps, and floats),
of Bay fill removed (e.g.; Pier ½ and Pier 2) and of Bay covered (e.g., the BART construction hole). This
information will be needed for both Phase 2 and Phase 3 build-out. Also NMFS requested that the
environmental document consider potential impacts on Essential Fish Habitat and Endangered Species
Act species that NMFS’ regulatory authority requires it to assess including the following issues:
underwater sound, overwater shading, dredging, and marine mammals.
7.2

PUBLIC SCOPING MEETING

The public scoping meeting began at 5:30 p.m. in an Open House format, allowing members of the public
time to review display boards and aerial photographs that had been set up around the room. By 5:41 p.m.,
a small crowd of people had gathered to look at the display boards and seemed eager to hear the
presentation. WETA staff then opened the meeting with presentations similar to those that had been
made at the afternoon agency scoping meeting. Mike Gougherty invited questions about the presentation
materials before opening the meeting for public comments. There were several clarification questions on
the proposed project, about subjects such the ferry services that would be using particular future gates or
berths, and Golden Gate Ferry Service’s planned upgrades to their facilities.
Scoping comments made by members of the public requested that WETA and FTA:


include pedestrians and delivery vehicles in the circulation analysis;



consider how pile driving will affect shaking in surrounding buildings and plaza;



consider the weight-bearing capacity of the back plaza in an emergency situation (emergency vehicles
and many people present);



consider how to accommodate emergency vehicles and personnel (ambulance, fire, police) in the
circulation impact analysis;



analyze the impact of construction on local air quality and heating, venting, and air conditioning
systems in the project vicinity;



consider noise impacts (e.g., pile driving) on adjacent offices and apartment buildings;



consider the effect of tides, currents, wind, storm conditions, and other vessel traffic (both
commercial and noncommercial—e.g., kayaks and boats) as part of the navigation and safety impact
analysis.

The meeting ended at 6:30 p.m. Photos 1 through 4 were taken during the public scoping meeting.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Project Location
The project is located in the northeastern section of San Francisco, California, at the San
Francisco Ferry Building, situated at the foot of Market Street. The study area encompasses Port
of San Francisco property between Pier 1 on the north and Pier 14 on the south, and includes the
Ferry Building, ferry gates, and the Ferry Plaza.
Project Purpose and Need
The purpose of the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project is to support and
expand ferry service on San Francisco Bay, as established by WETA in its Implementation and
Operations Plan, and in accordance with city and regional policies to encourage transit use.
Furthermore, the project will address deficiencies in the transportation network that impede ferry

Page 2 of 5

Notice of Preparation

operation and ferry patron access and circulation at the Downtown San Francisco Ferry
Terminal. The project objectives include:


Accommodate WETA’s projected increase in ferry ridership and related ferry
arrivals and departures from the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal;



Provide a viable alternative mode of transportation that accommodates projected
increases in transbay trips, and helps alleviates congestion over the Bay Bridge
and through the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Transbay Tube;



Address WETA’s and the Port of San Francisco’s (Port) emergency response
needs;



Establish a circulation plan and improved signage that provides clear pedestrian
routes for ferry to bus and ferry to rail transfers, as well as safe routes for bikes,
emergency vehicles, and delivery trucks to enter, park and exit the area;



Provide necessary landside improvements, such as designated weather-protected
areas for waiting and queuing, ticket machines and fare collection equipment,
improved lighting, and improved boarding and arrival/departure information to
serve ferry patrons and to enhance the Ferry Building as the central point of
embarkation for ferries on San Francisco Bay; and



Enhance the area’s public access and open space with design features that create
attractive, safe daytime and nighttime public spaces for both ferry patrons and
other users of the Ferry Building area.

WETA recognizes and supports the Port’s land use planning and development proposals in and
around the Ferry Building, including the historic renovation of the Agricultural Building and
other improvements in the Ferry Building area. These Port initiatives are being planned and
funded independent of the WETA project and, as a result, are not included as project elements.
WETA will stage construction, and manage and operate ferry services so they do not preclude,
conflict with, or inhibit the Port’s proposed development plans in the project vicinity.
Proposed Project Components
The proposed project incorporates modifications and improvements to the Ferry Terminal gates
and ferry boarding areas to accommodate future WETA service and increased ferry patronage.
The current estimate for 2025 projected daily ridership at the Ferry Terminal is approximately
35,000 passengers. The ridership projections account for existing service, plus new ferry
services from downtown San Francisco to Berkeley, Treasure Island, Hercules, Richmond,
Redwood City, Martinez, and Antioch to be initiated between 2014 and 2030. Service
frequencies during the day and evenings would reflect the travel demand for commute and nonPage 3 of 5

Downtown San Francisco

Notice of Preparation

commute periods. Existing ferry services operated by others (i.e., ferry service to Sausalito,
Larkspur, and Tiburon), and existing services operated by WETA (i.e., ferry service to Vallejo,
Alameda/Oakland, and Alameda Harbor Bay) would continue to operate, but the access and
boarding environments for these services would be improved by the project.
In addition, landside improvements to allow staging and circulation for possible emergency
evacuation at the Ferry Building are included in the proposed project. The modifications and
improvements are the responsibility of WETA in cooperation with the Port of San Francisco,
with funding coming from Regional Measure 2, State Proposition 1B, and FTA.
The WETA-sponsored improvements represent sequential construction phases (Phase 2 and
Phase 3). The Phase 2 and Phase 3 improvements build on those elements already completed by
the Port in 2003 during Phase 1. Phase 2, which is expected to be completed by 2017, will
include:


Demolition and removal of Pier ½ and Pier 2;



Construction of Gate A in the north basin, and Gates F and G in the south basin;



Installation of boarding area amenities such as weather-protected areas for
queuing, ticket machines and fare collection equipment, improved lighting, and
ferry boarding and arrival/departure information signs;



Widening of ferry access pathways along existing pedestrian promenades, and
separation of ferry patron queuing from other pedestrian and vehicular
movements where possible;



Improved wayfinding signage in the vicinity of the Ferry Building, which will
indicate ferry boarding areas and transit connections; and



Filling in the lagoon to prepare for and accommodate staging and circulation of
evacuees following a catastrophic event.

As new ferry gates are constructed, existing ferry services would relocate to the new gates. Pier
demolition and construction activities would be staged and sequenced to allow for the continuity
of existing ferry services during construction. Demolition of Pier ½ would precede construction
of Gate A. Similarly, demolition of Pier 2 would precede construction of Gate F. Gate G, which
is designated for ferry services not expected to operate until 2020 or later, would serve as a
vessel layover location, temporary storage area, and emergency boarding location in the interim.
WETA’s capital improvement plan synchronizes the purchase or leasing of vessels to meet
future service and emergency response requirements.

Notice of Preparation

Phase 3 is contingent on the implementation of the Treasure Island Redevelopment Plan. At full
build-out, expected to occur sometime between 2020 and 2030, new commercial, recreational,
and residential facilities on Treasure Island would require additional ferry capacity to serve
substantial numbers of visitors and residents. The additional capacity would be provided by
larger, bow-loading vessels purchased by the Treasure Island developer, and operated by WETA.
The bow-loading vessels would necessitate the redesign of Gate E to accommodate the larger
ferries.
Possible Impacts
The purpose of this EIR process is to study, in a public setting, the potentially significant effects
of the proposed project on the environment. Primary areas of investigation for this project
include, but are not limited to: land use, development potential, displacements, historic
resources, visual and aesthetic qualities, air quality, noise and vibration, dredging and bay fill
requirements, hazardous materials resulting from demolition and construction activities, traffic
circulation and transportation linkages, pedestrian circulation, safety, security, and emergency
response, bay habitat, and cumulative impacts. The environmental analysis may reveal that the
proposed project will not impact or have significant impacts to many of those areas. However, if
any environmental impacts are identified, measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate those impacts
will be proposed.

responsibility for the incidents on the
acts or omissions of any person or
entity.
Two railroad employees, while each
riding the side of rolling equipment to
protect a shoving movement, were
fatally injured (in separate incidents)
when the equipment they were riding
struck other equipment that was left out
to foul. A common factor in both
accidents was that the equipment was
left in a location where it fouled an
adjacent track by the very employees
who were involved in the incidents.
The first incident occurred on
September 2, 2010, in Bridgeport, New
Jersey, when a conventional two-person
switching crew was shoving rolling
equipment into an industrial facility.
The locomotive engineer was in the
locomotive control compartment and
the conductor was positioned on the
leading end of a tank car directing the
shoving move. The conductor had one
foot on the end platform and the other
on the side ladder tread as he began to
pass a tank car that he had spotted at
that location the previous day.
Unfortunately, the car had been left in
the foul of the adjacent track and the
cars struck each other; the conductor
sustained fatal injuries.
The second incident occurred on
February 8, 2011, in Kankakee, Illinois.
A conventional switching crew that
consisted of a conductor, engineer, and
a conductor-in-training was switching
cars on a switching lead track and using
various other yard tracks. The crew had
left a car on one of the yard tracks in
a location where it was in the foul of an
adjacent track. Shortly thereafter, the
conductor and conductor-in-training
boarded opposite sides of the leading
end of a gondola car and began a
shoving movement. Subsequently, the
side of the gondola on which the
conductor was riding struck the car that
was previously left in the foul of the
adjacent track. The conductor was
crushed between the two cars and
sustained fatal injuries.
Although the preponderance of
incidents involving equipment that is
left in the foul of an adjacent track
fortunately only result in railroad
property damage, the potential for
injury or death in such instances is
always present. By issuing this safety
advisory, FRA is reminding all
stakeholders of the importance of
situational awareness and compliance
with all applicable operating and safety
rules, particularly those related to
leaving rolling equipment in a location
that is clear of adjacent tracks.
FRA Action: Despite the significant
reduction in train accidents caused by
equipment being left in the foul of an

VerDate Mar<15>2010

19:53 Apr 06, 2011

Jkt 223001

adjacent track, a review of FRA’s
inspection data relative to 49 CFR
218.101 indicates a disturbing trend.
From calendar year (CY) 2009 to CY
2010, violations of 49 CFR 218.101
recommended for prosecution by FRA
inspectors increased 124 percent. Based
on the results of inspection data for the
first 2 months of 2011, if trends
continue, violations recommended for
prosecution in 2011 versus 2010 would
increase by an additional 81 percent.
Whether the increase in violations is
due to greater vigilance by FRA or is
due to an actual increase in the number
of instances where equipment is being
left in such locations, FRA intends to
ensure that railroads take necessary
steps to prevent and reduce the
potential trend indicated by the
statistics noted above.
Over the next several months, FRA
intends to increase its inspection
activity to focus on compliance with
railroad operating rules that address all
of the requirements contained in
Subpart F. Particular emphasis will be
placed on the requirements contained in
49 CFR 218.101. FRA will also focus its
inspection efforts on railroad
operational testing activity, particularly
as it relates to Subpart F. FRA strongly
encourages railroad industry members
to reemphasize the importance of
leaving equipment in the clear as
frequently as possible, and to take such
other actions as may help ensure safety
on the Nation’s railroads.
Recommended Railroad Action: In
light of the recent accidents discussed
above, and in an effort to maintain the
safety of railroad employees on the
Nation’s rail system, FRA recommends
that railroads:
(1) Review with employees the
circumstances of the two most recent
fatal incidents;
(2) Reinstruct supervisors and
employees on the operating and safety
rules applicable to leaving rolling
equipment in a location that is clear of
adjacent tracks. Particular emphasis
should be placed on the procedures that
enable employees to identify clearance
points and the means to identify
locations where clearance points will
not permit a person to safely ride on the
side of a car;
(3) Increase operational testing on
those operating and safety rules that
pertain to leaving rolling equipment in
a location that is clear of adjacent tracks;
and
(4) Review current job briefing
procedures among coworkers and
determine if the procedures are
sufficient to encourage more effective
communication regarding switching
activities, specifically as the procedures

Frm 00213

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

relate to the positioning of rolling
equipment so that the equipment is in
a location that is clear of adjacent tracks.
FRA encourages railroad industry
members to take action that is consistent
with the preceding recommendations
and to take other actions to help ensure
the safety of the Nation’s railroad
employees. FRA may modify this Safety
Advisory 2011–01, issue additional
safety advisories, or take other
appropriate action necessary to ensure
the highest level of safety on the
Nation’s railroads, including pursing
other corrective measures under its rail
safety authority.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Scoping
The FTA and WETA invite all
interested individuals and
organizations, public agencies, and
Native American Tribes to comment on
the scope of the EIS, including the
project’s purpose and need, the
alternatives to be studied, the impacts to
be evaluated, and the evaluation
methods to be used. Comments should
address (1) feasible alternatives that may
better achieve the project’s need and

VerDate Mar<15>2010

19:53 Apr 06, 2011

Jkt 223001

purposes with fewer adverse impacts,
and (2) any significant environmental
impacts relating to the alternatives.
NEPA ‘‘scoping’’ (Title 40 of the CFR
1501.7) has specific and fairly limited
objectives, one of which is to identify
the significant issues associated with
alternatives that will be examined in
detail in the document, while
simultaneously limiting consideration
and development of issues that are not
truly significant. It is in the NEPA
scoping process that potentially
significant environmental impacts—
those that give rise to the need to
prepare an environmental impact
statement—should be identified;
impacts that are deemed not to be
significant need not be developed
extensively in the context of the impact
statement, thereby keeping the
statement focused on impacts of
consequence consistent with the
ultimate objectives of the NEPA
implementing regulations—‘‘to make the
environmental impact statement process
more useful to decision makers and the
public; and to reduce paperwork and
the accumulation of extraneous
background data, in order to emphasize
the need to focus on real environmental
issues and alternatives… [by requiring]
impact statements to be concise, clear,
and to the point, and supported by
evidence that agencies have made the
necessary environmental analyses.’’
Executive Order 11991, of May 24, 1977.
Once the scope of the environmental
study, including significant
environmental issues to be addressed, is
settled, a scoping report will be
prepared that: (1) Documents the results
of the scoping process; (2) contributes to
the transparency of the process; and (3)
provides a clear roadmap for concise
development of the environmental
document.
Purpose and Need for the Project
The purpose of the Downtown San
Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion
Project is to support and expand ferry
service on San Francisco Bay, as
established by WETA in its
Implementation and Operations Plan
(IOP), and in accordance with city and
regional policies to encourage transit
use. Furthermore, the project will
address deficiencies in the
transportation network that impede
ferry operation and ferry patron access
and circulation at the Downtown San
Francisco Ferry Terminal. The project
objectives include:
• Accommodate WETA’s projected
increase in ferry ridership and related
ferry arrivals and departures from the
Downtown San Francisco Ferry
Terminal;

PO 00000

Frm 00214

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

• Provide a viable alternative mode of
transportation that accommodates
projected increases in transbay trips,
and helps alleviates congestion over the
Bay Bridge and through the Bay Area
Rapid Transit (BART) Transbay Tube;
• Address WETA’s and the Port of
San Francisco’s (Port) emergency
response needs;
• Establish a circulation plan and
improved signage that provides clear
pedestrian routes for ferry to bus and
ferry to rail transfers, as well as safe
routes for bikes, emergency vehicles,
and delivery trucks to enter, park and
exit the area;
• Provide necessary landside
improvements, such as designated
weather-protected areas for waiting and
queuing, ticket machines and fare
collection equipment, improved
lighting, and improved boarding and
arrival/departure information to serve
ferry patrons and to enhance the Ferry
Building as the central point of
embarkation for ferries on San Francisco
Bay; and
• Enhance the area’s public access
and open space with design features
that create attractive, safe daytime and
nighttime public spaces for both ferry
patrons and other users of the Ferry
Building area;
• Recognize the Port’s land use
planning and development proposals in
and around the Ferry Building so as not
to preclude, conflict with, or inhibit
proposed development plans in the
project vicinity.
WETA recognizes and supports the
Port of San Francisco’s land use
planning and development proposals in
and around the Ferry Building,
including the historic renovation of the
Agricultural Building and
enhancements to the Ferry Plaza area.
These Port initiatives are being planned
and funded independent of the WETA
project and, as a result, are not included
as project elements. WETA will stage
construction and manage and operate
ferry services so they do not preclude,
conflict with, or inhibit the Port’s
proposed development plans in the
project vicinity.
Project Location and Environmental
Setting
The project is located in the
northeastern section of San Francisco,
California, at the San Francisco Ferry
Building, situated at the foot of Market
Street. The study area encompasses Port
of San Francisco property between Pier
1 on the north and Pier 14 on the south,
and includes the Ferry Building, ferry
gates, and the Ferry Plaza.

Possible Alternatives
A study of potential ferry terminal
improvements at the San Francisco
Ferry Building was completed by the
Port in 1994. The planning process,
summarized in the Downtown San
Francisco Ferry Terminal Project,
Concept Design—Stage 1 Final Report,
addressed deficiencies in the circulation
of pedestrians across the Embarcadero
and through the Ferry Building;
constraints imposed by previous design
modifications of the Ferry Building that
obscured wayfinding to the ferry gates;
limited opportunities for public
gathering and access to the Bay; and
restricted commercial development
within the building. A variety of design,
configuration, and circulation
improvements were considered. The
Port selected those improvements that
best met its long-term public service and
facility objectives, and completed those
projects, including construction of Gates
B and E and the south basin breakwater
at Pier 14, as Phase 1 of the Downtown
San Francisco Ferry Terminal Project in
2003. This project builds on the
previous improvements, described
under the Action Alternative below. In
addition to the Action Alternative,
WETA considers the effects of doing
nothing, identified as the No Action
Alternative. Both the Action and No
Action Alternatives are being
considered in the EIS, as described
below.
No Action Alternative. Six ferry
routes currently serve the Downtown
San Francisco Ferry Terminal. Today,
the Downtown San Francisco Ferry
Terminal has approximately 130 ferry
arrivals and departures daily, serving
more than 10,000 daily ferry patrons.
The existing Ferry Terminal gate
configuration serves current ferry
operations and provides the circulation
areas to access these gates. The No
Action Alternative maintains the
existing ferry services, gate
configuration, and circulation areas,
including the function, uses, and design
of the Ferry Building, which also serves
as an important public space in San
Francisco. No new gates or additional
boarding capacity to accommodate new
ferry services would occur as part of the
No Action Alternative. Similarly,
circulation and boarding improvements
to respond to emergency planning
requirements would not be
implemented.
The No Action Alternative retains
vehicle circulation and drop-off areas
near the Ferry Building as well as the
current circulation patterns for ferry
patrons to access the ferry boarding
areas. Pedestrian pathways to boarding

19:53 Apr 06, 2011

Jkt 223001

locations for San Francisco Municipal
Railway (Muni) bus and streetcar lines
and the Amtrak bus would remain
unchanged. Programmed Transbay bus
and rail transit improvements identified
in the Regional Transportation Plan
would be implemented as part of the No
Action Alternative. This alternative
serves as the baseline against which the
environmental effects of the other
alternatives are measured.
Action Alternative. The Action
Alternative incorporates modifications
and improvements to the Ferry
Terminal gates and ferry boarding areas
to accommodate future WETA service
and increased ferry patronage. Current
estimates for 2025 projected daily
ridership at the Ferry Terminal are
approximately 35,000 passengers. The
ridership projections account for
existing service, plus new ferry services
from downtown San Francisco to
Berkeley, Treasure Island, Hercules,
Richmond, Redwood City, Martinez,
and Antioch to be initiated between
2014 and 2030. Service frequencies
during the day and evenings would
reflect the travel demand for commute
and non-commute periods. Existing
services operated by others (i.e.,
Sausalito, Larkspur, and Tiburon), and
existing services operated by WETA
(i.e., Vallejo, Alameda/Oakland, and
Alameda Harbor Bay) would remain, but
the access and boarding environments
for these services would be improved by
the project.
In addition, landside improvements to
allow staging and circulation for
possible emergency evacuation at the
Ferry Building are included in the
Action Alternative. The modifications
and improvements are the responsibility
of WETA in cooperation with the Port
of San Francisco, with funding coming
from Regional Measure 2, State
Proposition 1B, and FTA.
The WETA-sponsored improvements
represent sequential construction
phases (Phase 2 and Phase 3). As noted
previously, the Phase 2 and Phase 3
improvements build on those elements
already completed by the Port in 2003
during Phase 1. Phase 2, which is
expected to be completed by 2017, will
include:
• Demolition and removal of Pier c
and Pier 2;
• Construction of Gate A in the north
basin, and Gates F and G in the south
basin;
• Installation of boarding area
amenities such as weather-protected
areas for queuing, ticket machines and
fare collection equipment, improved
lighting, and ferry boarding and arrival/
departure information signs;

PO 00000

Frm 00215

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

19521

• Widening of ferry access pathways
along existing pedestrian promenades,
and separation of ferry patron queuing
from other pedestrian and vehicular
movements where possible;
• Improved wayfinding signage in the
vicinity of the Ferry Building, which
will indicate ferry boarding areas and
transit connections; and
• Filling in the lagoon to prepare for
and accommodate staging and
circulation of evacuees following a
catastrophic event.
As new ferry gates are constructed,
existing ferry services would relocate to
new gates. Pier demolition and
construction activities would be staged
and sequenced to allow continuity of
existing ferry services during
construction. Demolition of Pier 1⁄2
would precede construction of Gate A.
Similarly, demolition of Pier 2 would
precede construction of Gate F. Gate G,
which is designated for ferry services
not expected to operate until 2020 or
later, would serve as a vessel layover
location, temporary storage area, and
emergency boarding location in the
interim. WETA’s capital improvement
plan synchronizes the purchase or
leasing of vessels to meet future service
and emergency response requirements.
Phase 3 is contingent on the
implementation of the Treasure Island
Redevelopment Plan. At full build-out,
expected to occur sometime between
2020 and 2030, new commercial,
recreational, and residential facilities on
Treasure Island would require
additional ferry capacity to serve
substantial numbers of visitors and
residents. The additional capacity
would be provided by larger, bowloading vessels purchased by the
Treasure Island developer, and operated
by WETA. The bow-loading vessels
would necessitate the redesign of Gate
E to accommodate the larger ferries.
Possible Effects
The purpose of this EIS process is to
study, in a public setting, the potentially
significant effects of the proposed
project on the quality of the human
environment. Primary areas of
investigation for this project include,
but are not limited to: land use,
development potential, displacements,
historic resources, visual and aesthetic
qualities, air quality, noise and
vibration, dredging and bay fill
requirements, hazardous materials
resulting from demolition and
construction activities, traffic
circulation and transportation linkages,
pedestrian circulation, safety, security,
and emergency response, bay habitat,
and cumulative impacts. The
environmental analysis may reveal that

19522

the proposed project will not affect, or
affect substantially, many of those areas.
However, if any adverse impacts are
identified, measures to avoid, minimize,
or mitigate those adverse impacts will
be proposed.

Downtown San Francisco
Ferry Terminal Expansion Project

Fact Sheet

April 2011

The San Francisco Bay Area Water Emergency Transportation Authority (WETA) is proposing expansion and improvements
to the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal at the Port of San Francisco Ferry Building (see project area figure). The
project would expand the number of ferry gates, improve pedestrian circulation and ferry patron boarding, and enhance
emergency response capabilities to evacuate people from San Francisco in the event of a major catastrophic event.
The project is located in the northeastern
section of San Francisco, California, at the San
Francisco Ferry Building, situated at the foot
of Market Street. The study area encompasses
Port of San Francisco property between Pier
1 on the north and Pier 14 on the south, and
includes the Ferry Building, ferry gates, and
the Ferry Plaza. The Downtown San Francisco
Ferry Terminal currently accommodates
six ferry routes serving more than 10,000
passengers with approximately 130 ferry
arrivals and departures daily. The proposed
project would make improvements to
gates and boarding areas to accommodate
anticipated increases in ferry ridership as new
ferry services from downtown San Francisco to
Berkeley, Treasure Island, Hercules, Richmond,
Redwood City, Martinez, and Antioch are
introduced between 2014 and 2030.

Phase 2 of the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project would begin in 2014 and be completed by 2017,
and would consist of demolition of Pier ½ and Pier 2, construction of three new ferry gates, installation of amenities such as
weather-protected areas for queuing, improvements to pedestrian circulation, and filling of the lagoon for future use as a
staging area for evacuees in the event of a major catastrophe. Full build-out of the proposed improvements is contingent
on potential ridership demand at full build-out of the proposed Treasure Island redevelopment, expected to occur
sometime between 2020 and 2030. A preliminary sketch of proposed improvements in shown below.

Environmental Review
As the federal and local Lead Agencies, respectively, the Federal Transit
Administration and WETA are preparing a joint Environmental Impact Statement/
Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR) to satisfy the requirements of the National
Environmental Policy Act and the California Environmental Quality Act. The
EIS/EIR will address potential impacts to land use, development potential,
displacements, historic resources, visual and aesthetic qualities, air quality, noise
and vibration, dredging and Bay fill requirements, hazardous materials resulting
from demolition and construction activities, traffic circulation and transportation
linkages, pedestrian circulation, safety, security, and emergency response, Bay
habitat, and cumulative impacts. The environmental analysis may reveal that
the proposed project will not affect, or affect substantially, many at those areas.
However, if any adverse impacts are identified, measures to avoid, minimize or
mitigate those adverse impacts will be proposed.
Opportunities for Public Involvement
A comprehensive public involvement program for public and interagency
involvement will be developed for the project and posted on WETA’s website:
http://www.watertransit.org. The public involvement program will include
maintaining the project webpage on the WETA website, and outreach to local
officials, community and civic groups, and the public. Scoping meetings will
be held in April 2011 to obtain comments on the scope of the environmental
analysis. Comments will also be accepted by mail. When the environmental
analysis is complete, the document will be circulated for public review and
comment prior to finalizing it.

DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO FERRY TERMINAL EXPANSION
PROJECT
About | Environmental Review | Opportunities for Public Involvement | Downloads and Public Notices
ABOUT THE PROJECT
The San Francisco Bay Area Water Emergency Transportation Authority (WETA) is proposing expansion and
improvements to the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal at the Port of San Francisco Ferry Building (see project
area figure below). WETA and the Port have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to undertake a
coordinated planning effort for the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion project in accordance with the
Port's objectives for stewardship of the San Francisco waterfront and WETA's mission to provide ferry service and
emergency operations (see MOU attached below). The project would expand the number of ferry gates, improve
pedestrian circulation and ferry patron boarding, and enhance emergency response capabilities to evacuate people
from San Francisco in the event of a major catastrophic event.

The project is located in the northeastern section of San Francisco, California, at the San Francisco Ferry Building,
situated at the foot of Market Street. The study area encompasses Port of San Francisco property between Pier 1 on
the north and Pier 14 on the south, and includes the Ferry Building, ferry gates, and the Ferry Plaza. The Downtown
San Francisco Ferry Terminal currently accommodates six ferry routes serving more than 10,000 passengers with
approximately 130 ferry arrivals and departures daily. The proposed project would make improvements to gates and
boarding areas to accommodate anticipated increases in ferry ridership as new ferry services from downtown San
Francisco to Berkeley, Treasure Island, Hercules, Richmond, Redwood City, Martinez, and Antioch are introduced
between 2014 and 2030.
The planned improvements build on improvements that were completed by the Port of San Francisco in 2003 (Phase
1). Phase 2 of the Downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project would begin in 2014 and be completed
by 2017, and would consist of demolition of Pier 1/2 and Pier 2, construction of three new ferry gates, installation of
amenities such as weather-protected areas for queuing, improvements to pedestrian circulation, and filling of the

lagoon for future use as a staging area for evacuees in the event of a major catastrophe. Full build-out of the proposed
improvements is contingent on potential ridership demand at full build-out of the proposed Treasure Island
redevelopment, expected to occur sometime between 2020 and 2030. A preliminary sketch of proposed improvements
in shown below.

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW
As the federal and local Lead Agencies, respectively, the Federal Transit Administration and WETA are preparing a joint
Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR) to satisfy the requirements of the National
Environmental Policy Act and the California Environmental Quality Act. A Notice of Intent (NOI) and Notice of
Preparation (NOP) have been prepared and are being circulated by FTA and WETA for the purpose of defining the
scope and content of the EIS/EIR. The EIS/EIR will address potential impacts to land use, development potential,
displacements, historic resources, visual and aesthetic qualities, air quality, noise and vibration, dredging and Bay fill
requirements, hazardous materials resulting from demolition and construction activities, traffic circulation and
transportation linkages, pedestrian circulation, safety, security, and emergency response, Bay habitat, and cumulative
impacts. The environmental analysis may reveal that the proposed project will not affect, or affect substantially, these
areas. However, if any adverse impacts are identified, measures to avoid, minimize or mitigate those adverse impacts
will be proposed.
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT
A comprehensive public involvement program for public and interagency involvement will be developed for the project
and made available on this website. The public involvement program will include maintaining this webpage and
outreach to local officials, community and civic groups, and the public. Comments on the scope of the environmental
analysis for this project will be accepted during public scoping meetings held on April 26, 2011, or may be submitted in
writing to WETA Project Manager, Mike Gougherty, by May 16, 2011. When the environmental analysis is complete, the
document will be circulated for public review and comment prior to finalizing it.

Under NEPA we have the Federal Transit Administration,

before we can secure that funding, we have to meet the

goals of the project.

2

not only the expansion of new services to the downtown

increase in ridership.

important goal is to address both to emergency response

improvements related to the BART leasehold on the

eastern end of the Ferry Plaza.

7

These

So this is a plan view of the existing

8

conditions.

And these include what was Phase 1 of the

9

Downtown Ferry Terminal Expansion Project.

It was

10

completed in 2003, as we mentioned previously, by the

11

Port of San Francisco and entailed the construction of

12

the existing Gate B, which today supports the Vallejo

13

and Tiburon ferry services to San Francisco, as well as

14

the construction of Gate E, which supports the Alameda,

15

Oakland and Harbor Bay ferry services to San Francisco.

16

In addition to the construction of the two new

17

ferry gates, there were several improvements made to

18

the deck and promenade spaces to support passenger

19

circulation.

20

undertaken by the Port, there was a future expansion

21

contemplated in the conceptual designs prepared. That

22

expansion wasn't part of the environmental analysis of

23

the project board or obviously part of the

construction.

phases, Phase 2 and Phase 3 which would represent

where the improvements are clustered, in the North Bay

required to support the future services to Berkeley and

Richmond that are being developed by WETA.

18

of the improvements required to build Gate A and

19

support the Berkeley and Richmond ferry services, we

20

would be removing the existing Pier 1/2, making some

21

minor improvements to the promenade to support

22

day-to-day commuter services, as well as adequate

23

waiting and queuing areas in the event of an emergency,

24

and some other improvements on the land side including

inclement weather in addition to add some organization

to the queueing and waiting areas for the ferry

services.
Moving to the south basin, we'll see the

existing Gate E remains.

As the Treasure Island

7

service that is being proposed as part of the Treasure

8

Island Redevelopment Project, and WETA would play a

9

role in supporting and providing that service, when

10

that service comes on line we'll need additional

11

berthing capacity in the south basin.
So the Treasure Island service in conjunction

12
13

with WETA's need for spare berthing capacity as well as

14

layover berthing capacity for its existing services

15

would really necessitate the construction of Gate F and

16

Gate G.

Currently, Alameda and Oakland operate out of

17

Gate E.

In the event that -- when these new gates are

18

constructed, we would actually transfer the

19

Alameda/Oakland services to Gate F and implement the

20

Treasure Island Services at Gate E.

21

construction of the two new ferry gates in the south

We're calling it fall 2012 in the schedule.

So before we open up for public comments in the

4

scope of the EIR/EIS, I'd just like to give everyone an

5

opportunity to kind of field any questions they have

6

about the presentation before we move to a more formal

7

documentation of the comments on the scope.

8
9
10

Were there any questions about phasing or the
concept designs presented today?
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:

Veronica?

Yes.

Mike, would you

11

just repeat the services that are coming in to Gate A?

12

You said Richmond, and what was the other service?

13

MR. GOUGHERTY:

14

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:

15
16

missed it.

Berkeley.
Berkeley.

I'm sorry, I

And then Gate G?

MR. GOUGHERTY:

Gate G would function as a

17

spare berthing facility well as a layover berthing

18

facility and potentially support other services that

19

are in various stages of development.

20

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:

And my last question,

21

can you offer any updates on the Golden Gate Ferry

22

project that's been in design for the last decade?

23

MR. GOUGHERTY:

It's really not part of our

24

project.

We have been in preliminary talks with them

25

as to where they are in the environmental review of the

project, but I'm just honestly not well-informed enough

2

about where they are in the project.

3

the projects that is considered in the cumulative

4

analysis of our project.

5

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:

6

MR. DOUGHERTY:

It will be one of

Oh, it will?

Mike, I was wondering if you

7

could outline for us the, for lack of a better word,

8

the real estate that Golden Gate has access to that we

9

do not infringe on in the basin there?

10

MR. GOUGHERTY:

11

readily available right now.

12

right now is really focus on the scope of the EIR/EIS,

13

really looking at potentially significant environmental

14

impacts that will need to be addressed in the draft

15

EIR/EIS.

16

at another point.

17

I don't have that information
What we'd like to do

I'd be happy to get that information to you

MS. CONNERS:

A question about the

18

environmental impacts with circulation.

Is that

19

including pedestrians, delivery vehicles?

20

of the bullet points.

21

MR. GOUGHERTY:

That was one

So I think it's kind of a good

22

opportunity to turn it really over to you guys to

23

submit your comments on what you would like to see

24

evaluated in the draft EIR/EIS.

25

respond to what we think should and shouldn't be

Not so much for us to

included, but for a chance for you to go on the record

2

and state what you feel should be included in the

3

scope.

4
5
6

With that understanding, if you would like to
formalize that in a comment.
MS CONNERS:

Jane Conners with the Ferry

7

Building.

I would definitely have concerns just about

8

the improvements impacting pedestrians, just habits and

9

what people are used to back there, and also obviously

10

vehicular with regard to our deliveries and stuff.

11

Those are my major concerns just to be considered

12

during the study.

13

MS. WISE:

My name is Ernestine Wise, and I'm

14

concerned with the area in the south side of the wall

15

where the statue is.

16

neglected.

17

Will that be included in your scheme?

18

The fencing along there is so

That whole area needs a lot of improvement.

MR. GOUGHERTY:

Is there a particular

19

environmental impact associated with that area that we

20

would need to address in the EIR/EIS?

21
22
23

MS. WISE:

It's part of the whole plan to

improve that area.
MR. GOUGHERTY:

The scope of our project right

24

now is really limited to the expansion of the Downtown

25

Ferry Terminal facilities, so that is not part of the

scope of the project at this point.

2

MS. WISE:

Okay.

3

MS. CONNERS:

Jane again from the Ferry

4

Building.

The potential pile driving to cover the

5

lagoon, just to look at a variety of how the pilings

6

would be driven down through the mud and stuff so that

7

it would impact -- the building definitely shakes as it

8

is very now and then, it's on pilings, but just how

9

that would impact the building.

I think also the

10

weight bearing capacity of the back plaza if it's

11

staged for emergency evacuation, I think that's

12

something that might need to be looked at for the

13

environmental process.

14

emergency vehicles, et cetera, that might be something

15

we need to look at.

16
17

MR. GOUGHERTY:
all this.

MS. CONNERS:

19

MR. GOUGHERTY:

21

We have a court reporter taking

Thank you.

18

20

If there's 25,000 people with

Okay, great.
Any other comments on the scope

of the EIR/EIS?
MS. WISE:

How would they accommodate the

22

ambulance and fire and police people in case of

23

emergency?

24

MR. GOUGHERTY:

25

MS. CONNERS:

Again, the circulation impact.

I think another scope is just the

air quality for HVAC systems for any of the surrounding

2

buildings, which would include the Ag Building, Ferry

3

Building, Pier 1, pedestrian, there's a lot of joggers

4

along the Embarcadero, and I think during the

9

all the water vehicles there in that area?
MR. GOUGHERTY:

I'm sorry, was the question --

10

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:

11

MR. GOUGHERTY:

12
13
14

Will there be fueling?

No, there will be no fueling at

this terminal facility of the vessels.
MS. WISE:

And also, what about noise like the

pile driving and all that stuff?

15

MR. GOUGHERTY:

16

MS. WISE:

17

Will they be refueling

So noise impacts?

Because the large apartments across

the way and office buildings that might be impacted.

18

MR. GOUGHERTY:

19

MR. SINDZINSKI:

Any additional comments?
I was just going to say, Mike,

20

that we will stay here at least until 6:15, but people

21

don't have to feel like they have to stay.

22

You're welcome to stay.

23

MR. GOUGHERTY:

We do.

So we won't be providing

Subject: Concerns to address on the Environmental Impact Report
regarding the Ferry Terminal Expansion Project
Dear Mr. Gougherty,
Thank you for coming to the Ferry Building last Wednesday, May 11,
2011, to communicate the plans for the Ferry Terminal Expansion Project,
and for facilitating the ability to see our concerns addressed on the
Environmental Impact Report. With the time we have had between the
meeting last Wednesday and tomorrow's deadline to submit our concerns,
the following are concerns of the environmental impact that could be
caused by the design or construction of the expansion project, and that we
would like to see addressed on the Environmental Impact Report:
Air Quality- Will this work create a lot of dust? If so, what will be done to
prevent the dust from covering the windows and entering through
windows and air vents?
Pile Driving- I was very happy to hear that you are considering a method
of vibrating the pilings into the earth, rather than driving/pounding
them in, to reduce noise. Our question is this; how severe is this
vibration, will this be felt by Ferry Building tenants, and will we need
to take precautions so that things won't slide off tables & shelves, or
that pictures & art that's hung on the wall won't bang against the wall
or fall?
Pedestrians Traffic- will there be signage with directions to the Ferry
Building, and anything else that needs to be done, in the event of
blocked sidewalks or closed pedestrian areas, to make sure that our
clients and visitors are informed as to how to find our office during
construction?
Aesthetics- In the meeting it was mentioned that the structure to be built
for a weather-protected area for queuing for Gate B (and possibly
similar construction for other gates) would probably have panes of
glass overhead to block rain. I can tell you from working here for
almost eight years that windows and glass around the ferry building
are a magnet for bird droppings. The north end of our suite

overlooks this area and we do not want to look out upon a long pile
of bird droppings. What will be done to maintain this, and any other
structures, as a clean, aesthetically pleasing amenity? Another
example of an aesthetic concern would be that any and all debris be
removed promptly after its accumulation. Also, a large part of
what makes the Ferry Building such a wonderful place to work, visit,
and do business are the wonderful views. What will be done to
make sure that these views remain unobstructed?
Thank you again for taking time to come to the Ferry Building to share
details of the Ferry Building Expansion Project with us, and for your
attention to these matters.
Sincerely,

Ferry Building - Comments for WETA for the purpose of defining the scope
and content of the EIS/EIR

RE: Water Emergency Transit Authority (WETA) - Downtown Ferry
Expansion Plan –
Comments for WETA for the purpose of defining the scope and
content of the EIS/EIR.
Dear Michael:
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the scope and content of the
EIS and EIR for WETA’s Downtown Ferry Expansion Plan. Equity Office
understands the vital importance of the WETA’s Downtown Ferry
Expansion Plan. As the Ferry Building landlord we have the responsibility
to fully evaluate the implementation of this project and minimize the
environmental impacts to our tenants needs on the back plaza, while
simultaneously supporting WETA’s Ferry Expansion Plan. Please address
the following Ferry Building concerns in the EIR:

•

WETA to consider extending a full plaza from Gate B to Pier 1
rather than finger pier/planks from Embarcadero sidewalk – so
that there is abundant queuing area for ferry passengers.
Passenger ridership will increase three fold in the next 20
years – so we should take queuing off already congested
Embarcadero sidewalks.

•

WETA should consider install of solar panels on queuing
canopies over berthing areas for night time and emergency
lights.

•

Determine an area for a back up generator to power dock
lights, pier hydraulics, etc.

•

Noise and dust impacts on retail and office tenants of the
Ferry Building could lead to requests for rent reductions, loss
of revenue and possible requests for interim relocation or
lease terminations. Equity Office would ask that WETA look
for ways to mitigate noise & dust. Or have a method to
reimburse EOP if tenant claims are legitimate.

•

Study increase in wake/wave activity due to increase of ferry
activity and how that may affect the pilings under Ferry
Building.

•

The queuing canopy by Gate B will obstruct views from
Slanted Door’s café and restaurant areas. Because queuing
only happens seasonally – and often only one ferry ride in
mid-afternoon during work week – we ask that this not be
included in final design.

•

WETA to provide assurances that proves it meets all current
ADA standards for egress/ingress near and on the expansion
areas.

•

WETA to investigate how construction work could affect the
settlement or structure to Ferry Building (a historic structure) –
or ferry plaza platform as a result of ferry expansion.

•

Loss of retail views and outside seating due to construction

could lead to reduced retail sales and retailer requests for rent
reductions or lease termination. Equity Office requests that
WETA look for ways to enhance barricades with farmers
market, ferry transit and local food messaging.
•

WETA will mitigate any rodent, pest or bird control issues that
may arise due to ferry expansion construction. In EIR please
study the potential impacts.

•

Please incorporate bird deterrents on any up high structures or
ledges.

•

Please incorporate a cleaning plan for all up high facilities in
designs ( accumulation of debris & bird droppings on roof
canopies)

•

Make sure idling ferry fumes are required BAAQD distance
from café areas.

•

WETA to keep Ferry Plaza Farmer’s Market operating on
back plaza during the project. Equity Office asks that WETA
look for ways to keep majority of construction site on barges.

•

WETA to provide prompt removal of any floating debris from
construction immediately. Please consider a marine barrier
during construction that would mitigate this need.

•

Equity Office requests WETA to hire structural engineer to
take initial and subsequent surveys of Ferry Building structure
to ensure it remains undamaged by the ferry expansion
project.

•

WETA to provide a study of ferry passenger circulation that
provides stats on ridership numbers, ferry commuter habits,
ferry passenger bike commuting and rest room uses on boats
and at Ferry Building.

•

WETA to reimburse Equity Office fees associated hire a
structural or geotechnical engineer to review WETA's plans,
as they relate to the Ferry Building, or monitoring information.
Equity Office will need them if we experience excessive noise,
vibration or movement.

•

During Construction request that WETA use Ferry Building
approved vendors for Pest Control, Bird Abatement, cleaning
and/or other areas that require mitigation of impact on Ferry
Building Property..

•

Specifically request air quality testing for the interior of
building in accordance with ASHRAE 62.1-2007

•

Request addition of restroom, storage, and bike storage
facilities to plaza build-out.

Thank you for consideration and we look forward to working with WETA.
Should you require further information or have any questions, please
contact me at (415) 983-8001.

Record of Meeting: Agency Scoping with NMFS in Santa Rosa
May 4, 2011
Attendees:
NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service - Korie Schaeffer, Marine Biologist
WETA – Mike Gougherty, Chad Mason
URS – Bill Martin, Ian Austin

The meeting was held in the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) offices in Santa
Rosa because a NMFS representative was not able to attend the Agency Scoping meeting held in
San Francisco on April 26, 2011.
Mike Gougherty provided an overview of the proposed Downtown Ferry Terminal Expansion
Project as described in the project Fact Sheet. The project includes demolition of Piers ½ and 2
on the north and south side of the San Francisco Ferry building Gates B and E respectively, and
construction of three new gates (Gates A, F, and G).

Korie Schaeffer comments:
•

NMFS will need details of the square footage of new bay cover associated with the
project (e.g., piers, ramps, and floats), of Bay fill removed (e.g.; Pier ½ and Pier 2) and of
Bay covered (e.g., the BART construction hole). This information will be needed for
both Phase 2 and Phase 3 build-out.

•

NMFS requested that the same list of topics be addressed as the list that had just been
discussed for the Berkeley ferry terminal project. The topics are related to potential
impacts on Essential Fish Habitat and Endangered Species Act species that NMFS’
regulatory authority requires it assess:
o

Underwater Sound
Overwater shading
Dredging

AIR QUALITY

APPENDIX B
AIR QUALITY AND GREENHOUSE GASES
This appendix describes the methodology and assumptions used to estimate emissions and health risks
associated with the construction and operation of the No Action Alternative and the proposed project.
Data sources are also provided.

1.0

CONSTRUCTION EMISSIONS

The No Action Alternative does not include any construction activities. Thus, the construction
equipment, activity assumptions, and emission discussions below are only related to the proposed project.
1.1

CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT

Details of the construction equipment associated with the North Basin and South Basin activities of the
proposed project are provided in Tables AIR-1 and AIR-2. Construction phases for each basin and
equipment types for each activity were based on the descriptions in Chapter 2.0 Alternatives. Equipment
quantities for each phase were not detailed in Chapter 2.0 Alternatives. Thus, for the purposes of the air
quality/greenhouse gas (GHG) analysis, equipment quantities were assigned as follows: two of a
particular equipment type if Chapter 2.0 Alternatives used the plural form of that equipment type (e.g.,
cherry pickers), and one of an equipment type if the singular equipment name (e.g., cherry picker) was
provided. Equipment horsepower and duty cycles were based on the Sacramento Metropolitan Air
Quality Management District’s Road Construction model’s (Version 6.3.2, July 2009) default horsepower
and duty-cycle values for various equipment types.
The duration of each phase was generally based on the estimated construction schedule provided in
Chapter 2.0 Alternatives (Figure 2-10). This analysis assumed that construction would begin in January
2014. However, if Chapter 2.0 Alternatives grouped a basin’s construction activity descriptions (e.g., the
South Basin’s Embarcadero Plaza and East Bayside Promenade activities), then it was assumed that the
construction period for these activities would extend from the beginning of the earliest activity to the end
of the latest activity, with no additional time required for concurrent/overlapping activities shown on
Figure 2-10. It was assumed that there would be approximately 30 construction workdays in each month,
and that construction activities would occur for 8 hours each day.
The number of construction workers for each construction activity was assumed to be the maximum
quantity (25 workers) provided in Chapter 2.0 Alternatives, except for certain activities (e.g., demolition
and dredging) that were specifically referenced as requiring less workers (up to 6). Concrete truckload
quantities were taken from Chapter 2.0 Alternatives, and assumed to occur within a 14-day period.
The California Air Resources Board’s (CARB) Commercial Harbor Craft Emissions Model – California
Barge and Dredge Emissions Inventory Database model’s data for harbor craft were used for the marine
vessel horsepower assumptions (CARB, 2011).

1.2

CONSTRUCTION EMISSION SUMMARY

Construction emission sources were grouped into three categories: on-road vehicles, off-road equipment,
and marine vessels. Tables AIR-3 and AIR-4 provide summaries of construction-related emissions in
tons per year (tons/year) and pounds per day (lbs/day), and the corresponding Bay Area Air Quality
Management District (BAAQMD) thresholds. Construction emissions of toxic air contaminants (TACs)
and particulate matter 2.5 microns in diameter or less (PM2.5) are described in Section 3.1.
1.2.1

On-Road Emissions

The on-road emissions included emissions from construction-worker vehicles, concrete trucks, and
lowboy trucks (Tables AIR-5 through AIR-7). It was assumed that approximately half of the
construction-worker vehicles were light-duty automobiles, and half were light-duty trucks. An average
vehicle miles traveled of 10.8 miles was assumed based on URBEMIS’ default values for San Francisco
County (Jones & Stokes Associates, 2007). EMFAC 2007 v.3’s emission factors (at an assumed speed of
25 miles per hour) were used to calculate the exhaust emissions of each criteria pollutant during each year
of construction (CARB, 2006a). The number of construction truckloads for a particular phase was
divided by the number of days that truck was used (e.g., 14 days for concrete trucks) as shown in
Tables AIR-1 and AIR-2. The number of vehicles was multiplied by two to account for daily round-trips.
The equations below were used to calculate the on-road construction worker and truck emissions.
Construction Worker Vehicle Daily Emissions (lbs/day): # of construction workers * 2 trips/day
* average vehicle miles traveled (10.8 miles) * [(Emission Factor for Light-Duty Automobiles
(grams/mile) + Emission Factor for Light-Duty Trucks (grams/mile)/2] / conversion factor
(454 grams/lbs)
Concrete or Lowboy Trucks: # of construction truckloads for a particular phase/day * 2 trips/day
* average vehicle miles traveled (10.8 miles) * (Emission Factor for Light-Duty Trucks
(grams/mile) / conversion factor (454 grams/lbs)
1.2.2

Off-Road Emissions

The CARB’s OFFROAD2007 emission factors (CARB, 2006b) were used to calculate the emissions
generated from the project’s construction equipment during each construction phase (Table AIR-8). 1
Fugitive-dust–related particulate matter emissions were assumed to be negligible because the proposed
project’s construction area overlies water. The model’s default horsepower and load factors for each
equipment type were used, and it was assumed that active construction would occur for 8 hours each day.
Based on the construction equipment detail tables (Tables AIR-1 and AIR-2), equipment types and
quantities were input into the model for each construction phase for each year of construction. If a
particular type of construction equipment was not included in the model’s list of equipment types, a
similar equipment type was selected, or the “other construction equipment” category was used.

1

OFFROAD2007 was used because the newer OFFROAD2011 does not yet allow the user to estimate emissions
for ROG or CO2.

* Unmitigated average total construction-related emissions from the proposed project were calculated by dividing the total
combined North Basin and South Basin 2014 and 2015 emissions (tons/year) by a 24-month, 30-day/month construction
period and applying a conversion factor to obtain average daily emissions in lbs/day. These unmitigated total emissions were
assumed to: 1) occur during an overlapping 24-month construction period; and 2) be emitted daily from 8 hours of active
construction activities.
Mitigated emissions shown above indicate the emissions reduction from implementation of Mitigation Measure AQ-1, and an
additional reduction from implementation of Mitigation Measure AQ-2. Mitigation measures are detailed below.
The BAAQMD thresholds are from the BAAQMD’s CEQA Air Quality Guidelines (BAAQMD, 2011).

The model provided daily pollutant emissions (lbs/day) for each construction phase. As shown in the
equation below, these daily emissions were multiplied by the number of construction days for a particular
phase, and divided by a conversion factor (2,000 lbs/ton) to calculate annual emissions for each
construction phase (tons/year).
Annual Emissions by Construction Phase = Daily Emissions from Off-Road Model Results
(lbs/day) * # of construction days for that phase in a given year / conversion factor (2,000 lbs/ton)
1.2.3

Marine Emissions

Daily emission rates (in lbs/day) were calculated for construction-related marine vessels using the
formula below (Table AIR-9). It was assumed that the project’s marine vessels would be 2008 models.
The CARB’s Commercial Harbor Craft Emissions Model – California Barge and Dredge Emissions
Inventory Database 2011 model was used to determine appropriate marine vessel emission factors
(Table AIR-10). The appropriate emission factor for each vessel was selected from the corresponding
horsepower range for model year 2008. The deterioration rates used in the equations below were selected
based on each vessel’s horsepower range, and were adjusted to consider the age of the vessel at the time
of use /total lifespan of the vessel (vessel lifespan assumed to equal 20 years). Fuel correction factors
were 0.948 and 0.8 (unit less) for oxides of nitrogen (NOX) and particulate matter (PM), respectively, and
were taken from CARB’s Appendix B of the Commercial Harbor Craft Emissions Model, Emissions
Estimation Methodology for Commercial Harbor Craft Operating in California (CARB, 2012).
Daily emission rate (lbs/day) = emission factor (grams/horsepower-hour) * marine vessel’s
horsepower * vessel load factor × conversion factor (1 lb/453.6 grams) * vessel operation period
(hours/day) * fuel correction factor (for NOX and PM only) * (1 + (deterioration rate * adjustment
of deterioration rate for consideration of age of vessel))
Annual emissions (tons/year) associated with each construction phase were determined by multiplying the
daily emission rate (lbs/day) for the applicable marine vessel(s) by the number of work days for that
construction phase in a given year by the number of vessels of that type, and dividing by a conversion
factor of 2,000 lbs/ton (Table AIR-11).

Mitigated Emissions Calculations

As shown in Table AIR-4, the proposed project’s construction-related unmitigated emissions would
exceed the applicable BAAQMD average daily emission threshold for NOX. Therefore, the proposed
project would include the mitigation measures identified below, and would result in the constructionrelated emissions following mitigation shown in Table AIR-4. Mitigation measures for the proposed
project’s construction activities include:
•

Mitigation Measure AQ-1: Construction Phasing. The Water Emergency Transportation
Authority will phase construction activities in such a way that onsite emission-generating
construction activities for the North Basin and South Basin improvements do not overlap.

•

Mitigation Measure AQ-2: Implement BAAQMD-Recommended Best Management Practices.
The following BAAQMD-recommended best management practices will be implemented to reduce
exhaust emissions:

Minimize the idling time of diesel-powered construction equipment to 2 minutes.

−

The contractor will demonstrate at various phases of construction (e.g., 25 percent, 50 percent,
and completion) that the off-road equipment (more than 50 horsepower) and marine vessels to be
used during construction (i.e., owned, leased, and subcontractor vehicles) would achieve a
project-wide fleet-average 20 percent NOX reduction, and a 45 percent PM reduction, compared
to the most recent CARB fleet average to the extent feasible. Acceptable options for reducing
emissions include the use of late-model engines, low-emission diesel products, alternative fuels,
engine retrofit technology, after-treatment products, add-on devices such as particulate filters,
and/or other options that may become available. The contractor will document efforts taken to
achieve the specified goals, explain why meeting the goals was not feasible (if applicable), and
indicate what emissions reduction and equipment use goals were achieved.

−

Require that all construction equipment, diesel trucks, and generators be equipped with Best
Available Control Technology for emission reductions of NOX and PM.

−

Require all contractors use equipment that meets CARB's most recent certification standard for
off-road heavy-duty diesel engines.

Table AIR-4 above shows mitigated emissions associated with Mitigation Measures AQ-1 and AQ-2.
Whereas unmitigated emissions assume that the North Basin and South Basin construction activities
would overlap, Mitigation Measure AQ-1 assumes no overlap of emission-generating activities. Without
any overlap of emission-generating construction activities, the total construction period would increase
from 24 to 38 months. With implementation of Mitigation Measure AQ-1, average daily NOX emissions
would be reduced from 99.8 to 63.0 pounds per day, which still exceeds the BAAQMD’s 54-pounds-perday significance threshold.
Mitigation Measure AQ-2 would further reduce emissions from 63.0 pounds of NOX per day to
50.7 pounds per day (see Table AIR-4). With implementation of Mitigation Measures AQ-1 and AQ-2,
the project’s emissions would be less than BAAQMD’s 54-pounds-per-day threshold.

OPERATION EMISSIONS

The No Action Alternative and the proposed project would result in direct and indirect operational-related
emissions. For the No Action Alternative, vessel idling would generate exhaust emissions. The proposed
project would generate exhaust emissions from several sources, including idling vessels, operation and
periodic testing of an emergency generator, and a survey boat used for maintenance dredging.
Maintenance dredging and the operation of an emergency generator would occur infrequently, but were
included in the emission calculations to determine the most conservative (i.e., highest emissions)
scenario. For both the No Action Alternative and the proposed project, vessels were assumed to be
evenly composed of large (7,657 horsepower) and small (2,198 horsepower) vessels. Vessel types
assumed in this analysis were based on vessel information provided in the Program Environmental Impact
Report’s Technical Appendix AIR-C Emissions for Alternatives 1 through 4’s Summary of Marine
Emissions for the No Project and "Reduced" Alternative 2 Project Scenarios Assuming EPA Tier 2
Emissions Standards for Diesel Engines table (WETA, 2003).

NO ACTION OPERATION EMISSIONS

Similar to the construction-related marine vessel calculations, maximum daily emission rates (lbs/day) were
calculated for the No Action Alternative’s large and small vessels (Table AIR-12). The vessels were
assumed to be 2010 models, with the horsepower described above. The marine vessels for the No Action
and proposed project’s services would use U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and CARB
Tier 2–compliant clean diesel engines, which emit approximately 25 to 30 percent less reactive organic gas
(ROG), NOX, and particulate matter 10 microns in diameter or less (PM10) than current diesel engines. In
addition, add-on control devices such as selective catalytic reduction and particulate traps would further
reduce NOX and PM10 emissions to 10 percent and 5 percent, respectively, of U.S. EPA Tier 2 levels. For
ROG, NOX, PM10, and PM2.5, the U.S. EPA’s Marine Compression-Ignition Engines Exhaust Emission
Standards for Tier 2 commercial (C1) engines were used (Table AIR-13). As described above, additional
emission reductions from the add-on control devices were applied for NOX and PM10 (Table AIR-13).

The CARB’s Commercial Harbor Craft Emissions Model – California Barge and Dredge Emissions
Inventory Database 2011 model was used to determine appropriate marine vessel emission factors for
carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions for both alternatives. The appropriate emission factor for each
vessel was selected from the corresponding horsepower range for the corresponding model year. The
vessels were assumed to be 2010 models, with the horsepower described above. Based on Chapter 2.0
Alternatives, under the No Action Alternative, vessel arrivals could increase to a total of 65 vessels/day.
The equation used to estimate vessel idling emissions is as follows:
Daily emission rate (lbs/day) for idling small or large vessels = emission factor
(grams/horsepower-hour) * marine vessel’s horsepower * vessel load factor (of 0.01) *
conversion factor (1 lb/453.6 grams) * number of total vessels/day * 1/2 the vessels (one-half of
total vessels are small vessels and one-half are large) * 20 idling minutes/vessel * 1 hour/60 min
Annual vessel idling exhaust emissions (tons/year) were calculated as shown in Table AIR-14. To
calculate vessel idling emissions, daily emission rates for each vessel type was multiplied by
365 days/year and multiplied by a conversion factor (1 ton/2,000 lbs). Average daily emissions for the
No Action Alternative (Table AIR-15) were calculated by dividing the total annual emissions (tons/year)
for each pollutant by 365 days/year and multiplying by a conversion factor (1 ton/2,000 lbs).

PROPOSED PROJECT OPERATION EMISSIONS

Similar to the construction-related marine vessel calculations and the No Action Alternative’s operation
emission calculations, maximum daily emission rates (lbs/day) were calculated for the proposed project’s
maintenance dredging activities (survey boat), and large and small vessels (Table AIR-16). Based on
Chapter 2.0 Alternatives, the proposed project would support and increase in vessel arrivals to a total of
181 vessels arrivals/day. CARB’s Commercial Harbor Craft Emissions Model – California Barge and
Dredge Emissions Inventory Database 2011 model was used to determine appropriate marine vessel
emission factors for CO2e. For ROG, NOX, PM10, and PM2.5, the U.S. EPA’s Marine CompressionIgnition Engines Exhaust Emission Standards for Tier 2 commercial (C1) engines were used
(Table AIR-13).

The deterioration rates used in the equation below were selected based on each vessel’s horsepower and
were adjusted for the age of the vessel at the time of use /total lifespan of the vessel (assumed 20 years).
It was assumed the first year that maintenance dredging occurring under the proposed project would be
3 years after completion of project construction (assumed to be year 2018), and that the survey boat
would be 10 years old out of its 20-year lifespan (a deterioration rate adjustment of 10/20).
Daily emission rate (lbs/day) for survey boat = emission factor (grams/horsepower-hour) *
marine vessel’s horsepower * vessel load factor * conversion factor (1 lb/453.6 grams) * vessel
operation period (hours/day) * fuel correction factor (for NOX and PM only) * (1 + (deterioration
rate × adjustment of deterioration rate for consideration of age of boat))
Daily emission rate (lbs/day) for idling small or large vessels = emission factor
(grams/horsepower-hour) * marine vessel’s horsepower * vessel load factor (of 0.01) *
conversion factor (1 lb/453.6 grams) * number of total vessels/day * 1/2 the vessels * 20 idling
minutes/vessel * 1 hour/60 min
Annual emissions (tons/year) from each activity were calculated as shown in Table AIR-17. To calculate
the vessel idling emissions, the daily emission rates for each vessel type were multiplied by
365 days/year, and multiplied by a conversion factor (1 ton/2,000 lbs).

Maintenance dredging emissions were assumed to occur over a 10-day period; thus, the equation used to
calculate maintenance dredging emissions was daily emission rate for the survey boat * 10 days/year * a
conversion factor (1 ton/2,000 lbs). Average daily emissions for the proposed project (Table AIR-18)
were calculated by dividing the total annual emissions (tons/year) for each pollutant by 365 days/year,

Daily emissions from the operation and periodic testing of an emergency generator under the proposed
project were calculated using the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District’s Road
Construction Emissions Model, Version 6.3.2. In the model, it was assumed that one 549-horsepower
generator (default generator size and load factor used) would operate 24 hours per day. As shown in the
following equation, annual emissions (Table AIR-17) were calculated by using these maximum daily
emission rates (Table AIR-16), and assuming that the generator would be operated up to a maximum of
124 hours annually (2 hours/month for periodic testing, and up to 100 hours of use):
Annual emissions (tons/year) from the emergency generator = daily emission rates (lbs/day) ×
1 day/24 hours × 124 hours/year × conversion factor (1 ton/2,000 lbs)
2.3

NET OPERATION EMISSIONS

As shown in Tables AIR-19 and AIR–20, net proposed project emissions were calculated by
determining the total increase in the proposed project’s emissions, compared to the No Action
Alternative’s emissions. For operational emissions, there are four emission categories for the proposed
project: large-vessel idling, small-vessel idling, emergency generator, and maintenance dredging.
However, for the No Action Alternative, there are only two emission categories: large-vessel idling
and small-vessel idling. Consequently, the net emission increases for the emergency generator and
maintenance dredging shown in Table AIR-19 are identical to the proposed project emissions for these
categories shown in Table AIR-17. The net emission increases for the large- and small-vessel idling
categories shown in Table AIR-19 are the net change in emissions from these categories shown for the
proposed project in Table AIR-17, minus the emissions shown for the No Action Alternative shown in
Table AIR-14.

TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS AND HEALTH RISK ANALYSIS

3.1

TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS

In addition to the criteria air pollutants listed above, TACs or hazardous air pollutants are air pollutants
that may lead to serious illness or increased mortality, even when present in relatively low concentrations.
There are hundreds of different types of TACs with varying degrees of toxicity. Many TACs are
confirmed or suspected carcinogens, or are known or suspected to cause birth defects or neurological
damage. Secondly, many TACs can be toxic at very low concentrations. For some chemicals, such as
carcinogens, there are no thresholds below which exposure can be considered risk-free.
Industrial facilities and mobile sources are significant sources of TACs. Automobile exhaust also contains
TACs such as benzene and 1,3-butadiene. Most recently, diesel particulate matter (DPM) was identified as
a TAC by CARB. DPM differs from other TACs in that it is not a single substance but rather a complex
mixture of hundreds of substances. BAAQMD research indicates that mobile-source emissions of DPM,
benzene, and 1,3-butadiene represent a substantial portion of the ambient background risk from TACs in the
San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin. For the proposed project, the TACs of concern are DPM and PM2.5,
which would be emitted by heavy construction equipment and by marine vessels during project operation.
3.2

HEALTH RISK ANALYSIS

The proposed project’s construction and operational activities could affect local air quality. The primary
sources of health risks from construction equipment are DPM, which is produced by diesel engine exhaust;
and PM2.5. As shown in Tables AIR-17 and AIR-19 above, emissions of PM10 and PM2.5 in equipment exhaust
would not exceed the significance criteria for regional emissions of criteria pollutants. However, localized
PM2.5 and DPM emissions could expose sensitive receptors to substantial concentrations, resulting in health
risks. These pollutants were evaluated to identify potential cancer risk and chronic noncancer hazards.
The construction and operational health risk analysis evaluated the potential risk to existing sensitive
receptors in the vicinity of the proposed project areas. Risk characterization and model results are
discussed in this section.
The thresholds for individual project risks and hazards are:
•
•
•

An excess lifetime cancer risk level of more than 10 in one million;
A noncancer (chronic) risk greater than 1.0; and
An incremental increase in the annual average PM2.5 concentration greater than 0.3 microgram per
cubic meter (μg/m3).

3.2.1

Sensitive Receptors

To assess the health risks on sensitive receptors from the project’s construction and operation, the nearest
residential, school (including day cares), medical, and commercial sensitive receptors were identified.
The distance between the nearest residential-zoned property and the project area is approximately 300 feet
(91.4 meters). The nearest school is approximately 293 feet (89.3 meters) from the project area. A
medical facility is located approximately 4,168 feet (1,270 meters) from the project area. A commercial
property is within the project area and was considered to be 0 feet from the project area.

SCREEN3 Model and Inputs

The U.S. EPA’s SCREEN3 model was used to perform a screening-level analysis of the potential health
risks of the proposed project. The SCREEN3 model is a “single source Gaussian plume model which
provides maximum ground-level concentrations for point, area, flare, and volume sources” (U.S. EPA,
2012b). The model was used to identify a maximum ground-level concentration near the project area, and
the concentrations at the nearest four sensitive receptor types described above. As detailed below, these
concentrations were then converted into chronic and carcinogenic risks for the health risk analysis.
Inputs required for the model include source type, receptor, and source heights; project area dimensions;
emission rates (in grams/second*square meters); and distances to the nearest sensitive receptors. For this
analysis, the following model inputs were used:
•
•
•
•

Source type = Area source;
Receptor and source heights = 1.8 meters;
Project area dimensions = 1,543 feet by 829 feet (or approximately 470 meters by 253 meters), or a
total project area of 1,279,147 square feet; and
Project’s emission rates (discussed further below).

Total PM10 emission rates for each of the project’s construction years (Table AIR-3) and the project’s net
operational PM10 emissions (Table AIR-19) were converted from tons/year to grams/(second*square
meters). The converted project emission rates are provided in Table AIR-21. PM10 emissions were used
as a surrogate for DPM emissions.

Exposure Assumptions

The exposure assessment estimates human exposure to substances that can increase cancer risk or cause
chronic noncancer health risks. The primary exposure pathway for DPM is through inhalation.
Dose-response assessment is the process of characterizing the relationship between exposure to an agent
and incidence of an adverse health effect in exposed populations. In quantitative carcinogenic risk
assessments, the dose-response relationship is expressed in terms of a potency slope that is used to
calculate the probability or risk of cancer associated with an estimated exposure. Cancer potency factor is
expressed as the 95th percent upper confidence limit of the slope of the dose response curve, and assumes
continuous lifetime exposure to a substance at a dose of 1 milligram per kilogram of body weight-day,
commonly expressed in units of inverse dose, i.e., (milligrams per kilogram per day [mg/kg-day])-1. It is
assumed in cancer risk assessments that risk is directly proportional to dose and that there is no threshold
for carcinogenesis. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has
compiled cancer potency factors, which are used in risk assessments (OEHHA, 2011).
For noncarcinogenic effects, dose-response data developed from animal or human studies are used to
develop chronic noncancer reference exposure levels (RELs). The chronic RELs are defined as the
concentration at which no adverse noncancer health effects are anticipated. The most sensitive health
effect is chosen to determine the REL if the chemical affects multiple organ systems. Unlike cancer
health effects, noncancer chronic health effects are generally assumed to have thresholds for adverse
effects. In other words, chronic injury from a pollutant will not occur until exposure to that pollutant has
reached or exceeded a certain concentration (i.e., threshold). The chronic RELs are intended to be below
the threshold for health effects for the general population.
Risk characterization is the final step of risk assessment. Modeled concentrations and public exposure
information, which are determined through exposure assessment, are combined with potency factors and
RELs that are developed through dose-response assessment.

3.2.5

Cancer Risk

The maximum incremental cancer risk from exposure to DPM was calculated by estimating exposure to
carcinogenic chemicals, and multiplying the dose times the cancer potency factor. The following
equation was used to determine cancer risk:
Cancer Risk = (Dose * CRAF), where:
Cancer Risk = risk (potential chances per million)
Dose = dose through inhalation (mg/kg-day)
CRAF = Cancer risk adjustment factor (exposure period for project activity (2 years for
construction or 70 years for operation)/total exposure period (70 years)
Dose is estimated using the following equation:
Dose = (Cair * DBR * EF * ED * CF * Slope Factor)/AT, where:
Dose = dose through inhalation (mg/kg-day)
Cair = annual air concentration (μg/m3) from the SCREEN3 model at each sensitive receptor
location
DBR = daily breathing rate (393 L/kg body weight-day for maximum rate over a 70-year
exposure duration)
EF = exposure frequency (350 days/year, recommended default value)
ED = exposure duration (70 years, recommended default value)
CF = conversion factor (10-6 ([mg/μg] * [m3/L])
Slope Factor = the OEHHA-established cancer potency slope factor of 1.1 (mg/kg-day)-1 for
DPM.
AT = averaging time (25,550 days or 70 years)
For the cancer risk analysis, the dose was calculated using the default values provided above and the
annual air concentrations at each sensitive receptor location from the air screening (SCREEN3) model.
Default values were based on the guidance provided by OEHHA (2003). To determine incremental
cancer risk, the estimated dose through inhalation was multiplied by the OEHHA-established cancer
potency slope factor of 1.1 (mg/kg-day)-1 for DPM. The CRAF used for the construction risk
calculations was 2 years/70 years or 0.02857. The operation risk’s CRAF was one (70 years/70 years).
Results for cancer risk and chronic noncancer hazard impacts are provided in Table AIR-23 for each of
the nearest sensitive receptor types. Based on the assessment described above, it was determined that the
maximum incremental cancer risk at any of the receptor locations would be 5.21 in one million, which is
below the threshold of 10 in one million. Thus, incremental cancer risks at the various sensitive receptor
sites would be below the cancer risk threshold (as presented in Table AIR-23).

3.2.6

Chronic Noncancer Hazard Index

The potential for exposure to result in chronic noncancer effects is evaluated by comparing the estimated
annual average air concentration (which is equivalent to the average daily air concentration) to the
chemical-specific noncancer chronic RELs. The chronic REL is the inhalation exposure concentration at
which no adverse chronic health effects would be anticipated following exposure. When calculated for a
single chemical, the comparison yields a ratio termed a hazard quotient.
The chronic risk level is calculated as follows:
Inhalation chronic risk = Cair / cREL, where:
Cair = annual concentration (μg/m3)
cREL = Chronic noncancer REL (μg/m3)
For this analysis, the SCREEN3 model results were converted using an adjustment factor of 0.8 from
1-hour concentrations (μg/m3) to annual concentrations (μg/m3). A REL of 5 was used for mercury, as
recommended by OEHHA (2011). The inhalation chronic risk results are presented in Table AIR-23. As
shown in the table, the DPM exposure from the project’s construction and operation emissions would
result in a maximum chronic hazard index of 0.09 at the commercial receptor, which, when divided by the
REL of 5, is well below the threshold of 1.0.
3.2.7

Ambient PM2.5 Concentrations

The PM2.5 ground-level concentrations were modeled in SCREEN3 using the PM2.5 emissions from the
project’s construction and operation activities. Results of the analysis indicate that unmitigated PM2.5

construction-related concentrations at three of the nearest sensitive receptors would be greater than the
BAAQMD significance threshold of 0.3 μg/m3 (see Table AIR-24). However, implementation of
Mitigation Measures AQ-1 and AQ-2 would reduce the PM2.5 concentrations to levels less than the
BAAQMD’s significance health risk threshold.

CUMULATIVE HEALTH RISK

The cumulative analysis is conducted for the project site and results are compared to the thresholds for
cumulative effects:
•
•
•

An excess lifetime cancer risk level of more than 100 in one million;
A chronic noncancer HI greater than 10; and
An incremental increase in the annual average PM2.5 of greater than 0.8 μg/m3.

The incremental increase in PM2.5 concentrations, incremental cancer risk, and chronic HI from all past,
present, and foreseeable future sources (including stationary sources) within a 1,000-foot radius from the
project area, plus the contribution from the project, are analyzed for the cumulative health risk
assessment. Stationary source within the 1,000-foot buffer zone of each project site are presented in
Table AIR-25.
The screening PM2.5 concentration, cancer risks, and chronic hazards values for permitted stationary
sources were obtained from the BAAQMD county-specific kml files for Google EarthTM (BAAQMD,
2012). These files included PM2.5 concentrations, cancer risks, and hazards values. Table AIR-25 shows
these cumulative values from all sources within a 1,000-foot buffer zone of the project area. The
cumulative values include the maximum project PM2.5, chronic, and carcinogenic risk operational values.
As shown in the table, the maximum project cumulative operational values would result in a PM2.5
concentration of 0.309 μg/m3, a cancer risk of 91 in one million, and a chronic hazard index of 0.040.

Purpose:
 Provide agencies with an opportunity for meaningful participation in the environmental
review process (per Section 6002 of SAFETEA-LU);
 Comment on the Draft Coordination Plan; and
 Discuss the purpose and need and project alternatives.
Introductions:
Following introduction of the attendees, FTA (Debra Jones) provided an overview of the
purposes for the meeting, as listed above. It was emphasized that agency participation during
each phase of the process will aid in developing a better EIS/EIR and will lessen the burden on
agencies in reviewing the Draft EIS/EIR by allowing them to review and comment on
preliminary draft versions of the purpose and need, alternatives, and methodology for analysis.

1

Draft Coordination Plan:
The agencies were previously provided with a Draft Coordination Plan for review and comment.
The plan outlines agencies’ roles, the coordination process, and schedule of key coordination
activities.
FTA and WETA are the lead agencies under NEPA and CEQA, respectively. Federal agencies
with special expertise will serve as cooperating agencies and will support scoping and public
involvement activities and will provide technical assistance, as necessary, in addition to
reviewing and commenting on preliminary draft documents; NMFS has agreed to serve as a
cooperating agency. Participating agencies, those other agencies with an interest in the project,
will aid in identifying potential issues of concern relevant to the environmental review process
and project implementation in addition to reviewing and commenting on preliminary draft
documents. The participating agencies for this project include: National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration – National Marine Fisheries Service; U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers; U.S. Coast Guard, San Francisco Sector; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency;
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission;
Port of San Francisco; Bay Area Air Quality Management District; California State Lands
Commission; and BART.
It was noted that scoping meetings were held in April 2011. This meeting serves as the first of
two additional proposed coordination meetings. Agencies will have access to project documents
and updates via the project website, http://www.watertransit.org/CurrentProjects/
DTFX.aspx. A schedule of milestones for completing the EIS/EIR and decision documents was
reviewed.
USEPA (Susan Sturges) noted Table 1 of the Coordination Plan should also reflect the USEPA’s
jurisdiction and interest also includes air quality (i.e., transportation conformity).
Purpose and Need:
The purpose and need for the project was summarized as follows:
 WETA needs additional berthing facilities in San Francisco to accommodate its planned
route expansion;
 The proposed improvements are needed to allow WETA to effectively provide
evacuation and disaster recovery services in accordance with its emergency response
mandate; and
 To relieve pedestrian congestion around the terminal and provide better circulation.
Corps (Mark D’Avignon) recommended addressing the Section 404(b)(1) analysis in the
EIS/EIR, and that the purpose and need should consider the USACE’s approval requirements.
Range of Alternatives:
An overview of the Proposed Action and No Action Alternative were provided.
The Proposed Action represents Phase 2 of the planned improvements at the Downtown San
Francisco Ferry Terminal. Phase 1, which was planned and implemented by the Port of San
Francisco, occurred from 2001 to 2003 and involved construction of Gates B and E. Phase 2, this
project, would add three additional gates and is proposed to be completed from 2014 to 2017.
2

Construction of Phase 2 would occur in two phases, with the north basin improvements being
constructed first. The phasing is due to funding availability and limited staging area space at the
terminal. Dredging work windows have been considered in the project schedule, and it was noted
that relatively little dredging is proposed.
WETA is presently deciding whether Phase 3 will also be included in the project description for
this EIS/EIR. Phase 3 would involve provision of bow-loading facilities to accommodate
increased ridership from Treasure Island that is projected to occur between 2020 and 2030, and
the construction of Phase 3 would not occur until that time.
NMFS (Mandy Morrison) noted that the Proposed Action as described involves the removal of
Pier ½; however, removal of Pier ½ is being considered as mitigation for the America’s Cup
project. WETA has had preliminary discussions with the America’s Cup project proponent
regarding this matter and no decisions have been made yet. However, if the Pier is removed as a
part of the America’s Cup project, it would be removed from this project. It was also noted that
Pier 2 is also being considered for removal as mitigation for the America’s Cup project.
The Proposed Action was developed in consideration of the alternatives evaluated in Phase 1.
The draft alternatives chapter details several alternatives that were previously considered. Based
on previous planning efforts the Draft EIS/EIR for this project will analyze the No Action
Alternative (No Project Alternative) and the Action Alternative as described today.
It was noted that the environmental analysis for the individual expanded routes is being
addressed in separate NEPA/CEQA documents. WETA completed an Implementation and
Operation Plan (IOP) and a Program-level EIR for the IOP in 2003, which addressed its route
expansion program. As individual routes are proposed, separate NEPA/CEQA documents are
being prepared for the route. This project would provide facilities for the new routes in San
Francisco but it is assumed that the route expansion would take place even if the facility
improvements were not implemented (described in the No Action Alternative). It was suggested
that the cumulative impacts analysis for the San Francisco Ferry Terminal Expansion Project
consider the impacts of the arrival of the additional service lines at the San Francisco terminal.
Permitting:
Attending agency representatives provided the following input on permitting requirements:
 Corps (Mark D’Avignon) noted that the proposed dredging activity may be able to be
covered under the Port’s maintenance dredging permit. The current permit expires in
2013 and it may be possible to cover the dredging for the Downtown Ferry Terminal
Expansion Project in the renewal. It was also noted that the area proposed for dredging
for the project may overlap with the area proposed for dredging for the America’s Cup.
Rob Lawrence with the Corps should be contacted for additional information.
 Corps (Mark D’Avignon) stated that it may be possible to combine the Section 10 and
Section 404 permitting processes for the project.
 The USCG typically requires an anchor waiver (which would apply to barges used for
construction). All private aids to navigation will need to comply with navigation
standards; this is handled by the District office. Additionally, due to the proximity to the
bridge, the bridge office should be kept informed of the project.

NMFS will be the lead consulting agency for the Section 7 consultation.
Monica D’Angelis with NMFS in Long Beach should be contact regarding marine
mammal harassment issues.

Next Steps
 Agencies to provide comments on Draft Coordination Plan, Purpose and Need, and
Alternatives by January 6, 2012 (email is acceptable).
 EIS/EIR impact analysis methodology will be provided to agencies for review and
comment.
 Next agency coordination meeting in Spring 2012, prior to publication of Draft EIS/EIR
