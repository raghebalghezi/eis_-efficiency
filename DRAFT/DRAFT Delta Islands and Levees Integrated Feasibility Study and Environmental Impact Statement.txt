SCOPING REPORT

DELTA ISLANDS AND LEVEES FEASIBILITY STUDY
SCOPING REPORT
Introduction
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) initiated the Delta Islands and Levees
Feasibility Study at the request of the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), the
non-Federal sponsor for the study. USACE is the lead agency in the Feasibility Study, with
USACE taking the lead under the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA).
Numerous agencies, organizations, and individuals participated in the study including the
California Department of Water Resources (DWR), U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA Fisheries), U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, Sacramento
County, San Joaquin County, Contra Costa County, Yolo County, Alameda County, Solano
County, numerous levee maintaining agencies, local landowners and residents.
Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study
The feasibility report will present details on the USACE and non-Federal sponsor
(California Department of Water Resources) participation needed to implement the selected plan.
The report will conclude with a recommendation for Congressional authorization of a project, if
justified. It is anticipated that the planning efforts will result in an integrated planning document
discussing plan formulation and an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) which analyzes the
alternatives. The EIS would be prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA).
Notice of Intent/Preparation
In compliance with the requirements set forth in NEPA, USACE prepared a Notice of
Intent (NOI) describing its intent to prepare an EIS, the possible alternatives, and relevant
scoping meeting and contact information. The NOI was posted in the Federal Register, the
United States Government’s official noticing and reporting publication, on January 31 2013
(Federal Register, Vol. 78, No. 921). The official comment period for the NOI was January 31
2013 to March 15, 2013.
Mailings
USACE developed a postcard which was sent to interested stakeholders and agency
contacts. Additionally a previously developed mailing list of interested stakeholders and agency
contacts was sent by email notification encouraging attendance at the scoping meetings.

Notifications
Notices briefly introducing the lead agencies, the proposed projects and associated
environmental review processes, and the scoping meetings were placed in the Sacramento Bee

SR1-1

and Lodi News newspapers on February 6, 2013. Newsprint releases were published to reach a
local and regional public audience that residents routinely rely upon to keep them abreast of local
issues. A media release was also emailed out to a number media contacts within the region on
February 6, 2013. Attachment A contains copies of the following:

Public Meetings
In February 2013, two scoping meetings were held for the project study. The meetings
were held to educate the public about the study efforts and to garner input on the proposed scope,
in accordance with NEPA. Refer to Table 1-1 for the USACE planning and NEPA process.
The meetings were held at two different times over the course of two days. On February
19, 2013, the first meeting was conducted from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. at the Old Sugar Mill in
Clarksburg. The second meeting was conducted on February 19, 2013 from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. at
the Sheraton Grand Hotel in Sacramento.
The meeting locations were chosen because they are central to the region. The meeting
times were chosen to accommodate both the workday schedules of public agency representatives
and the general public, including residents and business owners.
The meetings were open-house style workshops in which attendees could read and view
the information about the two projects and interact with project staff, including representatives of
USACE and the California Department of Water Resources (DWR). The views expressed in the
scoping meeting are summarized as follows:
USACE staff was stationed at display boards to interact with public attendees and
provide additional detail or answer any questions. A Power Point presentation was on-going to
provide a brief introduction to the including objectives, schedule, environmental compliance, and
related flood control work in the region. A fact sheet, providing an overview of the Delta Islands
and Levees Feasibility Study including purpose and goals, maps of the corresponding study
areas, an overview of the environmental compliance process and timeline, was also made
available. Comment cards were prepared so that meeting attendees could provide feedback on
the projects. These cards could be filled out during the meeting and given to a project team
member. Attachment B contains copies of the following:

Corps to discuss Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study at public meetings
SACRAMENTO, Calif. – The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Sacramento District is set to host two public meetings
this month on its ongoing Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study, a cost-shared study with the state of California
to address critical water resources issues in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.
The public meetings, scheduled for Feb. 19 at the Old Sugar Mill in Clarksburg and Feb. 20 at the Sheraton Grand
Hotel in Sacramento, are intended to provide a public forum to explain the Corps’ feasibility study process and what
the Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study aims to achieve.
The Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study will inform the Corps’ and state of California’s efforts to address a
variety of critical issues in the Delta, including flood risk management, ecosystem restoration, water quality, water
supply conveyance, emergency flood water storage and, emergency response.
The draft environmental impact statement outlining the potential impacts of proposed solutions is scheduled to be
available for public review and comment in 2014. The array of potential measures and program alternatives will be
determined based on information received during the scoping process and other associated studies.
In addition to providing comments at the public scoping meetings, written comments can be submitted by mail to
1325 J Street, Sacramento, CA, 95814 or by e-mail to spk-pao@usace.army.mil. Additional public comment periods
and public meetings will be conducted throughout the course of the study as part of the environmental impact
statement development process.

STUDY OVERVIEW
Delta Islands & Levees Feasibility Study
Study Focus

Flood Risk Management and Ecosystem Restoration (not water supply)

Study Area

The Sacramento – San Joaquin Delta
is a web of channels and reclaimed
islands, covering about 738,000 acres,
at the confluence of five rivers protected
by a network of 1,100-plus miles of
levees constructed over the last 150
years.
Home to hundreds of species of fish,
birds, mammals and reptiles, the Delta
is part of the largest estuary on the west
coast, and was named an Ecosystem of
National Significance by the Environmental Protection
and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act in 2011.
The Delta is also the largest single source of
California’s water supply, providing 25 million
Californians with drinking water, and irrigating millions
of acres of farmland in the Central Valley. With nearly
three-fourths of the Delta producing agriculture, it
directly impacts not only the livelihood of the more
than 500,000 people who live within the Delta, but the
entire U.S as the Delta contributes billions of dollars in
production to the nation annually.

STUDY OVERVIEW
Delta Islands & Levees Feasibility Study
Ecological

There are a number of factors contributing to
the ecological decline of Delta species and
habitats, each of which has the capability
to produce adverse impacts independently
and/or in combination with each other.
Identified contributors of adverse impacts to
the ecological health of the Delta ecosystem
include:
• pesticides
• channelization
• exotic and non-native invasive species
• water supply diversions
• agricultural and urban runoff
• wastewater discharges
Specifically, channelization of rivers and
streams through the construction of levees
has resulted in the widespread loss of tidal
marsh, shaded riverine aquatic habitat,
and the disconnection of floodplains from
waterways.
If this loss of Delta habitats and
disconnection from floodplains continues,
the current substantial declines in the Delta’s
fisheries could result in the extinction of
culturally and economically critical species.
Many of the defining characteristics of
the pre-channelized ecosystem (spatial
extent, habitat heterogeneity, and dynamic
storage) have either been lost
or substantially altered as a
result of land use and water
management practices during
the past 100 years in California.
Nearly 95 percent of the historic
wetland habitat in the Delta has
been converted to agricultural
and urban uses.

Flood Risk

Delta levees protect critical
infrastructure such as:
• state highways
• rail lines
• natural gas fields
• gas and fuel pipelines
• drinking water pipelines
• businesses
• towns
While portions of Sacramento and
Stockton are located within the
Delta, most of its inhabitants are
located amongst six Delta islands.
As a result, the Delta Islands &
Levees Feasibility Study is closely
coordinating with Sacramento and
Stockton-related flood risk reduction
studies to ensure assumptions,
scopes, and alternative plans are
compatible.
Problems associated with inDelta flood risk are largely due to
the potential for levee failure and
overtopping during flood events.
These risks are increased as a result
of climate change, sea level change,
subsidence (as much as 25 feet
below sea level) and seismic risk.

Flood Risk Management
Water Supply, Reliability, and Environmental Improvements Act (Public Law (PL) 108-361), Section 103
(f) (3); as amended by the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) 2007 (PL 110-114), Section
3015; and the Energy and Water Appropriations Act of 2010.
The study area is located in Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano, Contra Costa, Alameda, and Yolo
counties, California and extends from Sacramento south to the cities of Stockton and Tracy, and west
to and including Suisun Bay. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta consists of about 740,000 acres of
land segregated into some 80 tracts and islands and 1,100 miles of levees. Title I of PL 108-361, the
CALFED Bay Delta Authorization Act of 2004 (CALFED Act), provided for Corps participation in the
CALFED Program by authorizing the Secretary of the Army to undertake the construction and implementation of levee stability programs or projects for such purposes as flood control, ecosystem restoration, water supply, water conveyance, and water quality as described in the 2000 Record of Decision for the Programmatic Environmental Impact Study/Report on the CALFED Bay-Delta Program.
The primary purpose of levee improvement projects is flood risk management, although it is recognized that incidental benefits for other purposes may accrue as a result of levee improvements in the
Delta.

FEDERAL INTEREST Delta levees protect 500,000 inhabitants, the water supply of 25,000,000 Californians, several Federal
navigation/transportation projects, and a $28B agricultural industry (10% of the nation’s output). The
Delta is home to over 750 plant and animal species including over 35 species listed under the Endangered Species Act.
SUMMARIZED Authorized Federal Limit $ 196,000,000
FINANCIAL DATA FY 08 Appropriations $ 4,920,000
FY 09 Appropriations $ 4,784,000
FY 10 Appropriations $ 4,814,000

PARTNERSHIP FUNDING

Up to $100,000 is available at full Federal expense to initiate Feasibility Phase activities, including preparing a Preliminary Draft Project Implementation Report (PDPIR), a Project Management Plan (PMP),
and to negotiate the Feasibility Cost Share Agreement (FCSA) for each project that proceeds
through the program. The cost share between the Corps and a non-Federal sponsor for Feasibility
Phase activities in the LSP beyond the initial $100k is 50/50. The cost share for design and construction
is 65% Corps/35% non-federal sponsor.

FY 10 ACTIVITIES

The Bethel Island Municipal Improvement District was the first non-Federal sponsor to sign a Feasibility
Cost Share Agreement (FCSA) with the Corps on 13 July 2010 for the Bethel Island-Horseshoe Bend
Project. The Corps team completed draft Project Management Plans (PMPs) for four additional
Levee Stability Program projects, including McCormack-Williamson Tract, Bacon Island, WalnutGrove, and River Junction, and began development of a PMP and FCSA for Brannan-Andrus Levee
Maintenance District. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed between USACE and DWR,
allowing the Corps-DWR to initiate Phase 1 of GIS Flood Contingency Mapping and Emergency Response Planning for the Delta region. The team met with Delta counties in August 2010 to get input on
concepts for the GIS products, response report, and related data.

FY 11 ACTIVITIES

The Bethel Island-Horseshoe Bend Project Feasibility Phase Study is currently underway; a completed
PIR and initiation of a Project Partnership Agreement is anticipated in FY13. The McCormackWilliamson Tract PMP and FCSA are currently at the Corps’ Headquarters office for approval; the PIR
is anticipated to be under development in FY12. Phase 1 of GIS Flood Contingency Mapping and
Emergency Response Planning final product was completed in September 2011 and includes: standardized GIS database of Emergency Management Data; Flood Contingency Map Books and large
scale wall maps of the Delta region; and an accompanying report documenting the existing framework, existing data, and any potential data gaps.

Public Comments
 What flood risk management problems should this
study consider?
►

For Example - Population centers at X Location are
located behind levees that are subject to flooding due to
stability, seepage, and overtopping concerns which could
result in loss of life and flood damages.

 What ecological problems should this study
consider?
►

For Example - Levee construction in close proximity to X
Channel has resulted in separation of historic floodplains
from natural hydrologic flooding events through channels
within the Delta.

Ecosystem Restoration and Flood Risk Management
Senate Resolution, 1 June 1948; Sec. 205 Flood Control Act, 17 May 1950 (P.L. 81-516); Conference
Report 108-357 dated 7 Nov 2003 of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act
(EWDAA), 2004
The study area is located in Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano, Contra Costa, Alameda, and Yolo
counties, California and extends from Sacramento south to the cities of Stockton and Tracy, and west
to and including Suisun Bay. The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta consists of about 740,000 acres of
land segregated into some 80 tracts and islands and 1,100 miles of levees.
The Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study (Delta Study) is the Corps’ mechanism to participate in
a cost-shared solution to address ecosystem restoration, flood risk management, and related water
resources in the Delta and Suisun Marsh area. A Feasibility Cost Share Agreement (FCSA) was executed on May 26, 2006 with the DWR, the non-Federal sponsor. The Corps-DWR study team meets
regularly to move the study forward and holds periodic Agency Coordination Meetings with associated Federal, State, and local agencies. The study will culminate in a feasibility report that will make
recommendations on construction projects and/or additional studies for authorization by Congress.

FEDERAL INTEREST

The CA Bay-Delta Ecosystem of National Significance is home to over 750 plant and animal species
including over 35 species listed under the Endangered Species Act. Delta levees protect 500,000
inhabitants and protect the water supply of 25,000,000 Californians and a $28B agriculture industry
(10% of the nation’s output). This study will develop the long-term strategy for Corps projects in the
Delta region. The study will assess existing and future flood risks in the Delta, as well as opportunities
for ecosystem restoration, and develop a comprehensive roadmap for Corps involvement in a wide
range of water resources needs.

ACTIVITIES

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the California Department of Water Resources (DWR)
signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), allowing the Corps-DWR to initiate Phase 1 of GIS
Flood Contingency Mapping and Emergency Response Planning for the Delta region. The team met
with Delta counties in August 2010 to get input on concepts for the GIS products, response report,
and related data. The Corps held several additional rounds of meetings with local entities to validate
data collected throughout the process, and gather additional information from County and RD representatives.
Final products for Phase 1 include:



Standardized GIS database of Emergency Management data;



Flood Contingency Map Books and large scale wall maps of the Delta region; and



An accompanying report documenting the existing framework, existing data, and any potential
data gaps.

Phase 1 was completed in September of 2011. Printed documents will be provided to DWR and the
Delta counties prior to the 2011-2012 flood season. Electronic data available at:

PARTNERSHIP FUNDING

Up to $100,000 is available at full Federal expense to initiate Feasibility Phase activities, including preparing a Preliminary Draft Project Implementation Report (PDPIR), a Project Management Plan (PMP),
and to negotiate the Feasibility Cost Share Agreement (FCSA) for each project that proceeds
through the program. The cost share between the Corps and a non-Federal sponsor for Feasibility
Phase activities in the LSP beyond the initial $100k is 50/50. The cost share for design and construction
is 65% Corps/35% non-federal sponsor.

FY 10 & 11 ACTIVITIES The Bethel Island Municipal Improvement District was the first non-Federal sponsor to sign a Feasibility
Cost Share Agreement (FCSA) with the Corps on 13 July 2010 for the Bethel Island-Horseshoe Bend
Project. The Corps team completed draft Project Management Plans (PMPs) for four additional
Levee Stability Program projects, including McCormack-Williamson Tract, Bacon Island, WalnutGrove, and River Junction, and began development of a PMP and FCSA for Brannan-Andrus Levee
Maintenance District. In 2010 a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed between USACE
and DWR, allowing the Corps-DWR to initiate Phase 1 of GIS Flood Contingency Mapping and Emergency Response Planning for the Delta region. Phase 1 was completed in September 2011 and includes: standardized GIS database of Emergency Management Data; Flood Contingency Map
Books and large scale wall maps of the Delta region; and an accompanying report documenting
the existing framework, existing data, and any potential data gaps.
FY 12 & 13 ACTIVITIES The Bethel Island-Horseshoe Bend Project Feasibility Phase Study is currently underway; a completed
PIR and initiation of a Project Partnership Agreement is anticipated in FY14. The McCormackWilliamson Tract PMP and FCSA have been approved by the Corps’ Headquarters office.

Background

The Sacramento – San Joaquin Delta (Figure 1) is part of the largest estuary on the west coast of the
United States; is home to hundreds of species of fish, birds, mammals and reptiles; and has been named
an Ecosystem of National Significance through the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity
Conservation (EPBC) Act in 2011. Agricultural land irrigated by Delta water contributes billions of dollars
in production for the nation. Two deep water ports serve as economic engines for the Central Valley,
Northern California, and the western States and are reliant on Delta waters and Federal Deep Draft
Navigation Channels and levees for navigation. Delta levees protect such critical infrastructure as state
and interstate highways, National rail lines, natural gas fields, gas and fuel pipelines, water conveyance,
drinking water pipelines, and numerous businesses and towns.
The Delta is a web of channels and reclaimed islands at the confluence of the Sacramento, San Joaquin,
Cosumnes, Mokelumne, and Calaveras Rivers. Forty percent of California’s land area is contained within
the watersheds of these rivers. The Delta, which covers about 738,000 acres, interlaced with hundreds
of miles of waterways, is legally defined by Section 12220 of California Water Code (CWC). Much of the
land is below sea level and protected by a network of 1,100 miles of levees which have been
constructed over the past 150 years to manage the flow of water through the Delta. The land behind
the levees is predominantly agricultural (corn, wheat, vineyards, cattle) and waterways provide
recreational outlets for nearby urban areas and essential habitat for fish and wildlife. The Delta is also
the largest single source of California’s water supply, providing 25 million Californians with drinking
water and irrigating millions of acres of farmland in the Central Valley. In addition, more than 500,000
people live within the Delta and rely upon it for water, recreation, and livelihood. The majority of that
population is in the greater Sacramento and Stockton areas and is the focus of other Corps FRM studies,
though there are communities within the Delta. Several historic towns, known as “legacy communities,”
remain within the Delta, some of which are listed in the national registry of historic places.
Historically, the Delta was defined by tidal wetlands, primarily comprised of peat soils. The Swamp and
Overflow Land Act of 1850 transferred ownership of all swamp and overflow land, including Delta
marshes, from the federal government to the State. This Act began the reclamation of wetlands in the
Delta through the construction of levees and drainage channels, typically by the new land owners. The
majority of levees in the Delta are still privately owned and maintained. Nearly three fourths of the
Delta is now in agriculture.

Economic Analysis

The economic analysis was conducted in two phases: 1) screening phase and 2) analysis phase. In the
screening phase, information contained in the Delta Risk Management Study (DRMS) was used to help
determine which Delta Islands that have a high likelihood of meeting the study’s FRM objectives. Based
on the screening criteria described in the next section, the four Delta Islands which have the highest
likelihood of meeting the objectives were analyzed in more detail in the analysis phase.
2.1

Screening Phase

All of the information used to conduct the screening phase of this economic analysis was obtained from
various components of the DRMS. DRMS was developed by the California Department of Water
Resources (DWR) and completed in two phases; Phase 1 assessed the performance of Delta and Suisun
Marsh levees and evaluated the economic, environmental, and public health and safety consequences
of levee failures to California as a whole; Phase 2 developed and evaluated risk reduction strategies.
The use of DRMS information was chosen because it is the only recent comprehensive analysis on the
local and statewide consequences of Delta levee failures. The screening criteria used to help refine
Delta Islands Feasibility FRM measures for the screening phase include the following three components:
1. the ratio of total inundation repair costs to upgraded levee costs
2. life safety risk
3. significance of statewide importance
1. Ratio of Total Inundation Repair Costs to Upgraded Levee Costs
To calculate the ratio of total inundation repair costs to upgraded levee costs, information was
taken from both phases of the DRMS. The total inundation repair costs values are from the
DRMS Phase 1 Impact to Infrastructure Technical Memorandum (IITM); these costs represent
the repair cost for each asset on a particular Delta island, based on inundation depths, the
percent damage incurred, and the original value of the asset. The assets considered in the IITM
include: a) points assets: structures and buildings (and their contents), bridges, marinas, natural
gas fields/storage areas, natural gas wells, commercial and industrial buildings, residences, and
pump stations and b) linear assets: railroads, highways, shipping channels, transmission lines,
aqueducts, and gas and petroleum pipelines. Since inundation repair costs are similar to the
Corps concept of damages it was determined to be an appropriate numerator value for a
screening criterion ratio. The upgraded levee costs were taken from DRMS Phase II report
Upgraded Delta Levees (Section 4); these costs consist of upgrading non‐project Delta Levees to
PL 84‐99 or Urban Project Levee (UPL) standards. In DRMS, levees protecting urban centers
were selected for UPL upgrades and PL 84‐99 upgrades for all other areas. The higher the
relative ratio of total inundation repair costs to upgraded levee costs for a particular Delta island
the higher the rating for this criterion.

Economics Appendix ‐ Delta Islands
2. Life Safety Risk
Life safety risk is based entirely on Delta island population data obtained from the DRMS
Economic Consequences Technical Memorandum (ECTM). Delta islands that have higher
populations were considered to have a greater potential for life safely issues and thus a higher
rating for this criterion.
3. Significance of Statewide Importance
A measure’s significance of statewide importance was determined qualitatively by using the
findings contained in contained in the ECTM. If a Delta island contained an asset that would
impact the region or state during and after a flood event, then that island was rated with a
“Yes”, otherwise the island was rated with a “NO.” The categories of statewide significance
include: deepwater ship channels, electric transmission lines, highways, natural gas
transmission, Mokelumne Aqueduct, oil and gas wells, railroads, wastewater facilities, eight
western islands, and legacy communities.
For criteria 1 and 2, each Delta island was assigned a rating of high, medium, or low. For criterion 3,
each island was given a rating of Yes or No. The location measures that were assigned a “high” rating
are generally populated areas with relatively higher economic values and therefore are likely to be
included in the final array of measures as a more comprehensive, whole island levee improvement. The
measures that were assigned a “medium” rating are generally somewhat populated with more limited
economic values and therefore are likely to be included in the final array of measures as a more limited
structural or non‐structural solution. The measures that were assigned a “low” rating are sparsely
populated areas with limited to no infrastructure/economic value and were therefore dropped from
further considerations. This qualitative assessment was based on existing data from the DRMS and is
summarized below in Table 1 and Figure 2. The green, yellow, and red areas in Figure 2 represent
islands that were assigned a high, medium, and low ranking respectively.

Analysis Phase

The three Delta Islands with the highest ratio of total asset repair costs to total construction costs (from
DRMS data) and not included in a current Corps study were considered for further screening level
benefit‐cost analysis; the three islands include: Bethel Island, Walnut Grove, the City of Isleton (on
Brannon‐Andrus Island). Based on suggestions from the local sponsor and its high population, a fourth
island, Discovery Bay, was also considered for further analysis; these islands are highlighted in Figure 3.
The main analytical tool used to perform the economic analysis in the analysis phase was the Hydrologic
Engineering Center’s Flood Damage Analysis (HEC‐FDA) software (version 1.2.5). This program uses
engineering data (hydrologic, hydraulic, and geotechnical) and economic data (structure/content
inventory and depth‐percent damage curves) to model flooding risk management problems and
potential solutions in the study area. Through integration of the engineering and economic
relationships HEC‐FDA computes expected annual damages (EAD) and performance statistics. EAD is the
metric used to describe the consequences of flooding on an annual basis considering a full range of
flood events – from high frequency/small events to low frequency/large events over a long time horizon.
The following two sections describe the economic and engineering data that was used the HEC‐FDA
analysis.
2.2.1
2.2.1.1

Economic Data
Structure and Contents Inventory and Valuation

Structure values were based on overall average values that were developed for the Lower San Joaquin
River Feasibility Study (LSJRFS). Each residential structure’s value was assumed to be equal to the
average LSJRFS residential structure value. Residential content value was assumed to be equal to 50
percent of the structure value. Non‐residential structure values were estimated by multiplying the
Marshall and Swift calculator valuation per square foot value by the average LSJRFS non‐residential
structure square footage value for each business classification. Non‐residential content values were
taken from an expert elicitation that was performed to develop content values and content depth‐
percent damage curves for specific occupancy types for the 2008 American River Watershed, Folsom
Dam Raise and Modification Economic Reevaluation Report (ERR). Although the values and curves were
developed specifically for structures in the American River Watershed study area, the results of the
expert elicitation were extended to the Delta study area in light of its proximity to Sacramento and the
similarity of its structure types/construction types to those in Sacramento.
The number of structures for the study area was determined by Sacramento (Walnut Grove, Isleton) and
Contra Costa (Bethel Island, Discovery Bay) county level GIS parcel data. Structure type (e.g.,
commercial, industrial, public and residential) was determined by GIS attribute codes and cursory checks
using Google Earth. Automobiles were also included in the analysis and it was assumed one automobile
would be subjected to flooding per residential structure; automobile values were determined for
average used cars ($7,988) based on information from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of
Transportation.

2.2.1.2

Depth‐Percent Damage Curves

The depth of flooding is the primary factor in determining potential damages to structures, contents,
and automobiles. Depth‐percent damage functions were used in the HEC‐FDA models to estimate the
percent of value lost for these categories. Residential depth‐damage curves (structures and contents)
were taken from Economic Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 01‐03, Generic Depth‐Damage Relationships,
Non‐residential structure curves were based on revised Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) Flood Insurance Administration (FIA) curves. Non‐residential content depth‐percent damage
curves for were taken from expert elicitation that were completed for previously mentioned American
River studies. The depth‐percent damage functions for automobiles were based on averages from
curves developed by the Institute for Water Resources (IWR) and provided in EGM 09‐04, Generic
Depth‐Damage Relationships for Vehicles.

2.2.1.3

Economic Uncertainty

In HEC‐FDA, there are three areas of economic uncertainty that were considered for this study;
valuation (structure and contents), depth damage curves (structure and contents), and foundation
height. Values for structure valuation uncertainty were taken the 2012 Napa LRR Economic Appendix;
content value uncertainties were based on data from expert elicitation from the previously mentioned
American River Study. Residential structure and content depth‐percent damage curves are normally
distributed and uncertainty is measured as standard deviations of percent damages. Non‐residential
structure and content depth‐percent damage curves are triangularly distributed and include a minimum,
most likely, and maximum percent damage by depth of flooding. The uncertainty value for residential
foundation height was assumed to be 0.5 feet; which is typical for SPK studies.

2.2.2

2.2.2.1

Engineering Data

Hydrologic and Hydraulic Analysis

The hydrologic and hydraulic data that was input into HEC‐FDA include: floodplain data, stage‐
probability relationships, and period of record length (a hydrologic uncertainty measure). Floodplain
data includes depths of flooding associated with the 50%, 20%, 10%, 4%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, and 0.2% annual
chance exceedance (ACE) events; the floodplain data along with stage‐probability curves were provided
by SPK’s Hydraulic Analysis Section. The data used for stage, frequency, and uncertainty event analysis
originated from the 1992 Hydrology Office Report of the Sacramento‐San Joaquin Delta Special Study by
the Sacramento District (1992 Office Report). The 1992 Office Report was selected as the source for the
hydraulic data and determined to be sufficient for this analysis as it is contains the most recent
comprehensive hydrologic and hydraulic analysis of the Delta. To model the consequences of a flood
event a simplified inundation model for analysis in the form of a constant water surface elevation, or
stage, across the entire island was assumed. The stage values were taken from the 1992 Office Report.
Table 2 shows the 1992 Office Report chart that was applied to each of the four islands along with the
15

Economics Appendix ‐ Delta Islands
corresponding stage for each ACE. The uncertainty associated with the data will be evaluated using the
appropriate period of record which is also listed the Table 2. See Appendix C‐ Engineering (Flood Risk
Management) for a more detailed analysis and discussion on Delta: risk, hydrology and hydraulics.

Geotechnical Analysis

Levee fragility curve data was provided by SPK’s Geotechnical Branch; a levee fragility curve shows the
probabilities of failure at different water surface elevations against a levee. Fragility curves are a main
component of the economic modeling and in determining the economic damages of flood events. For
this analysis, fragility curves were developed for Bethel Island, Walnut Grove and Isleton using
information contained in the DRMS Levee Vulnerability Technical Memorandum. Please see Appendix
C‐ Engineering (Flood Risk Management) for additional geotechnical information.

Benefit Cost Analysis

Values listed in this section are based on an October 2012 price level. Annualized benefits and costs
were computed using a 50‐year period of analysis and a federal water resource discount rate of 3.750%
as this was the current rate during the development of the flood risk management (FRM) and
multipurpose economic analysis.
2.3.1

Without Project Analysis

The future without project condition assumed that the capital features of DWR’s Bay Delta Conservation
Plan (BDCP) will be in place. Solutions under consideration by the BDCP include a dual water
conveyance system, which would create options that would move water through the Delta’s interior or
around the Delta through an isolated conveyance facility (tunnel). As such, any potential flood damages
to existing Delta water conveyance features are not included in the without project analysis as the BDCP
conveyance features will provide a means to convey water through or around the Delta. In addition,
there are no structural FRM measures to protect existing Delta water conveyance features considered in
the with‐project analysis. See the Main Report for a more detailed discussion regarding the future
without project condition.
Structure counts for the four main building categories are listed by island in Table 3a, and represent
those structures falling within the 500‐year floodplain. Without project EAD by major damage area and
population at risk (2010 census) are reported in Tables 3b and 4 respectively.

Annual Exceedance Probability

Annual exceedance probability (AEP) is a statistic used to describe the chance of flooding in any given
year within a designated area. AEP is computed in HEC‐FDA using engineering data; AEPs for the four
islands are reported in Table 5a.

Assurance

Assurance, describes the likelihood of a stream/river being able to pass a specific flow event, for
example the 100‐year flow. The assurance statistics provide relevant information to decision makers in
that it helps describe both how well the flood system currently performs and how well the system could
potentially perform under various with‐project scenarios.
The assurance statistics for each island under the without‐project condition are listed in Table 5b.
Taking Bethel Island for example, the information indicates there is a 66% chance of passing the 10%
flow event and 60% chance of passing the 1% flow event.

With Project Analysis

For this screening level analysis, there were no floodplains or other engineering data developed for
with‐project conditions. To develop estimates for with‐project damages, two scenarios were
considered; 1) Zero with‐project damages (or best case scenario), the Corps project would yield no
residual damages, and 2) 25 percent remaining damages (or a typical case scenario); the Corps project
would eliminate 75 percent of without‐project damages. The zero with‐project damages scenario is the
highest level of flood risk management (FRM) performance any Corps project could expect to yield;
whereas, the 25 percent remaining with‐project damages are more in line with the FRM performance of
a typical Corps project. The with‐project EADs for both scenarios are reported in Tables 6 and 7.

FRM Costs

Cost estimates for each island and measure were provided by the SPK’s Cost Engineering Section. Total
and annual FRM construction costs are shown in Table 10. All costs are annualized based on the fiscal
year 2013 federal water resource discount rate of 3.75 percent. The costs reported in Table 10 do not
include interest during construction. See Appendix E ‐ Cost Engineering for additional measure
descriptions and cost information.

Multi‐Purpose Analysis

As there was no overlap in the geographic footprints of the ER and FRM measures, opportunities do not
exist to simply combine measures into multi‐purpose measures. However, opportunities may exist to
incorporate smaller scale ER measures in some of the higher ranking FRM areas. Of the highest ranking
FRM areas, the two best candidates for multi‐purpose measures were found to be Bethel Island and
Walnut Grove. The opportunity to include ecosystem restoration into these FRM areas was largely
based on land use; portions of the island were used solely for agriculture and could contribute to ER
objectives if reconnected to the waterways. In order to determine if it was warranted to further pursue
these measures, an economic analysis was first completed on the FRM elements, as described below.
3.1

Multipurpose Economic Analysis

There were two multipurpose measures considered for further screening level analysis: 1) Bethel Island
Measure A (see Figure 3) and 2) Walnut Grove Measure B (see Figure 4). Both of these measures would
restore sustainable ecosystem functions in the Delta while improving FRM for developed areas. A
benefit‐cost analysis was performed to determine if a multipurpose measure could be economically
feasible based on FRM specific benefits and FRM separable costs. If a multipurpose measure’s FRM
benefits are less than the FRM separable costs, then that multipurpose measure will not be
economically justified regardless of the level ecosystem restoration benefits. Under USACE policy,
ecosystem restoration benefits cannot be used to justify FRM separable costs.
Table 12 contains the FRM separable costs for the two multipurpose measures; the costs in this table
only include FRM separable costs and do not include joint costs. FRM separable costs are the costs that
are required only for the FRM benefits of the measure, whereas joint costs are required for both FRM
and ecosystem restoration benefits. In Figure 3, the FRM separable costs of the Bethel Island Measure A
are the costs to construct levee feature BI_A_2 (orange line) while the joint costs are the costs to
construct setback levee feature BI_A_1 (or green line). In Figure 4, the FRM separable costs of Walnut
Grove Measure B are the costs to construct levee features WG_B_1 (red line), WG_B_3 (orange line) and
WG_B_4 (yellow line), whereas the joint costs are the costs to construct setback levee feature WG_B_2
(blue line).

Multipurpose Objective Net Benefits

The FRM specific net benefits and BCRs of the two multipurpose measures are shown in Table 15. As a
best‐case scenario, the FRM benefits were assumed to be equal to the total without‐project FRM
damages (i.e., a zero percent remaining damages with‐project scenario). The two measures would have
negative net benefits and BCRs below unity even under that best‐case scenario. The highest BCR is 0.62
for Bethel Island Measure A under the zero percent remaining damages with‐project scenario. Since
each multipurpose measure has a FRM negative net benefit, which indicates FRM specific benefits are
less than the FRM separable costs, these multipurpose measures cannot be economically justified as
ecosystem restoration benefits and costs are added.

FRM and multipurpose alternatives were found to be economically infeasible, therefore structural FRM
alternatives were not evaluated further. However, there may still be non‐structural measures to reduce
risk within the study area as further described within the main report.

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.1

Purpose

On February 2012, Major General Walsh, Deputy Commanding General for Civil Works and
Emergency Operations issued a memorandum of feasibility study program execution and
delivery. This memorandum issued guidance for the current portfolio of feasibility studies to
produce a more efficient, effective, and quality decision document and introduced the 3x3x3 rule
for USACE planning studies. In deference to the memorandum, this technical memorandum
presents the feasibility-level hydraulic evaluation of the existing conditions, conclusions, and
recommendations for the Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study (DILFS). This
memorandum has been developed in accordance with our new Planning Paradigm using the
“SMART” Planning Criteria.
According to the USACE Planning Community Toolbox ,“SMART” is a mnemonic giving
criteria to guide in the setting of project management objectives that shifts the emphasis from
discipline specific tasks to multi-criterion decision making. The letters conform to the words
Specific, Measureable, Attainable, Risk-Informed, and Timely. The development and use of
these criteria in the context of the USACE SMART Planning are described below:
1. The “Specific” criterion stresses the need for a specific goal rather than a more general one.
For DILFS our specific criteria is to identify projects and features within the study area that
can be evaluated within USACE business lines, for a recommendation of USACE
investment. For this study, alternatives that focus on Ecosystem Restoration and Flood Risk
Management are the USACE business lines are under evaluation.
2. The “Measurable” criterion stresses the need to develop concrete criteria for measuring
progress toward plan selection of the Tentatively Selected Plan. For DILFS our measurement
requirement, or decision criteria, is defined by a system evaluation criterion in the form of
National Economic Benefit (NED), Environmental Quality (EQ), Regional Economic
Development (RED), Other Social Effects (OSE), Cost, and Real Estate evaluation.
3. The “Attainable” criterion stresses the importance of project alternatives that are realistic
and attainable, or actionable, and are in the national interest. Following the evaluation of
alternatives using the measurable criteria listed above, a comparison of measures using the
system of accounts, multi-criteria Decision and Trade-off analyses are completed to inform
the recommendation of a Plan.
4. The fourth criterion, “Risk-Informed,” stresses the importance of using risk analysis to
improve decision making under uncertainty. For the DILFs Study the USACE is working in
coordination with the State of California’s Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP) and the
Delta Risk Management Strategy (DRMS) to leverage the USACE’s national objective to
develop water resources projects based on sound science that maximize net national
economic, environmental, and social benefits. Another key performance guideline gives
priority to projects that address a significant risk to human safety.
5. The final criterion is “Timely” and stresses the importance for grounding project goals
within a timeframe along with a commitment to a deadline in order to focus team efforts for
study completion. The SMART feasibility study process uses a series of study milestones to
3

ensure all of the discipline specific study efforts meet the 3-year SMART Planning
objective.
This feasibility-level SMART planned study hydraulic evaluation and recommendations are
based upon a summary of existing, best available knowledge of hydrology and hydraulics in the
Sacramento San Joaquin Delta. The information presented is intended to guide the Project
Delivery Team’s focus away from legacy, task driven, efforts to the new risk-informed decision
making orientation in the selection of alternatives and measures. The conclusions and
recommendations presented in this report are generalized for local conditions and uncertainties
about the values given in this report have been identified within the Study Risk Register.

Background

The image part with relationship ID rId9 was not found in the file.

The Central Valley of California,
here illustrated in Figure 1-1, is
defined by a watershed drainage
area of 59,380 square miles, and
includes the Sacramento River
(27,580 square mile watershed)
which flows south from the
Sacramento Valley and the San
Joaquin River (31,800 square mile
watershed) which flows north
from the San Joaquin Valley. The
Calaveras and Mokelumne Rivers
flow from the east into the
Sacramento San Joaquin Delta.
The Sacramento - San Joaquin
Delta (Delta) as defined for this
study, extending east of the
Carquinez Straight through
Suisun Bay to the northeast along
the Sacramento River to Freeport,
southeast along the San Joaquin
River to Vernalis, and through the
network of islands and levees east
Figure 1- 1 Sacramento – San Joaquin River Basins
to Stockton. The Delta is a
controlled system of over 700 miles of interconnected waterways and islands protected by
approximately 1,100 miles of levees that include approximately 400 miles of federal levees. The
levees are aging and under threat from subsidence, animal burrowing, earthquakes, wind and
wave action, floods, high tides, and sea level rise.

Prior to the DILFS study SMART Planning
reformulation, the primary task hydraulics’
focused on was the development of a
comprehensive framework of hydrodynamic
models. The models included in the framework are
the USACE “AD”aptive Hydraulic Model (ADH),
and the Environmental Protection Agencies’
(EPA) Environmental Fluid Dynamics code
(EFDC) model. The ADH model was selected to
allow the modeling of intricate and transient
model domains such as levee failures, sediment
transport, navigation, and detailed hydraulic
structures in large systems. EFDC fits well within
the framework as it is a 3-dimensional
hydrodynamic, sediment transport, water quality,
and linked ecosystem model. This framework of
models will enable USACE to simulate existing
conditions and system-wide impacts of natural and
purposeful changes to the Delta in order to
proactively manage this vital water resource. The physical process model, created in EFDC, is a
comprehensive framework of numerical models necessary to advance the understanding of the
system-wide effects of natural changes and
improvement projects including changes in
water levels, flows, salinity, water quality, and
consequently the ecosystem. The EFDC model
is an open-source, general purpose modeling
package supported by the US EPA for
simulating multi-dimensional flow and
transport in surface waters and has been used
for hundreds of estuarine applications
worldwide. Our effort to date and has been
Agency Technically Reviewed (ATR’ed)
through the efforts of ERDC’s Environmental
Lab. Please see figure 1-3 for the major
submodels in EFDC.

submodel within EFDC simulates both

Figure 1-1-2 Major Components of EFDC
within EFDC simulates the transport of
nutrients, dissolved oxygen, up to 3 algae
classes, eutrophication and sediment diagenesis. The hydrodynamic and water quality models
serve as drivers for the Comprehensive Aquatic System (CASM) ecosystem model and the
ELAM fish movement behavior model. The EFDC development efforts to date and the resulting
model analyses have been used to identify areas of high shear stress and tidal impacts of the delta
5

and have been used to analyze risk in the Delta. Both the ADH and the EFDC models have been
developed, calibrated, and validated to simulate existing conditions in the Delta. Additional
refinements and analysis using our comprehensive modeling framework have been placed on
hold until federal interest has been identified and future work authorized.

Data Sources for the Delta Levee System Risk and Vulnerability Analysis

1.3.1

Previous work for this project includes studies done by the State of California
Department of Water (DWR). The Corps of Engineers supported the joint state-federal
Delta Risk Management Strategy (DRMS) effort that has produced detailed reports on
risks and risk management for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. These documents
provided much of the risk informed data included in this memorandum. Important
sections for DRMS can be found at:
http://www.water.ca.gov/floodsafe/fessro/levees/drms/ .

1.3.2

The hydrology used for the subsequent downscaling of the hydraulic analysis effort to
support SMART Planning of the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta FRM analysis was the
1992 Sacramento District Office Report labeled “Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Special
Study. This report will serve as the baseline data source for the simplified Inundation
modeling framework used in the simplified hydraulic analysis whose output will be
used as input for the project economic decision model. This report presents stagefrequency curves for 24 tide gage locations, wave runup data for 12 locations and 1:50-,
1:100-, and 1:300 ACE maximum water surface elevation plots around the islands of
the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta. The stage-frequency curves in this report are
updates to the stage-frequency presented in a similarly named document dated
December 1976. Data in this 1992 report include stage data recorded through water year
1988. Stage values given in the 1992 report have been converted to NAVD’88 values
via the NGS website VertCon conversion at the URL listed below.
http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/VERTCON/vert_con.prl.

1.3.3

The topographic and bathymetric datasets used for this spatial analysis were supplied by
the Bay Delta Office of the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) from
two different sources. The first source is the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta Digital Elevation Model (DEM) developed by Rueen-Fang Wang and Eli
Ateljevich of DWR. This product is a set of mutually consistent 10m and 2m integrated
elevation maps (DEM) in standard ASCII format. This product was developed based on
synthesizing LiDAR, single- and multibeam sonar soundings and existing integrated
maps collated from multiple sources. Figure 1-2 below shows the data sources used for
different areas. The western part of the Bay-Delta work blends the original Foxgrover
dataset with the 1/3 arc second DEM produced by NOAA. For more information
regarding this dataset please refer to the URL listed below.
http://baydeltaoffice.water.ca.gov/modeling/deltamodeling/modelingdata/DEM.cfm
The second DWR Bay-Delta dataset used for this analysis is the CVFED Delta LiDAR
collected in March and April of 2008. This dataset has a vertical accuracy of 0.6 ft
Consolidated (1.96 x RMSEz), and 0.6 ft Fundamental (95th) percentile; Horizontal
6

accuracy of 3.5 ft (1.75 x RMSEx,y). Native Projection and datum is UTM 10N,
NAD83, US Foot; Vertical Datum NAVD’88. This dataset is void of bathymetric or
hydrographic data and was used as a consistency check for in-island terrain analysis.
1.4

Delta Levee System Risk and Vulnerability Analysis Summary

The National Research Council [NRC1994] defines risk analysis as having three core elements.
They are risk assessment, risk management, and, risk communication.
The first element of risk analysis is risk assessment and it is the process through which the
probability of loss within a system is estimated and the magnitude, or consequence, is also
measured or estimated. Risk management is the process through which the potential frequency of
magnitude and contributing factors to risk are estimated, evaluated, minimized, and controlled.
Risk communication is the process through which information about the nature of risk and
consequences are communicated to support Risk-Informed decision making.
This analysis uses the best available existing information to assemble composite risk
management information useful to USACE for Risk-Informed decision making. It summarizes
the Delta Risk Management Study (DRMS); expresses the DRMS and other findings in terms of
the USACE’s Composite Risk Management matrix; and examines the results for management
decision support.
Army and Corps of Engineers guidance documents define risk as the “probability and severity of
loss linked to hazards” and prescribe a composite risk assessment method to be used in USACE
projects. The Delta Risk Management Strategy Phase 1 and 2 reports are sound and rigorous
analyses of the relative probability of hazards and severity of risks in the Delta and provide the
information needed for risk analysis compliance within Corps of Engineers’ requirements.
The tables listed in the body of this document below provide rank-ordered lists of the highest risk
zones – those with the greatest probability of failure combined with the most severe
consequences. Those tables and the Appendices are used in this DILFS risk management
framework to identify needed risk management efforts.
While uncertainties in the absolute magnitude of the results make them most useful for
comparisons, the actual values of the probabilities and consequences are alarming. For example,
Sargent Barnhart Tract, northwest of Stockton, has a mean annual failure rate of 0.07, or an
expected levee failure every 14 years, with a probable 96 fatalities for a nighttime seismicinduced failure. Adjacent tracts with only slightly lower failure probabilities put another 500
lives at risk. Zone SM-124 has a projected failure rate of 0.5, or once every 2 years, with
maximum possible damages exceeding $250 million. The Sacramento Pocket Area, with a mean
annual failure rate of 0.006, has over $9 billion at risk.

While refinements to these risk estimates are possible, this report and the Delta Risk
Management Strategy analyses provide more than sufficient evidence that flooding in the
Sacramento –San Joaquin Delta presents significant risks to California and the nation. Hundreds
of lives and billions of dollar damages are at high probability of occurrence. Urgent action is
necessary to manage those risks.

2.0 DELTA RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY (DRMS)
The California Department of Water Resources commissioned the Delta Risk Management
Study (DRMS) on behalf of the CALFED agencies – more than 20 state and Federal
organizations with resource management responsibilities in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.
The purposes of the DRMS were to:
… assess expected performance of Delta and Suisun Marsh levees (under various
stressors and hazards) and the potential economic, environmental, and public health
and safety consequences of levee failures to the Delta region and to California as a
whole (Phase 1). After the completion of Phase 1, the purpose of DRMS is to address
the consequences of levee failures by developing and evaluating risk reduction
strategies (Phase 2). (URS/JBA 2008)

The DRMS Phase 1 report was published (still labeled as a draft) in October 2008, following a
final revision in response to reviews by a panel of independent peer reviewers. Those documents
(URS/JBA 2008 and CALFED Science Program Independent Review Panel 2008) are used here
for the DRMS Phase 1 findings. Phase 2 findings were reported in URS/JBA (2011)
2.1

Hazards and Assessment Measures

DRMS evaluated three hazard categories as potential threats to Delta and Suisun levees:
• Seismic Events
• Hydrologic Events (floods)
• Normal Events
Seismic events were expressed as the probability of a given ground motion in each area of the
Delta for an earthquake of a given type and magnitude on a given fault. Flood events were
expressed in terms of a combined probability of water level occurrence, given (a) inflows from
all streams using a Log-Pearson Type III distribution of historical flows plus the predicted
change in flow probabilities arising from climate change; and (b) tidal elevation probabilities
from historical gauged water level stations adjusted for projected sea level rise. Normal events
included non-seismic, non-flood events, such as those precipitated by high tides, rodent damage,
etc. Sea level change and climate change were considered to be part of the Delta environment
(i.e., not hazards), with an associated probability for each in a given year (2005 (base year),
2050, and 2100). Detailed zone-by-zone analysis was performed for 2005 conditions. For future

9

conditions, analyses predicted the overall changes of risk for the Delta. Section 3.3 of this report
(below) summarizes the future risks.
For each category the threat was quantified in terms of a “Hazard Analysis” or probability of
occurrence and a “Levee Vulnerability Analysis” that is the conditional probability of failure for
a levee. A “System Model” was used to evaluate the combination of events and levee damage for
a number of threat scenarios.
The System Model considered the combination of a hazard and levee vulnerability to have three
possible levee outcomes – No Damage, Damage without Breaching, and Breaching. The latter
two were assumed to constitute events with consequences – Emergency Response costs for
Damage without Breaching and all assumed consequences (next section) for Breaching. The
result was a tree-structure sequence of events and consequences (Section 3.3 below). For more
information regarding the system model please refer to the DRMS URL listed above.
2.2

Consequences and Assessment Methods

Consequences of levee failures and subsequent flooding were considered in three main
categories:
• Life Safety
• Water Quality
• Economic
Consequences were evaluated quantitatively where possible and qualitatively otherwise. They
were also evaluated on a per-island and Delta/state-wide basis. Per-island economic
consequences were evaluated for 182 individual zones – islands and a few non-island areas
adjacent to the levees – for life loss and damage costs specific to those zones, which are mapped
in Figure 4-1. Delta-wide and state-wide consequences were presented for scenarios of 1 to 50
islands experiencing levee failure.
Life safety impacts were evaluated for life-loss probability using a simplified form of the
LIFESim model (Aboelata et al. 2003) which considered six scenarios of flood, seismic, and
sunny day failures during daytime and nighttime through evaluations of:
• Flood routing
• Population exposure
• Warning and evacuation
The System Model assessed the potential for events that would damage the levees and included
uncertainty for natural variability (aleatory uncertainty) and for limited knowledge (epistemic
uncertainty). The DRMS Phase 1 report described it as:
The system model defines the relationship between hazards and their possible
combination to assess the state of the Delta immediately after an event (e.g., an
earthquake of magnitude [M] 6 on the Hayward Fault). The term “state-of-the- Delta”
refers to the condition of all levees and islands immediately after the event. Given an
earthquake and the probabilistic nature of levee performance (see levee vulnerability
10

above), numerous combinations exist in which various levees will breach and different
islands flood. The system model describes the potential combination of events and the
framework for calculating their frequency of occurrence. Each combination of flooded
islands is referred to as a levee failure sequence.
The system model also models islands that have not flooded, but whose levees may be
damaged and could deteriorate (as a result of wave action) and result in further island
flooding. Other factors or random events such as the time of year an event occurs, the
type of hydrologic water year, etc. are also included in the system model because of
their importance in assessing the hydrodynamic response to and consequences of levee
failures. (URS/JBA 2008)

The analysis showed that 10 zones had at least a 10 percent probability of 100 deaths or more if a
breach occurred in their protecting levees:

Future Risks

Future risks were considered in terms of the 2005 hazards as they might change with time and
also as the Delta environment – climate, sea level, landscape, levee condition, population,
infrastructure, and economics – may change over the next 200 years.
The fundamental conclusion of the DRMS future risks analysis (Section 14 in URS/JBA 2008)
was that all significant risk factors will increase with time, some modestly (e.g., tidal amplitude)
and others dramatically (e.g., population). Table 3-1 shows the expected increases in flood risk
factors for 2050 and 2100 under low, medium, and high change scenarios.

Risk Management (DRMS Phase 2)

DRMS Phase 2 (URS/JBA 2011) developed and evaluated strategies to manage risk of Delta
levee failures. Strategies were formulated in terms of “building blocks” of individual
improvements which could be combined in specific plans or “scenarios” for evaluation.
Building blocks presented in the Phase 2 report were:
•

•
•

Conveyance Improvements / Flood Risk Reduction and Life Safety
– Improved Delta Levee Maintenance
– Upgraded Delta Levees
– Enhanced Emergency Preparedness/Response
– Pre-Flooding of Selected Islands
– Land Use Changes to Reduce Island Subsidence
– Armored Pathway through Delta Conveyance (TDC)
– Isolated Conveyance Facility Alternatives (ICF)
– San Joaquin Bypass & San Joaquin River Widening
Infrastructure Risk Reduction
– Raising State Highways and Placing them on Piers,
– Bypass Construction of an Armored Infrastructure Corridor across Central Delta
Environmental Risk Mitigation
– Suisun Marsh Tidal Wetland Restoration
– Tidal Marsh Cache Slough Restoration
– Install Fish Screens
– Setback Levees to Restore Shaded Riverine Habitat
– Reduce Water Exports from the Delta

These building blocks were combined into four scenarios for detailed evaluation:
• Improved Levees
• Armored Pathway (Through-Delta Conveyance)
• Isolated Conveyance Facility
• Dual Conveyance

Evaluation of Results

The DRMS Phase 1 Draft 4 report (URS/JBA 2008) was reviewed by the CALFED Science
Program Independent Review Panel (2008). Their report stated:
… the revised DRMS Phase 1 Report is acceptable for use as a tool for
informing policymakers and others regarding potential resource allocations and
strategies to address risk in the Delta region, provided that some important
caveats (detailed below) are well understood. The first caveat is common to any
broad analysis that relies on a series of linked models. In such analyses, caution
is imperative when interpreting scenarios that deviate substantially from baseline
conditions. In the case of the DRMS analysis, baseline conditions are the 2005
base - year results. Predictions of conditions 20 to 30 years into the future are
inherently highly uncertain, and reliable predictions of conditions 50 to 100 years
into the future are virtually impossible. We therefore caution that future estimates
of consequences must be viewed as projections that can indicate potential
directions of effects, not predictions to be interpreted literally. In a related issue,
the IRP cautions readers and users of the DRMS report to avoid the common
mistake of equating precision with accuracy. Precision is the exactness of the
reported results. Accuracy is how close the predictions are to truth. The DRMS
analysis involves many computer-based calculations that can be reported with
very high precision, from which it is often tempting to infer great accuracy. In turn,
15

this could lead to misinterpretation of the DRMS results, and thus to incorrect
decisions.
The second caveat is specific to the DRMS analysis and is due to the minimal
ecosystem consequences that are actually assessed in the revised DRMS Phase
I Report. Estimates of the effect of island flooding on vegetation and wildlife were
much reduced from what was described in the methods section of the first draft
of the DRMS Phase I Report and in the Impact to Ecosystems Technical
Memoranda (TM). Furthermore, there was no assessment of consequences for
aquatic resources (i.e., fish). With ecosystem consequences minimally
represented in the current DRMS models, and with fish absent from the
predictions, the IRP believes this could easily lead to erroneous interpretations of
DRMS model results. Thus, anyone using the results of the DRMS scenarios
must be very aware that ecosystem effects are not fully captured in the analysis,
and that, in particular, the lack of ecosystem consequences reported does not
imply small ecosystem impacts. Rather, the IRP notes that some scenarios could
result in extremely large ecosystem disturbances, but these impacts will not be
quantified because ecosystem consequences are inadequately accounted for in
the current DRMS modeling framework.
The IRP believes that these caveats require users of the DRMS model
framework to exercise due diligence to ensure scientifically credible
interpretations of the results.

To these caveats can be added that the DRMS analysis, as comprehensive as it was, did not
include consideration of human-induced threats, such as terrorism and vandalism, nor did it
include the compounding effect of an upstream dam break on flood levels.
Previous work for this project includes studies done by the local sponsors, the State of California
Department of Water (DWR). DWR conducted a study of the Delta under the Delta Risk
Management Study (DRMS). This work was reviewed and utilized as part of the basis of our
evaluation of the existing conditions. The probability of failure curves for the existing condition
was directly converted to a format that is compatible with the USACE Flood Damage
Assessment (FDA) model. These reports indicate that most of the Delta islands and tracks are
vulnerable to failure from underseepage and from deformation as a result of seismic activity.
The extent to which each reach fails to meet design criteria varies, but without exception, each
island or tract has locations that have a high probability of failure, often along multiple reaches.

3.0 SACRAMENTO-SAN JOAQUIN DELTA LEVEE RISK ASSESSMENT
To achieve the first objective of presenting available Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta levee risk
information in a matrix form consistent with USACE and Army policies and suitable for

16

identifying areas of USACE concern, pertinent data were extracted from the DRMS Phase 1
report (URS/JBA 2008):
•
•

•

Predicted levee breach probability from Table 13-8, expressed as “Annual Mean Number
of Failures.
Predicted Damage cost estimates from Tables 12-7 and 12-8, for flooding by a 100-year
river flood, expressed as the sum of:
– “Repair Costs”
– “Differential Repair Costs for Point Assets” (Scour)
– “Differential Repair Costs for Linear Assets” (Scour)
Predicted maximum potential facilities caused by levee breaching from Table 12C,
expressed as “Breach Mean (Life Loss)”.

All the estimates extracted from the DRMS report were for calendar year 2005. The extracted
data are listed in Appendix B and are discussed further below.
3.1

Translation Approach

Histograms of the DRMS data were constructed to determine logical intervals for the Hazard and
Consequences matrices described in Army Field Manual 5-19 and Engineer Circular EC 1110-26062 (USACE 2011c). Economic damages and human fatalities were examined separately, but
both analyses employed the same levee breach probability intervals. Finally, each island or other
analysis zone (both referred to as “zones” hereafter) was assigned a category from 1 (low) to 5
(high) for both the hazard probability (levee breach) and the consequences (damages and
fatalities), producing a matrix of 25 possible combinations. The intervals for each are shown in
Table 4-2, Life Loss, and Table 4-3, Economic Damages.
Two Risk Indices – Breach Mean Life Loss and Predicted Damage – were computed for each
zone using Equation 2-1, the product of the Annual Mean Number of Failures and the
consequences divided by a Normalizing Value. The Normalizing Variable in Equation 2-1 was
chosen to be the maximum value of the numerator, so that the Risk Indices range from 0 to 1.
Choice of intervals for grouping the failure rates and consequences is somewhat arbitrary and
can be changed if needed, using the calculated Risk Indices to refine the analysis, creating more
or fewer categories, according to the application.
Tables showing the calculation details are presented in Appendix B. Extracts are presented and
discussed below.
3.2

Translated Hazards and Consequences Matrices

The Risk Matrix, with 5 Levee Failure Rate categories and 5 Life Loss categories, results in 25
possible pairs, which are aggregated into 5 Risk Levels labeled and color coded as shown in
Table 4-1. Table 4-2 shows the Life Loss matrix with the number of zones that fall within each

Table 4-4 lists the zones with the greatest Life Loss Risk Index, sorted by Risk Index and colorcoded by Table 4-1 category. Tracts Sargent Barnhart 2, Smith, Shima, and Lincoln Village all
have Risk Indices greater than 0.5, with maximum mean life loss values of 100 or greater and
more than 0.02 mean failures per year. Boggs Tract, Sherman Island and Bethel Island come
next, all in the Highest Risk category. Interspersed Higher and High categories in Table 4-3
illustrate the imprecise nature of the matrix at the boundaries between two categories.
Table 4-5 lists the zones with the greatest Damage Costs Risk Index, sorted by Risk Index and
color-coded by category. SM-124, not appearing in Table 4-4, has the greatest Risk Index of 1,
followed by Sargent Barnhart Tract with 0.6. Sacramento Pocket Area, Discovery Bay, Lincoln
Village, and Smith Tract follow, all with Damage Costs Risk Indices greater than 0.2.
Table 4-6 compares the Risk Indices for the zones with the greatest combined risk categories. It
also demonstrates that Life Loss and Damage Cost predictions were not available for all zones,
including some of those with substantial threats. Appendix B identifies those with missing
predictions.

Sea Level Rise

The incorporation of future sea-level rise was accounted per USACE Engineering Circular 11652-212. The modified National Research Council’s (NRC) equations accounts for historic global
mean sea level and local meal sea level change were used to calculate the potential sea level rise.
Curve I is based on the historical rate of sea level rise. Curve II reflects an intermediate estimate
of the future rate of sea level rise. Curve III reflects a high estimate of the future rate of sea level
rise. A table was provided to Economics with 10 year intervals beginning from year 2015 to

Evaluation of Results

As was pointed out in the DRMS report, significant uncertainties are inherent in these analyses,
and the Department of the Army approach does not reduce those uncertainties. However, the
results can be extremely useful when used in a comparative sense and with careful application of
sound judgment. For example, decisions about the priority of levee improvements between

22

23

24

Bethel Island and Boggs Tract using Table 4-6 alone are inadvisable: the differences between
their Life Loss and Damage Cost indices are small and statistically insignificant, respectively.
However, Sargent Barnhart Tract 2 is shown by Table 4-6 to be clearly at greater Risk (indices of
1 and 0.6) than either Bethel or Boggs. In the absence of other information, Sargent Barnhart
Tract would clearly be a levee repair and rehabilitation priority over most other zones shown.
Table 4-7 below lists the zones that appear in the DRMS report “Significant Island” list and
Tables 4-4 and 4-5 of this report. Zones that appear in all three lists are highlighted in dark tan
and those on two of the lists are highlighted in a lighter tan. Using the results in a comparative
sense would again suggest that those on two or three lists be considered for early improvements,
but in light of all factors relative to USACE projects.

These results show that translating the risks of Delta flooding into a form compatible with
Department of the Army and Corps of Engineers requirements does not change the overall
conclusions to be drawn from the DRMS effort and report. However, this translation makes the
results compliant with Army and Corps of Engineers Regulations and produces a different
prioritized list for management action.
Events of recent years – Hurricane Katrina, Deepwater Horizon explosion, and Tohoku
earthquake-tsunami – illustrate the horrific effects of low-probability, high consequence events
for which society was ill prepared. The analysis presented here is deliberately biased towards
high consequence events – large potential life loss and damage costs – in order to keep them in
focus for the DILFS/CALFED effort.
While uncertainties in the absolute magnitude of the results make them most useful for
comparisons, the actual values of the probabilities and consequences are alarming. For example,
Sargent Barnhart Tract, northwest of Stockton, has a mean annual failure rate of 0.07, or an
expected levee failure every 14 years, with a probable 96 fatalities for a nighttime seismicinduced failure. Adjacent tracts with only slightly lower failure probabilities put another 500

29

lives at risk. Zone SM-124 has a projected failure rate of 0.5, or once every 2 years, with
maximum potential damages exceeding $250 million 1. The Sacramento Pocket Area, with a
mean annual failure rate of 0.006, has over $9 billion at risk.
3.5

Final Site Selection for FRM Analysis

Using a systems approach, the analysis described above uses the best available information to
assemble risk management information useful to USACE for Risk-Informed decision making. It
summarizes the Delta Risk Management Study (DRMS); expresses the DRMS and other findings
in terms of the USACE’s Composite Risk Management matrix (See Appendix A); and examines
the results for management decision support.
Using CRM described above we have used Risk-Informed decision making to reduce the study
effort from more than 70 Islands in the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta to the “Top 25” in terms
of Life loss and infrastructure damage consequences. Using additional management controls we
can further refine the list through the elimination of those “Top 25” islands located within the
footprint of other ongoing USACE Planning efforts. These efforts include the American River
Common Features Study and the West Sacramento Studies to the north, and the Lower San
Joaquin Study to the south. By eliminating the islands within the footprint of other planning
studies currently underway we can further refine the list and focus on those remaining “Top 25”.
In order to evaluate the sensitivity of our decision criterion we started by analyzing the 3 of the
next remaining islands of the “Top 25” and adding a fourth, Discovery Bay, from input by our
sponsor . By selecting to carry out an FRM analysis of the four islands on the list that have the
next highest life loss and infrastructure damage consequences we can evaluate the need to
analyze the remaining islands on the list. Listed below are the islands the PDT has selected to
analyze in terms of Flood Risk Management:

Brannen Andrus Island (Isleton), and
Discovery Bay

4.0 FLOOD RISK ANALYSIS
All 1,100+ miles of Delta levees surrounding each island are made up of sediment dredged from
adjacent channels, excavated from island interiors, or imported from other areas by truck or
barge. The height of a levee surrounding any island is a function of the depth of subsidence and
the magnitude of water elevation change, due either to tides or floods. Since subsidence has

1

Note that “sunny day” failures for SM-124 would not produce this level of loss, which corresponds to the value of
all property at risk that might occur under flood conditions.
30

occurred slowly over the last 100 years, Delta levees have grown more expansive with the
addition of material on the top and sides, rather than being constructed all at one time. For this
reason, few levees in the Delta meet modern engineering standards. In addition, most Delta
levees rest on weak, seismically unstable foundations that have little resiliency to conditions that
increase the likelihood of levee failures. As described in DRMS phase 1, floods, earthquakes,
and high tides can cause local or widespread levee failures along these poorly constructed levees
on weak foundations as evidenced by 166 levee failures in the past 100 years with the last levee
failure occurring in 2004 at Jones tract.
It is worth noting that Delta levees are not levees, per se. While levees within the Sacramento
and San Joaquin watersheds hold back water only during flood events, Delta levees have high
water always against them. These “levees” are more accurately described as polders and are
similar to those protecting the Dutch from the sea. Webster’s Dictionary defines Polders “…as a
tract of low land reclaimed from the sea…and protected by dikes”. A dike is defined as “…an
embankment built to prevent flooding from the sea”. However, since dikes in the Delta are
widely referred to as “levees”, we continue with that convention.
The levees in the Delta are prone to overtopping and erosion during storms, principally when
high winds create large waves at high tides. Levees also fail due to seepage. The elevation
difference between the water surface in the channel and the floor of the subsided island causes
water to flow both through and under the levee. Seepage is common for most levees and does not
normally lead to failure. However, when water pressure gradients are great, seepage can erode
material within and under the levee, causing sand boils on the levee interior, eventually leading
to collapse. Rodents, particularly beavers, can exacerbate this problem. Poor foundations or levee
construction materials can lead to slumping, cracking or sagging of levees that allows water to
flow through and over the levee, leading to its failure. And finally, levees can fail during
earthquakes as shaking causes either the foundation or embankments to lose cohesion, deform, or
collapse. The levee failure mechanisms described above have one thing in common: the forces
that cause these failures are all increasing or will worsen in the future. This stems from both the
natural degradation of levees with time and the progressive changes in physical forces acting on
them. For this reason, it is prudent to assume that, without intervention, levee failures will
increase in the future.
Although Delta levees can fail in many ways, this evaluation will not focus on the mechanism of
levee failure but rather the consequences of flooding if the levees of an island were to fail. This
scaled down hydraulic evaluation was conducted to support the SMART planning of the Delta
Islands and Levees Feasibility study. The purpose being to develop Depth-Frequency
information for each parcel within the island used to support the economic decision making
technique of “Cost-Benefit.” This method evaluates risk in terms of reducing the frequency of
occurrence of an undesirable hydrologic event and the associated consequences are appraised
using damages to the impacted asset using some form of monetary lost value analysis. This
methodology is the traditional USACE approach to flood risk management (FRM) decision

31

making and expresses the ratio of cost versus benefit to evaluate alternatives in terms of
economic “Benefits” to the Nation.
For each hydrologic event the information needed includes the frequency of the event, an
estimate of the uncertainty associated with that frequency, and the water-surface elevation
(stage) in the Delta associated with that event. The data used for stage, frequency, and
uncertainty event analysis originated from the February 1992 Hydrology Office Report of the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Special Study by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Sacramento
district and is the best available data that encompasses the more than 1,000 square miles of the
Primary Delta. To model the consequences of a flood event we used a simplified inundation
model for analysis in the form of a constant water surface elevation, or stage, across the entire
island. The stage used for this simplified inundation model is the Stage in Feet for each Annual
Chance Exceedance (ACE) event developed for the 1992 office report as described in the table
5-1 below. For the economic analysis, the estimate of uncertainty associated with the data will
be evaluated using the supplied period of record for input to FDA is listed the table below.

Table 5- 1. Stage Frequency Values

4.1

Bethel Island

Bethel Island is located in Contra Costa County and is one of the most urbanized of the Delta
islands with, according to the 2010 Census, a population of 2,137. This 5.1 square mile island is
located approximately 9 miles east of the City of Antioch, CA. Bethel Island is bordered on the
East by the flooded Franks Tract, the north by
Taylor and Piper Sloughs, to the west by Taylor
Slough, and the south by Sand Mound and Dutch
Sloughs. The only access to Bethel Island by road
is from a bridge over Dutch Slough along Bethel
Island Road. The topographic data supplied by the
Bay Delta Office of DWR indicates the estimated
Top-Of- Levee (TOL) for Bethel Island to be
32

approximately 12 feet NAVD’88. Contra Costa County FEMA FIRM Map number
06013C0170F defines Bethel Island to be in an “AE” zone for the 1% BFE of 9 ft NAVD’88.
The simplified hydraulic analysis for Bethel Island was accomplished using ESRI’s ArcGIS
version 10.0 Spatial Analyst Extension. In general, the spatial analysis used the terrain datasets
(DEM) provided by the Bay Delta office of DWR as the baseline to determine the ground
elevations for each parcel and stage frequency data from Chart 12 of the 1992 Office Report as
input for the simplified inundation modeling framework. The first step in the workflow was to
simplify the inundation analysis for each parcel originally described as a polygon shape from
each parcels plat. For the inundation analysis of Bethel Island these parcel polygons were
converted into parcel-centroids, or parcel-points, where each point now represents a single
unique parcel whose record includes all the database fields supplied in the original cadastral
dataset. The second step in this workflow was to use the available extraction tools in Spatial
Analyst to assign ground elevations to each parcel-point from the supplied DEM in order to
populate an “Elevation” field in the parcel-point data layer. Plate 5-1illustrates a plan view of
Bethel Island while Plate 5-5 illustrates the Bethel Island interior profile line “AA” created to
describe the deep Bethel Island Floodplains. The final step in the analysis was to apply the
simplified stage inundation framework for each frequency by invoking the field calculator
function within ArcGIS to compute the depth of flooding for each parcel. This depth-frequency
dataset was then supplied to the Economics Section for their depth/damage/frequency
calculations used to support the economic analysis for decision making.
Figures 5-1 below and Figures 5-2 through 5-9 located in Plate 5-9 describe in tabular form a
statistical summary and the frequency distribution of the tabular data created for this analysis.
Analyzing tabular data often involves finding how many of something belongs to a given
category or finding patterns in the data by looking at the frequency distribution of values from
within the dataset. Statistical analysis is useful to identify and confirm spatial patterns, such as
the center of a group of features, directional trends or skews, or whether features form clusters.
While patterns may be apparent on a map, trying to draw conclusions from a map can be difficult
as how the data is classified and can obscure or overemphasize patterns. Statistical functions
analyze the underlying data and give a measure that can be used to confirm the existence and
strength of the patterns within the data. By analyzing the Parcel Elevation Statistics (Figure 5-1)
we can quickly infer the range of elevations for structures located at Bethel Island. We can also
validate the Top of Levee estimate of approximately 12 ft since we know structures have been
constructed on the levee. Additionally, we can quickly estimate, given the published FEMA 1%
BFE of 9 ft and a mean structure elevation of 1.41 ft, the average depth of water over the Island
in the event of a catastrophic levee failure of greater than 7 feet. By evaluating the frequency
distribution in the dataset we find an unusual pattern in the data that was worth investigation .

Figure 5- 1 Bethel Island Parcel Point Elevation Statistics & Frequency Distribution

Upon evaluation this bimodal distribution seen in the data was created from the approximate 500
of 1,872 parcels that were elevated above +10 ft
NAVD’88 as part of the now defunct Delta Coves
development project. This project, pictured to the
right, went bankrupt after the financial collapse of
their financial partner, Lehman Brothers. This
anomaly is also seen in the subsequent depth
frequency statistics as a “0” for minimum value for
statistics run for each “n”- year ACE analysis and
illustrated in Plate 5-2. As these parcels have no
structures we can further define the dataset by
removing these parcels from the parcel selection
set used for the economic decision analysis.

Discovery Bay

Discovery Bay was originally established in the
1970’s as a weekend and summer resort community.
Today with a full-service marina, shopping and
business centers, sheltered boat access to some 700
miles of Delta channels, and access to the San
Francisco Bay, Discovery Bay has developed into a
popular full time community. Also located in Contra
Costa County, Discovery Bay is the most urbanized
of the Delta islands with, according to the 2010
Census, a resident population of 13,352. Discovery
Bay was built on land of the Byron Tract and this 7 square mile community has 6.2 square miles
of land an 0.8 square miles of water. Discovery Bay is located approximately 18 miles by
automobile southeast of the City of Antioch, CA.
Even though FEMA FIRM maps of Contra Costa County in the area state:

34

“This area is shown as being protected from the 1-percent annual chance or
greater event from a levee system that has been provisionally accredited…”

It took a spatial analysis of the Discovery Bay terrain to determine the relative location. As this
levee’s location is not defined in either State of California Levee Database or the USACE
National Levee Database. The result of the spatial analysis using the Bay Delta DEM is
illustrated within the Terrain Data Frame of Plate 5-3. Plate 5-3 also shows FEMA FIRM data
that describes the parcels as elevated above the BFE. These elevated parcels act, in effect, like a
levee to protect the interior structures located particularly around Willow Lake and the golf
course within the confines of Discovery Bay. Plate 5-4 describes those parcels that are being
protected by the high ground of the Discovery Bay and are the only structures could potentially
be damaged due to a flood. Plate 5-5 profile line BB shows a typical high ground section of the
community. Figure 5-10 below describes statistical summary and frequency distribution of the
Discovery Bay dataset in its entirety. The bimodal shape of the frequency distribution can be
easily accounted by viewing the terrain spatial analysis and evaluation described above.

Figure 5- 10 Discovery Bay Island Parcel Point Elevation Statistics & Frequency Distribution

For Discovery Bay, a similar hydraulic analysis was accomplished using the same workflow as
used for Bethel Island. Using ArcGIS, the Bay Delta DEM, and Chart 12 of the 1992 Office
Report the simplified inundation analysis was conducted; results evaluated and turned over to
Economics for further evaluation. Statistics for Discovery Bay are illustrated on Plate 5-6. Of the
6,649 parcels evaluated only 1,156 parcels, or 17% , would have the potential to flood in the
event of an on foreseen geotechnical failure. The topographic data supplied by the Bay Delta
Office of DWR indicates the estimated Top-Of-Levee (TOL) for Discovery Bay to be
approximately 14 feet NAVD’88.

4.3

Isleton (Brannen Andrus Island)

According to the 2010 Census, the population of the 0.5 square mile City of Isleton is 804
persons. Isleton is located in the southwest section of Sacramento County behind the levees of
35

the Sacramento River. FEMA FIRM MAP NUMBER 06067C0561H shows the City of Isleton in
an "AE" Zone defined as:
“SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA SUBJECT TO INUNDATION BY THE 1%
ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD, 1% BFE = INTERIOR FLOODING TO 9 ft NAVD'88”

For the City of Isleton, Plate 5-7, a similar
Google Earth Image
hydraulic analysis was accomplished using the
same inundation modeling workflow as was
used for the other projects sites of the study.
Using ArcGIS, the Bay Delta DEM, and Chart 4
of the 1992 Office Report the simplified
inundation analysis was conducted and the were
results evaluated and turned over to Economics
for further evaluation .Statistics describing the
depth inundation analysis for Isleton is shown on Plate 5-8. For Isleton, of the 486 parcels
evaluated only 3.5% show elevations above the FEMA BFE and only 9.5% show mean values
above the 7.5 ft estimate for the 1:2 ACE. Flooding at Isleton represents very deep inundation
and is further illustrated as Section DD on Plate 5-11.
4.4

Walnut Grove

Walnut Grove is located in Sacramento
County approximately 30 miles downstream
of the City of Sacramento along the
Sacramento River and is the site of the Delta
Cross Channel (in Red). The Delta Cross
channel is a feature of the U.S. Department of
Reclamation’s (Reclamation) Central Valley
Project Delta Division. It is operated to divert
water from the Sacramento River into a
branch of the Mokelumne River to maintain a
water quality balance with the transfer of
controlled releases from the reservoirs at Lake
Google Earth Image
Shasta and Folsom to the headwork’s of the
Delta-Mendota and Contra Costa Canals. These gates are closed during high water to prevent
Sacramento River flood stages from entering the San Joaquin section of the Delta.
FEMA FIRM MAP NUMBER 060067C0560H states:
“THIS AREA IS SHOWN AS BEING PROTECTED FROM THE 1% ANNUAL
CHANCE OR GREATER FLOOD HAZARD BY A LEVEE SYSTEM THAT HAS
BEEN PROVISIONALLY ACCREDITED. OVERTOPPING OR FAILURE OF ANY
LEVEE SYSTEM IS POSSIBLE.”
36

A similar hydraulic analysis was accomplished using the same inundation modeling workflow as
was used for the other projects sites of the study. Using ArcGIS, the Bay Delta DEM, and Chart
5 of the 1992 Office Report the simplified inundation analysis was conducted and results were
evaluated and turned over to Economics for further evaluation .Plate 5-9 Describes the Terrain
Plan view of Walnut Grove and the statistics describing the depth inundation analysis are shown
on Plate 5-10. Plate 5-11 Section CC is a representative section through Walnut Grove.
4.5

Summary of Hydraulic Handoffs

The hydraulic analysis was conducted with the same method for Bethel Island, Walnut Grove,
Isleton and Discovery Bay. The Hydraulics section provided depth-frequency information for
each parcel within the specific island for the 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01, 0.005, 0.002, 0.001
annual chance of exceedence, as well as the uncertainty associated, represented as the Period of
Record (Years). The depth-frequency information was provided in an ARC-GIS shape file
format to the Economics section.

5.0 CONCLUSIONS
While additional analyses are possible – quantification of ecosystem risks and evaluation of
human threats among them – the evidence for system-wide catastrophic life loss and economic
damages is more than sufficient to justify risk management through targeted system
improvements.
The resulting Flood Risk Management analysis and the simplified economic inputs presented
herein should be used as a guide for risk-informed decisions for future USACE actions in
reducing flooding risks in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun Marshes.
While refinements to these risk estimates are possible, this appendix and the Delta Risk
Management Strategy analyses provide more than sufficient evidence that flooding in the
Sacramento –San Joaquin Delta presents significant risks to California and the nation. Hundreds
of lives and billions of dollar damages are at high probability of occurrence. Urgent action is
necessary to manage those risks.

APPENDIX A

Appendix A: USACE & Army Risk Assessment and Management
A. Definitions
1. Risk
Army Field Manual FM 5-19, Composite Risk Management (Army 2006) defines risk as:
Risk: probability and severity of loss linked to hazards.

This definition is consistent with present professional practice in risk management (e.g., NRC
2007, ISO 2009) that recognizes two distinct components in risk – the probability of an event
and the magnitude of consequences from that event.
Table A.1 illustrates the variability among definitions of risk from several USACE technical and
guidance documents. It shows that newer definitions, while varying in word choice, are
consistent with the Army Field Manual. Older documents may vary in substance, depending on
date and context of the document. For example, Engineer Manual 1110-2-1619, Risk-Based
Analysis for Flood Damage Reduction Studies (USACE 1996) gives the definition:
Long-term risk - The probability of capacity exceedance during a specified
period. For example, 30-year risk refers to the probability of one or more
exceedances of the capacity of a measure during a 30-year period.

It does not include in the definition “severity” of consequences that forms part of the later
publications. Despite this narrower definition of the term, EM 1110-2-1619 clearly requires
consideration of consequences, saying:
… indices described herein represent some aspects of the non-economic
performance of alternative plans; this performance is referred to herein as
engineering performance. The indices include expected annual exceedance
probability, long-term risk, consequences of capacity exceedance, and
conditional probability.

Engineer Circular 1110-2-6067, (USACE 2010) takes note of this variety of definitions and
states:
Consistent with USACE agency-wide changes, the definition in the glossary “Risk
– Measure of the probability and severity of undesirable consequences” is used
for this document. In USACE dam safety policies and other USACE technical
54

APPENDIX A

engineering guidance, ‘risk’ is used consistent with this definition, sometimes
expressed as a probability-consequence diagram. Please note, however, that
various USACE official guidance documents and policy letters have ‘risk’ in their
titles, and that these documents often address only probability of occurrence or
uncertainty. These documents will be corrected as they are updated and
revised.

The role of the two factors – probability of an event and the consequences of that event – in
defining risk can be illustrated as in Figure A-1. The vertical axis represents the probability of an
event, ranging from very low, such a 500-year return period storm, to a rather high probability,
such as an annual spring runoff event. The horizontal axis represents the consequences of the
event – low consequences might include small economic damages, whereas high consequences
may include loss of human life. A low probability event with large consequences (such as
Hurricane Katrina) is shown by point “A”. On the other hand, a 500-year snowfall event along
the coast might have only minor economic effects and be shown by point “B”. Events that have a
high probability, e.g., happening once per year like a spring freshet with small consequences,
may be shown by point “C”. The diagram can be categorized into low, medium and high risk
zones, as shown in Figure A-1, with the actual delineations among them depending on a careful
analysis of the specific system.

2. Risk Assessment
Field Manual FM 5-19 (Army 2006) defines risk assessment as:
Risk Assessment: The identification and assessment of hazards (the first two steps
of the composite risk management process).
The USACE Risk Management Gateway provides a more detailed, descriptive definition:
Risk assessment is a systematic, evidence-based approach for
describing the likelihood and consequences of any action, including no
action. Risk assessment methodology is a technical and a scientific
process by which the risks of a given situation for a system are modeled
and quantified. A risk assessment asks the questions: What can go
wrong? How can it happen? What is the likelihood it will go wrong? What
is the consequence if it goes wrong? Risk assessment is a small part of
the bigger process called risk management. Risk assessment provides a
piece of the required data for the decision makers in the risk management
process. Risk management includes the assessment, decision making,
and communication aspects of risk. The domain of risk assessment is
beyond engineering reliability, while reliability assessment is a significant
activity in a risk assessment. (USACE 2011b)

3. Risk Management
Field Manual FM 5-19 (Army 2006) defines Risk Management as:

Risk Management: The process of identifying, assessing, and controlling risks
arising from operational factors and making decisions that balance risk cost with
mission benefits.

The USACE Risk Management Gateway again provides a more detailed, descriptive definition:
58

APPENDIX A

Risk management is the keystone activity in the risk analysis process. It
starts with identifying problems and decisions to be made. The next step
is to begin efforts to identify and assess risks, which includes evaluating
risk management options and selecting the best one from among them. It
is also a risk management responsibility to implement and monitor the
selected risk management activity and to modify those decisions when
necessary.
…
Risk management has been defined in many different ways to meet the
needs of many different organizations and applications. Common to many
of these definitions are the following informal questions:
– What is the problem?
– What question(s) do we want risk assessment to answer?
– What can be done to reduce the impact of the risk described?
– What can be done to reduce the likelihood of the risk described?
– What are the trade-offs of the available options?
– What is the best way to address the described risk?
– Is it working?
(USACE 2011b)

4. Composite Risk Management
Field Manual 5-19 does not explicitly define Composite Risk Management (CRM). It simply
describes CRM as: “… the Army’s primary decision making process for identifying hazards and
controlling risks across the full spectrum of Army missions, functions, operations, and
activities.” (Army 2006)
The Manual explains the addition of the word “composite” by saying in the Preface: “This
holistic approach focuses on the composite risks from all sources rather than the traditional
practice of separating accident from tactical hazards and associated risks.”
While the Manual’s language is clearly tailored to the context of active duty military
risk management, CRM can be defined in terms pertinent to this report as:
Composite Risk Management: The process of identifying, assessing, and
controlling risks arising from all causes by making decisions that balance risk
with benefits.

59

APPENDIX A

B. Consequences in Risk Management
USACE typically evaluates economic, human health and life, and environmental consequences
separately. Attempts to address health and life losses quantitatively are often controversial and
encounter the challenge that human life is priceless. Recently environmental consequences have
proved susceptible to quantification through ecosystem services analyses, but the field is still
developing.
Among other Federal agencies, the EPA has attempted to use the “Value of a Statistical Life” to
define the cost-benefit ratio for regulations (EPA 2011) arriving at a value of $7.4M in 2006
dollars. The agency plans to change over to a “Value of Mortality Risk” in the future in order to
reduce controversy. Other agencies have used the “Cost to Save a Statistical Life” as an
alternative.
Recent efforts by USACE to formulate new dam and levee risk assessment strategies and the
ongoing process to revise the Federal “Principles and Practices” may produce quantitative
expressions for human health and safety and environmental quality. However, existing USACE
guidance does not provide a mechanism for doing so. Separate risk assessments are the norm for
economics, human health and life, and environmental quality, including ecosystem components.
C. Composite Risk Management Process
Field Manual 5-19 provides guidance on applying CRM through a five-step process depicted in
Figure C-2. While the Manual explains the five steps in terms of military personnel and
missions, e.g., “The factors of mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available,
time available, and civil considerations (METT-TC) serve as a standard format for identification
of hazards, on-duty or off-duty,” those terms have equivalent civil works factor connotations:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Mission – Project purpose, operation and maintenance
Enemy – Vandals, terrorists, earthquakes, floods
Terrain and weather – Natural factors such as soil, water, weather, and animals
Troops and support – USACE, local sponsors, stakeholders
Time available – Time and budget constraints
Civil considerations – Non-project activities such as recreation, farming, etc.

Once hazards have been identified, step 2 in the CRM is to assess each hazard by three sub-steps:
• Assess the probability of the event or occurrence.
• Estimate the expected result or severity of an event or occurrence.
• Determine the specified level of risk for a given probability and severity using the
standard risk assessment matrix.

60

APPENDIX A

Figure C- 2 CRM Steps (Source: Army 2006)

Figure C-2 shows that the risk management steps following hazard assessment are:
• Develop controls and make decisions
• Implement controls
• Supervise and evaluate
Figure C-2 also indicates that the steps repeat, with the focus on “residual risk” in the next
hazard identification step. The latter two bullets can be recognized as steps in an adaptive
management approach, which the National Research Council (NRC 2009) describes as:
Adaptive Risk Management: Flexible decision making that can be adjusted in the
face of uncertainties as outcomes from management actions and other events
become better understood.

Figure C-3 shows the Field Manual’s Risk Assessment Matrix. It reflects the two components of
risk as shown in Figure C-1 – probability of occurrence and severity of consequences.
Probability of occurrence is expressed as one of five categories ranging from “Frequent” to
“Unlikely” and severity of consequences is expressed as one of four categories ranging from
“Negligible” to “Catastrophic”. The Manual explains these categories in primarily military
terms; nevertheless, the concepts are still applicable to civil works activities with suitable
translation. For example, Figure C-4 is an example risk matrix for major equipment
rehabilitation decisions in civil works activities. In this case a Condition Index is used to define
the probability of an adverse event and loss of revenue from a shutdown has been used to
61

APPENDIX A

estimate the consequences ranging from “Low” to “High”. Numbers in the matrix cells of Figure
C-4 represent a calculated non-dimensional index representing degree of risk.

Figure C-1. CRM Hazard Assessment Matrix. (Source: Army 2006)

Figure C-2. Risk Matrix for Major Equipment Rehabilitation (Source: USACE 2011c)

The CRM matrix in Figure C-3 expresses composite risk in four levels:
Extremely High Risk – Loss of ability to accomplish the mission if hazards occur
during mission. A frequent or likely probability of catastrophic loss (IA or IB) or
frequent probability of critical loss (IIA) exists. This implies that the risk
associated with this mission, activity, or event may have severe consequences
beyond those associated with this specific operation or event. The decision to
continue must be weighed carefully against the potential gain to be achieved by
continuing this Course of Action (COA).

62

APPENDIX A

High Risk – Significant degradation of mission capabilities in terms of the
required mission standard, inability to accomplish all parts of the mission, or
inability to complete the mission to standard if hazards occur during the mission.
Occasional to seldom probability of catastrophic loss (IC or ID) exists. A likely to
occasional probability exists of a critical loss (IIB or IIC) occurring. Frequent
probability of marginal losses (IIIA) exists. This implies that if a hazardous event
occurs, serious consequences will occur. The decision to continue must be
weighed carefully against the potential gain to be achieved by continuing this
COA.
Moderate Risk – Expected degraded mission capabilities in terms of the required
mission standard and will result in reduced mission capability if hazards occur
during mission. An unlikely probability of catastrophic loss (IE) exists. The
probability of a critical loss is seldom (IID). Marginal losses occur with a likely or
occasional probability (IIIB or IIIC). A frequent probability of negligible (IVA)
losses exists.
Low Risk – Expected losses have little or no impact on accomplishing the
mission. The probability of critical loss is unlikely (IIE), while that of marginal loss
is seldom (IIID) or unlikely (IIIE). The probability of a negligible loss is likely or
less (IVB through (IVE). Expected losses have little or no impact on
accomplishing the mission. Injury, damage, or illness are not expected, or may
be minor and have no long term impact or effect.

Of particular note is that the Manual-delineated process does not explicitly combine the hazards
in a single composite risk evaluation. Each hazard is assessed and managed individually, as if it
were uncorrelated with any other hazard. It is the responsibility of the command to understand
how the hazards may interact to create a higher risk.

Using the risk assessment matrix is the key guidance provided by Field Manual 5-19, but its
implementation for civil works activities diverges from the military-centric procedures and
examples given in the Manual. Other USACE guidance describes the process for performing
composite risk management in civil works.
Factors to be considered in identifying levee hazards are given by EC 1110-2-6067 (USACE
2010) to include:
•
•
•
•

Construction records and quality control testing
Existing Operation and Maintenance Plan
Levee field inspection
Levee height assurance determination

Ice issues
Other applicable unique design criteria.

The EC also provides guidance and examples on how the assessments should be performed, but
does not describe how to populate a risk matrix with those assessments.
Risk values used to populate a risk matrix can be simple designations of High, Medium, Low,
etc., as shown in Figure D-3, or non-dimensional numeric values calculated by a risk assessment
procedure as in Figure D-4. They can be expressed mathematically as a simple product:

Risk Index =

P [Event ] * (Consequences of Event )

D-1

Normalizing Value

Where the Normalizing Value is selected to remove units from the index and fit it to a certain
range, such as 0 to 1, or 1 to 100 and P[ ] = probability function of the random variable within
the brackets.
In toxic materials and security risk analyses the P[Event] is often defined as:

P[ Event ] = P [Threat ] * [Vulnerability to Threat ]

D-2

USACE (2011c) develops Figure 2-4 rather simply, using the sum:
Risk Index = βCI + βRL

D-3

Where βCI = index value ranging from 10 (high likelihood of failure) to 0 (Low likelihood of
failure) from a lookup table corresponding to machinery Condition Indices ranging from 0 (poor)
to 10 (Good) and βRL = index value ranging from 1 (minor revenue loss) to 10 (high revenue
64

APPENDIX A

loss). The result are the index values ranging from 1 (low risk) to 20 (high risk) and the diagonal
division into four risk categories.
Engineer Circular 1110-2-6062 (USACE 2011c) applies a more complex analysis to an example
dam breach problem, defining the risk as:

R = H P[F] P[E] X L

2-5

Where R = Risk in expected losses per year; H = number of expected events per year; P[F] =
probability of failure of a project feature for each event; P[E] = probability of a breach, given
event and feature failure; X = conditional exposure of people or property caused by the event;
and L = loss rate for the exposed people and property.
While these mathematical forms are useful in understanding the interactions and separating high
risk from low risk, risk values are not typically treated as precise magnitudes. They are more
often scaled to a linear relationship appropriate for assigning classes of risk as displayed in
Figures D-3 and D-4, and shown in Equation D-1.
These examples serve to illustrate the variety of ways risk can be estimated and expressed. Other
than the overall approach, the conceptual form of the risk matrix, and requirement for sound
analyses, USACE risk assessment has considerable latitude. In the words of Field Manual 5-19:
“Technical competency, operational experience, and lessons-learned weigh higher than any set
of alpha-numeric codes. Mathematics and matrixes are not a substitute for sound judgment.”
(Army 2006)
E. Uncertainty and Risk Assessment
Engineer Circular EC 1110-2-6067 (USACE 2010) defines uncertainty in National Flood
Insurance Program levee evaluations as:

Uncertainty: A measure of the imprecision of knowledge of variables and functions
used in the risk analysis.

The EC also states:
USACE policy is to apply a probability and uncertainty analysis framework to
NFIP levee system evaluations for all engineering elements. As of the
publication date of this EC, probability and uncertainty-based methodologies for
the hydrology and hydraulics in Riverine situations is more advanced; elements
65

APPENDIX A

of the uncertainty for NFIP levee system evaluation exist and will be applied as
outlined below. Probability of exceedance and uncertainty assessment methods
for coastal, estuarine, and lake settings are less mature, but being developed
currently, and should be used as noted in paragraph 9.f., but with caution and
appropriately applied until they become more codified into engineering
guidance. Probability of exceedance and uncertainty-based methodologies are
under development and emerging for structural and geotechnical engineering
elements but are not yet sufficiently mature for direct application in NFIP levee
system evaluations. (USACE 2010)

Paragraph 9f cited in the quotation above provides guidance for hydrology and hydraulics
uncertainty analyses in river and coastal environments, citing EM 1110-2-1619, Risk-Based
Analysis for Flood Damage Reduction Studies (USACE 1996); Part II (Chapters 2 and 3) of EM
1110-2-1100, Coastal Engineering Manual (USACE 2008); and the Performance Evaluation of
the New Orleans and Southeast Louisiana Hurricane Protection System (IPET 2009).

APPENDIX B

APPENDIX B: RISK CALCULATIONS
Data used in the risk calculations were taken from the Delta Risk Management Strategy report
(URS/JBA 2008).
Table B1 – B2
Table B1 lists the Life Loss analysis zones alphabetically, with parallel columns for DRMS
report data and calculations for those data. Table A2 contains the same list, sorted by Risk Index.
Column details are:
“Zone” and “Maximum Mean Life Loss”: Names of zones for which DRMS Appendix 12C
provides estimated fatalities and the maximum value (usually a night-time event) of Mean Life
Loss. Blanks indicate that the zone in “URS Name” column could not be identified in DRMS
Appendix 12C. Shaded values in the “Maximum Mean Life Loss” column indicate that a value
was assumed based on similarity of “URS Name” or apparent co-location on maps. The “Notes”
column indicates where the assumed value was drawn from.
“URS_ID”, “URS Name”, and “Annual Mean No. of Failures”: Numbers, names, and annual
mean failures from DRMS Table 13-8. Blanks indicate that the zone in the “Zone” column could
not be identified in DRMS Table 13-8. Shaded values in “Annual Mean Number of Failures”
indicate that a value was assumed based on similarity of “Zone” name or apparent co-location
on maps. The “Notes” column indicates where the assumed value was drawn from.
“Life Loss Category”: Life Loss category for the “Zone”, using “Maximum Mean Life Loss”
and the categories in Table 4-2.

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.1

Purpose

This document was created as an addendum to the Hydraulic Engineering Technical Memorandum (TM)
for the Sacramento – San Joaquin Rivers Delta Island and Levees, California, Feasibility Study
(Feasibility Study), in order to describe the engineer analysis conducted for the Ecosystem Restoration
(ER) portion of the Tentative Selected Plan (TSP). The TM documents the hydraulic analysis work
conducted for the Flood Risk Management (FRM) portion of the TSP report.
The TM indentified four potential locations within the study area, Bethel Island, Discovery Bay, Brannen
Andrus Island and Walnut Grove, that would have provided the largest Benefit to Cost Ratio (BCR) for a
potential FRM alternative. However, the FRM analysis showed that there was not enough Federal interest
in FRM alternative for the Delta (benefit to cost ratio less than 1). The PDT decided to evaluate FRM
alternatives which only contained ER components and alternatives.
The Project Delivery Team (PDT) qualitatively selected ER alternatives from an array of choices based
on USACE Planning criteria and engineering judgment. This report does not support a recommendation,
it only documents the work conducted to support for the selection of an ER alternative for the TSP report.

1.2

Background

The Central Valley of California, is defined by a watershed drainage area of 59,380 square miles,
and includes the Sacramento River (27,580 square mile watershed) which flows south from the
Sacramento Valley and the San Joaquin River (31,800 square mile watershed) which flows north
from the San Joaquin Valley. The Calaveras and Mokelumne Rivers flow from the east into the
Sacramento San Joaquin Delta.
The Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta (Delta) as defined for this study, extending east of the
Carquinez Straight through Suisun Bay to the northeast along the Sacramento River to Freeport,
southeast along the San Joaquin River to Vernalis, and through the network of islands and levees
east to Stockton, as shown in Plate 1. The Delta is a controlled system of over 700 miles of
interconnected waterways and islands protected by approximately 1,100 miles of levees that
include approximately 400 miles of federal levees. The levees are aging and under threat from
subsidence, animal burrowing, earthquakes, wind and wave action, floods, high tides, and sea
level rise.
1.3
1.3.1

Data Sources
Bathymetric Data

The topographic and bathymetric datasets used to support the ER alternative analysis were
supplied by the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR), Bay Delta Office.
Digital Elevation Models (DEM) consisting of 10 meter and 2 meter integrated elevation maps
were developed by DWR. This product was developed based on synthesizing LiDAR, single-

3

and multibeam sonar soundings and existing integrated maps collated from multiple sources. For
additional information on the bathymetric data set please refer to the following DWR website:
http://baydeltaoffice.water.ca.gov/modeling/deltamodeling/modelingdata/DEM.cfm
1.3.2

Salinity Impact Analysis

DWR has conducted water quality impact studies along various locations in the Delta,
specifically looking at salinity, organic carbon, and mercury levels. DWR’s report
“Flooded Islands, Feasibility Study Baseline Report, 2005” documents potential project
alternatives and their relative impacts on the salinity levels on Frank’s Tract, Big Break and
Lower Sherman Lake. The water quality impacts were assumed to be the same for USACE’s ER
alternatives for TSP selection. For additional information on the bathymetric data set please refer
to the following DWR website:
http://www.water.ca.gov/Frank’stract/floodedislands.cfm

2.0 ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT
2.1

Formulation of Alternative Array

The formulations of the ER Alternative array address the ecological health of the Delta by reestablishing some of the critical ecosystem structure and functions. The alternatives, otherwise
referred to as “measures” are defined as a feature or an activity that can be implemented at a
geographic site to address one or more planning objectives. A detailed description of the
ecosystem restoration strategy and measures can be found in the TSP report. A list of ecosystem
restoration measures that were considered are given below:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
2.2

Restoration of native riparian habitat
Creation of new channels to connect habitat
Invasive species management
Restoration of in-channel islands and floodplains
Restoration of historic marshes
Salinity Management
Construction of habitat friendly levees
Construction of setback levees
Controlled flooding of appropriate subsided islands
Creation of bypasses
Alternative Selection

The measures listed in the previous section were initially screened based on four criteria:
likehood of opportunity, effectiveness, general efficiency, and general acceptability. A detailed
4

description of the selection criteria can be found in the TSP report. A secondary screening, in
which any measure that was already considered under the BDCP would be eliminated, also
helped to truncate the alternatives array.
A list of ecosystem restoration measures that were considered are given below:
•
•
•
•

These measures were again screened based on land availability concerns, likely effects to water
rights, impacts to existing habitat, gross relative real estate cost and gross relative construction
cost. A secondary screening, in which a measure already considered under the BDCP would be
eliminated, further truncating the alternative array.

3.0 ENGINEERING ANALYSIS FOR FINAL ALTERNATIVE ARRAY
Restoring intertidal habitats at Big Break, Little Frank’s Tract and Frank’s Tract, Plate 2, it
would provide an area for native aquatic and terrestrial species to survive, while also eliminating
habitant for invasive non-native species. Previous USACE projects at Venice Cut and Donlon
Island have shown that subsidence reversal is a viable method to restore intertidal marsh.

Project Assumptions
Salinity

Delta waters serve multiple purposes: providing habitat for important species of fish and other
aquatic organisms, a water source for California’s residents and for agricultural irrigation, all of
which have specific water quality requirements. The threat to the Delta from salt-water intrusion
is one of the main concerns of all who rely on the Delta.
DWR has conducted various studies to better capture a baseline condition of the salinity levels
within the Delta. Specifically, DWR concentrated on three study areas in their report “Flood
Island Baseline Report, State of California Department of Water Sources, 2005”, Frank’s Tract,
Big Break and Sherman Island.
Frank’s Tract is tidally connected to the San Joaquin River through the False River channel. Due
to the levee breach locations along Frank’s Track, the hydrodynamic forces trap saline water
within the flooded area of the island. Modeling showed that the saline water entered through the
breach along the western side of the island, False River, and exited into Old River through the
5

levee breach on the east side, which degrades the source water by allowing the saline water to
travel further upstream. For engineering purposes, it is assumed that a subsidence reversal
measure would eliminate this pathway for saline water to travel further upstream the Delta. At a
minimum, there would be no negative impacts to the salinity levels.
The flooded area within Big Break is shallower than Frank’s Tract, so the hydrodynamic forces
are not as complex. It is assumed for the TSP, that the salinity levels within the Delta would not
be negatively affected with a subsidence reversal measure.
3.1.2

Hazardous, Toxics and Radioactive Waste Concerns

There are common potential environmental concerns for all alternatives evaluated in this study.
There are Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Basin Plan Amendments for organic enrichment
and dissolved oxygen for portions of the San Joaquin Deep Water Ship Channel based on the
current 303d Clean Water Act list for the Delta, however, the project alternatives are outside of
impaired areas. There is also a TMDL for methyl mercury in the Delta, which includes wetland
and open water sources in the proposed project area. Total mercury loads and potential methyl
mercury loads are required to comply with the TMDL allocations.
The dredged material obtained from Operations and Maintenance Dredging will be characterized
prior to placement and habitat restoration. Similarly, previously placed dredged material will be
characterized for mercury prior to placement in the restoration areas, and has already been
characterized under the O&M dredging program for the past 13 years. Further, a control study
will be developed to monitor mercury and methyl mercury concentrations in the habitat
restoration areas following placement. All other environmental concerns will be addressed
through the 401 Water Quality Certification process and subsequent monitoring program
required under the 401 permit.
3.1.3

Hydraulic Impacts

Due to the geographic location of Big Break and Frank’s Tract, it is assumed that any subsidence
reversal measure would have little to no hydraulic impacts to the flood control system and deep
water shipping channels.
3.2
3.2.1

Subsidence Reversal Measure
Target Elevation for Island Restoration

Based on the previous projects at Venice Cut and Donlon Island, it was determined that optimal
wetland development occurs when the marsh habitat is restored to an elevation between -2.0ft to
0.5ft relative to mean water level. The mean water level elevation was based on data collected
from DWR’s gage along the Sacramento River at Rio Vista (RVB) for the year 2013. Since this
effort was only for a TSP selection, the PDT determined that a period of record of one calendar
year was enough data to get an estimate of the mean water level. Further refinement of the TSP
would consider a longer period of record and account for potential sea level rise. The mean water
level ranged from 2.8ft NAVD88 to 6.8ft NAVD88. An elevation of 4.8ft NAVD88 for mean
water level was estimated from the gage data.
6

Given the mean water level of 4.8ft NAVD88, the ground elevation required for restoration of
native habitat would range from 2.8ft to 5.3 ft NAVD88. Conservatively, the PDT choose to use
an elevation of 4.5ft NAVD88 as the target elevation to estimate fill quantities.
3.2.2

Volume Calculations

The amount of material required to fill in Big Break, Little Frank’s Tract and Frank’s Tract was
based on bathymetric data from DWR and data collected from previous USACE projects along
Venice Cut and Donlon Island.
Multiple cross sections were cut along various locations for Big Break, Little Frank’s Tract and
Frank’s Tract in order to determine a representative channel floor elevation. Plates 3 and 4 shows
the cross section locations for Big Break, Little Frank’s Tract and Frank’s Tract. Cross sections
were divided into sections of 100 meters and then the elevations were averaged together to get
representative elevations. Table 3.1 below shows a summary of the target elevations, the Delta
floor elevations, and the required depth to fill. Plates 5 through 15 show the cross section
profiles.

Based on the depth to fill and the area, approximate acreage and total fill volumes were
calculated. An extra 15% was added to the acreages due to the open water area at the edge of the
existing island that the project may have to partially fill. An additional 10% fill lost factor was
added as a contingency for estimation purposes. Table 3.2 below summarizes:

Error in Volume Calculations

An error was later found post district quality control for the total fill required to fill until
reaching the target elevation. The difference was found to be less than 6%. Being that the change

Increment Selection

In order to optimize the subsidence reversal measure, the PDT divided each project reach into a
grid system, with each grid approximately 1 acre. This allowed for the PDT to select smaller
increments of the project area to fill in based on proximity of the area to available fill material.
The grid outlines for Big Break, Frank’s Tract and Little Frank’s Tract are shown on plates 16,
17, and 18.
Big Break was divided into 7 different increments; Frank’s Tract was broken into 3 increments,
and Little Frank’s Tract into 2 increments. The acreages were determined by the amount of
material that could be placed at a specific site based on the volume of material available. Plates
19 through 20 show the increment breakdown and table 3.4 below describes the different
increments:

4.0 CONCLUSION
The Tentatively Selected Plan includes Big Break increment 1, 2, 3, 5 and Little Frank’s Tract
increment 1. The selected grids to be filled in are shown on plates 22 and 23. Big Break
Increment 1 would be filled in with dredged material from Operation and Maintenance dredging
along the Stockton Deep Water Ship channel for a period of 5 years, assuming that an average of
100,000 CY of material is available annually. The remaining sites would be filled in by pumping
available material from various nearby placement sites.

Basis of Estimate
1. Background:
The Delta Islands Feasibility Study began as a multi-purpose (FRM and ER) study.
However, due to the nature of how communities were generally distributed on the islands
exterior near the existing levee footprints, FRM alone was eventually screened out due to low
benefit cost ratios.
Refocused on ER alone, many potential sites were screened out due to the without project
assumptions and the need for expensive, new setback levee construction required for most ER
alternatives. When the concept of pumping suitable material over land to shallow flooded island
locations in order to develop habitat was introduced, the parametric cost estimates identified the
TSP as those elements utilizing pumping. Additionally, the proximity to the San Joaquin River
created the opportunity to cost share and re-direct O&M dredging outflows directly to the ER
project site.

2. Approach:
a. Cost Estimates
In developing the feasibility level cost estimates of the various increments of the Delta
Islands Feasibility Report, the Cost Engineering team utilized a parametric methodology
incorporating MII (MCACES, 2nd generation) generated unit costs. Costs for relocations and
construction throughout initial screening through TSP selection were compiled based on 1)
historical costs - past levee projects in the vicinity of the Legal Delta, 2) estimating software MII
and 3) Parametric Cost Estimating Tool (PCET) developed by URS and successfully used on the
Sutter Basin Feasibility Pilot Study.
During the screening process, the parametric spreadsheets utilized unit costs of certain
typical levee design parameters including, for example, stripping vegetation, earthwork, cutoff
walls, etc. The spreadsheet is essentially a collection/database of unit cost data from public bid
results and projects that URS worked on for the California Department of Water Resources and
other various public agencies. The parametric spreadsheet is thus believed to produce an
effective and reliable estimate. URS developed the spreadsheet following typical levee designs
provided by the Sacramento District (SPK) Geotech/Civil Design sections and computed the
corresponding construction cost. The estimate is based on the manual inputs and output is based
solely on the input. The project delivery team (PDT) collectively compiled the input parameters,
based on best available Hydraulic and representative Geotechnical data to come up with
recommended repairs (or new levee design) by reach. For each individual reach and cross
section, the input parameters such as the levee height, crest width, levee slopes, cutoff wall
C-3

depths, etc., were quantified and used to generate the parametric portion of the estimate. The unit
prices used were reviewed by SPK Cost Estimating Section and updated to reflect present day
costs. In some cases, these unit costs were updated based on cost developed in MII.
Other major cost categories including cultural resources, PED (Preconstruction
Engineering & Design), and Construction Management had to be considered separately. A
percentage of the construction cost was used to compute costs for the remaining cost categories.
The cost estimates for each alternative for the purposes of screening and TSP selection, is
the summation of the costs from the parametric spreadsheet output and the costs of the other
major cost categories.
The Screening Level Estimates were developed based on the initial measures and these
were combined to reflect the alternatives developed by the PDT. The estimates were
continuously updated to match the current design refinements and the latest information
available at the time of the revisions. The costs do not account for life cycle costs.
The estimates follow the Civil Works Work Breakdown Structure (CWWBS) code of
accounts. Feature Codes typically involved in this estimate are 01- Lands and Damages, 06-Fish
and Wildlife Facilities, 18-Cultural Resource Preservation, 30-Preconstruction Engineering and
Design, and 31-Construction Management. The 30 and 31 accounts involve any costs associated
with USACE staffing on the project. The amounts are based on historical data adjusted
downward based upon the simple nature of the features of work.
b. Cost Uncertainties
There are inherent uncertainties in the costs at the feasibility level of design since there is
no detailed design, plans or specs. However, the simplicity of the TSP’s features of work
significantly reduced the potential uncertainty. There are additional uncertainties as the
construction contractor(s) are responsible for obtaining most construction materials,
accomplishing the work in a timely manner as per the project due date, using of overtime and/or
multiple crews to accomplish the same, etc. There are also some cost uncertainties captured
relative to risk analysis (see below).
For this project, more than 50% of the TSP’s costs are directly related to the cost to pump
the previously dredged material to its placement site which has a low uncertainty due to the
availability of data for this area.
During the screening process, the high uncertainty in suitable material availability, the
need to acquire numerous tracts of land, and the condition/winding nature of haul routes within
the Delta, translated into high material costs for the hauling alternatives that were quickly
screened out for the previously dredged material storage sites. Alternatively, barging material to
the sites is considered highly uncertain due to barge draft requirements related to the shallow
depths of the nearby channels and placement sites. However, even with the unreasonable
assumption that a barge could traverse to the sites, the material unit costs were more than 50%
higher versus pumping.
C-4

c. OMRR&R Costs
A brief investigation of OMRR&R costs was done by the PDT and determined to be
unnecessary due to the success of the nearby and similar case study, Donlon Island which
resulted in the decision not to include any OMRR&R costs. This decision incorporates the fact
that there is a 2 year period of monitoring included for each site in the base cost estimate.
d. Total Project Schedule (including Construction)
Once the TSP was selected and the sequence of construction was determined, the Cost
Engineering Section’s master scheduler created the Total Project Schedule. The schedule has
subsequently been revised twice following DQC comments. The assumption has been made that
the PED portion of the project will occur in FY 16 thru FY 17 with the construction portion
commencing FY 18. Construction is assumed to take 5 years, with 2 years of subsequent
monitoring.
e. Cost and Schedule Risk Analysis
An initial Abbreviated Cost Risk Analysis (ACRA) was performed for the project. The
risk analysis process used is intended to determine the probability of various cost outcomes and
quantify the required contingency needed in the cost estimate. Risk analysis results are intended
to provide project leadership with contingency information in order to support decision making
and risk management as the project progresses from planning through implementation. To fully
recognize its benefits, cost and schedule risk analysis should be considered as an ongoing
process conducted concurrent to, and iteratively with, other important project processes such as
scope and execution plan development, resource planning, procurement planning, budgeting and
scheduling.
A meeting was held 19 December with the project manager and most PDT members. The
meeting focused primarily on risk factor identification using brainstorming techniques, but also
included some discussions based on risk factors common to many civil works projects. The
meeting included risk factor assessment and quantification and did result in some revisions to the
estimate. Project risks were identified and a risk register developed as a spreadsheet (using
Microsoft Excel). After the meeting, the draft risk register was forwarded to the PDT for review.
The quantitative impacts of each risk element on costs and schedule were analyzed using
a combination of professional judgment, empirical data and analytical techniques. Risks that
were not immediately agreed upon by the PDT were discussed at length and agreed upon in the
form of inputs into the probability density functions. Quantification involved multiple project
team disciplines and functions. The resulting product risk model therefore reflects the risk
register parameters as developed by the PDT.
In simple terms, contingency is an amount added to an estimate and/or schedule that
allows for items, conditions or events for which the occurrence or impact is uncertain and that
experience suggests will likely result in additional costs being incurred or additional time being
required.
C-5

The amount of contingency used for a project depends, at least in part, on the project
leadership’s willingness to accept risk of project overruns.
f. Review
The TSP level cost estimate has been reviewed by senior estimators at the Sacramento
District.
g. Screening Level Results
The tables at the conclusion of this section, Table 1, show a brief summary of the
screening level results.
h. Final Array Results
The tables at the conclusion of this section, Table 2, show a brief summary of the final
array cost estimates and the subsequent results from the environmental model output.

3. Key Assumptions:
a. Parametric Estimates
-

Cross Sections for the various levee improvements or new levees are representative of the
levee reach (during screening).
Unit Costs utilized are fair and reasonable and utilized an MCACES unit cost foundation
whenever possible.
400 CY of material pumped per hour within a slurry mix of 90% water.
50% of slurry outflow material settles into final position reducing which reduces the
amount of material needed to be handled following discharge.

b. Haul Distances – Levee Fill Borrow will come from within 30 miles (one-way haul) of the
various disposal areas. The lack of a detailed borrow site study of the Delta, and the prevalence
of peat (unsuitable for in-water placement or levee construction) within the Delta footprint, will
significantly increase haul costs. Barging material into Big Break, Frank’s Tract and Little
Frank’s Tract for open water ER placement is not feasible due to typically loaded barge draft
depths exceeding the available depth by at least four feet of MSL at all three sites. Attempting
to work in high tide and reduce available working hours or operate partially loaded barges was
found to lose too great a level of transport efficiency to compete with the pumping based TSP
alternatives.
c. Real Estate - Real Estate Costs used for screening and final array analysis are reasonable.
Real Estate estimate errors will affect the alternatives evenly and/or not affect the ranked order
of alternatives. Alternatively, the lack of adequate borrow material for both in water placement
and levee construction (during screening), significantly increases non-dredge material sourcing
costs due to the need to acquire and transport suitable material. The pipe crossing of HWY 160
C-6

necessary to pump from Decker Island south to Big Break is considered mobilization costs as
opposed to relocation costs after it was determined to be reasonably constructible. Judy
(530.741.4403) at the California Department of Transportation encroachment permitting
department responsible for this specific stretch of road (region 3) stated that this was an
acceptable permit application because of the classification of HWY 160 where encroachment
permits are under much less scrutiny than HWY 5 for example, where this would be an
unacceptable permit application.
d. Parametric Cost Estimates are sufficient for screening and evaluating the final array of
alternatives in order to determine the TSP.
e. Quantity Uncertainty – Previously dredged material storage site quantities are based upon the
deposits made since 2000. Correspondence with the controlling agencies indicates that the
dredge material storage sites for the TSP have not removed a significant quantity of this material,
if any, and is thus considered to be a conservative number. These figures were considered
adequate to screen alternatives to the point of determining a tentatively selected plan because
they are not expected to decrease which would only have a negative impact on per acre costs.
The estimated expected quantity of yearly O&M material available is based upon the most recent
placement figures (2006 to present) and the assumption that on most years, our expected amount
should exceed the available amount to prevent mid operation shut down.
f. Project Schedule - PED portion of the project will occur from FY 16 thru FY 17 with the
construction portion commencing FY 18. Construction is assumed to take 5 years followed by 2
years of monitoring. Real estate actions will be generally conducted the year prior to use.
g. Cultural Resources – Costs will be approximately 1% of the Federal Construction Costs
h. PED Costs – the assumed 15% of Construction Costs used in recent years by the Sacramento
District is fair and reasonable due to the simplistic nature of the TSP’s features of work.
i. Construction Management Costs – assumed 8.5% of Construction Costs used in recent years
by the Sacramento District is fair and reasonable due to the simplistic nature of the TSP’s
features of work.
J. Constructability (In water earthwork) – Although there are concerns about the constructability
of the in water earthwork due to depth of water and shapability of the material, this concern has
been captured in the cost risk analysis and determined to be low risk of increasing cost or
lengthening the schedule. Alternatively, a viable alternative of replacing the in water work with
additional labor hours to physically move the discharge pipe outflow location at a higher rate is a
cheaper, but less precise option. The lower precision of material placement is not a prohibitive
consequence and ultimately is considered an acceptable alternative method of construction.
k. Constructability (Sacrificial Hay bales) – It is assumed that the sacrificial hay bale
containment wall will be able to withstand the tidal forces applied to it over the course of the
construction season. A robust design was used to ensure stability during the most dynamic
C-7

situation where tidal outflow is combined with pipe discharge. Additionally, the use of 120
degree sectors for the sacrificial hay bale wall arc maintains a modest flow rate assuming evenly
distributed across the arc.

The Sacramento – San Joaquin Delta is part of the largest estuary on the west coast of the United States; is home to hundreds of species of fish, birds, mammals and reptiles; and has been named an Ecosystem of National Significance through the
Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act in 2011. Agricultural land irrigated by Delta water contributes billions of dollars in production for the nation. Two deep water ports serve as economic engines for the Central Valley, Northern
California, and the western States and are reliant on Delta waters and Federal Deep Draft Navigation Channels and levees for navigation. Delta levees protect such critical infrastructure as state and interstate highways, National rail lines, natural gas fields, gas
and fuel pipelines, water conveyance, drinking water pipelines, and numerous businesses and towns.

Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study
February 2014
Introduction:
This application of Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) is intended to quantify the anticipated
benefits to fish and wildlife resources that would occur with the creation of intertidal marsh
ecosystem restoration proposed in the Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study (Delta Study).
Project Description:
Corps of Engineers‐Sacramento District (Corps) and the Central Valley Flood Protection Board
(CVFPB) are considering restoration of intertidal marsh habitat using dredged material at Big
Break and Little Frank’s Tract. The ecosystem restoration measures that were retained through
all screenings include: restore intertidal habitat with subsidence reversal at Big Break, Frank’s
Tract, and Little Frank’s Tract. Detailed descriptions and final increments of these measures
follow.
Prior to levee construction in the 1800’s, Big Break, Frank’s Tract, and Little Frank’s Tract were
comprised of intertidal marsh. Levees were constructed to drain the lands for agricultural use,
resulting in subsidence of the land surface. Levee failure occurred in the early to mid 1900’s and
these areas were not reclaimed; however, enough subsidence had already occurred that these
open water expanses now function ecologically as lakes, providing no value to native species.
The primary action required to restore habitat value to native species at Big Break, Frank’s Tract,
and Little Frank’s Tract is subsidence reversal. Similar restoration actions were undertaken by
USACE in the 1990’s at nearby Venice Cut and Donlon Island. This restoration has
demonstrated that subsidence reversal to restore land surface to intertidal elevations, along with
minimal plantings, can result in successful restoration of intertidal marsh with 80% vegetation
coverage within 2 years. Measures considered at Big Break, Frank’s Tract, and Little Frank’s
Tract are based on the success of these reference sites.
Subsidence Reversal
While target elevations are consistent between the sites, current elevations vary from site to site,
resulting in differing requirements for volume of material per acre. Intertidal marsh restoration at
Big Break (1,064 acres of marsh with an additional 15% of open water) would require 12.7
million cubic yards of material, or 9,400 cubic yards of material per acre. Intertidal marsh
restoration at Frank’s Tracts (2,470 acres of marsh with an additional 15% of open water) would
require 42.6 million cubic yards of material, or 17,200 cubic yards of material per acre. Intertidal
marsh restoration at Little Frank’s Tracts (273 acres of marsh with an additional 15% of open
water) would require 4.6 million cubic yards of material, or 16,800 cubic yards of material per
acre.
Increments were developed for each site based on availability and proximity of fill material, as
this is the primary driver in restoring ecological function and the primary driver of cost. Based
on monitoring results from the Donlon Island and Venice Cut reference sites, it is expected that

placement of fill material to the appropriate elevations, followed by plantings of bulrush will be
the only required actions to restore intertidal marsh. As elevations are relatively constant within
each site, calculations were made to determine the volume of fill needed per acre at each site.
Volumes of available material were matched to the most efficient potential site. Potential sources
of material include:
• Direct placement from Operations and Maintenance dredging of the Stockton Deep
Water Ship Channel – assumes normal hydraulic dredging operations with suspended
material directly placed into the restoration area(s) via pipeline and contained in an
enclosed area surrounded by either existing high ground (remnant levees) or
sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to allow suspended material to settle and water
to filter through the silt curtains prior to exiting the site back into the waterways;
• Pumping previously dredged material from nearby stockpiles – utilize previously
dredged material in nearby stockpiles by creating a slurry that can be pumped into the
restoration area(s) via pipeline and contained in an enclosed area surrounded by either
existing high ground (remnant levees) or sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to
allow suspended material to settle and water to filter through the silt curtains prior to
exiting the site back into the waterways; and
• Trucking and/or barging material from borrow sites within a 30 mile radius – truck
and/or barge material from borrow sites within a 30 mile radius and place material
into the restoration area(s) either directly from trucks (where possible) or via
excavators on barges into an enclosed area surrounded by either existing high ground
(remnant levees) or sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to allow suspended material
to settle and water to filter through the silt curtains prior to exiting the site back into
the waterways.
Vegetation
Dredged material will be transported to the site as described above and placed to bring the
substrate to a target elevation of 4.5 feet mean sea level. This area will be conducive to aquatic
vegetation and anchored to the adjacent existing levee. The planting design includes planting
bulrush (Typha sp.) over the area and will be suitable to develop intertidal marsh habitat.
Plantings will be installed at 3 feet o.c. over 10% of the intertidal marsh area. The plant material
may be nursery grown, or collected from nearby sources and directly planted at the site.
Increments
Increments of restoration at each site were developed based on an acre grid system. Available fill
material calculations were used to determine the size of increments, i.e., how many grid cells
each increment included. Locations of increments are general within each site and are based on
proximity to fill material, proximity to remnant levees for improved constructability, and
connectivity to existing habitat. Measures considered at Big Break, Frank’s Tract, and Little
Frank’s Tract are based on the success of these reference sites.

HEP Overview:
The HEP is a methodology developed by the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) and other State
and Federal resource agencies which can be used to document the quality and quantity of
available habitat for selected fish and wildlife species. The HEP provides information for two
general types of habitat comparisons: (1) the relative value of different areas at the same point in
time; and (2) the relative value of the same areas at future points in time. By combining the two
types of comparisons, the impacts of the proposed or anticipated land-use and or water-use
changes on habitat can be quantified. In a similar manner, any compensation needs (in terms of
acreage) for the project can also be quantified, provided a mitigation plan has been developed for
specific mitigation sites.
A HEP application is based on the assumption that the value of a habitat for a selected species or
the value of a community can be described in a model which produces a Habitat Suitability Index
(HSI). This HSI value (from 0.0 to 1.0) is multiplied by the area of available habitat to obtain
Habitat Units (HUs). The HU and Average Annual Habitat Units (AAHUs) over the life of the
project are then used in the comparison described above. The reliability of a HEP application and
the significance of HUs are directly dependent on the ability of the user to assign a well-defined
and accurate HSI to the selected evaluation elements or communities. In addition, a user must be
able to measure the areas of each distinct habitat being utilized by fish and wildlife species
within the project area. Both the HSIs and the habitat acreages must also be reasonably estimable
at various future points in time. The HEP Team, comprised of Corps, DWR, and Service, staff,
determined that the HEP criteria could be met, or at least reasonably approximated, for the Delta
Study. Thus HEP was considered an appropriate analytical tool to assess the proposed restoration
project.
General HEP Assumptions:
Some general assumptions are necessary to use HEP and HSI Models in the impact assessment.
Use of HEP:
• The HEP is the preferred method to evaluate the impacts of the proposed project on fish
and/or wildlife resources.
• The HEP is a suitable methodology for quantifying project-induced impacts on fish and
wildlife habitats.
• Quality and quantity of fish and wildlife habitat can generally be numerically described
using the indices derived from the HSI models and associated habitat units.
• The HEP assessment is applicable to the habitat types being evaluated.
Use of HSI Models
• The HSI models are hypotheses based on available data.
• The HSI models are conceptual models and may not measure all ecological factors that
affect the quality of a given cover-type for the evaluation species (e.g. vulnerability to
predation). In some cases, assumptions may need to be made by the HEP Team and
incorporated into the analysis to account for loss of those factors not reflected by the
model.

Methodology:
This HEP application will be used to quantify the value of the ecosystem restoration of intertidal
marsh habitat proposed in the Delta Study.
A site visit to Big Break, Little Frank’s Tract, Frank’s Tract, and Donlon Island was attended by
Department of Water Resources (Ted Frink), Service (Brian Hansen), NMFS (Mike Hendrick
and Julie Wolford), and Corps (Brad Johnson and Brian Luke) on November 13, 2013. The HEP
team considered the proposed design, Donlon Island restoration site, a previous HEP for the
Bethel Island Levee Improvement Project, and Corps approved models in selecting the
appropriate HSI for the proposed intertidal marsh restoration.
The marsh wren HSI model was selected for use in projects with intertidal marsh habitats. Marsh
wrens require dense stands of emergent herbaceous vegetation, typically cattails and bulrushes
(Typha spp.) for nesting and cover. They prefer emergent vegetation in relatively deeper water, >
15 centimeters deep is considered optimum.
Model assumptions were developed as the basis for the assessment. The assumption regarding
existing and future without-project conditions is that little to no intertidal marsh habitat is or will
be present at the sites; therefore, AAHUs without-project are projected at 0.
The future with-project assumption is that elevations are restored to support a robust intertidal
marsh habitat shown in Table 1. Given these assumptions, long-term losses and gains in HUs can
be estimated for each future scenario over the life of the project, and then expressed as AAHU
gains (Table 2). A HSI value was calculated for each variable at year 1, 2, 25, and 50. A higher
numerical rating is indicative of a higher suitability for the evaluated element. The HSI, when
multiplied by the area of the habitat, yields HUs, a measure of the quality and quantity of the
habitat. Four habitat variables are used in this model to characterize the suitability of a wetland
for supplying cover and reproductive needs of marsh wrens.

•

Variable 1 – Growth form of emergent hydrophytes – Vegetation will be cattails and
bulrushes;
Variable 2 – Canopy cover of emergent herbaceous vegetation – Based on data collected
from restoration efforts at Donlon and Venice Cut Islands, canopy cover of emergent
herbaceous vegetation would quickly increase to 80% within 2 years from construction;
Variable 3 – Mean water depth – Mean water depth would exceed 15 centimeters; and
Variable 4 – Canopy cover of woody vegetation – The target design elevations would be
too low to support woody riparian vegetation.

Results and Discussion:
Table 2 shows the net change in AAHU’s for intertidal marsh habitat that could be created
resulting from the Delta Study. The three restoration areas are divided into increments based on
amount of available fill material. The large value in AAHU’s for acres created can be explained
by the quick establishment of intertidal marsh habitat (80% in 2 years) demonstrated in the
restoration completed at Donlon Island and Venice Cut.

Cost Effectiveness and Incremental Cost Analysis
Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study
February 2014
Introduction
Ecosystem restoration is one of the primary missions of the Corps of Engineers Civil
Works program. The Corps objective in ecosystem restoration planning is to contribute to
national ecosystem restoration (NER). Contributions to NER are increases in the net quantity
and/or quality of desired ecosystem resources. Measurement of NER is based on changes in
ecological resource quality and a function of improvement in habitat quality and/or quantity and
expressed quantitatively in physical units or indexes (but not monetary units). These net changes
are measured in the planning area and in the rest of the nation. Thus, single purpose ecosystem
restoration plans shall be formulated and evaluated in terms of their net contributions to increases
in ecosystem value (NER outputs) expressed in non-monetary units (habitat units).
For ecosystem restoration projects, a plan that reasonably maximizes ecosystem
restoration benefits compared to costs, consistent with the Federal objective, shall be selected.
The selected plan must be shown to be a cost effective plan for achieving the desired level of
output and economically justified (determined to be worth its investment cost). This plan shall be
identified as the NER Plan. This formulation, evaluation, and selection process is described
below.
A Cost Effectiveness and Incremental Cost Analysis (CE/ICA) analysis was conducted
using benefit and cost inputs using the certified IWR-Planning Suite software version 2.0.6.0
(IWR-PLAN).
Restoration Measures
The plan formulation process is described in detail in Section 3 of the Integrated Report.
That section describes the evaluation and screening of ecosystem measures and ultimately
included or excluded from the array of plans being considered. The ecosystem restoration
measures that were retained through all screenings include: restore intertidal habitat with
subsidence reversal at Big Break, Frank’s Tract, and Little Frank’s Tract.
The primary action required to restore habitat value to native species at Big Break,
Frank’s Tract, and Little Frank’s Tract is subsidence reversal. Similar restoration actions were
undertaken by USACE in the 1990’s at nearby Venice Cut and Donlon Island. This restoration
has demonstrated that subsidence reversal to restore land surface to intertidal elevations, along
with minimal plantings, can result in successful restoration of intertidal marsh with 80%
vegetation coverage within 2 years. Measures considered at Big Break, Frank’s Tract, and Little
Frank’s Tract are based on the success of these reference sites.

Subsidence Reversal
Studies conducted on reference sites at Donlon and Venice Cut Islands indicate that
optimum marsh wren habitat (i.e., where vegetative cover is greater than 75%) is found at
elevations ranging from approximately 2.8 to 4.8 feet. Therefore, using a conservative approach
for estimating quantity of fill, a target elevation of 4.5 feet was used to estimate fill quantities.
While target elevations are consistent between the sites, current elevations vary from site
to site, resulting in differing requirements for volume of material per acre. Intertidal marsh
restoration at Big Break (1,064 acres of marsh with an additional 15% of open water) would
require 12.7 million cubic yards of material, or 9,400 cubic yards of material per acre. Intertidal
marsh restoration at Frank’s Tracts (2,470 acres of marsh with an additional 15% of open water)
would require 42.6 million cubic yards of material, or 17,200 cubic yards of material per acre.
Intertidal marsh restoration at Little Frank’s Tracts (273 acres of marsh with an additional 15%
of open water) would require 4.6 million cubic yards of material, or 16,800 cubic yards of
material per acre.
Increments were developed for each site based on availability and proximity of fill
material, as this is the primary driver in restoring ecological function and the primary driver of
cost. Based on monitoring results from the Donlon Island and Venice Cut reference sites, it is
expected that placement of fill material to the appropriate elevations, followed by minimal
plantings of rushes will be the only required actions to restore intertidal marsh. As elevations are
relatively constant within each site, calculations were made to determine the volume of fill
needed per acre at each site. Volumes of available material were matched to the most efficient
potential site. Potential sources of material include:
• Direct placement from Operations and Maintenance dredging of the Stockton Deep
Water Ship Channel – assumes normal hydraulic dredging operations with suspended
material directly placed into the restoration area(s) via pipeline and contained in an
enclosed area surrounded by either existing high ground (remnant levees) or sacrificial
hay bales and silt curtains to allow suspended material to settle and water to filter through
the silt curtains prior to exiting the site back into the waterways;
• Pumping previously dredged material from nearby stockpiles – utilize previously dredged
material in nearby stockpiles by creating a slurry that can be pumped into the restoration
area(s) via pipeline and contained in an enclosed area surrounded by either existing high
ground (remnant levees) or sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to allow suspended
material to settle and water to filter through the silt curtains prior to exiting the site back
into the waterways; and
• Trucking and/or barging material from borrow sites within a 30 mile radius – truck
and/or barge material from borrow sites within a 30 mile radius and place material into
the restoration area(s) either directly from trucks (where possible) or via excavators on
barges into an enclosed area surrounded by either existing high ground (remnant levees)
or sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to allow suspended material to settle and water to
filter through the silt curtains prior to exiting the site back into the waterways.

Vegetation
Dredged material will be transported to the site as described above and placed to bring
the substrate to a target elevation of 4.5 feet mean sea level. This area will be conducive to
aquatic vegetation and anchored to the adjacent existing levee. The planting design includes
planting bulrush (Typha sp.) over the area and will be suitable to develop intertidal marsh
habitat. Plantings will be installed at 3 feet on center over 10% of the intertidal marsh area. The
plant material may be nursery grown, or collected from nearby sources and directly planted at the
site. It is anticipated that cattails will self-propagate on site. Additionally, 25 acres of the
adjacent existing levee will be treated to remove invasive non-native species, such as Himalayan
blackberry, pampas grass, pepper weed, etc. Records and reports will be required to document
what was done and how the site and plants progressed.
The restoration measures analyzed for the CE/ICA would restore intertidal habitat with
subsidence reversal at Big Break, Little Frank’s Tract, and Frank’s Tract.
Cost Effectiveness and Incremental Cost Analysis
A CE/ICA analysis was conducted using benefit and cost inputs with the IWR-PLAN.
The various separable element features were evaluated and compared, and recombined by the
software as discussed within this section.
The CE/ICA is an evaluation tool which considers and identifies the relationship between
changes in cost and changes in quantified, but not monetized, habitat benefits. The evaluation is
used to identify the most cost-effective alternative plans to reach various levels of restoration
output and to provide information about whether increasing levels of restoration are worth the
successively added costs. The CE/ICA is a planning tool to help identify cost-effective plans
which provide the highest habitat output relative to cost.
Functionally, the CE/ICA provides a framework for combining individual measures into
alternative plans. The software expedites this effort of testing each combination of measures and
tabulating the resulting costs and environmental benefits.
Cost Effectiveness Analysis
When there is no monetary measure of benefits but project outcomes can be described
and quantified in some dimension, cost effectiveness analysis can be used to assist on the
decision making process. Cost effectiveness analysis seeks to answer the question: given an
adequately described objective, what is the least-costly way of attaining the objective? A plan is
considered cost effective if it provides a given level of output for the least cost. Cost
effectiveness analysis was used to identify the least cost solution for each level of environmental
output being considered.
The cost effectiveness analysis is the first step in the CE/ICA, and compares the Average
Annual Habitat Units (AAHUs) potentially achieved by each alternative to the cost of each
alternative to generate a “cost per AAHU.” This cost provides a means to compare the cost-

effectiveness of each plan. The three criteria used for identifying non-cost effective plans or
combinations include (1) the same level of output could be produced by another plan at less cost;
(2) a larger output level could be produced at the same cost; or (3) a larger output level could be
produced at less cost. Cost-effectiveness is one of the criteria by which all plans are judged and
plays a role in the selection of the National Ecosystem Restoration (NER) Plan. Non-cost
effective combinations of plans are dropped from further consideration.
Incremental Cost Analysis
Incremental cost analysis compares the additional costs to the additional outputs of an
alternative. It is a tool that can assist in the plan formulation and evaluation process. The analysis
consists of examining increments of plans or project features to determine their incremental costs
and incremental benefits. Increments of plans continue to be added and evaluated as long as the
incremental benefits exceed the incremental costs. When the incremental costs exceed the
incremental benefits, no further increments are added. Incremental analysis helps to identify and
display variations in costs among different increments of restoration measures and alternative
plans. Incremental analysis helps decision makers determine the most desirable level of output
relative to costs and other decision criteria.
The incremental cost analysis portion of the CE/ICA compares the incremental costs for
each additional unit of output from one cost effective plan to the next to identify “best buy”
plans. The first step in developing “best buy” plans is to determine the incremental cost per unit.
The plan with the lowest incremental cost per unit over the No Action Alternative is the first
incremental best buy plan. Plans that have a higher incremental cost per unit for a lower level of
output are eliminated. The next step is to recalculate the incremental cost per unit for the
remaining plans. This process is reiterated until the lowest incremental cost per unit for the next
level of output is determined. The intent of the incremental analysis is to identify successively
larger plans with the smallest incremental cost per unit of incremental output.
Selection Considerations
For ecosystem restoration, the recommended plan should be the justified alternative and
scale having the maximum excess of monetary and non-monetary beneficial effects over
monetary and nonmonetary costs. This plan occurs where the incremental beneficial effects just
equal the incremental costs, or alternatively stated, where the extra environmental value is just
worth the extra costs. A plan that reasonably maximizes ecosystem restoration benefits compared
to costs, consistent with the Federal objective, is identified as the National Ecosystem
Restoration (NER) Plan. The selected plan should be cost effective and justified in achieving the
desired level of output. Thus, the NER plan is selected from the suite of cost effective plans
identified in the CE/ICA. While the NER Plan is not required to be a best buy plan, this is often
the case. The results of the CE/ICA do not provide a discrete decision, but rather they offer tools
to help inform a decision.

Costs
The construction methodologies used to generate the cost estimate follow standard
industry practices for standard wet and dry earthwork conditions. Earthwork crews were
developed in MCACES MII with production quantities pulled from the Cost Engineering Section
ProdQuant.xls spreadsheet. The dry earthwork techniques rely primarily on heavy earthmoving
equipment including: Dozers, scrapers and hydraulic excavators while the wet earthwork
techniques rely on barge mounted cranes with a low draft. Pumping costs were generated from
an MCACES MII model refined with bid information from multiple contractor proposals for
similar work in the immediate area. Pumping techniques require pipes to be laid over land and
secured to the river channel bottom as needed to maintain the most direct, cost efficient and low
environmental and local impact. The material source sites placing at Big Break are assumed to
be dependent on the McCormick dredge material storage site pumping operation in order to
create cost savings by utilizing McCormick's infrastructure following completion of its pumping
operation. The outflow of the pipe is considered mobile and would be repositioned regularly in
order to spread materials throughout the site. Some leveling of deposited material may be
required. Normal O&M dredging costs were excluded from this analysis, only the additional
pumping needed for restoration was considered. A summary of construction costs are included in
Table 1.
Table 1: Costs of Increments/Measures (Sept 2013 Price Level)

Increments
The inputs into the IWR-PLAN included seven increments, or solutions as identified in
the model, for Big Break, three increments for Frank’s Tract, and two increments for Little
Frank’s Tract (Table 2). Increments of restoration at each site were developed based on an acre
grid system. Available fill material calculations were used to determine the size of increments,
i.e., how many grid cells each increment included. It should be noted that the first increments at

each site are relatively small, with a large increment for the remainder of the site. This sizing is
a product of available fill material. The smaller increments were developed based on available
material that could be transported to the site without major modifications (i.e., construction of a
bridge, multiple transfers between trucks and barges, etc.). The larger increment includes the
remainder of each site for which a more efficient source of available material could not be
identified. Locations of increments are general within each site and are based on proximity to
fill material, proximity to remnant levees for improved constructability, and connectivity to
existing habitat.

CE/ICA Model Implementation
The restoration increments that were developed based on source material, material
distribution method, and location were entered in the IWR model as solutions. The model inputs
include two relationship dependencies. Big Break increments 3, 4, 5, and 6 all depend on
increment 2, pumping from McCormick Pit. Source material for the dependent increments will
first be pumped to McCormick Pit and then pumped from McCormick Pit to the restoration site.
The second relationship dependency is Frank’s Tract increment 2, which is dependent on
increment 1, pumping from Roberts Island 2. Source material from increment 2 (Roberts Island
1) will first be pumped to Roberts Island 2 and then pumped from Roberts Island 2 to the
restoration site.

Results
This comparison between increments was made using IWR-PLAN to conduct cost
effectiveness and incremental cost analysis based on costs (dollars) and outputs (marsh wren
AAHU). Incremental costs per unit of output were used to identify major breakpoints in cost
efficiency among the alternatives. These outputs are shown in Tables 3 and 4, and Figures 1 and
2:
The model run resulted in a total of 536 cost effective plans. Of these cost effective plans,
12 plans were identified as best buy plans including the no action plan. Table 3 presents the cost,
benefits, and incremental cost for each of the 12 best buy plans.
Outputs increase as alternatives progress (1-12); however, these outputs are achieved at
increasingly higher incremental costs. Breaks in incremental cost are found at Alternatives 2, 6,
8, and 12; therefore, these alternatives were identified as the most logical candidates for plan
selection. The incremental cost per AAHU for Alternative 2 is about $4,800 which is associated
with maintenance dredging and is the least expensive means of obtaining material. The increase
in cost per AAHU of Alternative 3-6 ranges from about $15,000 to $17,700. The increase
reflects the use of stockpiles dredged material. Alternatives 7 and 8 are in the next increment
break of about $30,000 per AAHU. This increase is due to the having to pump a longer distance
and pumping across the Sacramento River from the Rio Vista Pit for Alternative 7, and for
pumping a relatively small amount of material from Augusto Pit for Alternative 8. The
incremental break at Alternative 9 of about $43,500 is due to the increase in distance to pump
from Roberts Island 1 and 2 to the Frank’s Tract site. The three final alternatives have the largest
cost per AAHU. Even though the AAHU output is substantially higher, the cost of having to
truck or barge the needed material ranges from about $56,000 to $103,000 per AAHU.

Important Information About Your Species List
How We Make Species Lists
We store information about endangered and threatened species lists by U.S. Geological
Survey 7½ minute quads. The United States is divided into these quads, which are about the
size of San Francisco.
The animals on your species list are ones that occur within, or may be affected by projects
within, the quads covered by the list.
z

z

z

Fish and other aquatic species appear on your list if they are in the same watershed as your
quad or if water use in your quad might affect them.
Amphibians will be on the list for a quad or county if pesticides applied in that area may be
carried to their habitat by air currents.
Birds are shown regardless of whether they are resident or migratory. Relevant birds on the
county list should be considered regardless of whether they appear on a quad list.

Plants
Any plants on your list are ones that have actually been observed in the area covered by the
list. Plants may exist in an area without ever having been detected there. You can find out
what's in the surrounding quads through the California Native Plant Society's online
Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants.

Surveying
Some of the species on your list may not be affected by your project. A trained biologist
and/or botanist, familiar with the habitat requirements of the species on your list, should
determine whether they or habitats suitable for them may be affected by your project. We
recommend that your surveys include any proposed and candidate species on your list.
See our Protocol and Recovery Permits pages.
For plant surveys, we recommend using the Guidelines for Conducting and Reporting
Botanical Inventories. The results of your surveys should be published in any environmental
documents prepared for your project.

Your Responsibilities Under the Endangered Species Act
All animals identified as listed above are fully protected under the Endangered Species Act of
1973, as amended. Section 9 of the Act and its implementing regulations prohibit the take of
a federally listed wildlife species. Take is defined by the Act as "to harass, harm, pursue,
hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect" any such animal.
Take may include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or
injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding,
feeding, or shelter (50 CFR §17.3).

http://www.fws.gov/sacramento/es_species/Lists/es_species_lists.cfm

10/24/2013

Sacramento Fish & Wildlife Office Species List

Page 6 of 7

Take incidental to an otherwise lawful activity may be authorized by one of two
procedures:
z

If a Federal agency is involved with the permitting, funding, or carrying out of a project that may
result in take, then that agency must engage in a formal consultation with the Service.
During formal consultation, the Federal agency, the applicant and the Service work together to
avoid or minimize the impact on listed species and their habitat. Such consultation would result
in a biological opinion by the Service addressing the anticipated effect of the project on listed and
proposed species. The opinion may authorize a limited level of incidental take.

z

If no Federal agency is involved with the project, and federally listed species may be taken as
part of the project, then you, the applicant, should apply for an incidental take permit. The
Service may issue such a permit if you submit a satisfactory conservation plan for the species
that would be affected by your project.
Should your survey determine that federally listed or proposed species occur in the area and are
likely to be affected by the project, we recommend that you work with this office and the
California Department of Fish and Game to develop a plan that minimizes the project's direct and
indirect impacts to listed species and compensates for project-related loss of habitat. You should
include the plan in any environmental documents you file.

Critical Habitat
When a species is listed as endangered or threatened, areas of habitat considered essential
to its conservation may be designated as critical habitat. These areas may require special
management considerations or protection. They provide needed space for growth and
normal behavior; food, water, air, light, other nutritional or physiological requirements;
cover or shelter; and sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring, germination or
seed dispersal.
Although critical habitat may be designated on private or State lands, activities on these
lands are not restricted unless there is Federal involvement in the activities or direct harm to
listed wildlife.
If any species has proposed or designated critical habitat within a quad, there will be a
separate line for this on the species list. Boundary descriptions of the critical habitat may be
found in the Federal Register. The information is also reprinted in the Code of Federal
Regulations (50 CFR 17.95). See our Map Room page.

Candidate Species
We recommend that you address impacts to candidate species. We put plants and animals
on our candidate list when we have enough scientific information to eventually propose them
for listing as threatened or endangered. By considering these species early in your planning
process you may be able to avoid the problems that could develop if one of these candidates
was listed before the end of your project.

Species of Concern
The Sacramento Fish & Wildlife Office no longer maintains a list of species of concern.
However, various other agencies and organizations maintain lists of at-risk species. These
lists provide essential information for land management planning and conservation efforts.
More info

Wetlands
If your project will impact wetlands, riparian habitat, or other jurisdictional waters as defined
by section 404 of the Clean Water Act and/or section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, you
will need to obtain a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Impacts to wetland

habitats require site specific mitigation and monitoring. For questions regarding wetlands,
please contact Mark Littlefield of this office at (916) 414-6520.

Updates
Our database is constantly updated as species are proposed, listed and delisted. If you
address proposed and candidate species in your planning, this should not be a problem.
However, we recommend that you get an updated list every 90 days. That would be January
22, 2014.

We store information about endangered and threatened species lists by U.S. Geological
Survey 7½ minute quads. The United States is divided into these quads, which are about the
size of San Francisco.
The animals on your species list are ones that occur within, or may be affected by projects
within, the quads covered by the list.

z

Fish and other aquatic species appear on your list if they are in the same watershed as your
quad or if water use in your quad might affect them.
Amphibians will be on the list for a quad or county if pesticides applied in that area may be
carried to their habitat by air currents.
Birds are shown regardless of whether they are resident or migratory. Relevant birds on the
county list should be considered regardless of whether they appear on a quad list.

Plants
Any plants on your list are ones that have actually been observed in the area covered by the
list. Plants may exist in an area without ever having been detected there. You can find out
what's in the surrounding quads through the California Native Plant Society's online
Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants.

Surveying
Some of the species on your list may not be affected by your project. A trained biologist
and/or botanist, familiar with the habitat requirements of the species on your list, should
determine whether they or habitats suitable for them may be affected by your project. We
recommend that your surveys include any proposed and candidate species on your list.
See our Protocol and Recovery Permits pages.
For plant surveys, we recommend using the Guidelines for Conducting and Reporting
Botanical Inventories. The results of your surveys should be published in any environmental
documents prepared for your project.

Your Responsibilities Under the Endangered Species Act
All animals identified as listed above are fully protected under the Endangered Species Act of
1973, as amended. Section 9 of the Act and its implementing regulations prohibit the take of
a federally listed wildlife species. Take is defined by the Act as "to harass, harm, pursue,
hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect" any such animal.
Take may include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or
injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding,
feeding, or shelter (50 CFR §17.3).

Take incidental to an otherwise lawful activity may be authorized by one of two
procedures:
z

If a Federal agency is involved with the permitting, funding, or carrying out of a project that may
result in take, then that agency must engage in a formal consultation with the Service.
During formal consultation, the Federal agency, the applicant and the Service work together to
avoid or minimize the impact on listed species and their habitat. Such consultation would result
in a biological opinion by the Service addressing the anticipated effect of the project on listed and
proposed species. The opinion may authorize a limited level of incidental take.

z

If no Federal agency is involved with the project, and federally listed species may be taken as
part of the project, then you, the applicant, should apply for an incidental take permit. The
Service may issue such a permit if you submit a satisfactory conservation plan for the species
that would be affected by your project.
Should your survey determine that federally listed or proposed species occur in the area and are
likely to be affected by the project, we recommend that you work with this office and the
California Department of Fish and Game to develop a plan that minimizes the project's direct and
indirect impacts to listed species and compensates for project-related loss of habitat. You should
include the plan in any environmental documents you file.

Critical Habitat
When a species is listed as endangered or threatened, areas of habitat considered essential
to its conservation may be designated as critical habitat. These areas may require special
management considerations or protection. They provide needed space for growth and
normal behavior; food, water, air, light, other nutritional or physiological requirements;
cover or shelter; and sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring, germination or
seed dispersal.

Page 6 of 6

Although critical habitat may be designated on private or State lands, activities on these
lands are not restricted unless there is Federal involvement in the activities or direct harm to
listed wildlife.
If any species has proposed or designated critical habitat within a quad, there will be a
separate line for this on the species list. Boundary descriptions of the critical habitat may be
found in the Federal Register. The information is also reprinted in the Code of Federal
Regulations (50 CFR 17.95). See our Map Room page.

Candidate Species
We recommend that you address impacts to candidate species. We put plants and animals
on our candidate list when we have enough scientific information to eventually propose them
for listing as threatened or endangered. By considering these species early in your planning
process you may be able to avoid the problems that could develop if one of these candidates
was listed before the end of your project.

Species of Concern
The Sacramento Fish & Wildlife Office no longer maintains a list of species of concern.
However, various other agencies and organizations maintain lists of at-risk species. These
lists provide essential information for land management planning and conservation efforts.
More info

Wetlands
If your project will impact wetlands, riparian habitat, or other jurisdictional waters as defined
by section 404 of the Clean Water Act and/or section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, you
will need to obtain a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Impacts to wetland
habitats require site specific mitigation and monitoring. For questions regarding wetlands,
please contact Mark Littlefield of this office at (916) 414-6520.

Updates
Our database is constantly updated as species are proposed, listed and delisted. If you
address proposed and candidate species in your planning, this should not be a problem.
However, we recommend that you get an updated list every 90 days. That would be January
22, 2014.

INTRODUCTION

The Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District (Corps), and the Central Valley Flood
Protection Board propose to restore 89.5 acres of emergent marsh habitat using dredged
material in the west central portion of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta). Dredged
material would be transported and placed to restore areas of emergent marsh habitat at Big
Break and Little Frank’s Tract in the west central California Delta.
The purpose of this Biological Assessment (BA) is to analyze the potential effects from the
proposed project on listed threatened or endangered species and on designated critical
habitat, within the project’s area of effect (action area). The outcome of this BA and
consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) will determine the need for
formal consultation or whether a determination of “not likely to adversely affect” is
appropriate for listed species that may be affected.
This BA indicates that the proposed action “may affect” the Federally-listed threatened Delta
smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and the giant garter snake (Thamnophis gigas) and
therefore requires consultation with the USFWS, pursuant to Section 7(a)(2) of the federal
Endangered Species Act (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1536 (c)). Section 7 consultation is required to
ensure that the proposed project and alternatives are not likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of any federally listed species or result in the adverse modification of designated
critical habitat.
1.1 Project Overview
1.1.1 Location of Project Area
The project area is located approximately 2 miles west of the city of Antioch in the west
central portion of the Delta (Figures 1 and 2). The area’s approximate boundaries are the San
Joaquin River and Threemile Slough on the north, Sacramento River and Sherman Lake on
the west, south edge of Big Break and Dutch Slough on the south, and east edge of Frank’s
Tract and Fisherman’s Cut on the east.
1.1.2

Project Purpose

The proposed action is proposed under the Sacramento – San Joaquin Rivers Delta Islands
and Levees Feasibility Study (DILFS). The study also evaluated measures to reduce risk of
major flood damage in the Delta but no Federal interest was found in flood risk management.
Congressional authorization would be sought for construction of the project.
DILFS is analyzing the feasibility of restoring intertidal habitat by subsidence reversal in the
flooded areas of the Delta. Big Break and Little Frank’s Tracts are currently flooded islands
that were historically tidal marsh before levees were constructed and reclaimed for
agriculture and then became submerged when their levees failed.

The remaining ecosystems in the Delta no longer maintain the functions and richness that
historically defined the pre-channelized system. The measures of ecological health continue
to decline without preventive or restorative actions.
Before land reclamation for agriculture and flood control activities around the turn of the
20th century, the Delta supported a complex network of rivers and sloughs with in-channel
islands and vast expanses of tidal marsh. Much of the vegetation of the Delta (approximately
380,000 acres; 1,538 square kilometers) was dominated by tidal marshes (Atwater 1980;
Institute 1998). By 1930, island reclamation was complete, and by 1980, only about 16,000
acres (65 square kilometers) of marshes remained (Atwater 1980; The Bay Institute 1998).
Today, these areas of former tidal marshes consist primarily of channelized waterways
surrounding highly productive row-cropped agricultural islands that are protected from
flooding by over 1,300 miles (2,093 kilometers) of levees.
Freshwater tidal marsh constitutes the primary target vegetation type and habitat for the
proposed project. Other planning efforts in the Delta are also underway, including the Delta
Vision Strategic Plan, the CALFED Ecosystem Restoration Plan, and the Bay Delta
Conservation Plan, to restore tidal marsh and improve the ecological health of the Bay-Delta
Ecosystem. The proposed Dutch Slough Tidal Restoration Project, adjacent to and east of
Big Break, will restore tidal wetlands and other habitats on 1,166 acres of land owned by
DWR in eastern Contra Costa County near Oakley. The former dairy lands were slated for
residential development, but were instead purchased by the State so that declining natural
habitats of the Delta could be restored to the site. Restoration at Big Break and Little Frank’s
Tracts and Dutch Slough would in combination create a large continuous block of restored
habitat which would be important for dispersal of plant and wildlife populations and those
species requiring large habitat blocks.
1.1.3 Proposed Action
The proposed project consists of 89.5 acres of tidal marsh restoration at Big Break (80.3
acres) and Little Frank’s Tract (9.7 acres) (Figure 2). To restore the habitat, approximately
1.1 million cubic yards of fill material would be placed via direct placement of dredged
material from yearly Operations and Maintenance (O&M) dredging from the San Francisco
to Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel over a period of five years and via pumping of
previously dredged material from existing dredged material placement sites. A detailed
description of the proposed action is in Section 2.
Final Alternatives
The DILFS evaluated a range of measures and alternatives to restore ecosystem values.
Below is a brief summary of the final alternatives. Alternative 3 below represents the
tentatively selected plan and the Corps’ proposed action addressed in detail in this BA.
Alternative 1 - No Action. Alternative 1 is the no action plan and assumes that the
Corps would not participate in the restoration of wildlife habitat at Big Break and
Little Frank’s Tract.

Alternative 2 – O&M Placement. Alternative 2 consists of placing 500,000 cubic
yards (cy) of material dredged from the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel directly
into open water habitat to restore about 42 acres of intertidal marsh habitat at Big
Break. The restoration work would be conducted over 5 years as part of the yearly
O&M dredging of the ship channel. The environmental effects of the O&M dredging
and placement of material at the existing McCormick, Bradford, and Scour storage
sites are evaluated in the Corps’ San Francisco to Stockton Deepwater Ship Channel,
Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), scheduled for final release in
early 2015. Pumping of the wet dredged material from the O&M dredging ship to the
proposed placement site at Big Break is evaluated as part of DILFS.
Alternative 3 – O&M Placement/Overland Pumping. Alternative 3 includes the
restoration proposed under Alternative 2 but includes additional restoration at Big
Break and Little Frank’s Tract (see Figures 3 and 4). The work would involve
placing a total of 1,112,000 cy of dredged material into open water habitat to restore a
total of 89.5 acres of intertidal marsh habitat. The restoration work would be
conducted over 5 years as part of the yearly O&M dredging of the ship channel.
Previously stockpiled dredged material obtained from the McCormick, Bradford,
Scour, and Decker storage sites would also be placed in conjunction with the O&M
placement to increase the area of restored habitat.
The environmental effects of the O&M dredging and placement of material at the existing
McCormick, Bradford, and Scour storage sites are being evaluated in the Corps’ San
Francisco to Stockton Deepwater Ship Channel, Supplemental EIS, which is currently being
prepared for release in 2014. Removal and use of the stockpiled material are evaluated as
part of DILFS.
1.2 Species Covered
The USFWS online services species list was accessed on 16 December 2013. The database
query for special-status species was based on a search of the USGS 7.5’ quadrangles on
which the project area is located (i.e., Jersey Island [480C], Bouldin Island [480D]), Rio
Vista [480B], and Antioch North [481D]. The resulting USFWS query is included in
Appendix A. The California Natural Diversity Database was also queried for presence
information.
The USFWS database query identified 24 listed species as potentially present in the project
area. The list was reviewed; habitat preferences for each species were compared with the
affected areas and project site description. This BA covers two federally-listed threatened
species that could be affected by the project that are known to occur, or with suitable habitat,
in or near the project area:
•
•

delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and its critical habitat, and
giant garter snake (Thamnophis gigas)

by project-related impacts such as ground disturbance, noise, changes in water quality and
quantity, changes in air quality, and lighting effects.
The action area for this BA consists of the restoration work sites which include parts of Big
Break, and Little Frank’s Tract; existing dredged material storage sites; and linear corridors
of agricultural land and waterways between the storage sites and the two flooded islands
(Figure 2, 3, and 4). The project area encompasses approximately 600 acres of both land and
water. Most of the project area is either agricultural land or open water although there are
several developed areas on the south edge of Big Break and Bethel Island.
1.4 Critical Habitat in the Action Area
1.4.1 Designated Critical Habitat
The delta smelt is listed under both the ESA and California Endangered Species Act as a
threatened species (58 FR 12854, March 5, 1993). The designated critical habitat for delta
smelt encompasses the Delta and the Sacramento River upstream to the mouth of American
River (RM 60).

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED ACTION

2.1 Project Restoration Sites and Construction Process
Big Break
The proposed habitat restoration would restore approximately 80.3 acres of emergent marsh
habitat over 5 years. The existing remnant levees would serve as the anchor point to begin
filling activities. In subsequent years, the newly restored marsh complexes would serve as
the anchor points for filling.
Approximately 100,000 cy of dredged material from O&M dredging is available on a yearly
basis. Increment 1 (dredging sources) at Big Break would take approximately 5 years to
complete. The O&M dredged material would be pumped directly into Big Break, creating
about 41.9 acres of emergent marsh habitat per year. Material for Increments 2, 3, and 5
would come from dry dredged material storage sites within pumping distances (2 to 7 miles)
of Big Break (see Table 1).
Little Frank’s Tract
The proposed habitat restoration would restore approximately 9.15 acres of emergent marsh
habitat in 1 year. The existing remnant levee would serve as the anchor point to begin filling
activities. Dredged material would come from the Bradford dry storage site (see Table 2).

Borrow Material Sources

Two material sources identified for the project include future dredged materials from O&M
activities of deep water ship channels and existing stored materials from previous O&M
activities (Figure 6). Prior to placement, material from the sources (i.e., dredging or existing
storage site) would be sampled and analyzed for contaminants to determine suitability of use
at the proposed habitat restoration placement sites. Material test results would be compared
with existing baseline samples from Big Break and Little Frank’s Tract to determine
suitability. Placement materials must be “cleaner,” i.e., have fewer contaminants, than the
existing baseline sample from the storage site.
O&M Wet Dredged Material
Dredged material would come from O&M activities in the San Joaquin River between station
points 200+00 and1000+00 (see Figure 4). The Sacramento District is currently updating a
BA for submittal to the USFWS for this separate action. A subsequent Biological Opinion
will be issued by the USFWS, allowing the Corps to begin maintenance dredging activities in

2015. Wet material would be directly pumped to storage sites. See “Construction Process”
Section - Operations and Maintenance Dredging below. Material chemical and granular
composition analyses would be conducted in advance of placement into storage areas.
Stored Dry Dredged Material
Existing dredged materials that are stored at the dry Sherman Island McCormack pit,
Sherman Island Scour Pond, Decker Island, and Bradford Island sites would provide
additional material. Figure 6 shows the location of the proposed dredging and dry dredged
material storage sites. Tables 1 and 2 show the incremental material sources.
Sherman Island McCormack Pit. McCormack Pit encompasses 26 acres. The site contains
50 percent dredged material sand dunes and 40 percent non-native grass vegetation (refer to
Figure 7 for vegetation mapping) . The remaining area is composed of constructed wetlands
from gravity drained water. Most water is drained to an agricultural ditch and then pumped
off-site.
Sherman Island Scour Pond. Scour Pond has 15 acres of storage area. The site contains 20
percent dredged material sand dunes and 60 percent non-native grass vegetation. The
remaining area is composed of constructed wetlands from water draining to an existing
agricultural ditch. The remaining 20 percent of the site is natural wetlands (refer to Figure 8
for vegetation mapping). The USFWS has determined that the area is off-limits to
disturbance. On site water is gravity drained to an existing agricultural ditch and then
pumped off-site.
Bradford Island. The Bradford Island dredged material storage site encompasses 110 acres.
The site contains 40 percent dredged material sand dunes, 40 percent non-native grass
vegetation, and 20 percent willow stands (refer to Figure 9 for vegetation mapping). The
remaining storage area is composed of drainage structures allowing water to exit the site. Onsite water is gravity drained to an existing agricultural ditch and then pumped off-site. The
site is frequently used for cattle grazing. Accessibility is by boat only.
Decker Island. The Decker Island dredged material storage site encompasses 334 acres. The
site contains 60 percent dredged material sand dunes and 30 percent non-native grass
vegetation (Figure 10). The remaining disposal area is composed of drainage structures
allowing water to exit the site. Material is placed around existing on-going sand mining
operations. The site is accessible only by boat.
2.3

Construction Activities

Site Preparation and Equipment Mobilization
Mobilization would begin in August of each construction year. The proposed construction
period would extend from August 1 to October 31. Future Biological Opinions from the
USFWS and NOAA Fisheries would define the exact in-water work period. Work hours
would be 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Thursday.

Work and support areas that contain vegetation, large rocks, snags, and uneven terrain would
be cleared, grubbed, and in some cases leveled to provide a flatter working surface. Clearing,
grubbing, and leveling activities would be conducted in accordance with a Site Preparation
Plan normally developed either by the Corps or a designated construction contractor in
advance of project construction. Corps’ multi-year construction projects that are not subject
to permanent construction would be regraded and revegetated, where feasible and
practicable.
Following site preparation, the equipment and materials necessary for movement of dredged
materials would be transported to designated staging areas and set up, assembled, parked,
stored, and/or stockpiled for use. Throughout the multi-year construction period, construction
equipment, materials, and supplies would be replenished, replaced, dismantled, removed, and
changed, as needed, in the appropriate staging areas to support the various material pumping
actions. Figures 7-9 show the proposed staging areas for each storage site.
Staging Areas and Haul Routes
The existing storage sites are previously disturbed. The staging area would be positioned in
the safest, most feasible position to expedite the work. The existing storage sites have
existing staging and disturbed areas that could be reused. No effects to resources are
anticipated from temporary roads and staging areas. If necessary, temporary haul roads
would be constructed in accordance with common construction practices. Road bases would
be of compacted earth with gravel added, as needed, for stability. Road widths would vary to
accommodate one-way and two-way travel by off-road trucks, scrapers, dozers, and loaders.
Watering trucks and other dust controlling practices would be used, as needed, to minimize
fugitive dust emissions.
Construction Site Electric Power
Temporary diesel or propane 3-phase 120/240-volt electric power generators would be
provided during the multi-year construction period to run construction equipment including
conveyors, water pumps slurry mixer, and pumping station. To supply the necessary
electrical power, a small temporary substation-switching station would be set up in the
staging area for each storage site.
Fluidization/Pumping Plant
Existing dredged materials from the storage sites would be pumped to the proposed
restoration areas through 18-inch double wall, high density plastic extrusion (HDPE) pipe. A
hydraulic slurry hopper at the storage site would create the fluidization process necessary to
transport the dredged materials. Water necessary for the process would be siphoned from the
adjacent rivers by a hydraulic pump and transferred to the slurry hopper. Photograph 1
shows a portable water pump siphoning water. A loader would place dredged materials onto
a conveyer system that deposits materials into the slurry hopper (see Photograph 2).
The hopper mixes dredged materials with water, creating a 90 percent water-based slurry
solution that is pumped through the HDPE piping network. In-water piping that is not
anchored to the bottom would float at the surface by means of floatation devices (Photograph

3). A work boat and crew would tender the position of the floating pipe and outfall pipe
during pumping operations to ensure safe and correct alignment and placement of materials.
The dredged materials would be pumped August through November over 4 years. During
the first year of construction, dredged materials from the McCormack Pit site would be
pumped to the Big Break restoration area. The McCormack Pit site would then serve as a
permanent pump site for the subsequent years. In year 2, an additional pump would be
positioned at Sherman Island Scour Pond and then moved the following year to Decker
Island. Dredged material from the Bradford Island site would be pumped to Little Frank’s
Tract in year 1. Table 3 shows the pump station position by year and material destination.
Figure 5 shows the proposed piping layout schematic.

The HDPE piping schematic would require permits and easements to place pipe sections
through water courses, over levees, and across private property. Major river crossings at
navigable channels would require semi-permanent submerged piping for the life of the
project. Pipe segments would be anchored to the bottom to avoid effects to shipping and
recreation. A specialized marine craft with a crane and underwater processing head would be
required to install and secure the pipe segments on the river bottom (see Figure 10). Semipermanent anchoring would occur at the Decker Island to Sherman Island (Sacramento
River) and Sherman Island to Jersey Island (San Joaquin River) crossings. All other in-water
piping would be submerged for safety by using weights. This would allow boat tender crews
to easily move piping, as necessary, for safety and pumping.
Overland piping would be placed at the sides of existing roads, in existing irrigation ditches,
or in disturbed areas. Crossings over private property would require easements and possible
compensation for lost cropland areas.

Dry Material Placement
Turbidity Curtains and Hay Bales. The hydraulic slurry would be discharged at the
restoration site at a rate of 450 cy per hour/4,000 cy per day. Placement would begin using
remnant levees as an anchor/starting point. Turbidity curtains and hay bales would be used to
control sediment plumes, comply with water quality requirements, and aid with settlement
(see Figure 11). The tops of the hay bale line would be set at mean low tide level to allow
fish with an opportunity to escape the work area. Turbidity curtains would float slightly
above the bottom, allowing aquatic species to escape entrapment. Pumped materials would
be placed to bring the soil depth to 4.5 feet relative to mean sea level.
High Solids Dredging Placement Option. High solids dredging is a technique that uses
mechanical dredging to produce a slurry that is 50 to 80 percent solids, thus resulting in a
relatively clean effluent. This technique can be used to fill geotextile containers, which can
then be used to build a form for the outer ring of an island. Photograph 5 shows construction
of an island using geotextile containers. High solids dredging is one of the only techniques
suitable for building islands out of a highly silty material. This technique can be used when
contaminants are present in the sediment. This method would be used in high-flow areas
potentially subject to increased turbidity from placement, such as Increment 1 at Frank’s
Tract. Turbidity curtains would be used in conjunction with the geotextile containers to
manage water quality.
O&M Dredging
A pipeline hydraulic suction dredge would be used for O&M dredging under the existing
General Order Waste Discharge Requirement No. 05-01-116 for the Sacramento and
Stockton Deep Water Ship Channels. The general order allows clamshell dredging to be
used, if practicable, and if contract or project conditions change. Dredging rates vary
depending on the type of material being dredged and length of downtime during
repositioning of equipment and switching of crews. However, typical production rates vary
from 300 to 600 cy per operational hour. The O&M dredging operations are expected to be
conducted 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
Wet material would be pumped from the dredging ship directly to the proposed restoration
sites at Big Break. Materials would be pumped through a floating 18-inch double wall
HDPE pipe. The piping system would be placed along the shoreline of the Stockton
Deepwater Ship Channel in the San Joaquin River. The pipeline would be submerged and
anchored to the bottom, when necessary, to avoid navigation hazards. A floating repeater
pump station would be positioned every 3 miles to aid slurry flow. Work boats would install
and maintain the floating pipeline to the Big Break restoration sites from the dredging ship.
An additional work boat and crew would tender the position of the outfall slurry pipe during
pumping operations to ensure correct placement of materials. Placement would occur from
August 1 to October 31 over a 5-year period.

Plantings
The planting design includes planting bulrush (Typha sp.) over the newly restored areas.
Plantings would be installed at 3 feet o.c. (average spacing) over 10 percent of the emergent
marsh area. The plant material could be nursery grown or collected from nearby sources and
directly planted at the site. Additionally, 25 acres of the adjacent remnant levee would be
treated to remove weed species such as blackberry, pampas grass, and pepper weed. All
other disturbed areas would be reseeded with native grasses, as needed, to help minimize
erosion.
2.4

Maintenance and Monitoring

Plantings
New vegetative plantings would not require maintenance. Soil accretion and vegetative
recruitment have historically aided plantings on restored intertidal marsh habitats. Plantings
typically survive and reach desired density in 2 years. Monitoring records and reports would
be required to document planting processes and progress.
Chemical monitoring:
Sediment in the proposed restoration areas will be characterized and analyzed to determine if
negative impacts are expected during restoration. Following placement and settling,
sediment will be sampled for compounds that require detection either through existing Total
Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) amendments or the 401 permit process. A water quality
monitoring plan will be prepared for dredging and placement activities.
2.5 Avoidance and Minimization Measures
The following addresses proposed conservation measures that are a part of the proposed
action and are designed to minimize and avoid project-related impacts to federally listed and
proposed species and their habitats.
Fish Protection Measures
The following measures would be implemented to minimize short-term impacts to special
status fish species from construction:
•

During construction activities, stockpiling of construction materials, portable
equipment, vehicles, and supplies shall be restricted to the designated construction
staging areas.

•

A qualified biologist shall provide worker environmental awareness training to
contractors and construction crews regarding all special status fish species known
to potentially occur near the construction sites.

•

A representative (onsite monitor) shall be appointed by the Corps to be the point
of contact for any worker that observes a dead, injured, or entrapped special status
fish. Dead or injured fish shall be photographed and the photographs provided to
the Corps, NOAA Fisheries, and USFWS. If a live specimen is captured in good

condition, and a positive identification cannot be made in the field because of size
or lack of other distinguishing characteristics, the fish shall be immediately
returned to the river downstream of the construction site.
Giant Garter Snake
The following mitigation measures are proposed for the protection of the giant garter snake
and its aquatic habitat:
•

Construction activities would be kept to a minimum of 200 feet from the banks of
giant garter snake aquatic habitat.

•

The construction area will be surveyed for giant garter snakes 24 hours prior to
construction activities by a qualified biologist. Survey of the project area would
be repeated if a lapse in construction activity of two weeks or greater occurs. If a
giant garter snake is encountered during construction, then activities would cease
until appropriate corrective measures have been completed or it has been
determined that the snake would not be harmed.

•

In order to prevent harm to giant garter snake, construction activities will be
prohibited within a 200-foot buffer zone around the small pond, which is situated
on the southern boundary of the Scour Pond site, is appropriate. In addition, prior
to commencing construction activities, the Scour Pond site shall be surveyed for
giant garter snake by a qualified biologist. If a giant garter snake is encountered,
then all construction activities must cease until corrective measures are taken and
the site is resurveyed.

Pollution Control Measures
A pipe system will be used to move dredged material from disposal sites to the placement
sites. The pipe system will be required to prevent the transported material from entering the
waterways. Monitoring of the pipe will be required during all pumping activities. If it is
found that material is entering the water way from the piping operation, testing will occur to
determine compliance with the Basin Plan. The spoiled material would be tested to ensure
that it is clear of contaminants that could affect water quality during or after placement. The
pipes would be pressurized with shutoff capabilities in the event of an unexpected leak or
break in the pipe.
At the placement site silt curtains, hay bales or similar methods will be used to keep the
spoils material from floating out into the main waterways and away from the island raising
site. The Corps is currently working the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control
Board (CVRWQCB) to obtain 401 Certification. The conditions set forth in the certification
would be followed to prevent adverse affects to water quality. Water quality monitoring
would occur during construction activities to ensure that the project is in compliance with
401 Certification. Similar activities currently being performed by the Corps in the Delta
(dredging) have completed coordination with the CVRWQCB and obtained 401
Biological Assessment
12
Sacramento – San Joaquin Rivers Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study

March 2014
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

Certification. Conditions of similar projects include monitoring to comply with the Basin
Plan, reporting monitoring results, and maintaining low turbidity, pH, and dissolved oxygen
levels.
Coordination with the CVRWQCB will establish construction requirements to prevent
violation set forth in the Basin Plan or otherwise substantially degrade water quality to the
detriment of beneficial uses. The placement of material to raise the elevation of Big Break
Island will not affect salinity in the project area or downstream. No channel banks, channel
beds, or levees will be altered in a way that would cause erosion.
3.0

SPECIES ACCOUNTS

3.1 Delta Smelt
Status. Delta smelt are listed as a threatened species under both the California and Federal
Endangered Species Acts.
Distribution and Habitat. Delta smelt are endemic to the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta
estuary. Delta smelt inhabit the freshwater portions of the Delta and Sacramento and San
Joaquin rivers and the low-salinity portions of Suisun Bay. Rearing habitat for juvenile and
adult delta smelt typically is found in the estuarine waters of the lower Delta and Suisun Bay
where salinity is between 2 and 7 parts per thousand (ppt), although Delta smelt tolerate 0 ppt
to 19 ppt salinity. They typically occupy open shallow waters but also occur in the main
channel in the region where fresh water and brackish water mix. The zone may be
hydraulically conducive to their ability to maintain position and metabolic efficiency (Moyle
2002).
Delta smelt live their entire life cycle in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta. Delta smelt
typically have a 1-year lifecycle, although a small percentage of the adults may live to year
two. Adult Delta smelt migrate upstream into channels and sloughs of the eastern Delta
during fall and winter in preparation for spawning. Adult delta smelt begin a spawning
migration, which may encompass several months, and move into the upper Delta during
December or January. Spawning occurs between January and July, with peak spawning
during April through mid-May (Moyle 2002). Spawning occurs in shallow edgewaters in the
upper Delta channels, including the Sacramento River above Rio Vista, Cache Slough,
Lindsey Slough, and Barker Slough. Spawning also was observed in the Sacramento River
up to Garcia Bend during drought conditions, possibly attributable to adults moving farther
inland in response to saltwater intrusion (Wang and Brown 1993). Eggs are broadcast over
the bottom, where they attach to firm sediment, woody material, and vegetation. Hatching
takes approximately 9 to 13 days, and larvae begin feeding 4 to 5 days later. Newly hatched
larvae contain a large oil globule that makes them semi-buoyant and allows them to stay off
the bottom. Larval smelt feed on rotifers and other zooplankton. As their fins and swim
bladder develop, they move higher into the water column. Larvae and juveniles gradually
move downstream toward rearing habitat in the estuarine mixing zone (Wang 1986).

Sacramento – San Joaquin Rivers Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study

Population trends and abundance of delta smelt are poorly understood due to their short life
span (1 year). Based on data from 21 years of monthly sampling in Suisun Marsh, delta smelt
appear to be experiencing long-term declines (Matern et al. 2002). Summer tow-net and
fall/mid-water trawl data show fluctuating annual abundance from 1991 through 1996, with
an increasing trend in the late 1990s, followed by an overall decline in abundance since 1999
(Bryant and Souza 2004).
The decline in delta smelt abundance has been attributed to reduced Delta outflow,
entrainment losses to water diversions, changes in food organisms, toxic substances, disease,
competition and predation by nonnative species, and potential inbreeding with the nonnative
wakasagi. Splittail have been adversely affected by loss of floodplain attributable to levees
and channelization (Moyle 2002).
USFWS has prepared a recovery plan for Delta smelt that identifies criteria for evaluating the
status of the Delta smelt population (USFWS 1996). These criteria include annual indices of
abundance and geographic distribution in the estuary as determined through CDFW’s fall
mid-water trawl surveys. USFWS continues to evaluate the available scientific information
regarding the status of Delta smelt and the performance of various management actions
designed to improve protection, reduce mortality, and enhance habitat quality and availability
within the estuary.
Potential for Occurrence in Project Area. As a result of their life history and geographic
distribution, Delta smelt may occur seasonally within Little Franks and Big Break as eggs,
larvae, juveniles, and adults. Juvenile and adult Delta smelt are most abundant in the central
Delta in the vicinity of Franks Tract during the fall, winter, and spring (CDFW unpublished
data). Larval, juvenile, and adult Delta smelt are most abundant in the western Delta and
Suisun Bay in the vicinity of Big Break during spring, summer, and fall (CDFW unpublished
data).
3.2 Giant Garter Snake
Status. The giant garter snake (Thamnophis gigas) is Federally and State-listed as threatened.
Distribution and Habitat. The giant garter snake is endemic to wetlands in the Sacramento
and San Joaquin valleys (Hansen and Brode 1980). The current distribution extends from
near Chico in Butte County south to the Mendota Wildlife Area in Fresno County. No
occurrences of giant garter snakes are known from the northern portion of the San Joaquin
Valley north to the eastern fringe of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, where the
floodplain of the San Joaquin River is limited to a relatively narrow trough (Hansen and
Brode 1980, 58 FR 54053). The resulting gap of approximately 60 miles separates the
southern and northern populations (Hansen and Brode 1980).
Giant garter snakes are endemic to wetlands in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys and
inhabit marshes, sloughs, ponds, small lakes, low-gradient streams and other waterways, and
agricultural wetlands such as irrigation and drainage canals and rice fields, as well as the
adjacent uplands. There are four essential habitat components.

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers



Adequate water during the species’ active season (early spring through mid-fall) to
provide food and cover.



Emergent herbaceous wetland vegetation, such as cattails and bulrushes, for escape
cover and foraging habitat during the active season.



Upland habitat with grassy banks and openings in waterside vegetation for basking.



Higher-elevation uplands for cover and refuge from floodwaters during the dormant
season in winter (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1999).

The giant garter snake is extremely aquatic and rarely found away from water. Giant garter
snakes actively forage in the water and retreat to water to escape from predators and when
disturbed. The predominant prey species include crayfish, carp (Cyprinus carpio),
mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), bullfrogs, and Pacific tree frogs. Giant garter snakes are
typically absent from larger rivers and other water bodies that support introduced populations
of large predatory fish and from wetlands with sand, gravel, or rock substrates.
Potential for Occurrence in Project Area. There are only two isolated records of giant garter
snake on the south side of the San Joaquin River in the northern aspect of the species’ range.
Although the historical and current distribution of giant garter snake in the Delta is poorly
understood, the south bank of the San Joaquin River lies within the apparent gap between the
northern and southern populations. The nearest locality record to the south lies more than 50
air miles distant in Madera County; no giant garter snakes are documented in Stanislaus
County between the documented extremes of the documented extremes of the Sacramento
Valley and San Joaquin Valley populations.
A giant garter snake was found on Webb Tract (adjacent to Franks Tract to the North) during
April, 2002 near the ferry dock. Sherman Island (adjacent to Lower Sherman Island to the
east) is identified for recovery efforts in the Draft Recovery Plan for Giant Garter Snakes
(USFWS 1999). One giant garter snake was found in 1998 near Sherman and Decker
Islands, but it is not known whether this snake represented a resident population in the
western Delta or was washed into the Delta from high-water flows in the winter. Another
garter snake was observed at the north end of the Antioch Bridge before the mid 1980s (IES
2000). Intensive trapping surveys conducted within Contra Costa County independently by
Eric Hansen and by Biological, Inc. have failed to detect giant garter snake. Likewise,
Swaim intensively trapped in regions northeast of Oakley in 2003 and 2005, including Marsh
Creek, Big Break, and Contra Costa Canal, without success (Swaim 2004, Swaim 2005a-d).
An Environmental Assessment, dated 19 September 2003, prepared by the Corps for the
proposed expansion of the Sherman Island Scour Pond dredge material placement site
identified a pond on the southern boundary of the Scour Pond site, as potential aquatic habitat
for the giant garter snake.

EXISTING ENVIRONMENT

4.1 Proposed Restoration Areas
The dominant vegetation types in the project area include emergent tidal marsh, riparian
scrub/woodland, and submerged and floating aquatic vegetation. Big Break, Franks Tract,
and Little Franks Tracts are currently characterized by vast expanses of open water habitat.
Although these areas have been flooded for a number of years, these flooded islands have not
accumulated enough sediment to support the reestablishment and expansion of tidal marsh
vegetation. Vegetation cover type maps for each flooded island are shown in Figures 12 (Big
Break), and 13 (Little Frank’s Tract).
Big Break
Big Break is subject to daily tidal fluctuations and is at a sufficient distance from the Bay that
the tidal waters inundating this area have minimal salinity levels. A remnant levee runs
along the southern border of the open-water area. Riparian scrub vegetation dominated by
arroyo willow and Himalayan blackberry grows along the upper portions of this levee, but
the lower elevations of the levee support a low cover of tidal marsh vegetation. Extensive
stands of perennial emergent marsh are present within the open water habitat. Different
elevations have created a mosaic of emergent species in this perennial freshwater marsh with
common three-square in shallowly inundated areas, cattail and tule in deeper waters, and
California bulrush in the deepest waters (Vollmar 2000).
Several sunken barges within the open water area support islands of riparian scrub banded by
freshwater marsh at lower elevations. Flats along the shore support large stands of arroyo
willow scrub. Riparian habitats also support small stands of tree species such as Fremont
cottonwood, Goodding’s willow, northern California black walnut, coast live oak, prunus,
and red alder. A portion of the Big Break study area supports upland habitat. This upland
area is located in the southwestern corner of the study area and primarily supports alkali
grassland. Alkali grassland is dominated by perennial grasses including saltgrass and
creeping wildrye. Associated species are predominantly nonnative annual grasses and forbs
such as perennial pepperweed, wild oats, ripgut brome, telegraph weed, and spring vetch.
Other upland habitats present at this location include nonnative tree stands and disturbed or
developed areas. The scattered stands of nonnative trees are dominated by black locust, tree
of heaven, and white poplar. Isolated individual trees are predominantly nonnative species
such as eucalyptus, tamarisk and prunus. Disturbed/ developed areas are dominated by
nonnative and invasive plant species or support buildings and/or paved roads. Infestations of
egeria and water hyacinth are present within the extensive open water habitat of Big Break.
Little Franks Tracts
The two dominant vegetation types occurring at Little Frank’s Tract are emergent marsh and
riparian scrub. Tule and broadleaved cattail are the dominant species in the emergent marsh,
which occurs on the lower portions of remnant levees and in-channel islands. Associated

species in this vegetation type include sedges, rushes, smartweeds, and Delta mudwort.
Riparian scrub is predominantly found along the higher elevations of remnant levees and inchannel islands. The dominant shrub/tree species in this area include willow and red alder,
but scattered Fremont cottonwood may be present. The understory is extensively infested
with Himalayan blackberry and nonnative thistles that create impenetrable thickets along the
remnant levees. Native herbaceous wetland species in the understory include water
horehound, Suisun Marsh aster, Delta tule pea, and California loosestrife. Although there
was no description in the general plan, a small upland area was evident on the aerial
photograph in the southern portion of the study area. The majority of this flooded island is
open water, which supports infestations of egeria and water hyacinth (Center for Design
Research et al. 1988).

Dredged Material Source Sites

Dredged material would be transported from existing dredged material O&M placement sites
currently used by the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel (DWSC) and Stockton DWSC
(Figures 4 and 6). The project would confine areas of dredged material removal to only
those usable portions of the sites that do not support sensitive habitats. Impacts to sensitive
habitats would be minimized and/or avoided. The existing habitat conditions at these sites
are described below and shown in Figures 7-10.
Sherman Island Site. This site has three distinctive areas: (1) the northern portion is the Rio
Viento RV Park and dominated by unvegetated paved surfaces with an upland field of nonnative grasslands and valley and foothill grasslands on the eastern side; (2) the middle
portion is bermed on all sides and dominated by non-native grasslands with pockets of
riparian scrub and riparian woodland; and, (3) the southern portion is characterized by an
emergent wetland bounded by berms and dominated by non-native grassland on all sides.
Water on the site may pond within areas excavated in the uplands, and as such, the areas are
not considered jurisdictional waters of the United States. Additional seasonal wetlands in the
form of a drainage ditch and a small area in the northeastern portion of the site contain
cattails, tules (Scirpus spp.), and willows. The site is surrounded by fields currently used for
grazing. The usable portion of the site is located in the middle area of the site. It is mainly
composed of irrigated agriculture with a small area of non-native grassland and bermed on all
sides with willow scrub-shrub on the northern side and peppergrass on the remaining east,
west, and southern sides. Within the bermed area, the vegetation is dominated by wild lettuce
(Lactuca sp.) with minor pockets of willow shrubs (USACE 2008; U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service 2010). No wetlands, riparian areas, or other sensitive habitat are found within the
usable portion of the site.
Decker Island Site. This site encompasses most of Decker Island, except for a northern
parcel owned by USFWS, which is a wetland restoration site. A large berm running from
northeast to southwest through the site divides it into two distinctive parts: (1) the area east
of the berm, which is characterized by wetlands that transition to an emergent marsh in the
southern portion; and (2) the area west of the berm, which is dominated by non-native
grassland, marked by a tamarisk community and recent disturbance at the site’s center. At
the time of survey, active pumping in the southern extent of the western portion led to

flooding, creating a temporary wetland. A wetland margin borders the western edge of the
site and the Sacramento DWSC. The usable portion of the site is located northwest of the
berm that divides the site into two sections. This area is primarily composed of non-native
grassland, irrigated agriculture, and general shrubs and dominated by peppergrass, bromes,
and thistle (Silybum spp.) (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). There is a large tamarisk
community around the center of the northern half of the site, surrounding a recently disturbed
area next to an old landing. No wetlands occur within the usable portion of the site.
Sensitive habitats occurring within the usable portion of the site include 0.87 acres of riparian
habitat and 0.90 acres of open water.
Sherman Island - Scour Pond and McCormick Pit. Sherman Island is approximately 20 feet
below sea level. The island is bounded by the San Joaquin River on the south and the
Sacramento River on the north, and is protected by levees. Scour Pond and McCormack Pit
are located along the southern boundary of Sherman Island as shown in Figure 3-9. Both
sites have historically received dredge materials and has the material has used for levee
rehabilitation and reinforcement on Sherman Island.
The existing Scour Pond site is approximately 30 acres. The Reclamation District 341
currently has plans to expand the site by approximately 35 acres to the west and
approximately 75 acres to the east making the entire site approximately 140 acres in size.
The expanded site would then have a dredge material capacity of approximately 250,000
cubic yards. The vegetation type on the site consists of agriculture and non-native grassland.
A small pond is situated on the southern boundary of the site.
The existing McCormack Pit site (Assessor’s Parcel No. 158-030-003) is approximately
26 acres. The Reclamation District 341 has plans to expand the site by approximately
25 acres, making the entire site approximately 51 acres in size. The expanded McCormack
Pit site would then have a dredge material capacity of approximately 250,000 cubic yards.
The vegetation type on the site consists of non-native grassland and ruderal barren cover
types.
Bradford Island. The Bradford Island dredged material storage site encompasses 110 acres.
The site is specifically used for dredge materials from the Stockton Deep Water Ship
Channel along the San Joaquin River. The vegetation type on the site consists of non-native
grassland, ruderal barren cover types, and native willow stands. The site is frequently used
for cattle grazing. Accessibility is by boat only.

EFFECTS OF THE PROPOSED ACTION

The following section evaluates direct and indirect effects of the action on listed species
based on the anticipated changes to the physical environments and habitats in the action area
and the species life history, habitat use, and distribution in the action area.
Effects of the proposed project include both short- and long-term effects. Short-term effects
include direct impacts from construction activities (e.g., increased suspended sediment and

turbidity). Long-term or permanent impacts generally result from the conversion of open
water habitat to tidal marsh.
Indirect effects are project-related effects that would typically occur later in time and which
could occur outside of the area directly affected. For this project, indirect effects could
include long-term changes in sediment transport mechanisms and deposition patterns within
the local project area and habitat conditions for wildlife, including listed species.
The conversion of open water habitat to tidal marsh will indirectly affect habitat conditions
for listed species, including the Delta smelt and to a lesser extent the giant garter snake. To
assess ecosystem restoration benefits, Habitat Evaluation Procedures (HEP) were used to
evaluate potential long-term effects on fish and wildlife habitats over a 50-year period of
analysis. The Habitat Suitability Index Model for the Marsh Wren was used to assess outputs
of alternatives. The marsh wren requires emergent herbaceous vegetation, typically cattails
and bulrushes for nesting and cover in water >15 centimeters. The emergent marsh habitat
being proposed would meet typical marsh wren requirements and is a scare habitat type
within the Delta. This model was selected because it is an approved bluebook model that has
been used in other projects in the area, and is focused on the target habitat type. The HEP
assumption was made that existing and future without-project conditions provide little to no
tidal emergent marsh habitat at the sites. The future with-project assumption is that
elevations are restored to support a robust tidal emergent marsh habitat. The HEP showed
that 89.5 acres of restored tidal marsh would result in an output of 88.1 AAHU’s.
Effects on Existing Habitats
The proposed action (Alternative 3) would permanently convert 89.5 acres of open water to
freshwater tidal marsh habitat as shown in Table 4. Impacts to sensitive vegetative habitat
types located on the periphery of Big Break and Little Franks Tract such as existing tidal
marsh and riparian vegetation would be avoided. Because the proposed action relies on
obtaining sediment from dredged material source sites in addition to O&M dredged material,
this alternative could potentially disturb vegetative habitats located on the dredged material
sites. Table 4 and Figures 7-10 identify the terrestrial habitats present at the proposed
dredged material source sites. The impact analysis assumes that construction activities
required to excavate and transport material would be designed to avoid disturbance to
sensitive habitats by limiting construction activities to usable non-sensitive areas within these
sites.
Habitat development at Big Break would occur gradually over time as dredged material
placement occurs. Project construction would require at least 5 years to complete. Restored
tidal emergent marsh would gradually establish and provide habitat for fish and wildlife
species. Overall, the permanent conversion of wetland habitats would result in a substantial
improvement to the wetland functions and values on the project site for fish and wildlife,
including special status species. The gain of higher value tidal marsh habitat would more
than offset the loss of open water habitat.

5.1 Delta Smelt
Short-term effects
Construction would occur over a 5-year period during the summer and fall of each year, a
time when Delta smelt may be rearing. Construction‐related effects on delta smelt rearing
and migration will be minimized by restricting in‐water construction activities to the August
1 through November 30 work window, thereby avoiding the seasons when these life stages
are most likely to occur. Construction activities would not occur during spawning (January–
July).
Direct mortality of individuals could occur to fish are present during construction. Placement
of dredged sediment may also potentially disturb, injure, or kill any fish in the area of the
construction sites during construction.
The sound generated by construction activities could temporarily disrupt essential behavior
patterns (e.g., feeding, escape from predators, migration) of adult and juvenile fish at the
Project sites and the surrounding areas. Noise effects may occur at the project site and
general vicinity.
Construction would result in elevated levels of suspended sediment, causing increased
turbidity and potential sedimentation of benthic (bottom) habitat used by juvenile and adult
fish for feeding, cover, and other essential behaviors. Increased turbidity may decrease
feeding opportunities and increased suspended solids could clog and abrade gill filaments
(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2008). Decreased light penetration through the water column
may reduce photosynthesis and reduce the extent of aquatic vegetation upon which delta
smelt spawn, as well as the amount of phytoplankton which are fed upon by the delta smelt’s
zooplankton prey. Resulting short-term effects could include reduced feeding success, and
compromised ability to escape from predators.
Toxic substances used by construction equipment including gasoline and diesel, lubricants,
and other petroleum-based products, could enter the waterways adjacent to the project site as
a result of spills or leakage from machinery or storage containers. Mortality or physiological
impairment of fish or disruption of essential behavior patterns is possible if exposure to
sufficient concentrations occurs.
Non-mobile benthic organisms that are food sources for fish would be smothered by the
placement of dredged material and potentially from placement and anchoring of the sediment
transport pipelines on the bottom and potential up and down movement of the pipeline with
the tides. These areas affected should recover quickly after placement of the dredged
material and removal of the pipelines as these areas are recolonized by benthic organisms.
Long-term effects
The restoration of tidal marsh habitat will increase instream structure and aquatic habitat
complexity. Planted aquatic vegetation will begin to infiltrate the shallow water habitat

created by dredged material placement and gradually cover the site. These factors in
combination would provide high quality habitat. The tidal marsh habitat would provide
escape cover, creating ideal refugia from large predators for small larval and juvenile fishes.
Inundated vegetated wetland should provide an increase in potential Delta smelt spawning
habitat. Overall, the project would have a net long-term benefit to Delta smelt.
5.2 Giant Garter Snake
Short-term effects
Much of the action area is unlikely to provide giant garter snake aquatic habitat. Because the
giant garter snake is typically absent from larger rivers and other water bodies that support
introduced populations of large predatory fish, the snake is unlikely to present during
construction within the flooded areas to be restored to tidal marsh. Effects on the snake from
construction activities within the restoration areas are therefore unlikely.
Supporting aquatic habitat has a greater potential to occur in areas adjacent to the project
area, in drainage ditches and irrigation canals near the dredge material placement sites and
along the pipeline routes. Suitable habitat may be impacted by project construction within
200 feet of these features. Direct impacts include the removal of basking sites necessary for
thermoregulation, and destruction of burrows or crevices that provide hibernacula. Individual
snakes may be killed or hurt by moving construction equipment and personnel. Construction
disturbance may also cause giant garter snakes to move into areas where they have a greater
chance of being killed by vehicles (i.e., roads) or predation. Because there are only a few
documented sightings of giant garter snake in the general area, there is a low potential for
injury or mortality of the snake during construction activities.
Long-term effects
The project is unlikely to have any long-term effect on the giant garter snake. The snake is
unlikely to occur in the areas to be restored to tidal marsh because giant garter snake are
typically absent from larger rivers and water bodies that support large predatory fish.
Potential effects on suitable habitat near dredge material placement sites and along the
pipeline routes would be limited to the construction period; no long-term effects would occur
once construction is complete and disturbed areas are restored.
6.0

CUMULATIVE EFFECTS

Cumulative effects include the effects of future state, tribal, local or private actions that are
reasonably certain to occur in the action area. Future federal actions that are unrelated to the
proposed action are not considered in this section because they require separate consultation
pursuant to Section 7 of the ESA.
The Bay-Delta Conservation Plan, the Delta Wetlands Project, the Corps’ ship channel
navigation projects, the Sacramento River Bank Protection Project, are projects undergoing
or have undergone Section 7 consultation and therefore are not discussed below.

6.1 Anticipated Non-Federal Actions in the Action Area
The following non-federal actions are reasonably certain to occur within the action area
considered in this Biological Assessment.
Dutch Slough Tidal Marsh Restoration Project. The Dutch Slough Tidal Marsh Restoration
Project proposes wetland and upland restoration and public access to a 1,178-acre Dutch
Slough property owned by DWR near Big Break. This project seeks to restore habitat for
native fishes and other aquatic and wetland species, improve the understanding of restoration
science in tidal marsh wetland ecosystems in the region, and provide public access to the
restored area. This project in conjunction with the DILFS action at Big Break would provide
significant benefits to listed species. A Final Environmental Impact Report for this project
was certified by DWR on March 17, 2010. The EIR addressed the potential environmental
impacts of proposed changes to the tidal wetlands restoration project in the Dutch Slough
area at the mouth of Marsh Creek in Eastern Contra Costa County.
6.2 Cumulative Effects on Listed Species and Critical Habitats
Efforts are underway in the Delta to restore tidal marsh habitat and reverse the decline in
ecosystem function and values. The potential for long-term cumulative impacts on the listed
species appear to be beneficial due to these efforts. The DILFS action when added to these
other actions is not expected to degrade the environmental baseline for the Delta smelt or the
giant garter snake.

Delta Smelt
The proposed action is likely to adversely affect because construction activities may result in
the injury and mortality of individual Delta smelt. While incidental take of Delta smelt may
occur during construction, the proposed action to restore tidal marsh is anticipated to have
long-term benefits to Delta smelt.
The proposed action would is not likely to adversely affect on designated critical habitat
because the project has been designed to minimize any impacts to the extent feasible. An
approved stormwater management plan will be in place to minimize any increase in sediment
flow and turbidity, as will a plan to prevent the spill of toxic or potentially toxic materials
(including concrete) into the water during all construction.
Giant Garter Snake
The proposed action is not likely to adversely affect the giant garter snake because there is no
suitable habitat in the areas proposed for tidal marsh restoration, and the low likelihood that
the species would be present in the construction areas and temporary nature of the impacts.
Construction activities will be designed to avoid disturbance to areas of suitable habitat by
maintenance of a 200-foot buffer from these areas.

Section 404(b) (1) Clean Water Act Compliance Evaluation
Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study
I.

Introduction

This appendix evaluates compliance of the tentatively selected plan, Alternative SB-8,
with the Guidelines established under the Federal Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act)
Amendments of 1972 (Public Law 92-500), as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977 (Public
Law 95-217), legislation collectively referred to as the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act
sets national goals and policies to eliminate the discharge of water pollutants into navigable
waters. Any discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. by the Corps requires a
written evaluation that demonstrates that a proposed action complies with the guidelines
published at 40 CFR Part 230. These guidelines, referred to as the Section 404(b) (1) Guidelines
or “Guidelines,” are the substantive criteria used in evaluating discharges of dredged or fill
material under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
Fundamental to the Guidelines is the precept that “dredged or fill material should not be
discharged into the aquatic ecosystem, unless it can be demonstrated such a discharge will not
have an unacceptable adverse impact either individually or in combination with known and/or
probable impacts of other activities affecting the ecosystems of concern.”
The procedures for documenting compliance with the Guidelines include the following:


Examining practicable alternatives to the proposed discharge that might have fewer
adverse environmental impacts, including not discharging into a water of the U.S. or
discharging into an alternative aquatic site



Evaluating the potential short- and long-term effects, including cumulative effects, of a
proposed discharge of dredged or fill material on the physical, chemical, and biological
components of the aquatic environment.



Identifying appropriate and practicable measures to mitigate the unavoidable adverse
environmental impacts of the proposed discharge



Making and documenting the Findings of Compliance required by §230.12 of the
Guidelines.

This Clean Water Act, Section 404(b)(1) evaluation of compliance with the Guidelines is
not intended to be a “stand alone” document; it relies heavily on information provided in the
integrated feasibility and EIS to which it is attached.

Project Description

A. Project Purpose
The Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District (Corps), and the State of California, Department of
Water Resources (DWR) propose to restore 89.5 acres of emergent marsh habitat using dredged
material in the west central portion of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta).

DRAFT
The remaining ecosystems in the Delta no longer maintain the functions and richness that
historically defined the pre-channelized system. The measures of ecological health continue to
decline without preventive or restorative actions. The Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study
analyzes the feasibility of restoring intertidal habitat by subsidence reversal in the flooded areas
of Big Break, Frank’s Tract, and Little Frank’s Tract.
B. Location
The project area is located approximately 2 miles west of the city of Antioch in the west central
portion of the Delta (Figure 1) The area’s approximate boundaries are the San Joaquin River and
Threemile Slough on the north, Sacramento River and Sherman Lake on the west, south edge of
Big Break and Dutch Slough on the south, and east edge of Frank’s Tract and Fisherman’s Cut
on the east. The restoration sites include three submerged islands: Big Break (1,600 acres) and
Little Frank’s Tract (330 acres). The restoration work sites include parts of Big Break, Little
Frank’s Tract, dredged material disposal sites; and linear corridors of agricultural land between
the disposal sites and the two flooded islands (see Figure 2 and 3). The borrow sites include
McCormack Pit and Scour Pit located on Sherman Island, Decker Island Pit located on Decker
Island, and Bradford Pit located on Bradford Island (Refer to Figure 4). The project area
encompasses approximately 600 of land and open waters.
C. General Description
An initial array of 12 alternatives (including the No-Action Alternative) was developed
by USACE and the local sponsor (DWR) during the alternatives formulation process. The
alternatives represented varying combinations of measures. Alternatives were initially
developed based on the USACE federal planning objectives for water resource projects, specific
planning objectives developed for the feasibility study, and opportunities and constraints for
implementing flood risk management activities. After formulation and refinement of the project
alternatives, alternatives were ranked and screened based on NER benefits and implementation
costs. Chapter 3 of the integrated report addresses in greater detail the alternative formulation
process.
The Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study plan formulation process resulted in two
action alternatives in the final array:


Alternative 2. This alternative includes only increment 1 at Big Break (see Figure 3).
The work would involve placing 500,000 cubic yards (cy) of material dredged from the
Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel directly into open water habitat to restore 42 acres of
intertidal marsh habitat. The restoration would be conducted over 5 years as part of the
yearly Operations and Maintenance (O&M) dredging of the ship channel. The
environmental effects of the O&M dredging and placement of material at the existing
McCormick, Bradford, and Scour storage sites are evaluated in the Corps’ San Francisco
to Stockton Deepwater Ship Channel, Supplemental EIS, scheduled for final release in
early 2015. Pumping of the wet dredged material from the O&M dredging ship to the
proposed restoration site at Big Break is evaluated as part of the Delta Islands and Levees
Feasibility Study

DRAFT



Alternative 6 (Tentatively Selected Plan). This plan is the NER plan and includes
increments 1, 2, 3, and 5 at Big Break and increment 1 at Little Frank’s Tract (see Figure
3). The work would involve placing a total of 1,112,000 cy of dredged material into open
water habitat to restore a total of 89.5 acres of intertidal marsh habitat. The restoration
would be conducted over 5 years as part of the yearly O&M dredging of the ship channel.
However, previously stockpiled dredged material obtained from the McCormick Pit,
Bradford Island, Scour Pit, and Decker Island storage sites would also be placed in
conjunction with the O&M placement to increase the area of restored habitat. The
environmental effects of the O&M dredging and placement of material at the existing
McCormick, Bradford, and Scour storage sites are evaluated in the Corps’ San Francisco
to Stockton Deepwater Ship Channel, Supplemental EIS. Removal and use of the
stockpiled material are evaluated as part of the Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study
EIS.
D. Background

The Delta was named an Ecosystem of National Significance through the EPBC Act in
2011. It is a critical link in the Pacific Flyway, a major north-south route of travel for migratory
birds in America, and is protected through the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Natural
resource specialists agree that the remaining ecosystems in the Delta no longer maintain the
functions and richness that defined the pre-channelized system, and that the measures of
ecological health will continue to decline without preventive action. Not only is it certain that
these natural systems will not recover their defining attributes under current conditions, it is
unlikely that even the current, degraded ecological conditions can be sustained into the future.
For example, delta smelt, key indicators of ecosystem health continue to decline in number
throughout the watershed. Another example is the decline in populations of salmonids;
commercially, recreationally, and culturally important fish species in the Delta.
There are numerous contributors to the ecological decline of Delta species and habitats,
each of which has the capability to produce adverse impacts independently and/or in
combination with other stressors. For example, pesticides, channelization, exotic and non-native
invasive species, water supply diversions, agricultural and urban runoff, and wastewater
discharges have all been identified as contributors of adverse impacts to the ecological health of
the Delta ecosystem. Specifically, channelization of rivers and streams through the construction
of levees has resulted in the widespread loss of tidal marsh, shaded riverine aquatic habitat, and
the disconnection of floodplains from waterways. If this loss of Delta habitats and disconnection
from floodplains continues, the current substantial declines in the Delta’s fisheries could result in
the extinction of culturally and economically critical species. Many of the defining
characteristics of the pre-channelized ecosystem (spatial extent, habitat heterogeneity, and
dynamic storage) have either been lost or substantially altered as a result of land use and water
management practices during the past 100 years in California. Nearly 95 percent of the historic
wetland habitat in the Delta has been converted to agricultural and urban uses.

DRAFT
E. Authority and Purpose
The Corps ensure that the project complies with the CWA, including Sections 404, 401,
and 402. Placement of fill within jurisdictional wetlands and waters of the United States is
required for the project. A Section 401 State Water Quality Certification for activities
associated with implementation of the proposed project is required as a condition of Section 404,
and the sponsor will submit a 401 certification application to the CRWQCB for each contract.
The project would also require an NPDES permit, through the development of a SWPPP because
the project would disturb more than 1 acre of project area.
The purpose of the Feasibility Study is to determine if there is a Federal interest in
providing Flood Risk Management (FRM) and Ecosystem Restoration (ER) improvements in the
Sacramento – San Joaquin Rivers Delta (Delta), California. Since each multipurpose measure has
a FRM negative net benefit, which indicates FRM specific benefits are less than the FRM
separable costs, these multipurpose measures cannot be economically justified as ecosystem
restoration benefits and costs are added. For this reason, FRM measures will not be pursued.
A recommendation for plan selection was made by identifying the plan that reasonably
maximizes environmental outputs relative to costs while meeting planning objectives and
avoiding planning constraints. As all alternatives are cost effective, every alternative achieves
the greatest number of outputs for a given cost; therefore, incremental costs per output were used
to identify the NER Plan.
The O and M dredging actions are analyzed in the ‘Sacramento River - San Francisco Bay to
Stockton, California (John F. Baldwin And Stockton Ship Channels), Deep Water Ship Channel
Maintenance Dredging And Bank Protection Project, California 10-Year Draft Programmatic
Biological Assessment’. The process of transporting the dredge materials from the ship to the
project sites is analyzed in the Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study EIS.

III.

Final Array of Alternatives
A. Guidelines

Section 230.10 of the Guidelines dictates that, except as provided under §404(b)(2), “no
discharge of dredged or fill material shall be permitted if there is a practicable alternative to the
proposed discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem, so long as
the alternative does not have significant adverse environmental considerations.” While the
NEPA process, through the EIS, extensively examines alternatives and discloses all of their
environmental impacts, the 404(b) (1) Evaluation focuses on the impacts of alternatives to the
aquatic ecosystem. The Guidelines require choosing for implementation the practicable
alternative that has the least damage to the aquatic ecosystem, assuming that this alternative has
no significant adverse environmental impacts to other components of the environment, such as
endangered species that occupy upland habitat. A “practicable alternative” is defined as
“available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology,
and logistics in light of overall project purposes.”

DRAFT

The Guidelines also require that “where the activity associated with a discharge which is
proposed for a special aquatic site does not require access or proximity to or siting within the
special aquatic site in question to fulfill its basic purpose (i.e., is not “water dependent”),
practicable alternatives that do not involve special aquatic sites are presumed to be available,
unless clearly demonstrated otherwise.” The basic purpose of this project—to reduce flood risk
to the Sutter basin study area—is water dependent, since the project purpose cannot be fulfilled
outside the river.
B. Practical Alternative
The Guidelines further specify that where a discharge is proposed for a special aquatic
site, all practicable alternatives to the proposed discharge that do not involve a discharge into a
special aquatic site are presumed to have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem, unless
otherwise clearly demonstrated. The placement of dredge material at Big Break and Little
Frank’s Tract are the special aquatic site type in the project area. Section III, parts E and F
describe the proposed activities for each reach.
For the purpose of a 404(b) (1) alternatives analysis, practicable alternatives include:


Offsite alternatives—i.e., discharges of dredged or fill material at other locations in
waters of the United States.



On-site alternatives—these include project designs that do not involve a discharge of
dredged or fill material into waters of the United States as well as project designs that
have different impacts to waters of the U.S.

C. Off-Site Alternatives
The locations of this project were selected based upon the need to restore emergent marsh
habitat using dredged material within sunken Delta Islands. Off-site alternatives therefore are
not practicable at this time.
D. On-Site Alternatives
The two construction alternatives analyzed in detail through the NEPA process would
each accomplish the identified project purpose. However, they would accomplish the project
purpose to varying extents, with varying levels of benefits and varying adverse impacts to the
aquatic ecosystem.
The following is a summary of project elements for each alternative. In general,
Alternative 6 entails the greatest amount of emergent marsh habitat restoration (89.5 acres) and
Alternative 2 a lesser amount (42 acres). These alternatives are described in greater detail in
Chapter 3 of the integrated report EIS.
Alternative 2. The combined size of the potential placement sites would be 42 acres. The
total work area including dredging, placement, and staging areas is approximately 100 acres.

DRAFT
The dredge materials will be placed within the functional floodplain inside the river channel
complex. The potential placement areas are sunken islands comprised of peat soils. The
proposed placement sites are devoid of terrestrial vegetationNative floating aquatic species
include duckweed (Lemna spp.), water-meal (Wolffia spp.), and algae. Large expanses of the
open-water habitat within the study area are dominated by the invasive nonnative species water
hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes). Submerged aquatic vegetation within the open water habitat in
the study area is dominated by the nonnative species egeria (Egeria densa). The proposed work
would be conducted three months from August 1st through October 31st pursuant to coordination
with NMFS and FWS.
Alternative 6. The project area encompasses approximately 600 acres of both land and
water including borrow and placement sites. The dredge materials will be placed within the
functional floodplain inside the river channel complex. The potential placement areas are sunken
islands comprised of peat soils. The proposed placement sites are devoid of terrestrial vegetation.
Native floating aquatic species include duckweed (Lemna spp.), water-meal (Wolffia spp.), and
algae. Large expanses of the open-water habitat within the study area are dominated by the
invasive nonnative species water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes). Submerged aquatic vegetation
within the open water habitat in the study area is dominated by the nonnative species egeria
(Egeria densa). The proposed work would be conducted three months from August 1st through
October 31st pursuant to coordination with NMFS and FWS.
E. General Description and Quantity of Dredged or Fill Material
The wet dredge materials from O and M activities are comprised of organics, silts, sands,
and gravel which have accumulated within the deep water ship channels on the Sacramento and
San Joaquin rivers. Maintenance operations remove the materials to maintain deep draft
commercial ship passage. Existing stockpiled dry dredged materials from the O and M activities
are comprised of the same channel wet excavation materials, organics, silts, sands, and gravel.
Table 1-1 and 1-2 provides a general description of the quantity and fill materials for
each site within the project. Permanent and temporary impacts are a result of Sacramento District
Corps Environmental Planning Section.

Description of the Proposed Discharge Site(s)

Alternative 2
The work would involve permanently placing a total of 500,000 cy of dredged material
into open water habitat to restore a total of 42 acres of intertidal marsh habitat. A total of 500,00
cy of wet dredge material would be directly placed into Big Break from O&M dredging actions
within the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel.

Alternative 6
The work would involve permanently placing a total of 1,112,000 cy of dredged material
into open water habitat to restore a total of 89.5 acres of intertidal marsh habitat. At total of
500,00 cy of wet dredge material would be directly placed into Big Break from O&M dredging
actions within the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel. An additional 459,000 cy of dry stock
piled dredge material. A total of153,000 cy of dry stock piled dredge material would be placed in
Little Frank’s Tract.
The borrow sites for Alternative 6 do not involve filling of waters of the United States.
The sites are previously disturbed for the purpose of stockpiling dredge materials. The USFWS
has designated specific areas at Scour Pit as protected wetlands. Therefore proper conservation
measures ensure that existing wetlands are not disturbed. Drainage ditches exist at the
perimeters of the borrow pit sites. The drainage ditches allow for wet dredge materials to leach
out residual water. The drainage systems return to the adjacent river systems. The drainage
ditches would not be affected by the removal existing dry stockpiled dredge materials.

DRAFT

G. Timing and Duration of Discharge
The construction activities that would affect the waters of the U.S. would be conducted
over five years (2018-2023). The work window is August 1 through October 31. Both wet and
dry dredge material placement would occur in the same word window previously listed.
H. Description of Disposal Method
Wet Dredge Material Placement. Wet material would be pumped from the dredging ship
directly to the placement sites at Big Break. Materials would be pumped to the proposed project
areas through a submerged weighted 18” double wall high density plastic extrusion (HDPE)
pipe. The piping system would be placed along the shoreline of the Stockton Deepwater Ship
Channel in the San Joaquin River The pipeline would be submerged and weighted to the bottom
when necessary to avoid navigation hazards. A floating repeater pump station would be
positioned every 3 miles to aid slurry flow. Work boats would install and maintain the floating
pipeline to Big Break placement sites from the dredging ship. An additional work boat and crew
would tender the position of the outfall slurry pipe during pumping operations to ensure correct
placement of materials.
Dry Stockpile Dredge Material Placment. Existing dredged materials from the stockpile
sites would be pumped to the proposed project areas through 18” double wall high density plastic
extrusion (HDPE) pipe. A hydraulic slurry hopper at the stockpile site would create the
fluidization process necessary to transport the dredged stockpile materials. Water necessary for
the process would be siphoned from the adjacent rivers by a hydraulic pump and transferred to
the slurry hopper. The hopper mixes dredge materials with water creating a 90 percent water
based slurry solution which is pumped through the HDPE piping network. In-water piping
which is not anchored to the bottom would float at the surface by means of floatation devices. A
work boat and crew would tender the position of the floating pipe and outfall pipe during
pumping operations to ensure safe and correct alignment and placement of materials.
The stockpiled dredge materials would be pumped August through November over four
years. During the first year of construction dredge materials from the McCormack Pit site
would pumped to the Big Break restoration areas. The McCormack Pit site would then serve as
a permanent repeater pump site for the subsequent years. In year 2, additional pump would be
positioned at Sherman Island Scour Pond Decker Island, and then moved the following year to
Decker Island. The Bradford Island site would be pumped to Little Frank’s Tract in year one.
Refer to Table 3 for pump station position by year and material destination. Figure E shows the
proposed piping layout schematic.
Pipe crossings at the Sacramento and San Joaquin navigable channels would require
temporary submerged piping for the life of the project. Pipe segments would be weighted to the
bottom in order to avoid impacts to shipping and recreation. A specialized marine craft with a
crane and would be required for the pipe weighting process. Temporary weighting would occur
at the Decker Island to Sherman Island (Sacramento River) and Sherman Island to Jersey Island
(San Joaquin River) crossings. Additional in-water piping would be temporarily weighted to the

DRAFT
channel bottom. The pipes would be moved as necessary by tender boat crews for safety, vessel
passage, and pumping logistic purposes. Pipes crossing the deep water shipping lanes would be
placed in locations which provide adequate clearance from top of pipe to deep draft shipping
vessel hulls. The contractor would be required to work with Port and Corps representatives to
determine proper channel bottom locations of temporary pipe crossing based on recent sounding
reports. In-water piping that is not weighted to the bottom would float at the surface by means of
floatation devices. The floatation devices and marker buoys would be required to meet U.S
Coast Guard requirements.

IV. Factual Determinations (Section 230.11)
A. Physical Substrate Determinations (consider items in Section 230.11 and 230.20
Substrate)
(1) Substrate Elevation and Slope. The current bottom of channel elevations
average -2.44 ft for Big Break and -5.42 ft for Little Frank’s Tract. Alternative 2 and 3
finish grade elevations for the marsh restoration islands was calculated at an elevation
between -2.0ft to 0.5ft relative to mean water level.
(2) Sediment Type. Soils and sediment type for both Alternatives 2 and 3 are
composed of river deposits which include organics, silts, sands, and gravel.
(3) Dredged/ Fill Material Movement:
a) Fill: Alternatives 2 and 3 require permanent filling of open channel water
habitat. Placement of new fill materials would be below or at the ordinary
high water mark and may have an effect on hydraulic movement of
sediments resulting in recruitment at newly filled areas. Migration of fill
material may be possible since construction methods used to create the
marsh habitat areas require the use of high turbidity slurry materials.
(4) Physical Effects on Benthos (burial, changes in sediment type, etc.).
a) Fill: Alternatives 2 and 3 require permanent filling of open channel water
habitat. Placement of new fill materials would be below or at the ordinary
high water mark would have a short term effect on benthic organisms.
Alternative 2: Alternative 2 would have short term effects on 42 acres of
the existing benthic zone. The existing habitat and benthic zone is
considered poor quality due to invasive sub-aquatic plants. The project
would result in a long term increase of primary productivity (benthos) in
the area and habitat quality while potentially eradicating 42 acres of
invasive sub-aquatic plant species. Alternative 6 would result in 48 more
acres of long term benthos production than Alternative 2.
Alternative 6. Alternative 6 would have short term effects on 89.5 acres of
the existing benthic zone. The existing habitat and benthic zone is

DRAFT
considered poor quality due to invasive sub-aquatic plants. The project
would result in a long term increase of primary productivity (benthos) in
the area and habitat quality while potentially eradicating 89.5 acres of
invasive sub-aquatic plant species.
(5) Turbidity
a) Fill: Alternatives 2 and 3 require permanent filling of open channel water
habitat Placement of new fill materials would be below or at the ordinary
high water mark would have a short term effect on turbidity.
Alternative 2: Alternative 2 would have short term effects on turbidity.
Turbidity and silt curtains, sacrificial hay bales, and geotextile containers
would be used to contain sediments and reduce turbidity. Effects from
turbidity would be short term.
Alternative 6. Alternative 6 would have short term effects on turbidity.
Turbidity and silt curtains, sacrificial hay bales, and geotextile containers
would be used to contain sediments and reduce turbidity. Alternative 6
would produce a large effect on turbidity since the alternative is 48 acres
larger than Alternative 2. The effects from turbidity would be short term.
(6) Actions Taken to Minimize Impacts. Best Management Practices (BMP’s)
will be employed to avoid and turbidity and entrainment of aquatic species:
Install fish screens, or other appropriate fish exclusion devices, to prevent
entrainment of fish into water intakes of the pumps used for any portion
of the project. These pumps would be used to transport dredged material
to the site from previous disposal sites through pipelines across parts of
the Delta and from hydraulic off-loaders.
Incorporate best management practices during construction to prevent
excess sedimentation plumes into any of the existing and proposed
wetland areas.

B. Water Circulation, Fluctuation, and Salinity Determinations
(1) Consider effects on (for both Alternatives 2 and 3:
a) Salinity. No significant effect.
b) Water Chemistry (pH, etc.). No significant effect.
c) Clarity. No significant effect.
d) Color. No significant effect.
e) Odor. No significant effect.
f) Taste. No significant effect.
g) Dissolved Gas Level. No significant effect.

DRAFT
h) Nutrients. No significant effect.
i) Eutrophication. No significant effect.
j) Others as Appropriate. No significant effect.
(2) Current Patterns and Circulation (for both Alternatives 2 and 3 :). No
significant effect.
(3) Normal Water level Fluctuations (for both Alternatives 2 and 3 :): No
significant effect.
(4) Salinity Gradients (for both Alternatives 2 and 3): No significant effect.

(5) Actions That Will Be Taken to Minimize Impacts (for both Alternatives 2 and
3). Since disturbance throughout the project is greater than 1 acre, the contractor would
be required to file and adhere to a file and adhere to an In Water Work Plan.
C. Suspended Particulate/ Turbidity Determinations
(1) Expected Changes in Suspended Particulates and Turbidity Levels in Vicinity
of Disposal Site (for both Alternatives 2 and 3). No significant effect.
(2) Effects, Degree, and Duration on Chemical and Physical Properties of the
Water Column (for both Alternatives 2 and 3):
a) Light Penetration. No significant effect.
b) Dissolved Oxygen. No significant effect.
c) Toxic Metals and Organics. No significant effect. Dredge materials from
the deep water ship channels is collected and tested prior to removal. The
Corps maintains records of all materials currently held in dry land
stockpile sites. A chemical analysis of the existing project site channel
bottom would be conducted prior to the filling with existing dredge
materials. The project site channel bottom samples would serve as the
baseline by which fill materials chemical analysis must be at or below the
existing baseline threshold. Existing samples from sites surrounding the
project areas indicate that the dry land stockpile dredge materials would
meet baseline thresholds. Future dredge materials from O and M activities
would be measured against the baseline thresholds. Materials not meeting
the baseline would be stockpiled and not used as fill.
d) Pathogens. Not applicable.
e) Esthetics. Not applicable.
f) Others as Appropriate. No significant adverse effects to the chemical and
physical properties of the water column are anticipated.
(3) Effects on Biota (for both Alternatives 2 and 3):
Primary Production, Photosynthesis. No significant adverse effects to the primary
production and photosynthesis processes are anticipated.

DRAFT
(Suspension/ Filter Feeders. No significant adverse effects to suspension and
filter feeders are anticipated.
Sight Feeders. No significant adverse effects to sight feeders are anticipated.
(4) Actions Taken to Minimize Impacts (for both Alternatives 2 and 3). Since
disturbance throughout the project is greater than 1 acre, the contractor would be required
to file and adhere to an In Water Work Plan.
D. Contaminant Determinations. The proposed project Alternatives 2 and 3 would not
add contaminants the river channel system. Best management practices to reduce the potential of
accidental spills during gravel injection would follow all regulatory requirements in conjunction
with the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permitting process.
E. Aquatic Ecosystem and Organism Determinations
(1) Effects on Plankton. The proposed project Alternatives 2 and 3 would have
no affect on plankton communities.
(2) Effects on Benthos. The proposed project Alternatives 2 and 3 would have no
effect on benthos communities.
(3) Effects on Nekton. The proposed project Alternatives 2 and 3 would have no
effect on nekton communities.
(4) Effects on aquatic Food Web. The proposed project Alternatives 23 and 3
would have no effect on the aquatic food web, or the plankton, benthic and nekton
communities with the proposed project.
(5) Effects on Special Aquatic Sites.
a) Sanctuaries and Refuges. The proposed project Alternatives 2 and 3
would require work in the Frank’s Tract State Recreation Area.
Appropriate conservation measures and BMP’s would be utilized to
reduce impacts to wildlife resources. Any potential impacts would be
temporary and less than significant for both alternatives.
b) Wetlands. None exist in project area.
c) Mud Flats. None exist in project area.
d) Vegetated Shallows. None exist in project area.
e) Coral Reefs. None exist in project area.
f) Riffle and Pool Complexes.
(6) Threatened and Endangered Species.
a) Alternatives 3 and 2 are not likely to result in adverse water quality or
noise effects on migrating adult and juvenile winter or spring run Chinook
salmon, steelhead, green sturgeon, and Delta smelt and their critical
habitat. Restriction of all work activities to the proposed construction
footprints and work calendar (August 1 through October 31). The

DRAFT
adherence to all turbidity, sediment, and chemistry control as dictated in
the In Water Work Plan would further minimize the potential for projectrelated increases in turbidity and suspended sediment in the Big Break and
Little Frank’s Tract project areas. Implementation of a spill prevention
control and countermeasure plan and slurry spill/pipe breach contingency
plan is anticipated to minimize the potential for toxic or hazardous spills
or discharges into the project area. Based on the location and duration of
tender boat activities and other noise-generating activities, potential noise
and vibration impacts on fish are expected to be negligible.
b) Alternatives 2 and 3 are not likely to result in adverse modification of the
Primary Constituent Elements (PCE) of critical habitat of on winter or
spring run Chinook salmon, steelhead, green sturgeon, and Delta smelt.
There would be a direct physical modification of sub-aquatic vegetation
within the designated critical habitat of these species below the high water
mark. Temporary and permanent losses of submerged aquatic vegetation
would be limited to approximately 42 acres (Alternative 2) and 90 acres
(Alternative 6) of sub-aquatic vegetation within the permanent and
temporary footprints of the project below the OHWM. The majority of
sub-aquatic plant species within the project area open water habitat is
dominated by the nonnative species egeria (Egeria densa). This introduced
species is prevalent in the Delta, and it is currently targeted for abatement
by the California Department of Boating and Waterways (DBW). The
project would eradicate up to 42 acres (Alternative 2) and 90 acres
(Alternative 6) of egeria while provide long term primary productivity for
aquatic species. Alternative 6 would result in 48 acres of long term
primary productivity.
(7) Other Wildlife. The proposed project action would have no significant
adverse effect on wildlife because construction window is limited to specific areas and
during non-migratory periods. The duration of adverse effects is temporary. Any
displaced wildlife would be expected to return to the area after the action is completed.
(8) Actions to Minimize Impacts.
F. Proposed Disposal Site Determinations
(1) Mixing Zone Determination (for both 2 and 3) The project is not anticipated to
increase salinity levels within the Big Break or Little Frank’s Tract areas. The
project will not anticipated to further advance the current X2 salinity demarcation
line.
(2) Determination of Compliance with Applicable Water Quality Standards (for
both Alternatives 2 and 3). No water quality or effluent standards would be
violated during proposed project action. All project actions would be performed

DRAFT
with strict adherence to the In Water Work Plan developed with Federal and State
agency partners.
(3) Potential Effects on Human Use Characteristics (for both Alternatives 2 and
3). The proposed project would not have any significant adverse effects to
municipal and private water supply, recreational and commercial fisheries, or
water-related recreation. Any displacement of recreational activities would be
temporary. The project is anticipated to increase long term recreational
experiences and opportunities by increasing the habitat quality.
G. Determination of Cumulative Effects on the Aquatic Ecosystem
The potential cumulative impacts from implementation of the Preferred Alternative
(Alternative 6) considered with other relevant actions in the general vicinity of the Delta Islands
and Levees Feasibility Study, have been assessed and are discussed in Section 5.11 of the EIS.
Nearly all potentially significant impacts from Alternatives 2 and 3 could be reduced to less than
significant levels by mitigation measures specified in this EIS. The Alternatives would not have
any significant cumulative effects on the aquatic ecosystem. Implementation of the either the
TSP/NER (Alternative 6) or the Alternative 2 will provide sub-aquatic primary productivity and
terrestrial refugia for migratory species which results in ecosystem restoration benefits to the
Delta.
H. Determination of Secondary Effects on the Aquatic Ecosystem
Secondary effects (or impacts) are “effects on an aquatic ecosystem that are associated
with a discharge of dredged or fill materials, but do not result from the actual placement of the
dredged or fill material” (40 CFR 230.11(h) (1)). Therefore, secondary effects are limited to
other actions in the aquatic environment that are indirectly related to implementation of the
action, such as erosion or downstream sedimentation, or compensatory mitigation.
Implementation of Alternative 2 or the TSP/NER Alternative 6 could result in the
potential secondary impacts such as the unintentional placement of fill material outside of the
proposed project area, and an increase in contaminants from construction vehicles and
equipment. These actions could result in additional adverse impacts to water quality, accretion
patterns, aquatic and other wildlife habitat, recreation, aesthetics and air quality. To help
minimize impacts associated with the placement of fill material outside the proposed project
area, Corps construction contracts require that the contractor delineate the project boundaries,
and install proper BMP’s within the project area such as turbidity and silt curtains. Additionally,
the contractor will be required to adhere to the details of an In Water Work Plan which prevents
or reduces adverse impacts to water quality from turbidity or chemical spills.

V. Findings of Compliance or Non-Compliance with the Restrictions on Discharge
A. Adaptation of the Section 404(b) (1) Guidelines to this Evaluation: No significant
adaptations of the guidelines were made relative to this evaluation of the TSP/NER Alternative 6
or Alternative 2.

DRAFT

B. Evaluation of Availability of Practicable Alternatives to the Proposed Discharge Site
Which Would Have Less Impact on the Aquatic Ecosystem:
Alternative 2 creates 42 acres of temporary impacts to wildlife, recreation, water quality,
and impacts to the waters of the United States and associated aquatic systems. Alternative 6
creates 90 acres of temporary impacts to wildlife, recreation, water quality, and impacts to the
waters of the United States and associated aquatic systems. Alternatives 2 and 3 create
permanent impacts to the waters of the United States by conversion of open water habitat to tidal
marsh habitat. The restored tidal marsh would have a higher value habitat than the existing open
water habitat. The total project area for Alternative 6 is 90 acres compared to Alternative 2
which is 42 acres. Therefore, Alternative 6 creates more impact to the waters of the United
States based upon the additional 48 acres of proposed work. No alternative exists which does
not involve discharge of fill materials into waters of the U.S.
Alternative 2 does not provide the range and extents of ecosystem benefits and study
objectives as Alternative 6. Alternative 2 involves discharge of fill materials into the waters of
the U.S. and has less adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystem than Alternative 6. However,
Alternative 2 does not meet the study’s planning objectives. A recommendation for alternative
selection was made by identifying the plan that reasonably maximizes environmental outputs
relative to costs while meeting planning objectives and avoiding planning constraints.
The TSP/NER (Alternative 6) meets the Corps 404 (b) (1) permit criteria of the least
environmentally damaging practical alternative (LEDPA). The 404 (b)(1) guidelines, § 230.3
Definitions (q) define practicable as ‘a means available and capable of being done after taking
into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project purposes’.
Alternative 6 is the most reasonably efficient contribution to the California Delta ecosystem,
restoring 90 acres of tidal marsh habitat. Millions of Federal dollars have been spent in recent
decades to study the Delta; yet very little restoration has occurred. This plan would allow
progress to be made toward significant, cost-effective ecosystem restoration, while beneficially
using previously dredged material and future dredged material from USACE projects. The
project creates several benefits:




Creates 90 acres of long term high value habitat producing primary productivity
benefiting migratory avian and aquatic species, and threatened and endangered
species (Delta Smelt and Giant Garter Snake)
Removes stockpiles dredge material inventory and creates additional storage
space for future O and M actions.
Increase recreation opportunities in an area with evident recreation by creating
higher value habitat which attracts avian and aquatic species.

Appropriate conservation measures and BMP’s to minimize potential adverse impacts of
the discharge on the waters of the United States and associated aquatic systems would be
implemented. The proposed disposal sites for the discharge of dredge materials would meet
construction and In Water Work Plan specifications and guidelines and comply with the
requirements of practicable conditions and measures to minimize pollution or adverse effects to

DRAFT
the aquatic ecosystem. No mitigation should be necessary (other than air quality). The project is
designed to avoid affects to other habitat types and therefore no additional mitigation is
necessary. Additionally, The Corps would not mitigate for the open water area that is filled
because the habitat affected by the project is being converted to higher value habitat.
C. Compliance with Applicable State Water Quality Standards, and; Compliance with
Applicable Toxic Effluent Standard or Prohibition Under Section 307 of the Clean Water Act:
State water quality standards would not be violated. Alternatives 2 and 3 would not violate the
Toxic Effluent Standards of Section 307 of the Clean Water Act.
D. Compliance with Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973: The Corps has initiated
consultation with USFWS and NOAA Fisheries under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act
(16 U.S.C. 1536[c]) for potential effects to listed species and their critical habitats for both
Alternatives 3 and 2. All terms and conditions of a subsequent Biological Opinion from the
USFWS will be fully implemented.
E. Compliance with Specified Protection Measures for Marine Sanctuaries Designated
by the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972: Not applicable to both
Alternatives 2 and 3.
F. Compliance with Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899; 33 U.S.C. 403, et seq.. The Rivers
and Harbors Act of 1899, Section 10. Alternative 2 or 3 would not result in unauthorized
obstruction or alteration of any navigable water of the U.S. Both alternatives would require
work In Water Work Plans which require that no project action may interfere with river
commerce or alter the navigable shipping lane. Both project sites are not within the Sacramento
or San Joaquin deep water shipping lanes.
G. Evaluation of Extent of Degradation of the Waters of the United States: The
placement of fill materials would not result in significant adverse effects on human health and
welfare, including municipal and private water supplies, recreational and commercial fishing,
fish, shellfish, wildlife, and special aquatic sites. The life stages of aquatic species and other
wildlife would not be adversely affected. No significant adverse or long term effects on aquatic
ecosystem diversity, productivity and stability, recreational, aesthetic, and economic values
would occur.

This Real Estate Plan is prepared in accordance with ER 405-1-12, Section 12-16, and in
support of the Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study is to determine Federal interest in
providing Flood Risk Management (FRM) and Ecosystem Restoration (ER) improvements in
the Sacramento – San Joaquin Rivers Delta (Delta) in Northern California. The purpose and
scope of this Real Estate Plan is to describe the Recommended Plan, Alternative 6, and is to
be used for planning purposes only. There may be modifications to the plans that occur
during Preconstruction, Engineering and Design (PED) phase, thus changing the final
acquisition area(s) and/or administrative land cost.
Non Federal Sponsors

The USACE initiated the Feasibility Study at the request of the California Department of
Water Resources (DWR), the non-Federal sponsor for the study. The USACE and DWR
are the lead agencies in the Feasibility Study.
2. Project Authority

The authority for this investigation has roots in longstanding flood control laws. The
foundation for this investigation’s authority comes from the Flood Control Act of 1936
(Public Law [PL] 74-738. Section 2 of this Act states: “that, hereafter Federal investigations
and improvements of river and other waterways for flood control and allied purposes shall be
under the jurisdiction of and shall be prosecuted by the War Department under the direction
of the Secretary of War and supervision of the Chief of Engineers…”. Section 6 of the 1936
Flood Control Act further states: “The Secretary of War is hereby authorized and directed to
cause preliminary examinations and surveys for flood control at the following named
localities…Sacramento and San Joaquin River Valleys, California…Provided further, That
after the regular or formal reports made as authorized on any examination, survey, project, or
work under way or proposed are submitted to Congress, no supplemental or additional report
or estimate shall be made unless authorized by law or by resolution of the Committee on
Flood Control of the House of Representative or the Committee on Commerce of the
Senate.”

The Chief of Engineers completed a report based on this authority relevant to this project.
House Document No. 81-367, dated October 13, 1949, is a letter from the Secretary of the
Army on the Sacramento-San Joaquin Basin Streams, California which states: “A Letter from
the Chief of Engineers, United Sates Army, Dated July 27, 1948, submitting a report,
together with accompanying papers and illustrations, on preliminary examinations and
surveys of Sacramento-San Joaquin River Basin Streams, California. For Flood Control and
3

21 March 2014

allied purposes listed in the Report. This investigation was authorized by the Flood Control
Acts of June 22, 1936 and June 28, 1938.”
Following this Report, Congress directed additional study to be made of this region in 1964.
As mentioned above, Section 6 of the 1936 Flood Control Act expressly permits additional
reports to be authorized by House Resolution. Consistent with that, the Corps was authorized
to pursue further reviews of its report contained in House Document No. 81-367, referenced
above. Specifically, a House Resolution adopted May 8, 1964 states:
“Resolved by the Committee on Public Works of the House of Representatives, United
States, that the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors is hereby requested to review the
report on the Sacramento-San Joaquin Basin Streams, California, published as House
Document No. 367, 81st Congress, 1st Session, and other reports, with a view to determining
whether any modifications of the recommendations contained therein are advisable at this
time, with particular reference to further coordinated development of the water resources in
the San Joaquin River Basin, California.”
The Conference Report (H.rpt. 108-357) that accompanied the Energy and Water
Development Appropriations Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-137) and provided both further
congressional direction and funding relative to this study. Conference Report 108-357 states:
“The conferees have provided $1,100,000 for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California,
study including $350,000 for a reconnaissance study to evaluate environmental restoration,
flood protection, recreation, and related purposes for the California Bay-Delta Authority
North Delta Improvements project, and $500,000 to initiate and complete a reconnaissance
study to prioritize and evaluate environmental restoration, flood protection and related
purposes for the Delta Islands and Levees. The remaining funding is provided for the Delta
Special Study.”
About this time the Congress also passed the CALFED Bay-Delta Authorization Act of 2004
(P.L. 108-361). Section 103(f)(3) specifically authorized USACE participation in the
CALFED Program. The Sacramento District conducted a reconnaissance level study of the
CALFED Levee Stability Program. USACE sent its report to Congress entitled “CALFED
Levee Stability Program, California” in May 2006, recommending that the Corps perform a
feasibility study of the Delta Islands and levees to define the long-term strategy for the Delta
levee system improvement.
Section 3015 of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2007 amends Section
103(f)(3) of PL 108-361 which in part authorized this feasibility report. USACE published
its implementation guidance for WRDA, 2007, Section 3015, on August 11, 2008.
3. Project Description

This project will restore critical ecology systems and manage flood risks in the Delta.
The recommended plan will achieve this by restoring, enhancing, preserving, creating,
and maintaining, aquatic, riparian, and adjacent terrestrial habitats in the Delta for native
plants and wildlife. The wildlife includes Federal and State threatened, endangered, and
4

Delta Islands and Levees Real Estate Plan

21 March 2014

special-status species, with the potential secondary benefit to recreation. It will restore
floodplain functions and contiguous habitat in the Delta and incidentally improve water
quality in the Delta. This project will beneficially reuse available dredged materials by
restoring marsh habitat with material and redirecting flood waters into specific parts
of the Delta. Specifically, Alternative 6, the recommended plan, includes increments 1,
2, 3, and 5 at Big Break Island and increment 1 at Little Frank’s Tract Island.
Alternative 6 would result in 89.5 acres of restored intertidal marsh habitat and 13.55
acres of open water flowing through the site. This project will require 1,112k cubic
yards of fill material placed directly from dredged material. The dredged material
would come from yearly Operations and Maintenance dredging from the Stockton
Deep Water Ship Channel for a period of five years, and by pumping of previously
dredged material from the McCormick, Scour, Decker, and Bradford borrow/spoil
sites. The total cost of this alternative is $21.9 million.
4. Description of Land, Easements, Rights-Of-Way, Relocation, and Disposal Areas
(LERRDs)

The federal plan, Alternative 6, envisions an incremental system as shown in the table
below to achieve the project goals. Increments of restoration at each site were
developed based on an acre grid system. Available fill material calculations were used
to determine the size of increments, i.e., how many grid cells each increment included.
Locations of increments are general within each site and are based on proximity to fill
material, proximity to remnant levees for improved constructability, and connectivity to
existing habitat.

The real estate cost estimate for the tentatively selected plan was developed based on
the conventional approach for development of feasibility level design. Cadastral Section
has inventoried 43 parcels and portions of several sloughs and rivers that would be
impacted by the project. 19 parcels are sponsor-owned in fee title according to the
County assessor’s office. 18 parcels are privately owned and 6 are publically owned
according to the assessor’s office. During development of the REP, the real estate cost
estimate was developed in accordance with ER 405-1-12 and based upon the footprints
delineating project requirements developed by the Sacramento District’s Engineering
Division. The LERRDs requirements for the REP include: the acquisition of temporary
work area easements for staging areas, borrow easements, and temporary pipeline
easements and fee title for the intertidal marsh habitat and open flowing water ways.
The different types of acquisitions are as follows:
•

•
•

Five year Temporary work area easements are required for staging and
borrow areas owned by the sponsor and the Port of Stockton

On site intertidal marsh habitat restoration areas will be acquired in fee title

Five year pipeline easement for temporary pipeline to pump fill material to
Little Frank’s Tract and Big Break – Contractor will be responsible for
5

Delta Islands and Levees Real Estate Plan

21 March 2014

obtaining all permits for work required in the Sacramento Deep Water Ship
Channel

The pipelines will also cross Highway 160 and Sherman Island Crossing Road, which
are both State owned. After discussions, the State has agreed to issue encroachment
permits for these portions of the pipeline.

Once the Project Partnership Agreement (PPA) process is complete, the Sacramento
District Engineering Branch will prepare the final design for advertisement and
construction. During this process the tract register and tract maps will be updated to
reflect any modifications to include final staging areas, access requirements, and
restoration features. This information will be used for future crediting purposes.

Acquisition of about 103.05 acres in fee title along with about 955.76 acres of temporary
work area easements and 35.45 acres of temporary pipeline easements are required for the
Tentatively Selected Plan. Fee title would be acquired over submerged lands at Big Break
and Little Frank’s Tract; temporary work area easements at borrow sites and staging areas;
and temporary pipeline easements for placement of dredged material slurry pipelines where
the navigational servitude is unavailable. The non-Federal sponsor would acquire these
estates as part of its project obligations.
Real estate acquisition for the Tentatively Selected Plan is split among 16 landowners. All
fee acquisitions are located on currently flooded islands with no infrastructure, therefore
relocations are not required.

5. LERRDs Owned by the Non-Federal Sponsor and Crediting

It is understood that the sponsor will provide a credit appraisal for project lands
associated with the USACE Recommended Plan. This credit appraisal will be prepared
in accordance with the Uniform Appraisal Standards (USPAP) and prepared by a
certified appraiser who will be approved as a qualified appraiser by the USACE
Sacramento District Appraisal Branch. Approximately 19 parcels are owned in fee title
according to the County Assessor’s office in the study area identified in the tract
registers. The parcels owned by the Non Federal Sponsors are assumed sufficient for the
estates needed. Coordination with the State of California is ongoing and they will be
reviewing the proposed parcels. All restrictions, prior easements, or inconsistent
encumbrances are not known at this time. There is relatively low risk to the sponsor owned
lands being insufficient for project purposes as these are small relatively uninhabited Delta
Islands.
6. Standard Federal Estates

The non-Federal sponsor will be required to acquire the minimum interest in real
estate that will support the construction and subsequent operation and maintenance of
the proposed USACE project.
The following standard estates (with definitions) are identified as required for the
project:
Temporary Work Area Easement

A temporary easement and right-of-way in, on, over and across for a period not to
exceed 5 years after the execution of the construction contract, beginning with date
possession of the land is granted to the State of California, for use by the State of
California, its representatives, agents, and contractors as a (borrow area) (work area),
including the right to borrow and/or deposit fill, spoil and waste material thereon)
(move, store and remove equipment and supplies, and erect and remove temporary
structures on the land and to perform any other work necessary and incident to the
construction of the Delta Project, together with the right to trim, cut, fell and remove
there from all trees, underbrush, obstructions, and any other vegetation, structures, or
obstacles within the limits of the right-of-way; reserving however, to the landowners,
their heirs and assigns, all such rights and privileges as may be used without interfering
with or abridging the rights and easement hereby acquired; subject, however, to
existing easements for public roads and highways, public utilities, railroads and
pipelines.
Fee Simple Title

7

Delta Islands and Levees Real Estate Plan

21 March 2014

The fee simple title to [the lands described in Exhibit B], subject however, to existing
easements for public roads and highways, public utilities, railroads and pipelines.
Temporary Well and Pipeline Easement

A temporary and assignable easement in, on, over and across [the lands described in
Exhibit B] for a period not to exceed 5 years beginning (date)(with the date possession
is granted to the State of California in this proceeding {or date of deed}), and
terminating with the earlier of the completion of the remediation or the filing in the
local land records by the representative of the State of California in charge of the Project
of a notice of termination,) to locate, construct, operate, maintain, repair, replace,
and/or remove (a) (monitoring) (injection) (extraction) well(s), pipeline(s) and
appurtenances thereto; subject, however, to existing easements for public roads and
highways, public utilities, railroads and pipelines.
7. Description of any Existing Federal Projects in or Partially in the Proposed Project
There are no federal projects in our study area.

8. Description of any Federally owned Land Needed for the Project
There are no federally owned lands needed for this project.

9. Application of Navigational Servitude to the LERRDs Requirement

When the project's contractors are working in navigable waters of the U.S. there should
be no need to acquire temporary real property rights or rights of entry, regardless of
who owns the water bottoms. Contractors must clear any plans for placement of
temporary pipelines with SPK Regulatory Branch and possibly with the Coast Guard to
ensure no obstructions to navigation.

11. Anticipated Increased Flooding and Impacts

Based on hydraulic modeling results, there will be no increased flooding from the
proposed project, from either the flood risk management or ecosystem restoration
actions.
12. Cost Estimate

The following is a preliminary analysis estimating the costs of acquiring the required
LERRDs to support the USACE Recommended Plan to assist in the determination of
federal interest for a cost benefit analysis. The format and level of investigation of this
cost estimate is considered to be consistent with, and meet the intent of, the Real Estate
Policy Guidance Letter No. 31-Real Estate Support to Civil Works Planning Paradigm
(3X3X3). This policy letter states that “For projects in which the value of real estate
(lands, improvements, and severance damages) are not expected to exceed ten percent
of total project costs (total cost to implement project), a cost estimate (or rough order
of magnitude) will be acceptable for purposes of the feasibility phase.” The table below
10

Delta Islands and Levees Real Estate Plan

estimates the costs associated with acquiring real property interests necessary to
construct, operate and maintain the proposed project. The date of the approved cost
estimate was March 25, 2014.

13. Relocation Assistance Benefits.

The non-Federal sponsors must comply with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and
Real Properties Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4601 et seq. (P.L.
91-646, “the Uniform Act”) and provide relocation assistance to qualifying residences
and businesses within the project area that are displaced, as defined in the Uniform Act,
as a consequence of USACE project implementation. Presently, no displacements are
anticipated as a consequence of implementation of the Recommended Plan.
14. Mineral / Timber Activity.

There are no valuable minerals impacted by this project. There was no enhancement
for mineral deposits included in the cost estimate. There is no timber activity.
15. Non-Federal Sponsor’s Ability to Acquire.

The non-Federal sponsors have real estate staff and experience in acquiring real estate
for county, state and Federal projects.
16. Zoning Anticipated in Lieu of Acquisition.

There is no zoning in lieu of acquisition planned in connection with the project.

18. Description of Facility and Utility Relocations.

There will be no facility or utility relocations.

19. Hazardous, Toxic, and Radiological Waste (HTRW).
Naturally Occurring Hazards

Historic geologic conditions in the study area have led to the formation of peat and
other organic soils with thicknesses of up to approximately 55 feet on the western side
of the Delta; peat deposits are not commonly found on the eastern side. The thick
organic soils and peat have the potential to generate flammable gases such as methane
that can pose hazards to workers during deep excavations and tunneling. In addition,
petroleum deposits underlying the study area could result in the migration of oil and/or
natural gas from deep reservoirs into shallow strata that may be disturbed during
construction.
Hazards from Agricultural Practices

Agriculture has been the primary land use in the study area for more than a century.
Approximately 538,000 acres of the 738,000 acres of agriculture land potentially affect
the waters adjacent to the project areas.

A wide variety of pesticides, including insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, have
been used throughout the agricultural lands surrounding the project area for decades;
and those chemicals still may be present in and near agricultural lands. While some
pesticides that were used in 1974 were still in use in 2008 (e.g., sulfur, petroleum oils,
1,3‐dichloropropene, diuron, and carbaryl), a number of new pesticides, such as
chloropicrin, chlorpyrifos and propanil, are available and in use currently. Notably, a
number of pesticides prevalently used in the 1970s are no longer prevalently used:
dinoseb, chlordane, dibromochloropropane (DBCP), ethylene dibromide, parathion, and
toxaphene.

The wide variety of pesticides that has been applied, the numerous crops grown in the
region, and the fact that predominant land use across the Delta supports agriculture
indicate that pesticides and their residues are likely to be found in the soils throughout
the Delta. No comprehensive area‐wide soil or sediment sampling program is known to
have been conducted to evaluate pesticide residues from agricultural use. Further
discussion of the fate, transport, and bioaccumulative properties of pyrethroid,
organochlorine, and organophosphate pesticides that have been applied to the project
area crop lands.
Hazards from Historical Mercury Mining

13

Delta Islands and Levees Real Estate Plan

21 March 2014

Mercury has been identified as a chemical of concern in Delta area sediments, resulting
from gold and mercury mining operations in the watersheds upstream of the Delta.
Mercury was used extensively upstream of the study area in mining to extract gold from
ores and placer gravel deposits. Mercury released into the environment by historic gold
mining practices has been flowing into the study area via water, primarily from the
Sacramento River watershed, and sediments since the mid‐1800s and is expected to
continue to enter the study area. An unknown amount of mercury is present in
sediments within the project area, but estimates of mercury flowing into the Delta area ,
mainly associated with suspended sediment (Alpers et al. 2008), range from
approximately 200–400 kg/yr (CVRWQCB 2008).
Urban, Residential, and Recreational Land Use

In general, hazardous materials releases from cities and towns are associated with
stormwater runoff and primarily affect water bodies. Cities and towns account for
approximately 9% of the total study area. Urban stormwater discharges are generally
characterized by varying levels of metals and hydrocarbons that can accumulate in river
sediments over time. Historically, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been
associated with urban discharge, and these contaminants have been detected in fish
tissues in San Francisco Bay.

Urban areas have many facilities with the potential for hazardous materials releases,
including gas stations, dry cleaners, automotive repair facilities, and, in larger towns,
manufacturing facilities. Stockton, for example, has large shipping and port facilities, as
well as Federal facilities with a history of hazardous materials use, storage, and
releases. Antioch and Oakley, located on the south side of the San Joaquin River near
the project areas, have major power‐producing facilities and several active or former
industrial facilities with known groundwater impacts. Possible contaminants of
concern from urban land uses are extensive, but the most common contaminants in soil
and groundwater are petroleum and associated compounds (typically gasoline and
diesel releases from USTs as the source), chlorinated solvents and degreasers (from dry
cleaning and vehicle repair facilities), and various heavy metals, such as arsenic and
lead. Marinas typically include bulk fuel storage and overwater fueling, various boat
repair/maintenance facilities, stores, boat storage, and camping facilities. Typical
chemicals associated with marinas include fuels, lubricants, cleaners, anti‐fouling
paints, and fiberglass components.
Borrow Materials

Historic chemical and granular test results previously dredged materials at placement
sites indicated that the dredge materials are chemically cleaner than the existing
baseline sampling from project area samples. Future materials from dredging
operations would be sampled prior to operations and maintenance dredging. Materials
meeting baseline criteria would be utilized for marsh habitat creation. Materials not
meeting baseline criteria would be stored at existing dryland storage sites
14

Delta Islands and Levees Real Estate Plan

21 March 2014

Project construction activities are not expected to disturb existing HTRW sources that
could lead to contamination of environmental resources. Therefore the project
alternatives are not expected to create effects from HTRW.
19. Attitude of Landowners.

In February 2013, two scoping meetings were held for the project study. The meetings
were held to educate the public about the study efforts and to garner input on the
proposed scope, in accordance with NEPA. To date, the results of the outreach program
from the public scoping meetings have been very favorable, constructive, and
supportive. Numerous agencies, organizations, and individuals are participating in the
study including the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA Fisheries), U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, Sacramento County, San
Joaquin County, Contra Costa County, Yolo County, Alameda County, Solano County,
numerous levee maintaining agencies, local landowners and residents.

Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study, California
Draft Feasibility Report and
Environmental Impact Statement
April 2014

Type of Statement. Draft Feasibility Report and Environmental Impact Statement
Lead Federal Agency: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District
Lead State Agency: California Department of Water Resources
Proposed Action: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the California Department of Water
Resources propose to restore approximately 89.5 acres of lost or degraded tidal marsh habitat in
the west central portion of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The restoration work would
involve transporting and placing dredged material into open water habitat to restore 80.3 acres
and 9.2 acres of tidal marsh at Big Break and Little Franks Tract, respectively, in the Delta. The
work would be conducted over 5 years as part of the annual operation and maintenance (O&M)
dredging of the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel. Previously stockpiled dredged material
from existing dredged material storage sites would also be placed in conjunction with O&M.
Abstract: The draft report describes the affected environment in the Big Break and Little
Franks Tract area; evaluates the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects and the
benefits of the tentatively selected plan and two alternative plans; and recommends avoidance,
minimization, and mitigation measures. Most potential adverse effects would either be short
term and insignificant, or would be avoided or reduced to less than significance using best
management practices. Beneficial effects on vegetation and wildlife, special status species, other
resources, and the historic floodplain from the alternative plans are also discussed.
Public Review and Comment: The draft report is available for a 45-day public review from
April 18 to June 2, 2014. The document may be viewed on the Sacramento District’s website at
http://www.spk.usace.army.mil/Missions/CivilWorks/SacramentoSanJoaquinDelta. A CD copy
of the draft report is also available upon request. The Corps will host public meetings in
Clarksburg and Sacramento on May 7 and 9, 2014, respectively. All comments received will be
considered and incorporated into the final report, as appropriate, and specific responses will be
included in a comments and responses appendix. Questions and comments may be sent to: U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District, Attn: Mr. Robert Kidd, 1325 J Street,
Sacramento, California 95814; phone: (916) 557-5100; or email: deltastudy@usace.army.mil.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report: (1) identifies flood risk management and ecosystem restoration problems
and opportunities in the Sacramento – San Joaquin River Delta (Delta); (2) develops and
evaluates measures to solve identified problems; (3) formulates and compares alternatives for
ecosystem restoration; and (4) identifies a Tentatively Selected Plan (TSP) for implementation.
This integrated Feasibility Report/Environmental Impact Statement (FR/EIS) describes the
planning process followed to identify the Federal interest in the TSP and serves as the
environmental compliance document under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
This FR/EIS is being concurrently released for public review, internal policy review, Agency
Technical Review (ATR), and Independent External Peer Review (IEPR). Pending comments
received during these reviews, the FR/EIS will be finalized to present the recommended plan for
eventual authorization.

Background
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) initiated the Feasibility Study in 2006 at
the request of the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), the non-Federal sponsor
for the study. USACE is the lead agency for the Feasibility Study and is also the lead under
NEPA. Numerous other agencies, organizations, and individuals have participated in the study
including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service
(NMFS).
The Delta (Figure ES-1) is part of the largest estuary on the West Coast of the United
States; is home to hundreds of species of fish, birds, mammals and reptiles; and is considered an
ecosystem of national significance. Agricultural land irrigated by Delta water contributes
billions of dollars in production for the Nation. Two deep water ports in the Delta serve as
important marine terminals for dry bulk cargo vessels transporting agricultural products through
the Delta’s deep draft navigation channels to world markets. Delta levees protect thousands of
acres of orchards, farms, and vineyards as well as critical infrastructure including state and
interstate highways, major rail lines, natural gas fields, gas and fuel pipelines, water conveyance
infrastructure, drinking water pipelines, and numerous towns, businesses and homes.

The Delta is a web of channels and reclaimed islands at the confluence of the
Sacramento, San Joaquin, Cosumnes, Mokelumne, and Calaveras Rivers. Forty percent of
California’s land area is contained within the watersheds of these rivers. The Delta covers about
738,000 acres and is interlaced with hundreds of miles of waterways. Much of the land is below
sea level and protected by a network of 1,100 miles of levees which have been constructed over
the past 150 years to manage the flow of water through the Delta. The land behind the levees is
predominantly agricultural (corn, wheat, vineyards, cattle) and waterways provide recreational
outlets for nearby urban areas and essential habitat for fish and wildlife, including Federally
listed species under the Endangered Species Act. The Delta is also the largest single source of
California’s water supply, providing 25 million Californians with drinking water and irrigating
millions of acres of farmland in the Central Valley. In addition, more than 500,000 people live
within the Delta and rely upon it for water, recreation, and livelihood. The majority of that
population is in the greater Sacramento and Stockton areas and is the focus of other USACE
Flood Risk Management studies, though there are communities within the Delta. Several Delta
towns, known as “legacy communities,” are listed in the national registry of historic places.
Historically, the Delta was defined by tidal wetlands, primarily comprised of peat soils.
The Swamp and Overflow Land Act of 1850 transferred ownership of all Federally owned
swamp and overflow land, including Delta marshes, from the Federal Government to private
parties agreeing to drain the land and turn it to productive, presumably agricultural, use. This
Act began the reclamation of wetlands in the Delta through the construction of levees and
drainage channels, typically by the new land owners. The majority of levees in the Delta are still
privately owned and maintained. Nearly three fourths of the Delta is now in agriculture.

Consideration of Alternative Plans
During the feasibility study, the Federal planning process for development of water
resource projects was followed to identify a TSP for implementation. Following definition of
ecosystem restoration and flood related problems and opportunities, specific planning objectives
and planning constraints were identified. Various management measures were then identified to
achieve the planning objectives and avoid the planning constraints. Management measures were
screened based on how well they met the study objectives and cost effectiveness. Several
categories of measures were dropped from further consideration at that point, including structural
flood risk management measures. The retained management measures were combined to form
alternative plans, which were focused on restoration of intertidal marsh habitat. Alternative
plans were then compared through cost effectiveness and incremental cost analyses based on
costs and outputs.

Tentatively Selected Plan
The tentatively selected National Environmental Restoration (NER) plan (Alternative 6)
is the most reasonably efficient contribution to the California Delta, an ecosystem of national
significance, restoring 89.5 acres of intertidal marsh habitat in the Delta at a cost of $29M. The
TSP (Figure ES-2) provides a unique opportunity to restore intertidal marsh, habitat which is
ES-3

now largely non-existent in this ecosystem of national significance. Prior to levee construction
in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Delta was comprised almost solely of tidal marsh.
As levees were constructed, floodplains were disconnected from the waterways and land began
to subside and compact as it was farmed and developed for human use. Delta lands are now as
much as 20 feet below sea level, much too low for tidal marsh habitat without incorporation of
subsidence reversal, which is typically cost prohibitive. For this reason, restoration of tidal
marsh has been very limited throughout the central Delta in particular, where subsidence is most
extensive and also where tidal marsh was historically most prevalent. The Tentatively Selected
Plan links the proposed ecosystem restoration actions to historic and ongoing USACE navigation
projects, providing a cost effective mechanism to implement otherwise costly subsidence
reversal, resulting in restoration of habitat for multiple Federally listed species, notably
salmonids and Delta smelt. The restored habitat would also benefit the millions of migratory
fowl on the Pacific Flyway as they travel through the Delta, part of the largest estuary on the
West Coast.
The national significance of the Delta has been demonstrated many times through
decades of Federal authorizations and partnerships. The CALFED Bay-Delta Program, which
emerged from water crises of the 1990s, is a unique collaboration among 25 State and Federal
agencies to improve California’s water supply and the ecological health of the Bay-Delta. The
San Francisco Estuary Partnership is a coalition of resource agencies, non-profits, citizens, and
scientists working to protect, restore, and enhance water quality and fish and wildlife habitat in
the Bay-Delta. Most recently, the 2009 California Bay-Delta Memorandum of Understanding
Among Federal Agencies named the Bay-Delta “among the most important estuary ecosystems
in the Nation” and committed the Federal agencies to work in partnership with the State and
stakeholders to carry out the vision of “a healthy and sustainable Bay-Delta ecosystem that
provides for a high-quality, reliable, and sustainable long-term water supply for California, and
restores the environmental integrity and sustainability of the system.” The Tentatively Selected
Plan recommends Federal action to restore 89.5 acres tidal marsh, one of the most sought after
habitat types in this unique, important estuary.
The principle features of the TSP are: (1) placement of 500,000 cubic yards of fill
material into Big Break from Operations and Maintenance dredging from the Stockton Deep
Water Ship Channel to restore tidal habitat elevations; (2) placement of 124,000 cubic yards of
fill material into Big Break via pumping previously dredged material from the McCormick
dredged material placement site; (3) placement of 210,000 cubic yards of fill material into Big
Break via pumping previously dredged material from the Scour dredged material placement site;
(4) placement of 125,000 cubic yards of fill material into Big Break via pumping previously
dredged material from the Decker dredged material placement site; and (5) placement of 153,000
cubic yards of fill material into Little Frank’s Tract via pumping previously dredged material
from the Bradford dredged material placement site.

Environmental Effects
The effects to the environment have been considered throughout the study and
opportunities have been evaluated to provide environmental restoration, as described above. The
proposed alternatives, while providing long-term benefits to the Delta, would also have shortterm effects on some resources. Various mitigation measures have been considered including
construction timing, location of fill material placement, material source selection sites, and
avoidance of certain areas. A summary of impacts, mitigation measures, and level of impacts
with mitigation is provided in Table ES-1.
In all cases, the potential adverse environmental effects would be reduced to a less-thansignificant level through project design, construction practices, preconstruction surveys and
analysis, regulatory requirements, and best management practices. No compensatory mitigation
would be required. A geotechnical analysis of underlying substrates and water quality analysis
ES-5

of construction activities and methods would be conducted during the preconstruction,
engineering, and design phase to further refine potential impact analysis. A National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System general construction permit would be required. A Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan and Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan would be
developed by the contractor prior to construction.
Jurisdictional wetlands occur in the proposed footprint of the TSP. A Section 404(b)(1)
analysis has been conducted for the TSP (Alternative 6) to analyze potential effects that could
occur from the placement of dredged materials in open water habitat. Potential impacts to
vegetation communities and special status species have been greatly reduced through
construction design. Direct impacts to nesting birds and other sensitive species would be
avoided by implementing preconstruction surveys and scheduling of construction activities.
USACE has determined that the TSP is likely to have adverse short-term effects to Delta smelt;
however, it would have long-term benefits once the intertidal marsh habitat is established. The
TSP would also affect, but is not likely to adversely affect listed salmonids, green sturgeon, giant
garter snake and other special status species with the potential to occur in the area. Coordination
with USFWS and NMFS has been ongoing throughout the study. A biological assessment was
prepared for Delta smelt and submitted to USFWS to initiate consultation. Informal consultation
with NMFS will take place during public and agency review of this document.
Impacts to agricultural land would be minimized by avoiding active farm lands when
placing any temporary pipelines. If any land is temporarily disturbed during construction, it
would be returned to agricultural production after construction. The TSP is located in an estuary
area where urban populations are not present. Because of the lack of population in the area, it
has been determined that no affect would occur to socioeconomics, environmental justice, noise,
aesthetics, and public utilities and services. Additionally, the TSP proposes to create tidal marsh
lands and therefore does not contribute to occupancy, modification, or development of flood
plains, and therefore, the project is in compliance with Executive Order 11988.

CULTURAL RESOURCES
Any adverse effects on cultural resources that are
listed or eligible for listing in the National Registry
of Historic Places (i.e., historic properties) are
considered to be significant impacts. Effects are
considered to be adverse if they alter, directly or
indirectly, any of the characteristics of a cultural
resource that qualify that resource for the NRHP so
that the integrity of the resource's location, design,
setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or
association is diminished.

archaeological monitoring to ensure that no previously
unknown archaeological sites are impacted.
3 – If previously unidentified cultural resources are
discovered during ground disturbing activities, all
construction in the vicinity of the find would be halted
immediately and the USACE would follow the
procedures outlined under 36 CFR 800.

Major Conclusions
The preliminary recommendation is that the report be finalized based on results of public
review, internal policy review, ATR, and IEPR of this draft FS/EIS, and if warranted,
recommended for authorization for implementation as a Federal project. The estimated first cost
of the Tentatively Selected Plan is $29,018,000 and the estimated annual OMRR&R cost,
anticipated to be minimal, are to be determined prior to the final report. The Federal portion of
the estimated first cost, based on October 2013 price levels, is $18,933,000. The estimated fully
funded Federal first cost, based on projected inflation rates specified by USACE budget
guidance, and including Cultural Resource Data Recovery (100% Federal cost) is $19,324,000.
The non-Federal sponsor portion of the estimated first cost is $10,084,000. The non-Federal
sponsor’s share of the fully funded first cost is $10,292,000.

CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION

1.1

Purpose and Need

The communities and ecosystem within the Sacramento – San Joaquin Delta (Delta) rely
on an existing levee network to contain flows in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. The
1,100 mile levee network is a mix of Federal and non-Federal levees that do not meet U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE), or any other levee construction standard and could fail at water
levels well below top of levee. The levee network holds water back from flooding the subsided
islands/tracts during daily tidal fluctuations. Native habitat and natural river functions in the
study area have suffered extensive degradation over more than a century of levee construction
and conversion of the floodplain to agricultural and rural development, as well as management of
the system for municipal, industrial, and agricultural water supplies. The purposes of a project
for the Delta area are to reduce flood risk to life and property and to restore the ecosystem, as
stated in Section 2 of the Flood Control Act of 1936 (Public Law [PL] 74-7380), “investigations
and improvements of river and other waterways for flood control and allied purposes.”
This report presents the findings of the Sacramento – San Joaquin Rivers Delta Islands
and Levees, California, Feasibility Study (Feasibility Study). The purpose of the Feasibility
Study is to determine if there is a Federal interest 1 in providing Flood Risk Management (FRM)
and Ecosystem Restoration (ER) improvements to the Sacramento – San Joaquin Rivers Delta
(Delta), California. This report integrates plan formulation with documentation of environmental
effects. This report will also serve as an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), by providing
documentation and analysis required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969,
as amended. The report describes the flooding, ecosystem, and related water resource problems
and opportunities in the Delta area and expresses desired changes as planning objectives.
Alternative plans to achieve these objectives are presented. These alternative plans include a plan
of no action and various combinations of individual management measures 2. The economic,
social, and environmental effects of the alternative plans are described and a feasible plan is
tentatively selected for recommendation. The report also details the roles of the USACE and
non-Federal sponsor (California Department of Water Resources) in implementing the selected
plan. The non-Federal sponsor is responsible for compliance with the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA). The report concludes with a tentative recommendation for Congressional
authorization of the Tentatively Selected Plan, pending public review, technical reviews, and
subsequent revisions. This report will serve as an interim response to the study authority, stated
below.

1

A project is said to be in the Federal interest if it is consistent with the mission of the Corps of Engineers and the
project benefits are in excess of the project costs.
2
A management measure is a feature or activity that can be implemented at a specific geographic site to address one or
more planning objectives.

Study Authority

Authority for this investigation has roots in longstanding flood control laws. The
foundation for this investigation’s authority comes from the Flood Control Act of 1936 (Public
Law [PL] 74-7380). Section 2 of this Act states:
“[T]hat, hereafter Federal investigations and improvements of river and other
waterways for flood control and allied purposes shall be under the jurisdiction of
and shall be prosecuted by the War Department under the direction of the
Secretary of War and supervision of the Chief of Engineers…”.
Section 6 of the 1936 Flood Control Act further states:
“The Secretary of War is hereby authorized and directed to cause preliminary
examinations and surveys for flood control at the following named
localities…Sacramento and San Joaquin River Valleys, California…Provided
further, That after the regular or formal reports made as authorized on any
examination, survey, project, or work under way or proposed are submitted to
Congress, no supplemental or additional report or estimate shall be made unless
authorized by law or by resolution of the Committee on Flood Control of the
House of Representative or the Committee on Commerce of the Senate.”
The Chief of Engineers completed a report based on this authority relevant to this project.
House Document No. 367, dated October 13, 1949, is a letter from the Secretary of the Army on
the Sacramento-San Joaquin Basin Streams, California which states in part:
“A Letter from the Chief of Engineers, United Sates Army, Dated July 27, 1948,
submitting a report, together with accompanying papers and illustrations, on
preliminary examinations and surveys of Sacramento-San Joaquin River Basin
Streams, California. For Flood Control and allied purposes listed in the Report.
This investigation was authorized by the Flood Control Acts of June 22, 1936 and
June 28, 1938.”
Following this Report, Congress directed additional study to be made of this region in
1964. As mentioned above, Section 6 of the 1936 Flood Control Act expressly permits
additional reports to be authorized by House Resolution. Consistent with that statutory
delegation a House Resolution adopted May 8, 1964 authorized the Corps to pursue further
reviews of the Agency’s report contained in House Document No. 367, referenced above.
Specifically the May 8, 1964 House Resolution states:
“Resolved by the Committee on Public Works of the House of Representatives,
United States, that the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors is hereby
requested to review the report on the Sacramento-San Joaquin Basin Streams,
California, published as House Document No. 367, 81st Congress, 1st Session, and
other reports, with a view to determining whether any modifications of the
recommendations contained therein are advisable at this time, with particular
2

reference to further coordinated development of the water resources in the San
Joaquin River Basin, California.”
Conference Report 108-357 accompanied the Energy and Water Development
Appropriations Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-137) and provided both further congressional direction and
funding relative to this study. Conference Report 108-357 states:
“The conferees have provided $1,100,000 for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta,
California, study including $350,000 for a reconnaissance study to evaluate
environmental restoration, flood protection, recreation, and related purposes for
the California Bay-Delta Authority North Delta Improvements project, and
$500,000 to initiate and complete a reconnaissance study to prioritize and
evaluate environmental restoration, flood protection and related purposes for the
Delta Islands and Levees. The remaining funding is provided for the Delta
Special Study.”
About this time Congress also passed the CALFED Bay-Delta Authorization Act of 2004
(P.L. 108-361). Section 103(f)(3) of the Act specifically authorized USACE participation in the
CALFED Program. Accordingly the Sacramento District conducted a reconnaissance level study
of the CALFED Levee Stability Program. USACE sent its report to Congress entitled
“CALFED Levee Stability Program, California” in May 2006, recommending that the Corps
perform a feasibility study of Delta Islands and levees to define a long-term strategy for Delta
levee system improvements.
“Section 3015 of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2007 amends
Section 103(f)(3) of PL 108-361, which in part authorized this feasibility report.
USACE published its implementation guidance for WRDA, 2007, Section 3015, on
August 11, 2008.”

1.3

Study Area Location

The study area (Figure 1-1) includes the entire Sacramento – San Joaquin Delta and
Suisun Marsh, comprising parts of Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano, Contra Costa, Alameda,
and Yolo Counties, California. The area extends south from the City of Sacramento to the cities
of Stockton and Tracy, and west from approximately Interstate Highway 5 to and including
Suisun Bay, an eastward extension of the San Francisco Bay. The Delta consists of about
740,000 acres of agricultural and developed lands, wetlands and tidal marshes segregated into
some 80 tracts and islands by 1,100 miles of levees and a labyrinth of navigation channels,
rivers, tributaries, streams, sloughs, waterways and shallow open water expanses.

Study Sponsor and Participants

USACE initiated the Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study at the request of the
California Department of Water Resources (DWR), the non-Federal sponsor for the study.
USACE and DWR are the lead agencies in the Feasibility Study and share the cost of the study
equally (50% /50%), pursuant to the Feasibility Cost Sharing Agreement (FCSA) executed by
the parties on May 25, 2006.
Numerous agencies, organizations, and individuals are participating in the study
including the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA), California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), Sacramento County, San
Joaquin County, Contra Costa County, Yolo County, Alameda County, Solano County,
numerous levee maintaining agencies, local landowners and residents.

1.5

Existing Programs, Studies, and Projects

There are many ongoing water resources related programs, studies, and projects that
could affect flooding and ecosystem conditions in the study area. Those efforts that pertain
directly to this feasibility study are summarized below.

1.5.1

Programs

Bay-Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP)
The BDCP is a part of California’s overall water management portfolio. It is being
developed as a 50-year habitat conservation plan with the goals of restoring the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta ecosystem and securing California water supplies. The BDCP would secure
California’s water supply by building new water delivery infrastructure and operating the system
to improve the ecological health of the Delta. The BDCP also would restore or protect
approximately 150,000 acres of habitat to address the Delta’s environmental challenges. The
Draft BDCP and BDCP Draft EIR/EIS are being made available to the public for a 180-day
review period (including a 60-day extension). The public review and comment period is effective
December 13, 2013 through June 13, 2014.
CALFED Bay-Delta Program (CALFED)
CALFED was established in May 1995 as a cooperative effort among the State and
Federal agencies that handle management and regulatory responsibilities in the Sacramento –
San Joaquin Delta. CALFED’s mission is to develop and implement a long-term comprehensive
plan that will restore ecological health and improve water management for beneficial uses of the
Bay-Delta. In July 2003, the State of California formalized the cooperative effort by creating the
CALFED Bay-Delta Authority, a State agency responsible for overseeing implementation of the
Bay-Delta Program.
5

Central Valley Flood Protection Plan (CVFPP)
In 2012, the California Central Valley Flood Protection Board adopted the CVFPP, a
comprehensive new framework for system-wide flood management and flood risk reduction in
the Sacramento and San Joaquin River Basins.
Central Valley Integrated Flood Management Study (CVIFMS)
USACE, in conjunction with DWR, will jointly develop CVIFMS to define a long-range
program for the Sacramento and San Joaquin River Basins and the corresponding level of
Federal participation. This program will identify opportunities to reduce flood risk by improving
the flood capacity of the system while restoring and protecting floodplain and environmental
features including wetlands and other fish and wildlife habitat.
Sacramento River Bank Protection Program
This is a long-term program implemented to maintain the integrity of the Sacramento
River Flood Control Project from erosion. It provides protection to existing levee and flood
control facilities of the Sacramento River Flood Control Project.

1.5.2

Studies

American River Common Features General Re-evaluation Report
USACE and the Central Valley Flood Protection Board are conducting a comprehensive
study to investigate further improvements to the flood risk reduction system throughout the
Sacramento region. A draft report with a recommended plan for improvements is scheduled to
be released for public comment in 2014.
Delta Long-Term Management Strategy
USACE, DWR, the California Bay-Delta Authority, the Delta Protection Commission,
the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), and the Central Valley Regional Water
Quality Control Board (Central Valley RWQCB) are developing a long-term management
strategy for sediment management in the Delta, including dredging and dredged material
placement and reuse.
Dutch Slough Tidal Marsh Restoration Project
The study area, in an area formerly slated for urban development, will soon become
1,178 acres of critically needed habitat for fish and wildlife in the Sacramento-San Joaquin
Delta. The project's location in the western Delta offers the opportunity, soil types, and lack of
subsidence to create a large area of tidal marsh and complex intertidal channels favored by native
Delta species. Shaded channels, native grasslands, and riparian forests will be restored in the
6

upland portions of the site. The restored habitats are like those that historically dominated the
Delta, and their restoration is considered a critical action to increase numbers of native sensitive
species and improve general ecological health of the Delta. The public comment period for the
Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is January 21, 2014 through March 07, 2014.
Lower San Joaquin River Feasibility Study
USACE and the San Joaquin Area Flood Control Agency are conducting a study to
determine if there is a Federal interest in providing flood risk management and ecosystem
restoration improvements along the Lower San Joaquin River.
Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel Project
USACE and the Port of West Sacramento are conducting a study to investigate Federal
investment in providing for more efficient and safe commodity transport along the existing deep
draft navigation route extending from the Port of West Sacramento to New York Slough, thereby
affording the Port of West Sacramento access to San Francisco Bay Area harbors and the Pacific
Ocean.
San Francisco Bay to Stockton Navigation Improvement Project
USACE, the Port of Stockton, and Contra Costa County Water Agency are conducting a
study to evaluate the efficiency of the movement of goods along the existing deep draft
navigation route extending from the San Francisco Bay to the Port of Stockton. The project
includes the John F. Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channels.
USGS Subsidence Research on Twitchell Island
DWR and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) constructed approximately 15 acres of
wetlands in 1997 to evaluate land surface elevation changes and carbon accretion due to the
accumulation and decay of plant materials. Ongoing research at this facility has shown that land
surface elevation increases 1.3 to 2.2 inches per year, while surrounding areas used for
agricultural purposes lost elevation due to subsidence. Decaying organic matter can not only
eliminate subsidence but also reverse subsidence through utilization of appropriate land
management practices. Research is ongoing.
West Sacramento General Re-evaluation Report
USACE and the West Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency (WSAFCA), the nonFederal sponsor, propose to provide flood damage reduction to West Sacramento by repairing the
levees that surround the city. The draft EIS/EIR, which describes the environmental resources in
the project area; evaluates the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the three
alternative plans; and recommends avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures, is
scheduled to be available in 2014.

1.5.3

Projects

Antioch Dunes Restoration
Project being implemented by USFWS, CDFW, the Port of Stockton, and USACE to
benefit three endangered and endemic species—two plants and one butterfly. Material dredged
through annual operations and maintenance dredging is being placed in the project area to restore
dune habitat. Construction is underway and will continue for approximately ten years.
California State Water Project (SWP)
The California State Water Project is a water storage and delivery system of reservoirs,
aqueducts, power plants and pumping plants. Its main purpose is to store water and distribute it
to 29 urban and agricultural water suppliers in Northern California, the San Francisco Bay Area,
the San Joaquin Valley, the Central Coast, and Southern California. Of the contracted water
supply, 70 percent goes to urban users and 30 percent goes to agricultural users. The Project
makes deliveries to two-thirds of California's population. It is maintained and operated by the
DWR. The Project is also operated to improve water quality in the Delta, control Feather River
flood waters, provide recreation, and enhance fish and wildlife.
Central Valley Project (CVP)
The CVP is a Federal water management project in the state of California under the
supervision of Reclamation. It was devised in 1933 in order to provide irrigation and municipal
water to much of California's Central Valley—by regulating and storing water in reservoirs in
the water-rich northern half of the state, and transporting it to the water-poor San Joaquin Valley
and its surroundings by means of a series of canals, aqueducts and pump plants, some shared
with the California SWP. Many CVP water users are represented by the Central Valley Project
Water Association.
Donlon Island and Venice Cut Mitigation for the 1987 Widening and Deepening of
the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel
In 1987, USACE and the Port of Stockton completed widening and deepening the
Stockton DWSC. Dredging and other construction techniques resulted in the movement of
considerable volumes of dredged materials and some losses of existing marsh and riparian
vegetation. The final design of the project included features selected to mitigate for habitat
losses caused by the construction activities and to enhance fish and wildlife values beyond those
present before modification of the channel. Dredged materials were used to create
approximately 81 acres of new shallow water, wetland, and upland habitats within two flooded
islands, Donlon Island and Venice Cut Island. The resulting dredged-material islands were the
first created in the Delta specifically to benefit fish and wildlife. The newly created islands are
used by a wide variety of birds, and the number of species generally increased proportionally
with the extent and complexity of the habitats available. These findings have been translated
into design guidelines that can be used with increased confidence to design new habitat using
dredged material.
8

Sacramento River Flood Control Project, California
Congress directed the California Debris Commission in 1910 to prepare a flood
management plan for the Sacramento River system. The proposal incorporated the leveed
bypass concept, which became the basis of the present project. This major project was
authorized by the 1917 Flood Control Act and was sponsored by The Reclamation Board. The
Sacramento River Flood Control Project consists of a comprehensive system of 1,000 miles of
levees, 5 major overflow weirs, 2 sets of outfall gates, 3 major drainage pumping plants, 95 miles
of bypass floodways, overbank floodway areas, and channel enlargement in the lower reach of
the Sacramento River. The levees constructed during this project are known as “project levees.”

Lower San Joaquin River and Tributaries Project, California
The Lower San Joaquin River and Tributaries Project was authorized by the Flood
Control Act of 22 December 1944, Public Law 534, 78th Congress, 2nd Session, Section 10. The
project includes: (a) Federal levee and channel improvement and bank protection along the
Lower San Joaquin River from the mouth of the Merced River to the Delta; (b) the preservation
of natural overflow lands upstream of the mouth of the Merced River by the acquisition of
flowage easements by the State of California, and/or by the construction of levees at specified
locations by responsible local interests at no cost to the Federal Government; (c) Federal flood
control storage on the Stanislaus River at the New Melones site; (d) the provision of flood
control storage on the Tuolumne River by local interests with payment therefore by the United
States; and (e) operation of the existing Federal Friant Reservoir for flood control.

1.6

Public and Agency Scoping

On January 31 2013, USACE published a notice of intent (NOI) in the Federal Register
(Vol. 78, No. 921) to prepare an EIS. In February 2013, two scoping meetings were held for the
project study. The meetings were held to educate the public about the study efforts and to garner
input on the proposed scope, in accordance with NEPA. Refer to Table 1-1 for the USACE
planning and NEPA process.
The meetings were open-house style workshops in which attendees could read and view
the information about the two projects and interact with project staff, including representatives of
USACE and DWR.
The views expressed in the scoping meeting are summarized as follows:
•

Clarifications on data and history of the Delta

•

Concerns of siltation in Delta channels

•

Recommendation for coordination with other agencies and efforts in the Delta

9

•

Recommendation to evaluate environmental effects of alternatives to water supply,
water quality, and aquatic and terrestrial biology

For more detail on comments received, information available at the meetings, and a
summary of key issues that were raised, see Appendix A which contains a scoping report. A
similar open-house format will be used when this draft integrated feasibility report and EIS are
made available for public review and comment. USACE will ensure all agencies, organizations,
and individuals who provide comments will be provided a copy of the final integrated feasibility
report and EIS.

Report Organization

The planning process consists of six major steps: (1) Specification of water and related
land resources problems and opportunities; (2) Inventory, forecast and analysis of water and
related land resources conditions within the study area; (3) Formulation of alternative plans; (4)
10

Evaluation of the effects of the alternative plans; (5) Comparison of the alternative plans; and (6)
Selection of the recommended plan based upon the comparison of the alternative plans.
This report documents the study process. It also serves as the EIS for compliance with
NEPA. The chapter headings and analysis presented in this report generally follow the outline of
an EIS. The report chapters relate to the six steps of the planning process as follows:
•

The second chapter of this report, Need for and Objectives of Action, covers the first
step in the planning process (Specification of water and related land resources
problems and opportunities).

•

The third chapter of this report, Alternative Plans, is the heart of the report and is
therefore placed before the more detailed discussions of resources and effects. It
covers the third step in the planning process (Formulation of alternative plans), the
fifth step in the planning process (Comparison of alternative plans), and the sixth step
of the planning process (Selection of the recommended plan based upon the
comparison of the alternative plans). In addition, at the end of the chapter, a project
description is provided for the purposes of the NEPA analysis.

•

The fourth chapter of this report, Affected Environment, covers the second step of the
planning process (Inventory, forecast and analysis of water and related land resources
in the study area).

•

And, the fifth chapter of this report, Environmental Consequences, covers the fourth
step of the planning process (Evaluation of the effects of the alternative plans).

•

The remaining chapters of the report discuss: compliance with Federal laws and
executive orders (Chapter 6); public and agency involvement and review (Chapter 7);
the tentatively selected plan (Chapter 8); recommendations (Chapter 9); the list of
preparers (Chapter 10); references (Chapter 11); and an index to the report (chapter
12).

CHAPTER 2 – NEED FOR ACTION
2.1

Background

The Sacramento – San Joaquin Delta (Figure 1-1) is part of the largest estuary on the
West Coast of the United States; is home to hundreds of species of fish, birds, mammals and
reptiles; and is considered an ecosystem of national significance. Agricultural land irrigated by
Delta water contributes billions of dollars in production for the Nation. Two deep water ports in
the Delta serve as important marine terminals for dry bulk cargo vessels transporting agricultural
products through the Delta’s deep draft navigation channels to world markets. Delta levees
protect thousands of acres of orchards, farms, and vineyards as well as critical infrastructure
including state and interstate highways, major rail lines, natural gas fields, gas and fuel pipelines,
water conveyance infrastructure, drinking water pipelines, and numerous towns, businesses and
homes.
The Delta is a web of channels and reclaimed islands at the confluence of the
Sacramento, San Joaquin, Cosumnes, Mokelumne, and Calaveras Rivers. Forty percent of
California’s land area is contained within the watersheds of these rivers. The Delta covers about
738,000 acres and is interlaced with hundreds of miles of waterways. Much of the land is below
sea level and protected by a network of 1,100 miles of levees which have been constructed over
the past 150 years to manage the flow of water through the Delta. The land behind the levees is
predominantly agricultural (corn, wheat, vineyards, cattle) and waterways provide recreational
outlets for nearby urban areas and essential habitat for fish and wildlife, including Federally
listed species under the Endangered Species Act. The Delta is also the largest single source of
California’s water supply, providing 25 million Californians with drinking water and irrigating
millions of acres of farmland in the Central Valley. In addition, more than 500,000 people live
within the Delta and rely upon it for water, recreation, and livelihood. The majority of that
population is in the greater Sacramento and Stockton areas and is the focus of other USACE
FRM studies, though there are communities within the Delta. Several Delta towns, known as
“legacy communities,” are listed in the national registry of historic places.
Historically, the Delta was defined by tidal wetlands, primarily comprised of peat soils.
The Swamp and Overflow Land Act of 1850 transferred ownership of all Federally owned
swamp and overflow land, including Delta marshes, from the Federal Government to private
parties agreeing to drain the land and turn it to productive, presumably agricultural, use. This
Act began the reclamation of wetlands in the Delta through the construction of levees and
drainage channels, typically by the new land owners. The majority of levees in the Delta are still
privately owned and maintained. Nearly three fourths of the Delta is now in agriculture.

12

2.2

Problems and Opportunities

A problem is an existing undesirable condition to be changed. An opportunity is a
chance to create a future condition that is desirable. Within the context of solving the problems,
opportunities contribute to the overall beneficial outcome of the project. The difference between
problems and opportunities is often indistinct, but in both cases a changed future condition is
preferred. The purpose of this feasibility study is to develop an implementable and acceptable
plan to change the future condition and address specific water and related land resources
problems and opportunities in the Delta and Suisun Marsh.
Problems and opportunities to be addressed were identified in several ways. Based upon
a review of plan formulation efforts for the BDCP, the Delta Risk Management Study (DRMS),
the Delta Vision (Blue Ribbon Task Force), the CVFPP, USACE Special Study, USACE 180
Day Report to Congress, and other related state planning efforts, the PDT has identified two
general types of problems—Flood Risk and Ecological—and identified corresponding
opportunities and objectives. In order to understand – and display that understanding of – the
integrated nature of water resources in and related to the Delta, problems and opportunities
related to conveyance of water supply have been identified and will be qualitatively discussed as
they relate to flood risk and ER; however, these elements will not be considered in, nor drive
plan formulation for this study. Two Federal Deep Draft Navigation studies are also underway
within the study area and will be discussed as they relate to this study. In addition to the review
of the aforementioned references, several workshops and brainstorming meetings were held to
help define the existing conditions and identify problems and opportunities. Participants in these
meetings included:
•

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

•

California Department of Water Resources

•

Delta Stewardship Council

•

Delta Conservancy

•

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service

•

The problems and opportunities addressed in the feasibility study are defined in the
following sections.

2.2.1

Flooding Problems

Delta levees protect such critical infrastructure as state highways, rail lines, natural gas
fields, gas and fuel pipelines, drinking water pipelines, and numerous businesses and towns.
Delta inhabitants are primarily located on six islands, although portions of Sacramento and
Stockton are located in the Delta. Flood risk reduction for Sacramento and Stockton is the focus
of other USACE studies. These studies are being closely coordinated to ensure assumptions,
scopes, and alternative plans are compatible.
Problems associated with in-Delta flood risk are largely due to the potential for levee failure
and overtopping. These risks are increased as a result of climate change, sea level change,
subsidence (as much as 25 feet below sea level), and seismic risk. In particular:
•

Population centers [such as those at Walnut Grove (1,542), Isleton (804), Locke
(600), Courtland (355), Bethel Island (2,137), Hood (271), and Ryde (142)] and
surrounding agricultural lands are located in deep floodplain areas, the flooding of
which could result in loss of life and flood damages;

•

Highways 4, 12, 5, and 160, as well as major railroads, are located in deep
floodplain areas, the flooding of which could disrupt critical transportation routes
for people and goods, as well as emergency evacuation and response;

•

Critical infrastructure including aqueducts, natural gas transmissions, oil and gas
wells, and high power transmission lines are located in deep floodplain areas, the
flooding of which could cause damages and service disruptions.

About two thirds of the Delta levees were constructed without engineering specifications
and are non-Project levees, while only 385 miles of levees are part of the Sacramento River
Flood Control Project or the Lower San Joaquin River and Tributaries Project. Inherent
weaknesses in Delta levees and foundations, due to construction practices, encroachments,
abandoned pipes, and burrowing by various mammals, commonly result in seepage distress,
internal erosion, and occasional levee failure and island inundation. Many of the reclaimed
islands have subsided due to the oxidation and loss of peat soils and are now well below sea
level. Agricultural use in the Delta has contributed to soil erosion and oxidation of peat soils.
Oxidation of peat soils on a majority of Delta islands is causing levee foundations and the levees
to consolidate. This consolidation, along with interior island subsidence causes uneven settling
14

and further weakening of the levees. It is apparent by the frequency of historical flood events
(over 168 instances in the past 100 years) that the current levee system does not provide adequate
flood protection for the 500,000 people living behind Delta levees. A single island failure can
result in the “domino effect” of multi-island failures due to the extensive network of unstable
levees.
Focus of BDCP/Delta Plan
Additionally, flood risk problems currently exist that will be resolved through the
implementation of the BDCP/Delta Plan. These problems are described below to provide a
general understanding of the study area; however, this report will only qualitatively discuss these
problems and the likely solutions under consideration by others.
The impacts associated with failure of fragile Delta levees can reach beyond the
geographic extent of the Delta and disrupt the water supply for 25 million Californians reliant on
drinking water that passes through the Delta and billions of dollars of agricultural production that
is reliant on Delta waters. For example, a levee failure on one island can have a domino effect,
leading to the failure of levees on adjacent islands as the now subsided islands fill with water and
experience water loading on interior levee walls. Reclaimed islands and land tracts act as a
barrier between fresh and salt water, preventing sea waters from the San Francisco Bay and
Pacific Ocean from entering into the State and Federal Water Project intake structures. A multiisland failure could result in the saltwater contamination of water supplies and could take a year
to rectify. In particular:
•

Levee failure(s) in the Delta could compromise the quantity and quality of water
supplies for 25 million Californians as a result of the encroachment of saline waters
into the Southern Delta; and

•

Insufficient emergency response plans and resources for some areas in the Delta
could increase the duration of loss of water supplies for San Joaquin Valley and
Southern California in the event of multiple levee failures.

2.2.2

Ecosystem Problems

The Delta, an ecosystem of national significance, is a critical link in the Pacific Flyway, a
major north-south route of travel for migratory birds in America, and is protected through the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Natural resource specialists agree that the remaining
ecosystems in the Delta no longer maintain the functions and richness that defined the prechannelized system, and that the measures of ecological health will continue to decline without
preventive action. Not only is it certain that these natural systems will not recover their defining
attributes under current conditions, it is unlikely that even the current, degraded ecological
conditions can be sustained into the future. For example, Delta smelt, key indicators of
ecosystem health continue to decline in number throughout the watershed. Another example is
the decline in populations of salmonids; commercially, recreationally, and culturally important
fish species in the Delta.
15

There are numerous contributors to the ecological decline of Delta species and habitats,
each of which has the capability to produce adverse impacts independently and/or in
combination with other stressors. For example, pesticides, channelization, exotic and non-native
invasive species, water supply diversions, agricultural and urban runoff, and wastewater
discharges have all been identified as contributors of adverse impacts to the ecological health of
the Delta ecosystem. Specifically, channelization of rivers and streams through the construction
of levees has resulted in the widespread loss of tidal marsh, shaded riverine aquatic habitat, open
water habitat, and the disconnection of floodplains from waterways, which has greatly reduced
the amount of shallow, gently sloping near shore areas. If this loss of Delta habitats and
disconnection from floodplains continues, the current substantial declines in the Delta’s fisheries
could result in the extinction of culturally and economically critical species. Many of the
defining characteristics of the pre-channelized ecosystem (spatial extent, habitat heterogeneity,
and dynamic storage) have either been lost or substantially altered as a result of land use and
water management practices during the past 100 years in California. Nearly 95 percent of the
historic wetland habitat in the Delta has been converted to agricultural and urban uses.
The conversion of the Delta for urban and agricultural uses, including levee
construction, has resulted in:
•

Substantial loss (95%) and fragmentation of historic intertidal and
tidal habitat areas and linkages for native plants and wildlife,
including over 35 Federal and State listed Threatened and Endangered
species;
o Subsidence in the Delta and Suisun Marsh which can cause
significant adverse ecological impacts due to deeper
flooding;

•

Introduction and propagation of non-native invasive species;

•

Separation of historic floodplains from natural hydrologic flooding
events through channels within the Delta; and

•

Degraded water quality conditions from various stressors.

Focus of BDCP/Delta Plan
Additionally, ecological problems exist that will be resolved through the implementation
of the BDCP/Delta Plan. These problems are described below to provide a general
understanding of the study area; however, this report will only qualitatively discuss these
problems and the likely solutions under consideration by others. Solutions under consideration
by the BDCP/Delta Plan include a dual water conveyance system, which would create options
that would move water through the Delta’s interior or around the Delta through an isolated
conveyance facility (tunnel).

16

Current operation of the CVP and California SWP, as well as other export operations and
diversions that result in consumptive losses, supply water to 25 million Californians and 4.5
million acres of irrigated land. At the same time, these water resource operations can have a
damaging effect on the plants and animals inhabiting the Delta. For example, the operation of
pumping facilities is known to alter the flow patterns, affecting the migration of salmonids
passing through the river system. Delta smelt are drawn into the flow of water to the pumping
facilities and can be entrained, resulting in the mortality of this Federally-listed species. The
altered hydrology and operation of the State, Federal, and local water projects has resulted in:
•

Altered natural water flows through the Delta and to Suisun Marsh and San Francisco
Bay;

•

Mortality of native species in/adjacent to water control structures (primarily delta
smelt and salmonids);

•

Changes to timing, volume and/or distribution of water throughout the Delta which
has adversely affected the ecosystem and the habitat requirements of many native
species; and

•

Reduction in seasonal variability in the migration and concentrations of saline water.

2.2.3

Opportunities

The Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study provides an opportunity to:
•

Restore, enhance, preserve, create, and maintain aquatic, riparian, and adjacent
terrestrial habitats in the Delta for native plants and wildlife, including Federal and
State threatened, endangered, and special-status species, with the potential secondary
benefit to recreation

•

Manage invasive and non-native species for the benefit of native plant and wildlife
species, with the potential secondary benefit to recreation

•

Restore floodplain functions and contiguous habitat in the Delta

•

Reduce flood risk in the Delta to protect people, property, agriculture, habitat, and
infrastructure, with the potential secondary benefit to recreation and navigation

•

Address seismic and sea-level change risks to levees in the Delta that protect
population centers, highways, railroads, and critical infrastructure

•

Improve emergency management and response throughout the Delta

•

Incidentally, improve water quality in the Delta

•

Beneficially reuse available dredged materials

2.3

Federal and Sponsor Objectives

The Federal (USACE) and non-Federal sponsor (DWR) objectives for water resources
implementation studies establish the overall goals for the feasibility study. The specific
objectives for this feasibility study were derived from the identification of the study problems
and opportunities and are discussed in Section 2.4.
The Federal objective of water and related land resources planning is to contribute to
National Economic Development (NED) consistent with protecting the nation’s environment,
pursuant to national environmental statutes, applicable executive orders, and other Federal
planning requirements. Contributions to NED are increases in the net value of the national
output of goods and services, expressed in monetary units. Contributions to NED are the direct
net economic benefits that accrue in the planning area and the rest of the nation.
The USACE has added a second national objective for Ecosystem Restoration (ER) to
contribute to the Nation’s ecosystems (or National Ecosystem Restoration – NER) by restoring
degraded ecosystem structure, function, and dynamic processes to a less degraded, more natural
condition. Contributions to NER are increases in ecosystem value and productivity and are
measured in non-monetary units such as acres or linear feet of habitat, average annual habitat
units, or increased species number or diversity.
The DWR, as the non-Federal sponsor, has flood risk and ER objectives similar to the
national NED and NER objectives. Additionally, DWR has water supply objectives being
carried out by other related initiatives.

2.4

Planning Goals and Objectives

The planning objectives, which are developed specifically for this study, are statements
of the study purpose. Planning objectives are more specific than the Federal and non-Federal
objectives and reflect the problems and opportunities in the Delta Study area; an objective is
developed to address each of the identified problems and opportunities. Planning objectives
represent desired positive changes in the future without-project conditions. The planning
objectives for the Delta Study would be attained within the period of analysis for the study, a 50year timeframe beginning in 2018, pending identification of Federal interest and inclusion in a
selected plan. All of the objectives focus on activity within the study area.

18

Goal 1 - Restore sustainable ecosystem functions in the Delta.
•

Ecosystem Restoration Objective 1—Increase area, connectivity, and diversity of
native tidal and non-tidal aquatic, riparian, and related habitats within the study
area during the period of analysis.

Goal 2 - Improve flood risk management in the Delta.
•

Flood Risk Management Objective 1a – Reduce the consequences and annual
damages associated with flood risk in the study area during the period of analysis.

•

Flood Risk Management Objective 1b – Improve resiliency and reduce the
chance of loss of life and key infrastructure (transportation corridors, aqueducts,
pipelines/wells, etc.).

•

Flood Risk Management Objective 2 – Reduce risks to life loss within the study
area during the period of analysis, focusing on areas with the greatest potential life
loss impacts (such as areas with the greatest inundation).

The goal of the feasibility study is to develop a range of alternative plans that balance the
objectives and avoid conflicts or, where necessary, demonstrate the tradeoffs between conflicting
objectives, enabling decisions to be made. The Federal objective is to maximize net benefits.
Because of this, it is not appropriate to identify targets within objectives. For example, no target
level of flood risk, minimum acreage of habitat, or minimum habitat value was identified for the
project. Rather, the planning process includes formulation of alternative plans to maximize NED
and NER benefits relative to costs.

2.5

Planning Constraints

A constraint is a restriction that limits the extent of the planning process. It is a statement
of things the alternative plans should avoid. Constraints are designed to avoid undesirable
changes between without and with-project future conditions.
In the development of the alternatives, the following constraints were identified to direct plan
formulation efforts so that beneficial effects would be maximized and adverse effects would
be minimized:
•

Formulated alternatives and the recommended plan must not impede the
BDCP/Delta Plan; and

•

Formulated alternatives and the recommended plan must not be dependent upon
the BDCP/Delta Plan.

19

CHAPTER 3 – ALTERNATIVE PLANS

3.1

Plan Formulation Process

The formulation, evaluation, and comparison of alternative plans comprise the third,
fourth, and fifth steps of the USACE planning process. These steps are often referred to
collectively as plan formulation. Plan formulation is an iterative process that involves cycling
through the formulation, evaluation, and comparison steps several times to develop a reasonable
range of alternative plans and then narrow those plans down to a final array of feasible plans
from which a single plan can be identified for implementation.
Plan formulation for FRM and ER presents a challenge because alternative plans produce
both monetary and non-monetary benefits. Comparison of the trade-offs among alternative plans
is difficult because monetary and non-monetary benefits cannot be directly compared. To
facilitate the plan formulation process, the methodology outlined in the USACE Engineer
Circular 1105-2-404, “Planning Civil Work Projects Under the Environmental Operating
Principles,” 1 May 2003, was used. The steps in the methodology are summarized below:
•

Formulate and screen management measures (referred to hereafter simply as
measures) to achieve planning objectives and avoid planning constraints. Measures
are the building blocks of alternative plans.

•

Identify a primary project purpose. For this study, it is anticipated that ER will be
identified as the primary purpose. This is because there is strong interest by the
Federal and State governments in restoring this area, indicating that there is high
restoration potential. Also, based on previous studies, it is unlikely a feasible plan
can be developed for FRM only.

•

Formulate, evaluate, and compare an array of alternative plans to achieve the primary
purpose (ER) and identify a feasible plan that reasonably maximizes NER outputs
relative to costs. This plan is called the National Ecosystem Restoration plan.

•

Formulate and screen plans that achieve both ER and FRM (combined plans).

•

Evaluate and compare trade-offs among the combined plans and rank them. The
highest ranked combined plan is the plan that reasonably maximizes total net NER
and NED outputs.

•

Determine whether the highest ranked combined plan is justified; that is, whether the
benefits of the plan exceed the costs. If the highest ranked plan is not justified, move
to the next ranked plan. Continue to move down through the ranked plans until a
justified plan is identified. The highest ranked, justified, combined plan is the
NED/NER plan or the Combined Plan. If no combined plan is justified, the NER
plan shall be recommended for implementation, pending public review and
comments.

20

3.2

Planning Criteria

Planning criteria are used to formulate, screen, evaluate, and compare measures and
alternative plans. Four specific formulation criteria are required in USACE water resource
studies, as described in Planning Manual (Institute for Water Resources Report 96-R-21,
November 1996): completeness, effectiveness, efficiency, and acceptability. These criteria are
generally subjective and are useful in narrowing down the array of possible alternative plans.
With the exception of completeness, these criteria are also useful in screening potential
measures.
•

Completeness. Completeness is a determination of whether or not the plan includes
all elements necessary to achieve the objectives of the plan. It is an indication of the
degree that the outputs of the plan are dependent upon the actions of others. Plans
that depend upon the actions of others to achieve the desired output were dropped
from consideration.

•

Effectiveness. Effectiveness is the extent to which a measure or alternative plan
achieves the planning objectives. Measures or alternative plans that clearly make
little or no contribution to the planning objectives were dropped from consideration.

•

Efficiency. Efficiency is a measure of the cost effectiveness of the plan expressed in
net benefits. Benefits can be both monetary and non-monetary. Measures or
alternative plans that provided little benefit relative to cost were dropped from
consideration.

•

Acceptability. Acceptability is a measure of the ability to implement a measure or
alternative plan. In other words, acceptability means a measure or plan is technically,
environmentally, economically, and socially feasible. Unpopular plans are not
necessarily infeasible, just unpopular. Measures or plans that were clearly not
feasible were dropped from consideration.

Measures and plans that pass the screening criteria are evaluated and compared against
more specific evaluation criteria. Evaluation criteria are described later in this chapter.
Evaluation criteria can include costs, outputs, or effects and reflect the planning objectives or
constraints. Some or all of the evaluation criteria may be used at various stages in the plan
formulation process to compare alternative plans. Effective evaluation criteria must be
measurable and reveal differences or trade-offs between alternative plans.

3.3

Without-Project Future Conditions

Through the November 2009 Delta Reform Act, the State of California has established
“two coequal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting,
restoring, and enhancing the Delta ecosystem.” The Act also established the Delta Stewardship
Council as a new, independent state agency tasked with delineating how to meet these goals
through the development and implementation of the Delta Plan. The details of this plan are
being developed in a public process and will incorporate the BDCP process. Although still under
21

development, these large-scale plans will result in a vastly changed Delta system upon
implementation, posing a significant risk to this study regarding the uncertainty of future Delta
conditions. In order to reduce this risk, this study will include the BDCP/Delta Plan in the future
without project conditions to ensure that a recommended plan is successful if and when the
BDCP/Delta Plan is implemented.
The future without project condition will include all authorized and funded projects, as
well as the recommended plan from the BDCP/Delta Plan, as shown in Figure 3-1. For the
purposes of this study, it is assumed that the final BDCP/Delta Plan will be completed in 2014,
with implementation occurring 10 to 15 years after the final report. The assumptions regarding
this future scenario are:
•

50-year planning horizon for future conditions.

•

Include the large-scale BDCP/Delta Plan (preliminary draft released March 2013)
which would drastically alter the study area upon implementation.
o Dual conveyance system in place to convey water from the Sacramento River
to Clifton Court Forebay in the south Delta for transfer to the Central Valley
Project (Federal water management project) and the California State Water
Project. The proposed dual conveyance system includes the existing
operational through Delta pathway and a new alternative conveyance system
with three 3,000 cfs pumping stations. Existing through Delta pathway
(shown as the Armored Pathway in Figure 3-1) for water conveyance will
continue to be armored/improved through levee improvements funded through
DWR’s Delta Levees Maintenance Subventions Program and Delta Levees
Special Flood Control Projects.
o Mitigation, habitat conservation, and ecosystem restoration features are
implemented (145,000 acres to be implemented over 50 years) in the proposed
“restoration opportunity areas” shown in Figure 3-1.
o BDCP is being developed in compliance with the existing laws, biological
opinions, and regulations governing the management of salinity that balance
the sometimes conflicting salinity levels for the environment (with sometimes
conflicting needs of between endangered species such as Delta smelt and
salmonids), Delta water exports, and in-Delta water use/rights. Salinity
management will continue based on these existing laws, biological opinions,
and regulations.

•

Ecosystem functions will be improved by restoration and conservation efforts focused
along the perimeter of the Delta (BDCP/Delta Plan); however, system-wide
ecosystem dynamics will continue to be impaired, affecting:
o 47 special status species;
o Multiple essential fish habitat areas;
o Multiple critical habitat areas (Delta smelt, Winter and Spring run salmon,
Central Valley Steelhead, and Green Sturgeon);
22

o Migratory birds;
o Tidal, inter-tidal, and riparian wetlands; and
o Water quality.
•

Population centers within the Delta will remain at risk of flooding.

•

State and regional population growth will increase demands on Delta infrastructure
(i.e. transportation, power transmission, water conveyance); however, water
conveyance infrastructure will be improved through the implementation of the
BDCP/Delta Plan.

•

Development will continue to be limited by the Delta Protection Act.

•

Agricultural practices will continue.

•

Recovery from catastrophic failure of Delta levees will be undertaken by the State of
California, if necessary, to manage salinity for the environment and human use,
which will also protect the brackish Suisun Marsh. As described in DWR’s Delta
Flood Emergency Facilities Improvement Project, the State is working to ensure that
it has the appropriate infrastructure and supplies in the Delta to respond to and
recover quickly and effectively from major flood or earthquake disasters in the Delta.
Locations of storage and transfer sites for stockpiled flood fight materials are shown
in Figure 3-1 and include the follow features and actions:
o Establish two new material storage and transfer facility sites:


Stockton West Weber Avenue; and



Brannan Island State Park.

o Modify an existing material storage facility at Rio Vista.
o Establish new flood fight supply facilities at all three locations.
o Make site preparations to support Incident Command Posts at Stockton West
Weber Avenue and Brannan Island State Recreation Area.
o In addition to the 223,000 tons of quarry rock stockpiled by DWR at Rio Vista
and within the Port of Stockton, DWR would also stockpile up to 40,000 tons
of quarry rock material of variable gradations less than 24-inch-minus at
Stockton West Weber Avenue and Brannan Island, and 20,000 tons of sand in
Rio Vista for a total additional increment of 100,000 tons.

23

Figure 3-1. Future Without-Project Condition.

24

•

Flood risk in the Delta will persist, if not increase, notwithstanding ongoing
operations and maintenance activities and scattered flood risk management projects,
namely DWR’s Delta Levees Maintenance Subventions Program and Delta Levees
Special Flood Control Projects
o Probability for multiple levee failures from a seismic event will increase
o Subsidence of reclaimed lands will continue to separate water and land
elevations, further increasing the hydraulic load on Delta levees within dry,
leveed islands and tracts
o Seepage issues will continue
o Climate change will put additional stress on Delta levees 3


Mean water levels in the Delta will increase as sea level rises



Peak river inputs to the Delta will likely increase due to stronger
winter river flows, as well as possible increases in mean precipitation
rates and single-day precipitation amounts



In-Delta wind speeds may also increase, due to predicted increases in
the large-scale temperature and pressure gradients that drive these
flows

•

Subsidence will not occur on submerged lands, consistent with current conditions

•

Nonstructural flood risk management will continue through efforts of the Delta
Protection Commission, to include:
o Emergency preparedness and response planning
o Land use management to manage growth in Delta floodplains

3.4

Identification and Screening of Measures

A measure is a feature or an activity that can be implemented at a specific geographic site
to address one or more planning objectives. Table 3-1 lists the various general measures
identified for this study and identifies the individual objectives to which they contribute. 4
Measures are the building blocks that are grouped together to form alternative plans. The wide
variety of measures listed below was screened to determine whether each measure should be
retained for use in the formulation of alternative plans. Descriptions of the measures and the
decision to retain or drop each measure from further consideration are presented next.

3

Source: Delta Risk Management Strategy Climate Change Technical Memorandum, 2008
The U. S. House Report 108-357 (Conference Report accompanying the Energy and Water Development Appropriations
Act, 2004, P.L. 108-137) urged the Secretary of the Army to incorporate locally preferred options that provide protection
to agricultural lands and residential properties. Measures considered include such options.

4

25

These general measures were screened, as shown below, based on:
•

Opportunity for implementation under future without-project conditions;

•

Effectiveness at achieving an objective;

•

General efficiency; and

•

General acceptability.

3.4.1

Flood Risk Management

FRM measures primarily achieve FRM objectives in the study area, but may also
contribute to the ER objectives. FRM measures can be nonstructural or structural. Nonstructural
measures reduce flood damages without significantly altering the nature or extent of flooding.
Damage reduction from nonstructural measures is accomplished by changing the use made of the
floodplains, or by accommodating existing uses to the flood hazard. In contrast, structural
measures alter the nature or extent of flooding. Structural measures accomplish FRM by
modifying the magnitude, duration, extent, or timing of flooding. The general FRM measures
considered in this study are:
•

Protect Utility/Highway Corridor(s). Identify and reduce risk to a specific
area/corridor that contains the largest portion of utilities and highways in the study
area. This concept will be applied to other FRM measures through the evaluation
process. This measure will be further developed through economic analysis of levee
improvements. It is a reasonable measure for consideration to achieve FRM
objectives, and will be carried forward.

•

Levee Improvements. Reduce risk to life and assets through improvements to existing
levees. This is a reasonable measure for consideration and will be carried forward.

•

Ring Levees. Reduce risk to life and assets through construction of ring levees. This
is a reasonable measure for consideration and will be carried forward.

•

Emergency Response Planning and Coordination. Reduce risk to life loss through
emergency response planning and coordination. This is a reasonable measure for
consideration and will be carried forward.

•

Raise/Floodproof Communities. There is no opportunity for this measure as a method
of reducing flood damages due to the deep floodplains of the Delta. This measure
will be dropped from further consideration.

***** “Relocate Communities” and “Relocate Individual Structures” were screened out as this would be unacceptable because
communities and structures would have to be relocated outside the Delta, severely impacting Delta culture and historic value.

opportunity for these measures as a method of reducing flood damages due to the deep floodplains of the Delta.

27

•

Raise/Floodproof Individual Structures. There is no opportunity for this measure as a
method of reducing flood damages due to the deep floodplains of the Delta. This
measure will be dropped from further consideration.

•

Relocate Community. This measure is considered unacceptable because communities
would have to be relocated outside the Delta, as there are no flood-free areas within
the Delta. Additionally, it would not be possible to truly relocate entire communities,
but rather purchase estates and allow individual entities within the communities to
relocate to a location of their choosing. Delta communities would be disbanded and
scattered to various locations outside of the Delta. Implementation of this measure
would impact the preservation of Delta history and eliminate the culture of the Delta,
which has been proposed as a National Heritage Area. For these reasons, this
measure will be dropped from further consideration.

•

Relocate Individual Structures. This measure is considered unacceptable because
structures would have to be relocated outside the Delta, as there are no flood-free
areas within the Delta. Delta communities would be severely impacted and would
likely be disbanded and scattered to various locations outside of the Delta.
Implementation of this measure would impact the preservation of Delta history and
the culture of the Delta, which has been proposed as a National Heritage Area. For
these reasons, this measure will be dropped from further consideration.

•

Enhance Flood Risk Communication. Retained for further consideration. Due to the
large six county area, many agencies would be involved in a large scale response
effort. Opportunity may exist to improve the flood risk communication.

•

Reoperation and Transbasin Diversion. Reoperation of upstream reservoirs and
transbasin diversions in order to reduce flood risk. Although this measure would
likely reduce risk to the areas upstream of the tidal influence of the Delta, it would
not contribute to reducing flood risk to the largely tidal Delta. This measure does not
contribute to an objective and is therefore not effective. This measure will be
dropped from further consideration.

Criteria were established to further screen the specific measures based on reduced risk to
life loss, reduced annual damages, reduced infrastructure at risk, and if a measure was included
in BDCP/FWOP. Measures were qualitatively assessed and rankings of “High-Medium-Low”
were assigned based on professional judgment. These specific measures and criteria are shown
below in Table 3-2. An overall ranking of “High-Medium-Low” is indicated by the “GreenAmber-Red” color scheme, respectively. “High” ranking measures ranked “high” for at least
two criteria. “Medium” ranking measures ranked “medium” or “high” for at least one criterion.
No measures ranked as “Low” overall; therefore all measures were retained through this
screening process. Quantitative assessments will be refined as the study progresses.

Structural Flood Risk Management
Once general measures were screened for effectiveness, efficiency, and acceptability, the
remaining general measures were refined to a greater level of detail. Locations were identified
for consideration of application of measures based on the following.
Ratio of Total Inundation Repair Costs to Upgraded Levee Costs
To calculate the ratio of total inundation repair costs to upgraded levee costs, information
was taken from both phases of DWR’s Delta Risk Management Strategy (DRMS). The total
inundation repair costs values are from the DRMS Phase I Impact to Infrastructure Technical
Memorandum (IITM); these costs represent the repair cost for each asset on a particular Delta
island, based on inundation depths, the percent damage incurred, and the original value of the
asset. The assets considered in the IITM include: a) points assets: structures and buildings (and
their contents), bridges, marinas, natural gas fields/storage areas, natural gas wells, commercial
and industrial buildings, residences, and pump stations and b) linear assets: railroads, highways,
shipping channels, transmission lines, aqueducts, and gas and petroleum pipelines. Since
inundation repair costs are similar to the USACE concept of damages it was determined to be an
appropriate numerator value for a screening criterion ratio. The upgraded levee costs were taken
from DRMS Phase II report Upgraded Delta Levees (Section 4); these costs consist of upgrading
non-project Delta Levees to PL 84-99 or Urban Project Levee (UPL) standards. In DRMS,
levees protecting urban centers were selected for UPL upgrades and PL 84-99 upgrades were
assumed for all other areas. The higher the relative ratio of total inundation repair costs to
upgraded levee costs for a particular Delta island the higher the rating for this criterion.

29

Life Loss Risk
Life loss risk is based entirely on Delta island population data obtained from the DRMS
Economic Consequences Technical Memorandum (ECTM). Delta islands that have higher
populations were considered to have a greater potential for life safely issues and thus a higher
rating for this criterion.
Significance of Statewide Importance
A measure’s significance of statewide importance was determined qualitatively by using
the findings contained in contained in the ECTM. If a Delta island contained an asset that would
impact the region or state during and after a flood event, then that island was rated with a “Yes”,
otherwise the island was rated with a “NO.” The categories of statewide significance include:
deepwater ship channels, electric transmission lines, highways, natural gas transmission,
Mokelumne Aqueduct, oil and gas wells, railroads, wastewater facilities, eight western islands,
and legacy communities.
For criteria 1 and 2, each Delta island was assigned a rating of high, medium, or low. For
criterion 3, each island was given a rating of Yes or No. The location measures that were
assigned a “high” rating are generally populated areas with relatively higher economic values
and therefore are likely to be included in the final array of measures as a more comprehensive,
whole island levee improvement. The measures that were assigned a “medium” rating are
generally somewhat populated with more limited economic values and therefore are likely to be
included in the final array of measures as a more limited structural or non-structural solution.
The measures that were assigned a “low” rating are sparsely populated areas with limited to no
infrastructure/economic value and were therefore dropped from further considerations.
This qualitative assessment was based on existing data from the DRMS and is
summarized below in Table 3-3 and Figure 3-2. Developed by DWR and completed in two
phases, the overall purpose of the DRMS was to assess the performance of Delta and Suisun
Marsh levees and evaluate the economic, environmental, and public health and life loss
consequences of levee failures to California as a whole (Phase I); and to develop and evaluate
risk reduction strategies (Phase II). The DRMS was chosen because it is the only recent
comprehensive analysis on the local and statewide consequences of Delta levee failures.

Benefit-Cost Ratio Screening Analysis Criteria on the Focused Array
The three Delta Islands with the highest ratio of total asset repair costs to total
construction costs (from DRMS data) and not included in another current USACE study were
considered for further screening level benefit-cost analysis; the three islands include: Bethel
Island, Walnut Grove, and the City of Isleton (on Brannon-Andrus Island). Based on
suggestions from the local sponsor and its high population, a fourth island, Discovery Bay, was
also considered for further analysis.
The main analytical tool used to perform the economic analysis was the USACE
Hydrologic Engineering Center’s Flood Damage Analysis (HEC-FDA) software. This program
uses engineering data (hydrologic, hydraulic, and geotechnical) and economic data
(structure/content inventory and depth-percent damage curves) to model flooding risk
management problems and potential solutions in the study area. Through integration of the
engineering and economic relationships HEC-FDA computes expected annual damages (EAD)
and performance statistics. EAD is the metric used to describe the consequences of flooding on
an annual basis considering a full range of flood events – from high frequency/small events to
low frequency/large events over a long time horizon. Without project EAD by major damage
area are reported in Table 3-4. All costs are based on the Fiscal Year 2013 Federal water
resource discount rate of 3.75 percent.

Annual exceedance probability (AEP) is a statistic used to describe the chance of
flooding in any given year within a designated area. Annual exceedance probability is computed
in HEC-FDA using engineering data; AEPs for the four islands are reported in Table 3-5.

For this screening level analysis, there were no floodplains or other engineering data
developed for with-project conditions. To develop estimates for with-project damages, two
scenarios were considered: 1) zero with-project damages (or best case scenario), the USACE
project would yield no residual damages, and 2) 25 percent remaining damages (or a typical case
scenario); the USACE project would eliminate 75 percent of without-project damages. The zero
with-project damages scenario is the highest level of flood risk management performance any
USACE project could yield; whereas, the 25 percent remaining with-project damages are more in
line with the FRM performance of a typical USACE project. The with-project EAD for both
scenarios are reported in Tables 3-6 and 3-7.

Net benefits are determined as the difference between the annual benefits and the annual
costs. The net benefits and BCRs for each island and measure under both with-project scenarios
are shown in Table 3-11. All island measures have negative net benefit; also, there is no island
measure that has a BCR above unity; the highest BCR is 0.76 for the Isleton Measure A under
the zero percent remaining damages with-project scenario.

Structural FRM Summary
The four Delta islands that have the highest potential for structural Flood Risk
Management measures (based on the DRMS data) have negative net benefits and BCRs
significantly below unity (with the highest being 0.76). Considering these results, there is no
Federal Interest in structural Flood Risk Management in the Delta at this time based on
applicable costs, water resources discount rate, and USACE policy.
Nonstructural Flood Risk Management
Nonstructural measures retained through previous screenings include: emergency
response planning and coordination; and enhancements to flood risk communication.
Emergency response planning and coordination, as well as enhancements to flood risk
communication, are included in the future without project condition through ongoing actions by
DWR, the Delta Protection Commission, USACE, and other Federal, state, and local agencies to
develop preparedness plans, stockpile flood fight materials, and communicate flood risk through
public outreach. In addition to these valuable ongoing efforts, an opportunity may exist for
additional multi-agency response planning and public outreach. Advanced flood warning
systems should also be considered for the Delta, as very little warning time exists for much of the
region due to the nature of the isolated tidal levee systems and deep floodplains. The existing
USACE Floodplain Management Services (FPMS) authority could allow for Federal support in
implementation of these recommendations. For these reasons, these measures are provided as
general recommendations and will not be included in a recommended plan for action, as
sufficient authority exists to further explore these recommendations.

3.4.2

Ecosystem Restoration

Ecosystem restoration measures, described below, were developed to achieve ecosystem
restoration objectives in the study area 6. The ecosystem restoration measures address the critical
nature of the ecological health of the Delta, address the cause of habitat degradation, and reestablish some of the critical ecosystem structure and functions. Addressing habitat degradation
improves the overall ecosystem by reducing the negative stressors that have depleted the
ecosystem functions and will allow the natural processes to restore some ecosystem structure and
functions, improving the overall health of the ecosystem. Reviving ecosystem function typically
involves actively restoring key hydrologic and geomorphic processes through physical
modifications and reestablishing native vegetation to start the recovery process. The general
ecosystem restoration measures considered in the study were:
•

Restore native riparian habitat. Restoration of natural riparian habitat by active
means such as resloping banks, planting vegetation, or controlling invasive species.
In most, if not all cases, riparian habitat restoration would be connected to the levee
and would involve work within the levee prism. Due to the potential for significant

6

Due to the integrated nature of levees and habitat in the Delta, some ecosystem restoration measures may also incidentally
contribute to flood risk management objectives.

39

habitat gains from increased riparian habitat, this measure was retained for further
consideration.
•

Creation of new channels to connect habitat. Creating new channels would involve
dredging or otherwise creating new channels to improve stream connectivity and
resulting connections for aquatic and terrestrial species. Creation of new channels
would be connected to levees and would involve work within the levee prism. This
measure would be consistent with and improve the integrated nature of levees and
habitat in the Delta, therefore, this measure was retained for further consideration.

•

Invasive species management. This measure would include removal of non-native
plant species from existing or restored habitats. Generally, removal and continued
management of invasive species is costly and significant habitat gains are not realized
by this type of measure alone. Therefore, this measure will be dropped from further
consideration as a standalone measure, but the concept may be incorporated into other
restoration areas.

•

Restore in-channel islands and floodplains. This measure includes the reconnection
of floodplains to adjacent waterways through the partial or full removal of levees or
setting back of levees, along with re-sloping and contouring as necessary. Work
associated with this measure has the potential to realize significant habitat benefits.
Therefore, this measure was retained for further consideration by this study.

•

Restore historic marshes. This measure includes the creation of tidal and intertidal
marsh habitat to benefit native aquatic and terrestrial species. This measure is
included in the future without-project condition (which assumes BDCP
implementation) for areas throughout the Delta that are currently of the appropriate
elevation (range of depths) for this habitat type; therefore, little opportunity would
exist under the assumed future conditions to implement this measure without
incorporation of subsidence reversal. Additionally, opportunities may exist within
already flooded islands, most of which are currently deep water (as opposed to marsh)
due to subsidence that occurred prior to levee failure and subsequent flooding 7.
Subsidence reversal in conjunction with restoration of tidal and intertidal habitat
provides an opportunity for restoration of historic marshes in areas not considered for
BDCP implementation.

•

Salinity Management. This measure would alter salinity patterns through the
operation of a salinity control gate in the Delta or modifying upstream reservoir
operations. Salinity management currently occurs in the Delta through a complex
system of laws, biological opinions, and regulations that balance the sometimes
conflicting salinity requirements for the environment (with sometimes conflicting
needs between endangered species such as Delta smelt and salmonids), Delta water
exports, and in-Delta water use/rights. The BDCP is being developed in compliance
with the existing laws, biological opinions, and regulations governing salinity;
therefore, salinity management is included in the future without-project condition for
this study and will be dropped from further consideration.

7

Subsidence largely results from the oxidation of peat during dry conditions; therefore, subsidence does not occur on flooded
areas and/or submerged lands. Subsidence of flooded lands, as mentioned, occurred while those lands were dry/leveed.

40

•

Construct habitat friendly levees. This measure would include constructing or
modifying levees to include features such as benches for establishing native
vegetation. This measure could include setback levees or other measures. Due to the
connection between levees, floodplains, and associated habitat establishment, it was
determined that as a standalone measure, habitat friendly levees would not provide as
much ecosystem benefit as it would when combined with other measures. Therefore,
this measure will be dropped from further consideration as a standalone measure. It
will be incorporated into other restoration measures.

•

Setback levees (tidal/riparian). This measure would include constructing setback
levees that allow for tidal/riparian habitat to be restored in the area between the
existing levee and the setback levee. This measure may require landside levee
sloping and notching of the existing levee to allow for water to get to the restoration
area. This measure would require work within the levee prism, has potential to
provide incidental flood risk management benefits and achieve significant habitat
benefits. Therefore, this measure was retained for further consideration.

•

Controlled flooding of appropriate subsided islands. This measure includes
degrading/removing/notching levees to allow restoration of the floodplain. Due to
subsidence, flows would have to be managed in order to create habitat suitable for
native species and prevent fish strandings. This measure would require work within
the levee prism, has potential to be combined with flood risk management measures
and achieve significant habitat benefits. Therefore, this measure was retained for
further consideration.

•

Create bypasses. This measure includes creating bypasses with riparian and intertidal
habitats. Work may require levee modifications, removal, or minor channel
construction. This measure has a high potential for aquatic restoration benefits
associated with listed species for various life-stage functions. Therefore, this measure
was retained for further consideration.

Ecosystem Restoration Measures Developed in Detail
Measures that were carried forward through the initial screening process were refined to a
greater level of detail. Locations were identified for consideration of implementation of
measures based on the following criteria:
•

Geographic footprint must not coincide with restoration considered as part of the future
without-project condition (i.e., BDCP Restoration Areas were excluded from ecosystem
restoration analysis);

•

Favor areas in closer proximity to potential fill material necessary to restore elevations to
the appropriate range for habitat, when possible;

•

Favor areas where potentially less fill material would be required;

•

Avoid impacts to population centers and infrastructure (including islands in the western
Delta that are considered critical for salinity management – known as the “eight western
islands”); and
41

•

Favor areas which provide connectivity to existing habitat, when possible.

Figure 3-3 provides a geographic representation of the limitations these criteria pose on
the geographic extent of restoration considered.

Figure 3-3. Geographic Limitations of Opportunities for Ecosystem Restoration.
42

Once locations were identified, increments (or scales) of measures were developed, when
possible, in order to evaluate and determine the most cost effective scale of restoration necessary
to achieve the study objectives. Descriptions of these detailed ecosystem restoration measures
follow.
Restore Intertidal Habitat with Subsidence Reversal at Big Break (see Figure 3-4)
Restore habitat value to native species through subsidence reversal and subsequent
restoration of intertidal habitat in the flooded Big Break. This location was selected because it is
in close proximity to potential fill material, would likely require less fill material than other
locations in the vicinity, would have no impacts to population centers or infrastructure, and could
provide connectivity to existing habitat. Two scales of this measure were included for
evaluation:
•

Increment 1– The minimal restoration considered at Big Break would include 62
acres of tidal habitat restoration along the northern remnant levee adjacent to Jersey
Island. In-water placement of material would be required to increase elevations to
tidal range. Increment 1 is shown below in orange.

•

Increment 2 (purple) – The larger scale of restoration considered would include the
remaining 621 acres at Big Break. In-water placement of material would be required
to increase elevations to tidal range. Increment 2 is shown below in purple.

Figure 3-4. Big Break Measure.

43

Restore Intertidal Habitat with Subsidence Reversal at Little Franks Tract and
Franks Tract (see Figure 3-5)
Restore habitat value to native species through subsidence reversal and subsequent
restoration of intertidal habitat in the flooded Little Franks Tract and Franks Tract. This location
was selected because it is in close proximity to potential fill material, would likely require less
fill material than other locations in the vicinity, and would have no impacts to population centers
or infrastructure. Three scales of this measure were included for evaluation:
•

Increment 1 – The minimal restoration considered would include 319 acres of tidal
habitat restoration at Little Franks Tract. In-water placement of material would be
required to increase elevations to tidal range. Increment 1 is shown below in orange.

•

Increment 2 – The next larger scale of restoration considered would include 862 acres
along the remnant levee on the northern edge of Franks Tract. In-water placement of
material would be required to increase elevations to tidal range. Increment 2 is
shown below in purple.

•

Increment 3 – The largest scale of restoration considered would include the remaining

Restore Stream Connectivity and Riparian Habitat with Setback Levees at
Steamboat and Sutter Sloughs (see Figure 3-6)
Restore connectivity/habitat to improve channel margin habitat through floodplain
restoration including setback levee construction. This location was selected because it is in close
proximity to (likely more limited) potential fill material, could require less fill material than
other locations in the vicinity, and would have limited impacts to population centers or
infrastructure. Four scales of this sub-measure were included for evaluation:
•

Increment 1 – The minimal restoration considered at Steamboat and Sutter Sloughs
would include 0.4 miles of setback levee on the northern most tip (at the southern
extent of the Elk Slough restoration) of Sutter Island to improve connectivity between
Sutter and Steamboat Sloughs and the Sacramento River through the restoration of 66
acres of riparian habitat. Increment 1 is shown below in orange.

•

Increment 2a – This configuration of the next larger scale of restoration would
include the adjacent 1,967 acres of Sutter Island (extending from the north to just
south of Miner Slough), 732 acres on the southern tip of Netherlands (on the north
bank of Miner Slough), and 1,217 acres on the northern tip of Ryer Island (on the
south bank of Miner Slough). This 3,916 acre increment would connect the Elk
Slough restoration to Steamboat Slough and Miner Slough, as well as existing and
planned habitat areas on Prospect Island. This increment would require a 0.6 mile
setback levee across Sutter Island, a 2.1 mile levee across the southern tip of
Netherlands, and a 1.9 mile setback levee on the northern tip of Ryer Island.
Increment 2a is shown below in purple hatch.

•

Increment 2b – This configuration of the next larger scale of restoration would
include all of Sutter Island (an additional 2,449 acres in addition to the 66 acres in
Increment 1), as well as a 956 acre corridor (approximately 1,000 ft wide) along
Steamboat Slough on Ryer Island requiring 7 miles of setback levee. This 3,405 acre
increment would connect the Elk Slough restoration to Steamboat Slough and the
Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel at their confluence with the Sacramento River,
restoring a corridor which could serve as an alternative migratory pathway for
endangered salmon and Delta smelt. Increment 2b is shown below in purple hatch.

•

Increment 3 – The maximum restoration considered would be implemented in
conjunction with Increment 2b and would increase the restoration corridor on Ryer
Island by 2,197 acres, requiring a 5.6 mile of setback levee. Additionally, 2,251 acres
would be restored on the opposite bank of Steamboat Slough on Grand Island,
requiring a 6.6 mile setback levee. This 4,448 acre increment would provide
additional acres of restored habitat and connect the restoration to existing and planned
restoration on the southwest tip of Grand Island at the confluence of the Sacramento
River. Increment 3 is shown below in blue.

Restore Riparian/Intertidal Habitat, Floodplain Access, and Subsidence Reversal
along the South Mokolumne River (see Figure 3-7)
Increase floodplain connectivity through the use of gates or setback levees. This location
was selected because it would have limited impacts to population centers or infrastructure and
could provide connectivity to existing habitat. Four scales of this measure were included for
evaluation:
•

Increment 1 – The minimum restoration considered for this measure includes 3,530
acres of riparian/intertidal habitat along the South Mokelumne River, requiring 7.3
miles of setback levees on four tracts. This increment would extend other existing
and planned adjacent habitat areas to the north (Cosumnes Preserve, McCormackWilliamson Tract, Staten Island, and other BDCP proposed habitat areas). Increment
1 is shown below in orange. Portions of the following tracts would be included in
this increment:
o New Hope Tract – 563 acres of riparian/intertidal habitat, 2.4 miles of setback
levee.
o Canal Ranch – 868 acres of riparian/intertidal habitat, 2 miles of setback
levee.
o Brack Tract – 1216 acres of riparian/intertidal habitat, 1.4 miles of setback
levee.
o Terminous Tract – 883 acres of riparian/intertidal habitat, 1.5 miles of setback
levee.

•

Increment 2 – The next increment under consideration would extend Increment 1
south toward the San Joaquin River and would add an additional 1,217 acres of
riparian/intertidal habitat, requiring 3.7 miles of three setback levees on two tracts.
Two separate setback levees would be constructed on Terminous Tract. The eastern
Terminous Tract habitat area would span 118 acres and would require a 0.5 mile
setback levee. The southern Terminous Tract habitat area would encompass 471
acres and would require a 1.3 mile setback levee. The third habitat area in this
increment includes the 628 acres on the eastern most portion of Empire Tract and
would require a 1.9 mile setback levee. Increment 2 is shown below in purple.

Restore Riparian/Intertidal Habitat and Floodplain Access with Subsidence
Reversal at Medford Tract (see Figure 3-8)
Increase floodplain habitat through subsidence reversal and subsequent restoration of
riparian and intertidal habitat. This location was selected because it is in relatively close
proximity to potential fill material, would have limited impacts to population centers or
infrastructure, and could provide connectivity to existing habitat. Two scales of this measure
were included for evaluation:
•

Increment 1 – The minimum restoration considered for this measure includes 14 acres
of subsidence reversal and subsequent restoration of intertidal and riparian habitat on
the southeastern portion of Medford Island surrounded by an existing mitigation
habitat area/preserve (approximately 200 acres). Increment 1 is shown below in
orange.

•

Increment 2 – The maximum restoration considered for this measure would include
subsidence reversal and subsequent restoration of intertidal and riparian habitat on an
additional 664 acres of Medford Island. This increment would restore Medford
Island in its entirety, as approximately 512 acres of the island have already been
restored through mitigation efforts. Increment 2 is shown below in purple.

Additional Ecosystem Restoration Measures Considered
The following site-specific measure were considered, but dropped from further
evaluation for the reasons noted.
•

Restore Stream Connectivity and Riparian Habitat with Setback Levees at Elk Slough.
Restore connectivity/habitat to improve channel margin habitat through floodplain
restoration including setback levee construction. Upon investigation, it was
determined that this action is currently under consideration in the BDCP and is
therefore part of the future-without project condition. For this reason, it was dropped
from further consideration.

•

Restore Floodplain/Bypass at Paradise Cut. Widen access to floodplain to increase
capacity and improve hydraulic conditions to benefit native species (consideration
must be taken to avoid migration of fish into State and Federal Water Projects due to
the proximity to these facilities). Upon investigation, it was determined that this
action is currently under consideration in the BDCP and is therefore part of the
future-without project condition. For this reason, it was dropped from further
consideration.

•

Creation of Bypass at Prospect Island. Increase floodplain connectivity through the
use of gates or setback levees. Upon investigation, it was determined that this action
is currently under consideration in the BDCP and is therefore part of the futurewithout project condition. For this reason, it was dropped from further consideration.

•

Restore Intertidal/Riparian Habitat, Floodplain Access, and Subsidence Reversal at
Staten Island: Mokolumne River. Increase floodplain connectivity through the use of
gates or setback levees. Upon investigation, it was determined that this action is
currently under consideration in the BDCP and is therefore part of the future-without
project condition. For this reason, it was dropped from further consideration.

•

Restore Intertidal/Riparian Habitat, Floodplain Access, and Subsidence Reversal at 8
Western Islands. Increase floodplain connectivity through the use of gates or setback
levees. Although this general measure would contribute to the ecosystem restoration
objective, this particular location was discussed due to its importance to the water
delivery system rather than ecosystem restoration objectives. Other areas were
identified for more suitable application of this general measure. For this reason, this
site-specific measure was dropped from further consideration.

•

North Delta Bypass: Glide District and Netherlands. Increase floodplain
connectivity through the use of gates or setback levees to connect the shortest reach
of landscape between the Sacramento River and the Yolo Bypass and include
crossing the Sacramento Deepwater Ship Channel. The weir on the Sacramento This
measure could provide flood risk benefits for the city of West Sacramento, the Pocket
area and Sacramento downtown, and potentially Clarksburg, Hood, Courtland,
Walnut Grove, Ryde, and Isleton on the Sacramento River downstream of the bypass
and would provide additional access and connectivity to the floodplains of Yolo
Bypass under specific flood conditions. Although this measure could contribute to
the ecosystem restoration objective under certain operation criteria, the primary
50

formulation objective would be for flood risk management for areas outside of the
study area. For this reason, this site-specific measure was dropped from further
consideration.
Screening of Ecosystem Restoration Measures
In order to ensure that only implementable measures with a reasonable chance of
achieving a significant increase in habitat value at a reasonable cost were included in the final
array of alternatives, criteria were established to further screen these detailed measures. The
criteria used to screen detailed ecosystem restoration measures are described below:
•

Land Availability Concerns. Due to high value agricultural crops, competing land
uses and interests in the Delta, and the ongoing land issues associated with the BDCP
project, land availability is a major concern for implementing ecosystem restoration.
Some areas have been in agriculture for generations, with the owners having no
interest in selling even a portion of the land. Short of exercising eminent domain,
these lands will not be available in the foreseeable future. Use of eminent domain to
acquire large areas of private land for single-purpose ecosystem restoration that could
be implemented elsewhere is generally not considered to be acceptable. Additionally,
there are some very high value crops (i.e. vineyards) that would be cost prohibitive
even if there were willing sellers. Other lands have greater opportunity, such as those
with potentially willing sellers, public ownership, or limited current usage (flooded
areas). A qualitative risk ranking of High (not likely to have a willing seller),
Medium (likely to have a willing seller), or Low (public/state ownership) has been
assigned to each measure based on input from non-Federal sponsor staff with
extensive experience concerning Delta land acquisition and availability.

•

Likely Effects to Water Rights. For any of the measures that involve diverting water
or creating fish passage facilities or setback levees, an evaluation of water rights will
be required for any additional water that would be needed during the non-flood
season. Most of the water in the Sacramento River is either Federal Central Valley
Project (CVP) water or State Water Project (SWP) water and there may not be “extra”
water from the river for restoration or fish passage purposes.

•

Impacts to Existing Habitat. In order to implement restoration, modifications to the
existing habitats would likely occur. In some cases, there is some good to high
quality habitat along the slough’s edge that could be adversely impacted through the
restoration activities. In order to avoid these impacts, a qualitative ranking of High
(likely to adversely impact existing habitat), Medium (may adversely impact existing
habitat), or Low (not likely to adversely impact existing habitat) has been assigned to
each measure based general information about the sites and input from the nonFederal sponsor.

•

Gross Relative Real Estate Cost. Purchase of the lands is likely to be a big driver in
the cost of restoration. In order to avoid unrealistic areas for restoration, a general
ranking of High (purchase of private lands with likely exponentially higher costs),
Medium (purchase of private lands required), or Low (public/state ownership of
51

lands) has been assigned to each measure based on general land use information and
input from the non-Federal sponsor.
•

Gross Relative Construction Cost. Construction costs vary greatly between the
measures under consideration, largely driven by the necessity of setback levees at
some locations. In order to screen out measures that would have exponentially higher
construction costs for similar benefits, parametric cost estimates were developed for
each measure. Costs included active restoration costs and levee construction costs, as
these were anticipated to be the drivers in relative costs per acre (other costs were
anticipated to be relatively similar for each site). A summary of these parametric cost
estimates is shown in Table 3-12.

•

Likely to Require Mitigation for Flood Impacts. Changes to the system hydraulics
would likely result from some ecosystem restoration measures under consideration.
Some measures would have a higher likelihood of resulting in upstream or
downstream impacts that would require hydraulic mitigation that could increase costs
without providing additional ecosystem restoration benefits. In order to screen out
measures that would most likely have high hydraulic mitigation costs for similar
benefits, a general ranking of High (extensive levee work likely required), Medium
(some levee work likely required), or Low (not likely to require hydraulic mitigation)
has been assigned to each measure based general information about the site.

Final Ecosystem Restoration Measures
The ecosystem restoration measures that were retained through all screenings include:
restore intertidal habitat with subsidence reversal at Big Break, Franks Tract, and Little Franks
Tract. Detailed descriptions and final increments of these measures follow.
Prior to levee construction in the 19th Century, Big Break, Franks Tract, and Little
Franks Tract were comprised of intertidal marsh. Levees were constructed to drain the lands for
agricultural use, resulting in subsidence of the land surface due to compaction, oxidation, and
wind erosion. Levee failure occurred in the early to mid 20th Century and these areas were not
reclaimed; however, enough subsidence had already occurred that these open water expanses
now function ecologically as lakes, providing no value to native species.
The primary action required to restore habitat value to native species at Big Break,
Frank’s Tract, and Little Franks Tract is subsidence reversal. Similar restoration actions were
undertaken by USACE in the 1990s at nearby Venice Cut and Donlon Island. This restoration
has demonstrated that subsidence reversal to restore land surface to intertidal elevations, along
with minimal plantings, can result in successful restoration of intertidal marsh with 80 percent
vegetation coverage within 2 years. Measures considered at Big Break, Franks Tract, and Little
Franks Tract are based on the success of these reference sites.
Subsidence Reversal
Studies conducted on reference sites at Donlon and Venice Cut Islands indicate that
optimum marsh wren habitat (i.e., where vegetative cover is greater than 75 percent) is found at
elevations ranging from approximately 2.8 to 4.8 feet. Therefore, using a conservative approach
for estimating quantity of fill, a target elevation of 4.5 feet was used to estimate fill quantities.
While target elevations are consistent between the sites, current elevations vary from site
to site, resulting in differing requirements for volume of material per acre. Intertidal marsh
restoration at Big Break (1,064 acres of marsh with an additional 15 percent of open water)
would require 12.7 million cubic yards of material, or 9,400 cubic yards of material per acre.
Intertidal marsh restoration at Franks Tracts (2,470 acres of marsh with an additional 15 percent
of open water) would require 42.6 million cubic yards of material, or 17,200 cubic yards of
material per acre. Intertidal marsh restoration at Little Franks Tracts (273 acres of marsh with an
additional 15 percent of open water) would require 4.6 million cubic yards of material, or 16,800
cubic yards of material per acre.
Increments were developed for each site based on availability and proximity of fill
material, as this is the primary driver in restoring ecological function and the primary driver of
cost. Based on monitoring results from the Donlon Island and Venice Cut reference sites, it is
expected that placement of fill material to the appropriate elevations, followed by minimal
plantings of rushes will be the only required actions to restore intertidal marsh. As elevations are
relatively constant within each site, calculations were made to determine the volume of fill
needed per acre at each site. Volumes of available material were matched to the most efficient
potential site. Potential sources of material include:
55

•

Direct placement from Operations and Maintenance dredging of the Stockton Deep
Water Ship Channel – assumes normal hydraulic dredging operations with suspended
material directly placed into the restoration area(s) via pipeline and contained in an
enclosed area surrounded by either existing high ground (remnant levees) or
sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to allow suspended material to settle and water
to filter through the silt curtains prior to exiting the site back into the waterways;

•

Pumping previously dredged material from nearby stockpiles – utilize previously
dredged material in nearby stockpiles by creating a slurry that can be pumped into the
restoration area(s) via pipeline and contained in an enclosed area surrounded by either
existing high ground (remnant levees) or sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to
allow suspended material to settle and water to filter through the silt curtains prior to
exiting the site back into the waterways; and

•

Trucking and/or barging material from borrow sites within a 30 mile radius – truck
and/or barge material from borrow sites within a 30 mile radius and place material
into the restoration area(s) either directly from trucks (where possible) or via
excavators on barges into an enclosed area surrounded by either existing high ground
(remnant levees) or sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to allow suspended material
to settle and water to filter through the silt curtains prior to exiting the site back into
the waterways.

Vegetation
Soil material will be transported to the site as described above and placed to bring the
tract soil depth to a target elevation of 4.5 feet mean sea level. This area will be conducive to
aquatic vegetation and anchored to the adjacent existing levee. The planting design includes
planting bulrush (Typha sp.) over the area and will be suitable to develop intertidal marsh
habitat. Plantings will be installed at 3 feet on center over 10 percent of the intertidal marsh area.
The plant material may be nursery grown, or collected from nearby sources and directly planted
at the site. It is anticipated that cattails will self-propagate on site. Additionally, 25 acres of the
adjacent existing levee will be treated to remove weed species, such as, Himalayan blackberry,
pampas grass, pepper weed, etc.
Increments
Increments of restoration at each site were developed based on an acre grid system.
Available fill material calculations were used to determine the size of increments, i.e., how many
grid cells each increment included. It should be noted that the first increments at each site are
relatively small, with a large increment for the remainder of the site. This sizing is a product of
cost breakpoints associated with available fill material. The smaller increments were developed
based on available material that could be transported to the site without major modifications (i.e.,
construction of a bridge, multiple transfers between trucks and barges, etc.). The larger
increment includes the remainder of each site for which a more efficient source of available
material could not be identified. Locations of increments are general within each site and are
based on proximity to fill material, proximity to remnant levees for improved constructability,
56

and connectivity to existing habitat. Figures 3-9 through 3-11 show increments and available fill
material. Table 3-14 provides a summary of all final increments/measures under consideration.

Preliminary Costs
The overall strategy for generating preliminary costs was to utilize historical construction
methodologies and current day prices for labor, equipment and materials. There are several
important assumptions that were used to create the costs and generally serve to create a less
conservative estimate of the cost, but are reasonably accepted to be true. The most influential
assumptions are related to direct placement dredging: all costs associated with direct placement
alternatives up to a distance of 15,000 feet of dredged material pumping are excluded from the
cost estimate and will be funded by Federal Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funds (assume
100,000 CY per year O&M dredging direct placement), and that the likelihood of a significant
cost increase for any potential environmental mitigation due to this feature of work is low.
The highest level of risk from these assumptions lies in the assumed low likelihood of
any potential environmental mitigation costs because of the sensitivity of the Delta to the
turbidity that these construction techniques have the potential to cause. It is assumed that the
deployment of stacked hay bales, or similar technology, will be sufficient and cost effective at
the point of placement to prevent a significant increase in environmental mitigation costs. Direct
Placement dredging relative to the O&M measures are not stand alone projects and require full
cooperation and partnership with other programs or projects.
The second most influential assumption is that moving the discharge point is the only
practical means of placing slurried fine-grain material. Limited leveling of sand mounds at
discharge points may be required if fine sands are also present in the material. Essentially, this
reduces the scope of the earthwork to outflow pipe management. These assumptions reduce the
exposure to costs for all in water placement through pumping outflow and are considered
conservative based upon PDT discussion. A relatively low contingency of 25% was used until
an abbreviated cost risk analysis can be conducted, but again is considered reasonable due to the
low complexity of the project's features of work.
The highest risk to cost increases lies in trucking/barging material sourcing and the
environmental mitigation for pumping from existing dredged material storage sites.
Trucking/barging material sourcing is thought to be feasible for the 55+ Million CY within a 30
aerial mile radius with more weight given to the sites farther away due to typical Delta soil
conditions. This will raise the weighted average contingency for increments utilizing
trucking/barging, but these increments are already cost prohibitive.
For environmental mitigation, the hay bale/silt curtain method is not a complicated
methodology, but in the tidal conditions, even the assumed robust cross sectional design may not
be able to withstand the tidal forces and require an even more robust and costly mitigation plan.
Fortunately, the cost of environmental mitigation is 4 to 10% of the total project cost, depending
on the dredge/pumping increment and will not prohibitively alter the “per acre” cost or the
weighted contingency.

61

The construction methodologies used to generate the cost estimate follow standard
industry practices for standard wet and dry earthwork conditions. Earthwork crews were
developed in MCACES MII with production quantities pulled from the Cost Engineering Section
ProdQuant.xls spreadsheet. The dry earthwork techniques rely primarily on heavy earthmoving
equipment including: Dozers, scrapers and hydraulic excavators. Pumping costs were generated
from an MCACES MII model refined with bid information from multiple contractor proposals
for similar work in the immediate area. Pumping techniques require pipes to be laid over land
and secured to the river channel bottom as needed to maintain the most direct, cost efficient and
low environmental and local impact. The material source sites placing at Big Break are assumed
to be dependent on the McCormick dredged material storage site pumping operation in order to
create cost savings by utilizing McCormick's infrastructure following completion of its pumping
operation. The outflow of the pipe is considered mobile and would be repositioned regularly in
order to spread materials throughout the site. Some leveling of deposited material may be
required.

Formulation of Alternatives

The array of alternatives was formulated for the single purpose of Ecosystem
Restoration, with the incorporation of non-structural Flood Risk Management measures
into all alternatives to address Flood Risk Management Objective 2, reduce risk to life
loss. The following guiding Plan Formulation principles were used in development of
alternatives:
•

Use a systems context

•

Adopt a watershed perspective

•

Avoid the need for mitigation

•

Keep land acquisition to a minimum

•

Federal participation in monitoring and adaptive management consistent with
Federal law and USACE policy. (Section 2039, WRDA 2007 requires
monitoring to determine ecological success and allows for up to 10 years of
Federal cost-sharing for monitoring.)

3.5.1

Ecosystem Restoration Alternative Formulation

USACE Institute for Water Resources (IWR) Planning Suite was used to
formulate alternatives based on the final increments/measures. Increments/measures
were developed and screened such that all measures meet planning objectives and avoid
planning constraints. Cost effectiveness and incremental cost analyses (CE/ICA) were
performed and generated 11 Best Buy Plans (alternatives) in addition to the no action
alternative:
Alternative 1 is the no action plan and assumes no action is taken as the result of
this study.
Alternative 2 includes only increment 1 at Big Break, which would result in 42
acres of restored intertidal marsh habitat, requiring 500,000 cubic yards of fill material
which would be placed via direct placement of dredged material from yearly Operations
and Maintenance dredging from the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel for a period of
five years. The total cost of this alternative is $5.4 million.
Alternative 3 includes increments 1 and 2 at Big Break, which would result in 52
acres of restored intertidal marsh habitat, requiring 624,000 cubic yards of fill material
which would be placed via direct placement of dredged material from yearly Operations
and Maintenance dredging from the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel for a period of
five years and via pumping of previously dredged material from the McCormick
placement site. The total cost of this alternative is $8.8 million.

64

Alternative 4 includes increments 1, 2, and 3 at Big Break, which would result in

and Maintenance dredging from the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel for a period of
five years and via pumping of previously dredged material from the McCormick and
Scour placement sites. The total cost of this alternative is $14.7 million.
Alternative 5 includes increments 1, 2, 3, and 5 at Big Break, which would result
in 80 acres of restored intertidal marsh habitat, requiring 959,000 cubic yards of fill
material which would be placed via direct placement of dredged material from yearly

Evaluation of Final Array of Alternative Plans

A standard Habitat Evaluation Procedure (HEP) was used to quantify outputs for
the CE/ICA. The Habitat Suitability Model for the Marsh Wren was used to assess
outputs of each alternative. The marsh wren requires emergent herbaceous vegetation,
typically cattails and bulrushes for nesting and cover in water greater than 15 centimeters.
The intertidal marsh habitat being proposed would meet typical marsh wren requirements
and is a scarce habitat type within the Delta. This model was selected because it is an
approved bluebook model that has been used in other projects in the area, is focused on
the target habitat type, and has been coordinated with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Model assumptions were developed as the basis for the assessment. The
assumption regarding existing and future without-project conditions is that little to no
intertidal marsh habitat is or will be present at the sites; therefore, AAHU with-project
are projected at 0. The future with-project assumption is that elevations are restored to
support a robust intertidal marsh habitat. HEP outputs are shown in Table 3-17.

Comparison of Alternative Plans

3.7.1

Cost Effectiveness and Incremental Cost Analysis

Alternatives were compared based on costs and outputs, as well as other criteria
such as contribution to planning objectives, environmental factors, completeness,
effectiveness, efficiency, and acceptability were relatively consistent between
alternatives. This comparison was made using IWR Planning Suite to conduct cost
effectiveness and incremental cost analysis based on costs (dollars) and outputs (marsh
wren AAHU). Incremental costs per unit of output were used to identify major
breakpoints in cost efficiency among the alternatives. These outputs are shown in Table
3-18 and Figures 3-12 and 3-13:

3.7.2

Contribution of Alternatives to Planning Objectives

All 11 action alternatives achieve the first ecosystem restoration planning
objective of increasing area, connectivity, and diversity of native tidal aquatic and related
habitats within the study area during the period of analysis. None of the alternatives
achieve the second objective, which was to increase area, connectivity, and diversity of
non-tidal or riparian habitats, as an effective opportunity did not exist under the assumed
future without-project condition. The extent to which alternatives increase area of tidal
habitat is the discriminating factor between alternatives. Historically, the Delta was
comprised almost entirely of about 350,000 acres of tidal marsh, yet less than 5 percent
of this remains. Any contribution to restoring tidal habitat would be seen as beneficial in
this ecosystem of national significance. Although more habitat area would be viewed as
better from an ecological perspective, the extent of Federal investment will be driven by
incremental costs necessary to achieve those additional outputs.

70

3.8

Tentatively Selected Plan

A recommendation for plan selection was made by identifying the plan that
reasonably maximizes environmental outputs relative to costs while meeting planning
objectives and avoiding planning constraints. As all alternatives are cost effective, every
alternative achieves the greatest number of outputs for a given cost; therefore,
incremental costs per output were used to identify the NER Plan.
Outputs increase as alternatives progress (1-12); however, these outputs are
achieved at increasingly higher incremental costs. Breaks in incremental cost are found
at Alternatives 2, 6, 8, and 12; therefore, these alternatives were identified as the most
logical candidates for plan selection. The incremental cost increase from Alternative 2 to
Alternative 6 is $244,000, but this cost increase is accompanied by an increase in AAHU
outputs from 42 to 88, more than doubling the outputs. The incremental cost increase
from Alternative 6 to Alternative 8 is similar at $299,000, yet this cost increase is only
accompanied by an increase in AAHU outputs from 88 to 93. The incremental cost
increase from Alternative 8 to Alternative 12 is $1,849,000, which was determined to be
unreasonable for the outputs achieved. For these reasons, Alternative 6 is recommended
for plan selection and is shown in Figure 3-14.
Alternative 6 is the most reasonably efficient contribution to the California Delta,
an ecosystem of national significance, restoring 89.5 acres of intertidal marsh habitat at a
cost of $22 Million. Millions of Federal dollars have been spent in recent decades to
study the Delta, yet very little restoration has occurred. This plan would allow progress
to be made toward significant, cost-effective ecosystem restoration, while beneficially
using previously dredged material and future dredged material from USACE projects. If
the San Francisco Bay to Stockton Navigation Improvement Project, currently under
investigation, is authorized and funded, this would produce readily available dredged
material that could be used to restore an additional 2,000 acres. This could mean
increments 4, 6, and 7 at Big Break; increment 2 at Little Franks Tract; and increments 2
and 3 at Franks Tract should be re-evaluated because they could become considerably
more cost effective as additive to the current TSP.

NEPA Project Description

NEPA requires a greater level of detail in order to properly analyze the potential
effects of the proposed alternatives on the natural and human environment. Chapter 4
includes a description of the affected environment in the study area, followed by Chapter
5, which includes a discussion of the potential environmental effects of the proposed
alternatives that are described below.
A final array of alternatives for Ecosystem Restoration was developed using cost
effectiveness and incremental cost analysis (CE/ICA). As discussed in Section 3.5
above, 11 alternatives were developed in addition to the no action alternative for
consideration and further analysis. These alternatives were later screened to eliminate
alternatives from further analysis under NEPA. The NEPA screening process and
detailed alternative descriptions are described below.
72

3.9.1

Alternatives not Considered in Detail

Alternatives 3, 4, and 5 were considered independently but were ultimately
combined using the CE/ICA and included in Alternative 6, an action alternative and the
TSP.
Alternatives 7 and 8 resulted in increased incremental cost per habitat unit that
was nearly double that of the TSP and was considered to be too high to be carried
forward. The increased cost for Alternative 7 was primarily due to having to pump a
relatively small amount of material from the Rio Vista Pit across both the Sacramento
River and San Joaquin River. Alternative 8 was eliminated from further consideration
because the amount of available borrow material at Augusto Pit would provide less than
an acre of tidal marsh habitat and the cost of pumping such a small amount of material
doubled the incremental cost per output.
Alternative 9 included increments 1 and 2 at Franks Tract. The source of material
would come from Roberts Island 1 and 2, and would require the material to be pumped
approximately 6 miles across many small waterways and private property. The increased
cost in pumping and real estate eliminated Alternative 9 from further consideration.
Alternatives 10, 11, and 12 would all require a large amount of borrow material to
be trucked or barged to the restoration sites. The incremental cost per output of trucking
and barging would be about five times higher than the TSP. Additionally, no borrow
sites have been identified that could provide the material, and the environmental affects
to local roads, waterways, and air quality would be much greater than the TSP. Therefore
these alternatives were eliminated from further consideration.

3.9.2

NEPA Action Alternatives

In addition to Alternative 1, the no action alternative, Alternatives 2 and 6 are
carried forward to be considered in detail. Alternative 2 proposes intertidal marsh
restoration at Big Break via direct placement from annual operations and maintenance
(O&M) dredging. Alternative 6 proposes, in addition to the tidal restoration via O&M
dredging, to also use previously stockpiled material from four source material sites to
create additional increments of intertidal marsh restoration at both Big Break and Little
Franks Tract. Alternatives 1, 2, and 6 are described in greater detail in the following
sections.
Alternative 1 – No Action
Under no action, the Corps would not participate in ecosystem restoration in the
project area as part of the Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study. The ecosystems of
the Delta, as represented by the project area, would continue to degrade over time, with

73

the associated decline and loss of Delta habitats and species. The no action alternative
would not meet the planning goal to restore sustainable ecosystem functions in the Delta.
Ecological characteristics, such as spatial extent, habitat heterogeneity, and
dynamic storage, would remain substantially altered as a result of past and present land
use and water management practices in the Delta. Fragmentation and loss of shallow
open waters, tidal marsh, and shaded riverine aquatic habitats due to past channelization
and construction of levees would remain, as would the separation of historic floodplains
from natural hydrologic flooding events through the channels in the Delta. Nearly 95
percent of the historic intertidal and tidal wetland habitats in the Delta remain converted
to agricultural and urban uses.
This continuing loss and fragmentation of habitats would provide reduced habitat
values, thus supporting fewer numbers and types of both plant and animal species.
Native species, including Federally listed threatened, endangered, and proposed species,
such as Antioch Dunes evening-primrose, Delta smelt, and salmonids, would likely
continue to decline in overall health and numbers due to degraded soil and water quality
conditions. In addition, degraded conditions have led to the introduction and propagation
of non-native invasive species such as egeria and water hyacinth that out-compete and
replace native species for limited resources.
Alternative 2 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break via Direct
Placement
Alternative 2 includes only Big Break increment 1 using O&M dredging over a five year
period to create 41.9 acres of intertidal marsh habitat. As part of a separate dredging
project, the Sacramento District is currently updating a Biological Assessment for
submittal to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). A subsequent Biological
Opinion is expected to be issued by the USFWS allowing the Corps to begin maintenance
dredging activities in 2015. Dredged material would come from O&M activities in the
San Joaquin River between station points 200+00 and1000+00 (Figure 3-8). Wet
material would be directly pumped to the restoration sites, rather than their typical
dredged material placement sites. A chemical and granular composition analysis of the
materials would be conducted in advance of placement. The environmental effects of the
O&M dredging and the piping of material to the placement site is an ongoing USACE
operation that is covered under the San Francisco Bay to Stockton (John F Baldwin and
Stockton Ship Channels) Final Environmental Impact Statement from September 1980.
However, a brief description of these activities is included in the following section.
O&M Wet Dredged Material
A pipeline hydraulic suction dredge will be used to accomplish the dredging
project under the existing General Order (GO) Waste Discharge Requirement No. 05-01116 for the Sacramento and Stockton Deep Water Ship Channels (DWSC). The General
Order allows for clamshell dredging to be used if practicable and if contract or project
conditions change. Dredging rates vary depending on the type of material being dredged,
74

but production rates of 300 to 600 cubic yards per operational hour are typical. The
dredging operations are expected to be conducted 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
Typically, approximately 18 hours per day are considered ‘operational,’ during which
dredging occurs.
Wet material would be pumped from the dredging ship directly to the placement
sites at Big Break. Materials would be pumped to the proposed project areas through a
floating 18 inch double wall high density plastic extrusion (HDPE) pipe. The piping
system would be placed along the shoreline of the Stockton DWSC in the San Joaquin
River. The pipeline would be submerged and anchored to the bottom when necessary to
avoid navigation hazards. A floating repeater pump station would be positioned every 3
miles as necessary to aid slurry flow. Work boats would install and maintain the floating
pipeline. An additional work boat and crew would tender the position of the outfall
slurry pipe during pumping operations to ensure correct placement of materials.
Placement would occur over a five year period from August 1 to November 30.
Material Placement
The hydraulic slurry would be discharged at the restoration sites at a rate of 450
cubic yards per hour or 4,000 cubic yards per day. Placement would begin using remnant
levees as an anchor/starting point. Turbidity curtains and sacrificial hay bales would be
used to control sediment plumes, comply with water quality requirements, and aid with
settlement. The tops of the sacrificial hay bale line would be set at mean low tide level to
allow fish an opportunity to escape the work area. Turbidity curtains float slightly above
the bottom allowing aquatic species to escape entrapment. Pumped materials would be
placed to bring the tract soil depth to 4.5 feet relative to mean sea level.
Plantings
The planting design includes planting bulrush (Typha sp.) installed over the newly
created areas. Plantings would be installed at 3 feet on center over 10 percent of the
intertidal marsh area. The plant material may be nursery grown or collected from nearby
sources and directly planted at the site.
Alternative 6 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break and Little Franks
Tract via Direct Placement and Pumping of Previously Dredged Materials
The O&M dredging, material placement, and plantings for Alternative 6 would be
the same as described above for Alternative 2. In addition to O&M dredging, stockpiled
dredged material would also be used to create an additional 47.6 acres of intertidal marsh
habitat at Big Break and Little Franks Tract for a total of 89.5 acres. Existing dredged
materials stored at dry placement sites located at Sherman Island McCormack Pit,
Sherman Island Scour Pond, Decker Island, and Bradford Island would also be used to
provide the additional materials needed for this acreage (Figure 3-8). Tables 3-19 and 320 display the incremental material sources.

Preparation and Equipment Mobilization
Site mobilization would commence in August of each construction year. The
work window would be from August 1 to November 30. Work hours would be 7:00 am
to 4:00 pm Monday through Thursday. The source material sites that contain vegetation,
large rocks, snags, and uneven terrain would be cleared, grubbed, and in some cases
leveled to provide a flatter working surface.
Following site preparations, the equipment and materials necessary for movement
of dredged materials would be imported to designated staging areas and set up,
assembled, parked, stored, and/or stockpiled for use. It is anticipated that throughout the
multi-year construction period, construction equipment, materials, and supplies would be
replenished, replaced, dismantled, removed, and changed-out as needed in the appropriate
staging areas to support the various material pumping actions.
Staging Areas
It is anticipated that temporary diesel or propane 3-phase 120/240-volt electric
power generator would be provided during the multi-year construction period to run
construction equipment including conveyors, water pumps, slurry mixers, and pumping
stations. To supply the necessary electrical power, a small temporary substationswitching station would be set up at the staging area.

76

Fluidization/Pumping Plant
Existing dredged materials from the stockpile sites would be pumped to the
proposed project areas through 18” double wall HDPE pipe. A hydraulic slurry hopper at
the stockpile site would create the fluidization process necessary to transport the dredged
stockpile materials. Water necessary for the process would be siphoned from the
adjacent rivers by a hydraulic pump and transferred to the slurry hopper. A loader would
place dredged materials onto a conveyer system that deposits materials into the slurry
hopper. The hopper mixes dredge materials with water creating a 90 percent water based
slurry solution which is pumped through the HDPE piping network. In-water piping
which is not anchored to the bottom would float at the surface by means of floatation
devices. A work boat and crew would tender the position of the outfall slurry pipe during
pumping operations to ensure correct placement of materials.
The stockpiled dredge materials would be pumped between August 1 and
November 30 over four years. During the first year of construction dredge materials
from the McCormack Pit site would be pumped to the Big Break restoration areas. The
McCormack Pit site would then serve as a permanent repeater pump site for the
subsequent years. An additional pump would be positioned at Sherman Island Scour
Pond, and then moved the following year to Scour Pond, and finally Decker Island. The
Bradford Island site would be pumped to Little Franks Tract in year one. Table 3-21
shows the pump station position by year and material destination.
The HPDE piping schematic (Figure 3-8) would require permissions and permits
necessary to place pipe sections on private property, over levees, and through water
courses. Major river crossings at navigable channels would require submerged piping.
Pipe segments would be anchored to the bottom in order to avoid impacts to shipping and
recreation. A specialized marine craft with a crane and underwater processing head
would be required for the anchoring process. The crane and pipe processing head install
and secure the segments on the river bottom. When possible, pipe sections crossing
farmland would be positioned along the edge of farm roads in order to avoid impacts to
farm operations or special status species populations.

Site Restoration and Monitoring
Following construction material source sites would be graded for proper drainage
and elevation as determined by construction plans and specifications. Construction and
pumping equipment would be demobilized and removed from the site. The site would be
cleaned and hydroseeded with native grasses to prevent erosion, if necessary.
At the intertidal marsh restoration sites, new vegetative plantings would not
require maintenance. Soil accretion and vegetative recruitment have historically aided
plantings on restored intertidal marsh habitats. Plantings typically survive and reach
desired density within 2 years. Monitoring records and reports would be required to
document planting processes and progress.

CHAPTER 4.0 – AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT
This section describes the pre-project conditions of the environmental resources in
the project area. In Chapter 5.0, these pre-project conditions are compared to the withproject conditions in order to determine the effects of the proposed project. Resources
less likely to be adversely affected by the project are described first, followed by the
resources that may be affected by the alternatives. Although all resources are subject to
some change over time, most of these resources are not expected to change significantly
during the period of analysis for this study. Thus for most of the resources in the affected
environment existing conditions are assumed in this environmental analysis to be the
future without-project conditions as well.. Excepted resources which are likely to
experience significant changes due to implementation of one of the proposed alternatives
include vegetation and wildlife, special status species, land use, socioeconomics, and
traffic and circulation. These resources are described in greater detail in Section 4.2
below.

4.1

Resources Not Considered In Detail

Initial evaluation of the effects of the project indicated that there would likely be
little to no effect on several resources. These resources are discussed in Sections 4.1.1
through 4.1.10 to add to the overall understanding of the area. Sections 4.2.1 through
4.2.6 describe existing conditions for those resources that are more likely to be affected
by implementation of the proposed alternatives.

4.1.1

Geology and Seismicity

Geology
The Delta and Suisun Marsh lie within California’s Central Valley, which is
approximately 465 miles long and 40 to 60 miles wide. The valley is bounded by the
Sierra Nevada on the east and the Coast Ranges on the west. Paleogeographic
reconstructions of this region indicate that Miocene sedimentation was similar to a
modern fore-arc basin (a sea floor depression between a subduction zone and an
associated volcanic arc), shedding arkosic (granular quartz and feldspar or mica), and
volcanoclastic sediments westward from the continent. In the mid-Pliocene Epoch, a
shift in plate tectonics triggered uplift of the Coast Ranges, which gradually closed the
southern marine outlet to the basin. By the late Pliocene, sub-aerial conditions prevailed
throughout the valley, resulting from marine regression (i.e., when the oceans were
regressing seaward over land) and sedimentation from the west. During Pleistocene
Epoch, the valley separated from the Pacific Ocean and developed internal drainage, the
modern outlet being the Carquinez Strait, through which the Sacramento River flows to
the San Francisco Bay (Lettis and Unruh 1991).

79

The historical Delta evolved at the inland margin of the San Francisco Bay
Estuary as two overlapping geomorphic units. The Sacramento River Delta comprises
about 30% of the total area and was influenced by the interaction of rising sea level and
river floods that created channels, natural levees, and marsh plains. During large river
flood events, silts and sands were deposited adjacent to the river channel, forming natural
levees above the marsh plain. In contrast, the larger San Joaquin River Delta—located in
the central and southern portions of the Delta and having relatively small flood flows and
low sediment supply—formed as an extensive, unleveed freshwater tidal marsh
dominated by tidal flows and organic soil (peat and muck) accretion (Atwater and
Belknap 1980). Because the San Joaquin River Delta had less well defined levees,
sediments were deposited more uniformly across the floodplain during high water,
creating an extensive tule marsh with many small branching tributary channels. As a
result of the differential amounts of inorganic sediment supply, the peats and mucks of
the San Joaquin River Delta grade northward into peaty mud and then into mud as it
approaches the natural levees and flood basins of the Sacramento River Delta (Atwater
and Belknap 1980). The proposed alternatives are small-scale ecosystem restoration
projects that would restore the proposed locations to historic conditions. As a result, the
project would have no effect on the geologic features in the project area.
Seismicity
The California Coast Ranges physiographic province lies along the complex
boundary between two tectonic plates: the North American Plate and the Pacific Plate.
The geologic and tectonic conditions in the Delta and Suisun Marsh have been, and
continue to be, controlled primarily by the interaction of these two massive blocks of the
Earth’s crust. Under the current tectonic regime, the Pacific Plate moves northwestward
relative to the North American Plate at a rate of about 1.57 inches (40 millimeters) per
year (Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities 2003). Although relative
motion between these two plates is predominantly lateral (strike-slip), an increase in
convergent motion along the plate boundary within the past few million years has
resulted in the formation of mountain ranges and structural valleys of the Coast Ranges
province.
The San Andreas Fault system dominates the seismicity of the region, and it
comprises several major faults including the San Andreas, Hayward–Rodgers Creek,
Calaveras, Concord–Green Valley, and Greenville faults. In addition to these major
faults, many other named and unnamed regional faults accommodate relative motion
between the plates and relieve compression stresses that also act along the plate
boundary.
The Delta and Suisun Marsh are in the eastern portion of the greater San
Francisco Bay region, one of the most seismically active areas in the United States.
Since 1800, several earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 6.5 have occurred in the
immediate San Francisco Bay Area, including the 1868 magnitude 6.8 earthquake on the
Hayward Fault, the 1906 magnitude 7.9 San Francisco earthquake on the San Andreas

80

Fault, and the more recent 1989 magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake that occurred in
the Santa Cruz Mountains.
The proposed alternatives are small-scale ecosystem restoration projects in rural
areas. There are no permanent structures associated with the proposed alternatives that
would require compliance with State seismic laws and regulations. As a result, the
proposed alternatives would not be impacted by seismicity within the project area.

4.1.2

Topography and Soils

Topography
Soils formed in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta (Delta) as the result of
geologic processes over approximately the past 7,000 years. These processes produced
landward accumulation of sediment behind the bedrock barrier at the Carquinez Strait,
forming marshlands comprising approximately 100 islands that were surrounded by
hundreds of miles of channels (Weir 1950). Generally, mineral soils formed near the
channels during flood conditions and organic soils formed on marsh island interiors as
plant residues accumulated faster than they could decompose. Prior to the mid‐1800s, the
Delta was a vast marsh and floodplain, under which peat soils developed to a thickness of
up to 30 feet in many areas (Weir 1950), with a thickness of approximately 55 feet in the
vicinity of Sherman Island (Real and Knudsen 2009). The tidal portion of the Delta
consisted of backwater areas, tidal sloughs, and a network of channels that supported
highly productive freshwater tidal marsh and other wetland habitats (CALFED Bay‐Delta
Program 2000). The study area consists of sunken islands with remnant levees which are
subject to tidal inundation. The majority of the study area is under water. While the
proposed alternatives do involve reusing dredged materials to raise the elevation of these
sunken islands, the purpose of the action is to restore these islands to historic conditions.
As a result, the proposed alternatives would have no effect on the major topographic
features in the project area.
Soils
Soils in the study area are extremely variable in texture and chemical
composition. The soil composition of the islands surrounding the study are a combination
of peat beds in the center of islands with relatively coarse textured inorganic sediments
deposited in the channels and along the margins of the islands soils in perimeter marsh
areas around islands are comprised of peat beds that accumulated and were preserved
under anoxic conditions (lack the presence of oxygen). In contrast, soils in channels and
along the higher energy channel margins of islands tend to be comprised primarily of
mineral sediment. The peat soils have been largely drained, resulting in oxidation of
organic matter and subsequent large‐scale land subsidence on Delta islands (Deverel, S.
J., and S. Rojstaczer. 1996). The soils that would be used as part of the proposed
alternatives are dredged materials that originate from the waterways within the study

81

area. Reusing this soil to create intertidal marsh habitat would not have any impact on
the existing soils in the study area.

4.1.3

Hydrology and Hydraulics

The Delta watershed includes the tributary rivers that flow into the Delta from the
Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River basins (Figure 2-1). In general, the Delta
watershed is represented by the drainage of the Central Valley except for the Tulare Lake
area. Areas outside of the Delta that receive Delta water include Tulare Lake, San
Francisco Bay, Central Coast, and Southern California. The project area is not isolated
and subject to the overall hydrologic and hydraulic processes, both natural and human,
which are present in the Delta.
Delta Hydrology
The hydrologic function of the Delta involves the interaction of streamflow runoff
from the major rivers and tidal inflow of salt water from the Pacific Ocean. Two major
rivers supply the majority of the freshwater: the Sacramento River from the north and the
San Joaquin River from the south. The runoff of the Sacramento River is greater,
accounting for 80% of the freshwater runoff by volume. The water in the San Joaquin
River and its tributaries has been highly diverted for agricultural use, and much of the
runoff is diverted upstream of the Delta. At their junction, runoff from the Sacramento
River channel near Sherman Island flows southward to create a freshwater barrier across
the mouth of the San Joaquin; without this barrier, it is postulated that saltwater inflow to
the south-central Delta would increase significantly.
Sacramento River Basin
The Sacramento River flows generally north to south from its source near Mount
Shasta to the Delta. The Sacramento River receives contributing flows from numerous
major and minor streams and rivers that drain the east and west sides of the basin,
including the Feather River, Yuba River, and American River. In addition, Putah and
Cache Creeks flow into the Yolo Bypass, which subsequently flows into the Cache
Slough complex prior to entering the Sacramento River upstream of Rio Vista. The
Sacramento River basin topography ranges in elevation from approximately 14,000 feet
above sea level on Mount Shasta to approximately 1,070 feet at Shasta Dam, to sea level
in the Delta. Generally, precipitation occurs in the form of snow during winter and early
spring at elevations above 5,000 feet. The snowmelt generally occurs in April and May.
San Joaquin River Basin
The San Joaquin River originates in the Sierra Nevada and then flows west into
the San Joaquin Valley through Millerton Lake at Friant. The San Joaquin River turns
north near Mendota and flows through the San Joaquin Valley and into the Delta near
Vernalis. The San Joaquin River receives contributing flows from the Fresno,
82

Chowchilla, Merced, Tuolumne, Stanislaus, Calaveras, Mokelumne, and Cosumnes
Rivers. The Calaveras, Mokelumne, and Cosumnes Rivers flow into the San Joaquin
River within the boundaries of the Delta. When Kings River in the Tulare Lake
hydrologic region floods, the San Joaquin River also receives flood waters as high as
5,000 cfs from the Kings River via Fresno Slough.
The San Joaquin River basin topography ranges in elevation from over 10,000
feet above sea level in the Sierra Nevada to sea level in the Delta. Generally,
precipitation occurs in the form of snow during winter and early spring at the upper
elevations, and snowmelt occurs in the late spring and early summer months. Flows in
the San Joaquin River are regulated by operation of Friant Dam, which diverts water into
the Central Valley Project (CVP) Friant Division. The Friant Division conveys water in
the Madera Canal to the north and the Friant‐Kern Canal to the south for irrigation and
municipal and industrial water supplies, and releases water in the San Joaquin River to
meet downstream water rights and instream flow requirements. Hydropower generation
facilities in the upper reaches of the San Joaquin River influence water flows into
Millerton Lake (formed by Friant Dam).
Delta Hydraulics
The Delta is a complex network of over 700 miles of tidally influenced channels
and sloughs. Four strong forcing mechanisms drive circulation, transport, and mixing of
water in the Delta: (1) freshwater river flow from drainages to the Delta; (2) tides from
the west propagating from the Pacific Ocean through San Francisco Bay; (3) State Water
Project (SWP) and CVP water supply facilities operating in the Delta; and (4) collective
effects of in‐Delta agricultural diversions (U.S. Geological Survey 2005).
Influence of Delta Inflows
The Sacramento River is the primary contributor to Delta inflows. The San
Joaquin River is the second biggest contributor to Delta inflows. Finally, east side
streams (Mokelumne, Cosumnes, and Calaveras Rivers) provide inflow to Delta annually
that join from east and flow towards west.
Influence of Delta Tidal Flows
Tidal flows have a major influence on Delta hydraulics and vary with the extent
of high and low tides. On average, tidal inflows to the Delta are approximately equal to
tidal outflows. All tidal flows enter and leave the Delta along the San Joaquin River at
Chipps Island. Water levels vary greatly during each tidal cycle, from less than one foot
on the San Joaquin River near Interstate 5 to more than five feet near Pittsburg. Sea level
rise is another factor that has a notable influence on Delta hydraulics. Factors affecting
sea level rise include tidal variations, storm surges, large‐scale changes in water
temperature and wind forces, and climate‐related changes.

83

Influence of the State Water Project and Central Valley Project on Delta
Operations
The withdrawal rates at the south Delta intakes influence Delta hydraulics and can
change the direction of flow of some waterways in the south Delta. The most influential
effects occur on Old and Middle Rivers. Reverse flows also occur in False River in the
western Delta and Turner Cut in the San Joaquin River.
South Delta hydraulics are influenced by several channels that have been widened
or connected and by barriers to reduce connectivity between other channels to protect
agricultural water uses or aquatic resources. Operations of these facilities affect
operations of the SWP/CVP south Delta intakes (DWR 2009a).
Influence of Delta Agricultural Diversions
There are over 1,800 diversions in the Delta area that are estimated to divert up to
5,000 cfs during peak summer months. Most of these diversions are related to
agricultural operations. Surface water in the Delta also is influenced by consumptive use
of groundwater by agricultural crops and by seepage from the surface water into the
interior of the islands and tracts. A substantial portion of the water diverted from the
Delta or that seeps into the islands and tracts is returned to the Delta surface water by
agricultural and drainage flows and seepage that is pumped from the islands and tracts
into the Delta (DWR 2009b).
The creation of 90 acres of intertidal marsh habitat in the Delta estuary would not
have an effect on hydraulic or hydrologic processes because of the small size of the area
being created and the tidal influence of the water levels. The project is very small
relative to the entire Delta system. Salinity and hydraulic analysis taken from existing
reports support a conclusion of no change to water levels Because the project would
only include the placement of fill material into open waters to create intertidal marsh
habitat surface water, flood plain boundaries, flood characteristics, or flood control
structures (such as levees) adjacent or downstream of the study area are not expected to
change.

4.1.4

Land Use and Agriculture

Land Use
The study area evaluated for potential effects on land use includes the portions of
Contra Costa and Sacramento counties. Although the greater Delta study area includes
portions of Solano, Yolo, and San Joaquin counties, local land use issues are analyzed
only for the areas where Alternatives 2 and 6 are located.

84

Big Break
Big Break is located in Contra Costa County, California. The majority of the land
use surrounding Big Break is privately owned and designated for agriculture (58%). The
remaining land uses include industrial (16%), residential (15%), recreation (5%), marina
(2%) and public education facilities (1%). Big Break is interior tidal open water area
owned by the state and local governments (Contra Costa County 2013a).
Little Franks Tract
Little Franks Tract is located in Contra Costa County, California. The majority of
the land use surrounding Little Frank’s Tract is privately owned and designated for
agriculture (94%). The remaining land use is residential (6%). Little Franks Tract is
interior tidal open water area owned by the state and local governments (Contra Costa
County 2013a).
Borrow Sites
The proposed borrow sites are shown on Figure 3-8. The McCormick, Scour
Pond, and Decker Island borrow sites are located in Sacramento County, California. The
Bradford Island borrow site is located in Contra Costa County, California. Land use
designations for the disposal sites are agricultural (Sacramento County 2013; Contra
Costa County 2013b).
County General Plans
This section identifies relevant land use designations, goals, objectives, and
policies related to land use in adopted local general plans of Sacramento Country and
Contra Costa counties within the study area. These counties have incorporated policies
developed by the Delta Protection Commission (DPC) under the Delta Protection Act of
1992 (Public Resources Code (PRC) Section 29700), into their general plans and zoning
codes, which enables implementation of the Land Use and Resource Management Plan
for the Primary Zone of the Delta at the county level. The Primary Zone lands generally
are designated for agriculture or special Delta resources in their respective general plans.
The zoning codes allow a variety of uses in the Primary Zone: agriculture and
agriculturally oriented uses; outdoor recreation; wildlife habitat; public facilities; and
limited areas for commercial, industrial, and rural residential development. The parcel
sizes specified in the general plans and zoning codes range from 5 to 160 acres, with
most of the Primary Zone in the 20 to 80 acre minimum parcel sizes. General plan
policies relevant to specific resource areas (e.g., aesthetics, cultural resources, minerals,
visual resources, transportation) are discussed in the sections corresponding to those
resources.

85

Sacramento County General Plan
The Sacramento County General Plan update was adopted on November 9, 2011.
The plan seeks to provide a sustainable growth management program for the
unincorporated territory through 2030. The area within Sacramento County potentially
affected by the action alternatives is largely agricultural. The applicable general plan
policies that are potentially affected by the action alternatives specifically address
farmland of importance, preservation of agricultural practices, habitat preservation, and
open space creation.
Contra Costa County General Plan
A comprehensive update to the Contra Costa County General Plan 2005–2020
was adopted on January 18, 2005, to guide future growth, development, and resource
conservation through 2020 (Contra Costa County 2005). Amendments to the general
plan occurred in 1996 and 2005 to reflect changes to the land use map and the
incorporation of the city of Oakley, and the Housing Element was updated in 2009
(Contra Costa County 2013a).
The area within Contra Costa County potentially affected by the action
alternatives is largely agricultural. The applicable general plan policies that potentially
affected by the action alternatives specifically address farmland of importance, habitat
preservation, open space creation, and providing Delta recreation opportunities.
The proposed alternatives involve restoring the open water habitat of sunken
islands to their historic tidal marsh condition. There would be no changes in land use
policies associated with any of the proposed alternatives. All restoration work would be
consistent with local plans and policies. As a result, there would be no effect to land use
and no mitigation would be required.
Agriculture
The California Department of Conservation uses the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s modern classification when administering the Farmland Mapping and
Monitoring Program to characterize the types and amounts of agricultural land in an area.
Agricultural lands in the study area are primarily characterized as:
•

Prime farmland: Land that has the best combination of physical and chemical
characteristics for producing food, feed, fiber, forage, oilseed, and other
agricultural crops with minimum inputs of fuel, fertilizer, pesticides, and
labor, and without intolerable soil erosion (7 USC 4201[c][1][A]).

•

Unique farmland: Land other than prime farmland that is used for the
production of specific high-value food and fiber crops...such as, citrus, tree
nuts, olives, cranberries, fruits, and vegetables (7 USC 4201[c][1][B]).
86

•

Additional farmland of statewide or local importance: Land identified by
state or local agencies for agricultural use, but not of national significance (7
USC 4201[c][1][C]).

The proposed alternatives would be consistent with existing general plan policies
by restoring intertidal marsh areas, which would create habitat value for numerous Delta
wildlife species. The created marshlands would offer new recreation possibilities while
not hindering existing fishing and hunting activities. The pipes used to transport material
from the borrow sites to the intertidal marsh restoration areas would be located adjacent
to prime and unique farmlands. Where possible the pipes would be placed along existing
farm roads or access areas so that no impacts to prime and unique farmland would occur.
Some pipes may be placed in areas that are designed as prime and unique farmland, but
they would be located there temporarily and would not alter the land use or degrade the
value of the farmland. Habitat restoration is not proposed on land designated as prime
farmland, unique farmland, farmland of statewide importance, and none of these
farmlands would be converted to other land uses. As a result, no prime, unique, or
farmland of statewide or local importance would be affected by implementation of the
project and no mitigation would be required.

4.1.5

Socioeconomics

Delta Community Overview
Numerous communities with populations ranging from thousands (e.g., Pittsburg)
to a few hundred (e.g., Locke) are located in the Delta. These communities comprise
portions of Contra Costa, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano, and Yolo Counties.
Surrounding these communities are farms, ranches, orchards, and vineyards, most of
which have residences associated with them that are not in a delineated community, but
are socially tied to a community through general proximity or public services (e.g.,
school district boundaries and public service delivery areas). The California Delta
Reform Act of 2009 designated a number of unincorporated towns and areas in the
Delta, including Bethel Island, Clarksburg, Courtland, Freeport, Hood, Isleton,
Knightsen, Rio Vista, Ryde, Locke, and Walnut Grove as “Legacy Communities.”.
These communities exemplify the Delta’s unique cultural history and contribute to the
sense of the Delta as a place. In addition to recognized cities and communities, the Delta
also includes numerous small, recreational areas (including campgrounds, marinas,
recreational vehicle parks, and vacation homes) that are popular throughout the spring
and summer months.
Beyond the physical boundaries of the Delta, people are connected to the Delta
through business enterprises, recreational interests, and social activities. For the people
who reside outside the Delta, there is a sense of being part of the community because of
the social interaction, common ties, and common appreciation of the Delta environment
shared among residents and visitors. Different user groups may have a sense of being
87

part of the larger Delta community because of shared values that are linked to the Delta
landscape and resources.
Geographic Distribution and Characterization of Population in the Delta
The demographic composition of the Delta varies greatly. It can be characterized
by small towns and dispersed rural residences in the interior of the Delta, and large urban
areas on the periphery. In general, the population density of the inner Delta is very low.
Most of the population resides in or near the peripheral urban areas. The highest
concentration of people is in the urban centers of Sacramento to the north, Antioch and
Pittsburg to the west, and Stockton and Tracy to the southeast. The small rural
communities of Freeport, Isleton, and Thornton also are in the interior of the Delta.
The population in the interior of the Delta is centered around several rural
communities, including Clarksburg, Courtland, Hood, Isleton, and Walnut
Grove/Locke/Ryde (Delta Protection Commission 1995). These communities have
experienced land use restrictions that inhibit urban development within the Primary Zone
of the Delta, an area generally representing the inner Delta, defined by the Delta
Protection Commission for the purposes of land use planning.
In addition to more densely populated Delta communities in the Primary Zone,
numerous residences are scattered throughout the Delta islands and are either associated
with agricultural parcels or are more estate‐style residences used as vacation or leisure
residences. Among the Delta islands in the interior of the Delta, Brannan‐Andrus Island,
Bethel Island, Byron Tract, New Hope Tract, and Sargent Barnhart Tract historically
have had the highest populations (California Department of Water Resources 1995),
although determining the populations of these individual islands is difficult because of
seasonal changes in the recreation‐associated residency and the presence of temporary
agricultural workers on some islands, which can skew census tabulations. Some islands
in the Delta are dedicated solely to agriculture or natural habitat, including
McCormack‐Williamson Tract, Kimball Island, and Coney Island.
The population of the Delta is relatively diverse as a result of its unique cultural
history, the presence of seasonal farm workers, and increasing development within the
larger Delta communities. There are high proportions of minority residents in both urban
and rural areas. Historically, many of the agricultural areas in the interior of the Delta
exhibit high proportions of minority residents, including Hispanics, Asians, and
African‐Americans because of a combination of historical and recent settlement trends.
The section on Environmental Justice further discusses the demographics of minority
populations in the Delta.
Economy
The economy of the Delta is rooted in agriculture. Production of some of
California’s best‐known crops, including asparagus and pears, occurs in Delta fields and
farms. Agriculture became the primary economic driver in the Delta because of its rich
88

soil, ample water supply, and proximity to urban markets. In addition, agriculture
fostered a diverse population in terms of race and ethnicity. The waterways of the Delta
have been used historically to transport agricultural products to urban centers, such as
Stockton or Sacramento for processing, packing, and shipment.
Tourism and recreation are the second most important sources of economic
benefit in the Delta. The Delta is a destination for boating, fishing, waterskiing, and
windsurfing. Because the communities in the interior of the Delta were established
primarily for their easy access to the water, Delta communities are easily reached
destinations for boaters and recreationists traveling through the area. As some areas have
become key destinations for recreational users, the tourist activity supports additional
services and businesses. Some of the recreationally‐oriented communities have
restaurants, cafes, retail shops, and service providers near the local dock or marina.
Implementation of the various alternatives would not affect the local economy because
the creation of intertidal marsh habitat would not affect recreation, jobs, homes, or other
economic factors within the Delta.
Environmental Justice
Federal Executive Order (EO) 12898, Environmental Justice, requires that, to the
greatest extent practicable and permitted by law,
…each Federal agency shall make achieving environmental
justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as
appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human
health or environmental effects of its programs, policies,
and activities on minority populations and low-income
populations.
EO 12898 charges each cabinet department to “make achieving environmental
justice part of its mission,” with the EPA responsible for implementation of EO 12898.
The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) has oversight of the Federal government’s
compliance with Executive Order 12898 and NEPA. For purposes of this analysis, the
definitions of minority and low-income populations provided in the CEQ's Guidance for
Agencies on Key Terms in Executive Order 12898 (CEQ 1997) are used. Minority
individuals are defined as members of the following population groups:
•

American Indian or Alaskan Native,

•

Asian or Pacific Islander,

•

Black,

•

Hispanic.

89

Minority populations are identified by the following.
•

Where the minority population percentage of the affected area is meaningfully
greater than the minority population percentage of the general population.

•

Where the minority population percentage of the affected area exceeds 50%
(CEQ 1997).

•

Low-income populations are identified based upon poverty thresholds
provided by the U.S. Census Bureau (CEQ 1997), and identified as one of the
following.

•

The population percentage below the poverty level is meaningfully greater
than that of the population percentage in the general population.

•

The population percentage below the poverty level in the affected area
exceeds 50%.

•

Significant concentrations of minority or low-income individuals are
sometimes referred to as environmental justice populations.

The project sites are located in open water locations with the borrow sites located
on relatively unpopulated privately owned islands. Construction activities and equipment
placement would not result in disturbance to existing population centers or individuals.
Therefore the alternatives would have no disproportionate and adverse human health or
environmental effects on minority and low-income populations. The alternatives would
have no adverse effects on the local, regional, state, or national economies.

4.1.6

Noise

This section describes the existing noise environment in the study area. This
includes local, Federal, and State criteria; sources and levels of noise; and noise-sensitive
land uses and receptors. Noise can be defined as unwanted sound, and effects are
interpreted in relationship to noise level criteria for each county. The standard unit of
sound measurement is the decibel (dB). Since the human ear is not equally sensitive to
sound at all frequencies, a special rating scale has been devised to relate noise to human
sensitivity. The A-weighted decibel scale (dBA) provides this compensation by
discriminating against frequencies in a manner approximating the sensitivity of the
human ear.
Community noise (CNEL) is commonly described in terms of ambient noise level
that constitutes the normal or existing level of environmental noise at a given location.
The ambient noise level is measured as the average, or equivalent, sound level (L eq ) and
is often expressed as the noise descriptor L dn , which is a 24-hour average noise level with
a 10-dB penalty adjustment used for nighttime noise.

90

State and Federal Criteria
The criteria for evaluating traffic effects on noise are contained in the Federal
Procedures for Abatement of Highway Traffic Noise and Construction Noise (23 CFR
772) and the Caltrans Traffic Noise Analysis Protocol dated October 1998. The Category
B criterion in these documents applies to residences, churches, schools, recreation areas
and similar uses, and is an hourly sound level that approaches or exceeds 67 dBA L eq .
Other developed lands such as commercial or industrial are included in Category C, for
which an hourly sound level criterion that approaches or exceeds 72 dBA L eq has been
established. There are no criteria for undeveloped land or construction noise. These
sound levels are determined at the exterior of structures during peak-hour noise
conditions.
The FHWA and Caltrans consider traffic to have an effect on noise if predicted
peak-hour traffic noise levels approach or exceed the noise abatement criteria. Caltrans
defines “approach or exceed” as noise levels within 1 dBA of noise abatement criterion,
meaning 66 dBA for Category B. In addition to the criterion sound levels described
above, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and Caltrans consider traffic to
have an effect on noise predicted sound levels "substantially" exceed existing noise
levels. Caltrans defines "substantial" as an increase of 12 dBA over existing peak-hour
noise levels. Caltrans and FHWA policies dictate that noise abatement measures must be
considered when effects on noise are identified.
Local Criteria
Sacramento County
The Sacramento County 2030 General Plan Update Noise Element states that
interior and exterior noise created by new non-transportation noise sources may not
exceed the noise level standards shown in Table 00 at existing noise sensitive areas in a
project’s vicinity (Sacramento County 2011). The Plan states that noise associated with
construction activities shall adhere to County Code requirements. Sacramento County
Code Section 6.68, Noise Control, states that exterior noise shall not exceed 50 dBA
between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. and 55 dBA between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. for
residential and agricultural areas. Construction activities between the hours of 6:00 a.m.
and 8:00 p.m. Monday through Friday and 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. on weekends are
exempt from this ordinance. Construction may be allowed to continue past these limits
when an unforeseen or unavoidable condition occurs and the nature of the project
requires work to continue until a specific amount of work is completed that will not
jeopardize inspection acceptance or create undue financial hardships for the contractor or
owner (Sacramento County 2009).
Contra Costa County
The Noise Element of the Contra Costa County General Plan (2005-2020)
contains guidelines for Land use Compatibility for Community Noise Environments.
91

These guidelines assign appropriate noise levels for indoor and outdoor activities at
various land use categories. According to this Noise Element, it is "normally acceptable"
for low density residential lands to be exposed to a day-night average sound level (Ldn)
of 60 dBA or less. These guidelines are normally used for planning new projects in noisy
areas; they do not strictly apply to mechanical noise from the project affecting the
existing residential land. However, they do provide an indication of noise sensitivity at
neighboring residences.
Existing Sources of Noise
Noise sources in eastern Contra Costa County and eastern Antioch include
transportation and non-transportation activities. Traffic noise occurs along the corridors
of Highways 4 and 160. Rail operations and aircraft from the Byron Airport contribute to
the noise environment. Motorized boats along the San Joaquin River also contribute
noise. Non-transportation noise sources in the county include agricultural operations,
commercial and industrial activities, parks and school playing fields, heating and cooling
equipment, landscape maintenance, and heavy equipment use.
Existing Noise-Sensitive Land Uses
Contra Costa County land in the project area is primarily in agricultural and
recreational use. Residential, commercial, industrial, and open space land uses also exist
in both unincorporated and incorporated areas of the county. Residential, commercial,
and industrial uses are concentrated in the city of Oakley, in eastern Contra Costa County.
Residential uses are the primary noise-sensitive land uses in the county.
Existing Noise Levels
Existing noise measurements for portions of Contra Costa County in the vicinity
of the study area, as described in the Contra Costa County General Plan (Contra Costa
County 2005), include traffic noise levels from existing roadways in the area. The noise
contour maps indicate that roadway noise near potential project-related activities
evaluated in this EIS from 60 to 75 dB in 2005. Land uses near project components are
primarily rural and consist of agricultural use and low-density residential development.
As such existing noise levels are in the range of 40 to 50 dBA.
Noise-Sensitive Land Uses and Receptors
Noise effects are defined as those that can adversely affect sensitive receptors.
Residences, schools, hospitals, nursing homes, religious facilities, libraries, and other
areas of similar use are often considered to be sensitive to noise. Existing noise at the site
is primarily caused by boat traffic along Taylor Slough, and routine agricultural activities
on nearby farmland. No residential or industrial type activities occur within a quarter
mile of the site. Residences would not be affected by the work on the levee. Temporary
increases in ambient noise would not harm wildlife.

92

Because the project is located in an area that does not contain a sensitive receptor
population there would be no affect from noise.

4.1.7

Esthetics

The statutory Delta encompasses 738,000 acres and consists of largely
undeveloped islands and low-lying tracts of land surrounded by waterways and levees.
Historically, more than 40% of the state’s runoff flowed to the Delta through the
Sacramento, San Joaquin, and Mokelumne Rivers (California Department Of Water
Resources 1993). In addition to the natural waterways, the area contains a variety of
water development facilities such as levees, aqueducts, and intake structures. The
construction of levees resulted in the conversion of wetlands, riparian corridors, and open
water to agricultural lands characterized by elevated and vegetated levees surrounding
low-lying areas of farmland. Construction of these levees, completed before World War
II, also allowed for urbanization, commercial shipping to the Ports of Stockton and West
Sacramento, recreational boating, and marina development within the Delta (SacDelta
2009).
Lands contributing to the visual resources of the project area include State
Recreation Areas, wildlife refuges and preserves, marinas and shoreline recreation
facilities. Some large tracts are managed by duck hunting clubs. Although the Delta is
largely agricultural, human-made structures of aesthetic value, such as bridges and
historical homes and towns, are located along the roadways.
The attributes of the Delta landscape change over the course of a year in response
to seasonal changes and weather. Vegetation, agricultural crops, and land use patterns
vary according to the time of year and farming activities. For instance, a particular field
may be fallow through winter and early spring and yet exhibit substantial vegetative
growth through summer. Often stubble or crop remnant can be seen in fall after harvest.
Project Area Landscape Types
The Delta’s landscape can be grouped into three main landscape categories:
agricultural, waterways, and developed. Each of these categories has distinctive visual
and scenic attributes that contribute to the dominant visual character of the Delta
landscape. Within each category, specialized dominant features in the visual landscape
combine to define more distinct landscape types that share similar visual elements.
Agricultural Landscapes
Agricultural lands account for the primary land use in the Delta. The extensive
tracts of agricultural land shape the Delta’s visual character. A wide mixture of crops,
land management practices, and agricultural infrastructure create a pastoral visual
landscape composed of a variety of colors, textures, and views from different distances.

93

Waterway Landscapes
Approximately 1,000 miles of waterways traverse the Delta, making them a
defining and dominant feature of the landscape (Delta Science Center 2009a). Many of
the waterways follow natural courses, while others have been constructed for navigation,
flood control, water supply, and drainage. The predominant features constraining and
defining these waterways are artificial levees. The Delta’s waterways are unique in their
diversity and wide range of distribution and abundance, adding substantially to the
region’s visual characteristics. Most Delta waterways have a general scenic quality that
attracts and contributes to varied types of recreation. The three general types of Delta
waterway visual landscapes consists of open river, channels and sloughs, and marsh.
The open river is a visual landscape dominated by a singular, expansive waterway.
This landscape type is a common sight along Delta roadways that closely parallel the
Sacramento and other rivers and offer views of the river corridor. In the study area where
former islands have been inundated, (Little Franks Tract and Big Break) the open-river
landscape expands broadly, creating an open-water visual landscape. Numerous channels
and sloughs wind through the Delta as the large Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers
mingle with smaller rivers that drain the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges (Delta Science
Center 2009b). Sloughs meander through the landscape in a curvilinear fashion, while
engineered waterways that have been channelized and diverted for agriculture and water
conveyance tend to carve straighter paths. The marsh landscape type consists of
intermixed open water and wetland vegetation. It is characterized by fluctuating water
levels and/or seasonal flooding from tidal action, rain, and management actions.
Developed Landscapes
Settlement patterns in the Delta are generally rural; however, small towns and
pockets of urban development are distributed throughout. The primary development or
settlement patterns that contribute to the Delta visual landscape include landscape rural
centers, urbanized development, and industrial development. Rural centers are
characterized by the small, sometimes historic towns scattered throughout the Delta.
These towns are typically clustered alongside a major waterway. Most of the interior
Delta is rural; large, more urban development tends to occur only on its edges. The
urbanized landscape type is also characterized by medium to larger cities. The industrial
visual landscape type is scattered throughout the Delta and includes ports, water
conveyance facilities, transmission lines, substations, and buildings with industrial uses,
such as warehouses and storage silos.
The Delta area is primarily a viewshed of open waters, tidal marshes, wetlands,
and shoreline habitat. Creating additional intertidal marsh habitat would be consistent
with the existing viewshed of the Delta and therefore, there would be no affects to
aesthetics with construction of the project.

94

4.1.8

Hazardous, Toxic, and Radiological Waste

Naturally Occurring Hazards
Historic geologic conditions in the study area have led to the formation of peat
and other organic soils with thicknesses of up to approximately 55 feet on the western
side of the Delta; peat deposits are not commonly found on the eastern side. The thick
organic soils and peat have the potential to generate flammable gases such as methane
that can pose hazards to workers during deep excavations and tunneling.
Hazards from Agricultural Practices
Agriculture has been the primary land use in the study area for more than a
century. Approximately 538,000 acres of the 738,000 acres of agriculture land potentially
affect the waters adjacent to the project areas.
A wide variety of pesticides, including insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides,
have been used throughout the agricultural lands surrounding the project area for
decades; and those chemicals still may be present in and near agricultural lands. While
some pesticides that were used in 1974 were still in use in 2008 (e.g., sulfur, petroleum
oils, 1,3‐dichloropropene, diuron, and carbaryl), a number of new pesticides, such as
chloropicrin, chlorpyrifos and propanil, are available and in use currently. Notably, a
number of pesticides prevalently used in the 1970s are no longer prevalently used:
dinoseb, chlordane, dibromochloropropane (DBCP), ethylene dibromide, parathion, and
toxaphene.
The wide variety of pesticides that has been applied, the numerous crops grown in
the region, and the fact that predominant land use across the Delta supports agriculture
indicate that pesticides and their residues are likely to be found in the soils throughout the
Delta. No comprehensive area‐wide soil or sediment sampling program is known to have
been conducted to evaluate pesticide residues from agricultural use. Further discussion
of the fate, transport, and bioaccumulative properties of pyrethroid, organochlorine, and
organophosphate pesticides that have been applied to the project area crop lands.
Hazards from Historical Mercury Mining
Mercury has been identified as a chemical of concern in Delta area sediments,
resulting from gold and mercury mining operations in the watersheds upstream of the
Delta. Mercury was used extensively upstream of the study area in mining to extract gold
from ores and placer gravel deposits. Mercury released into the environment by historic
gold mining practices has been flowing into the study area via water, primarily from the
Sacramento River watershed, and sediments since the mid‐1800s and is expected to
continue to enter the study area. An unknown amount of mercury is present in sediments
within the project area, but estimates of mercury flowing into the Delta area, mainly
associated with suspended sediment (Alpers et al. 2008), range from approximately 200–
400 kg/yr (CVRWQCB 2008).
95

Urban, Residential, and Recreational Land Use
In general, hazardous materials releases from cities and towns are associated with
stormwater runoff and primarily affect water bodies. Cities and towns account for
approximately 9% of the total study area. Urban stormwater discharges are generally
characterized by varying levels of metals and hydrocarbons that can accumulate in river
sediments over time. Historically, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been
associated with urban discharge, and these contaminants have been detected in fish
tissues in San Francisco Bay.
Urban areas have many facilities with the potential for hazardous materials
releases, including gas stations, dry cleaners, automotive repair facilities, and, in larger
towns, manufacturing facilities. Stockton, for example, has large shipping and port
facilities, as well as Federal facilities with a history of hazardous materials use, storage,
and releases. Antioch and Oakley, located on the south side of the San Joaquin River
near the project areas, have major power‐producing facilities and several active or former
industrial facilities with known groundwater impacts. Possible contaminants of concern
from urban land uses are extensive, but the most common contaminants in soil and
groundwater are petroleum and associated compounds (typically gasoline and diesel
releases from USTs as the source), chlorinated solvents and degreasers (from dry
cleaning and vehicle repair facilities), and various heavy metals, such as arsenic and lead.
Marinas typically include bulk fuel storage and overwater fueling, various boat
repair/maintenance facilities, stores, boat storage, and camping facilities. Typical
chemicals associated with marinas include fuels, lubricants, cleaners, anti‐fouling paints,
and fiberglass components.
Borrow Materials
Historic chemical and granular test results previously dredged materials at
placement sites indicated that the dredge materials are chemically cleaner than the
existing baseline sampling from project area samples. Future materials from dredging
operations would be sampled prior to operations and maintenance dredging. Materials
meeting baseline criteria would be utilized for marsh habitat creation. Materials not
meeting baseline criteria would be stored at existing dryland storage sites
Project construction activities are not expected to disturb existing HTRW sources
that could lead to contamination of environmental resources. The placement of material
into the sites would not cause disruption of the areas under the sites because placement
would be directly on top of the existing soil. Additionally, the pipes that would carry any
material to the placement sties would be placed directly on top of existing land and not
disturb any material. The borrow material being used to create intertidal marsh habitat
would be tested prior to any processing of the material. Only material meeting baseline
criteria would be used and therefore no affects to HTRW would occur from use or
transport of this material. Because no HTRW material or sites would be affected by the
project no impacts to HTRW would occur with implementation of the project.
96

4.2

Resources Considered in Detail

4.2.1

Vegetation and Wildlife

This section describes the existing vegetation, wildlife, and habitats which occur
in the study area. Biological resources such as plants and animals are important because
they influence ecosystem functions and values, have intrinsic value, and are subject to a
number of statutory and regulatory requirements.
Regulatory Setting
Federal
Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act. The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act
requires the USACE to coordinate with the USFWS on water resources related projects to
obtain their views toward preservation of fish and wildlife resources and mitigation of
unavoidable impacts.
USACE Mitigation Plans. USACE is required under Section 2036(a)(3)(B) of
WRDA 2007, Public Law (PL) 110-114, § 2036(a)(3)(B), 121 Stat. 1093 (2007), Section
2036(a) to fully develop mitigation plans for water resource projects that include the
following: 1) monitoring until successful; 2) criteria for determining ecological success;
3) a description of available lands for mitigation and the basis for the determination of
availability; 4) the development of contingency plans (i.e., adaptive management); 5)
identification of the entity responsible for monitoring; and 6) establishing a consultation
process with appropriate Federal and state agencies in determining the success of
mitigation.
Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) and Executive Order (EO) 13186,
Conservation of Migratory Birds. The MBTA states that it is unlawful to kill, capture,
collect, possess, buy, sell, trade, or transport any migratory bird, nest, young, feather, or
egg in part or in whole, without a Federal permit issued in accordance with the MBTA’s
policies and regulations. Under EO 13186, Federal agencies are directed to evaluate the
impacts of their actions on migratory birds in NEPA documents and to conserve
migratory birds, giving priority to species of concern (listed by USFWS), and their
important habitats.
EO 13112, Invasive Species. Dated February 3, 1999, this EO directs Federal
agencies to expand and coordinate their efforts to combat the introduction and spread of
“invasive species” (i.e., noxious plants and animals not native to the U.S.). Non-native
flora and fauna can cause significant changes to ecosystems, upset ecological processes
and relationships, and cause harm to our nation’s agricultural and recreational sectors.

97

Those species that are likely to harm the environment, human health, or economy are of
particular concern.
State
California Endangered Species Act (Fish and Game Code Section 2050 et. seq.)
(CESA). This Act regulates the take of a species listed as threatened or endangered under
the state act. CESA does not require formal consultation; however, CEQA does require
that CDFW act as a reviewing agency for all CEQA documents if the fish and wildlife
resources of the state may be affected by the proposed action. If take of a California
listed species may occur, CDFW would require a Fish and Game Code Section 2081
Incidental Take Permit.
Affected Environment
Big Break and Little Franks Tracts are currently flooded islands that were
historically tidal marsh before levees were constructed and reclaimed for agriculture and
then became submerged when their levees failed. Before land reclamation for agriculture
and flood control activities around the turn of the 20th century, the Delta supported a
complex network of rivers and sloughs with in-channel islands and vast expanses of tidal
marsh. Much of the vegetation of the Delta (approximately 380,000 acres; 1,538 square
kilometers) was dominated by tidal marshes (Atwater 1980; Institute 1998). By 1930,
island reclamation was complete, and by 1980, only about 16,000 acres (65 square
kilometers) of marshes remained (Atwater 1980; The Bay Institute 1998). Today, these
areas of former tidal marshes consist primarily of channelized waterways surrounding
highly productive row-cropped agricultural islands that are protected from flooding by
over 1,300 miles (2,093 kilometers) of levees.
Despite the loss of more than 95 percent of historic tidal marsh habitat in the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (The Bay Institute 1998), fish and wildlife diversity is
high, with an estimated 200 species of birds, 55 species of fish, 22 species of reptiles, 58
species of mammals, and 9 species of amphibians occurring in the Delta (California
Department of Water Resources et al. 2013).
Freshwater intertidal marsh is the vegetation type and habitat proposed for
restoration under the current alternatives. Other planning efforts in the Delta are also
underway, including the Delta Vision Strategic Plan, the CALFED Ecosystem
Restoration Plan, and the Bay Delta Conservation Plan, to restore tidal marsh and
improve the ecological health of the Bay-Delta Ecosystem. The proposed Dutch Slough
Tidal Restoration Project, adjacent to and east of Big Break, will restore tidal wetlands
and other habitats on 1,166 acres of land owned by DWR in eastern Contra Costa County
near Oakley. The former dairy lands were slated for residential development, but were
instead purchased by the State so that declining natural habitats of the Delta could be
restored to the site. Restoration at Big Break and Dutch Slough would in combination
create a large continuous block of restored habitat which would be important for dispersal
of plant and wildlife populations and those species requiring large habitat blocks.
98

General Description of Habitat Types in the Study Area
This section describes the habitat types and the wildlife that occupy these habitats.
The description of existing conditions is based on a literature review, field visits, and
coordination with resource agencies.
Tidal Perennial Aquatic
The tidal perennial aquatic natural community is the dominant habitat cover type
within the flooded islands. This aquatic community in the Delta is identified as deep
water aquatic (greater than 10 feet deep from mean low low tide [lowest of the low tide in
a day]), shallow aquatic (less than or equal to 10 feet deep from mean low low tide), and
non-vegetated intertidal (mudflat) zones of estuarine bays, river channels, and sloughs
(CALFED Bay-Delta Program 2000). Under present water operation conditions in the
project area, tidal perennial aquatic is mainly freshwater, with brackish and saline
conditions occurring at times of high tides and low freshwater inflows.
Vegetation. The tidal perennial aquatic natural community is largely unvegetated.
Where vegetation exists, it can be separated into two categories: submerged aquatic
vegetation and floating vegetation (both rooted and non-rooted) (Cowardin et al. 1979).
The geographic extent of this vegetation is highly dynamic because it is largely
dependent on physical factors that are highly variable, such as depth, turbidity, water
flow, salinity, substrate, and nutrient with a nitrogen fixing bacteria that lives within its
tissues (Armstrong 1979). Invasive water hyacinth grows in dense mats that can have
harmful effects on native fish and plant species.
Wildlife. Zooplankton in the foodweb of the tidal perennial aquatic natural
community consume phytoplankton and detritus, and are fed upon by other consumers,
such as fish and macroinvertebrates. Water salinity is a major factor that influences the
distribution of zooplankton species in the tidal perennial aquatic natural community. In
the brackish portions of the project area, calanoid copepods, and cyclopoid copepods are
the primary zooplankton species, and mysid shrimp is the dominant macrozooplankton.
In freshwater regions, cladocerans and calanoid copepods are the dominant zooplankton
present (Kimmerer and Orsi 1996; Kimmerer 2004; Gewant and Bollens 2005; Winder
and Jassby 2010). It is used as habitat by fish for foraging, spawning, egg incubation and
larval development, juvenile nursery areas, and migratory corridors. Most species spend
their entire lives in the community while others may spend certain seasons or part of their
lives in habitats outside of the tidal perennial aquatic natural community depending on
the state of physical factors such as salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, flow rates, and
water temperature. The terrestrial species known to forage in tidal perennial aquatic
habitat include Townsend’s big-eared bat, California least tern, and giant garter snake.
In addition to its value as habitat for fish, the tidal perennial aquatic natural
community provides reproduction, feeding, and resting habitat for many species of
mammals and birds. Open water areas supply habitat for rest and foraging by water
99

birds, especially during heavy winter storms when open coastal waters become rough.
Bird species that use the inland open water include loons, gulls, cormorants, and diving
ducks (CALFED Bay-Delta Program 2000). A number of state and federally listed birds
feed on fish in the tidal perennial aquatic natural community, including bald eagle, and
California least tern.
Tidal Mudflat
The tidal mudflat natural community typically occurs as mostly unvegetated
sediment deposits in the intertidal zone between the mean higher high tide and the mean
lower low water tide. The community is typically associated with the tidal freshwater
and tidal brackish emergent wetland communities at its upper edge and the tidal perennial
aquatic community at its lower edge. The tidal mudflat natural community is ephemeral
and owes its physical existence to sediment erosion and deposition processes that differ
throughout the Delta and Suisun Marsh, and its biological characteristics to plant
succession (Golden and Fiedler 1991; Fiedler and Zebell 1993; Witham and Kareofelas
1994; Zebell and Fiedler 1996; Cappiella et al. 1999; Meisler 2002; Ruhl and
Schoellhamer 2004; McKee et al. 2006; Witham 2006). Inflows to the Delta import
suspended sediment, and the resuspension and deposition of that sediment are critical
accretion factors. Wave energy dissipation and levee maintenance are typical erosion
factors. The rate of plant succession on the sediments will vary depending on the supply
of plant propagules and the distance to plants that can colonize the sediment by extending
their root systems.
Vegetation. The tidal mudflat natural community is generally not vegetated, but
patches of two small special status plant species, Mason’s lilaeopsis and delta mudwort,
are found in this community type with the former being more abundant in brackish areas
and the latter more abundant in freshwater areas (Golden and Fiedler 1991; Fiedler and
Zebell 1993; Zebell and Fiedler 1996; Meisler 2002; Fiedler et al. 2007). Plant species in
mudflats are quite sensitive to inundation period and the plant community changes with
very slight changes in elevation and inundation period.
Wildlife. An important wildlife habitat function of the tidal mudflat natural
community is as foraging habitat for probing shorebirds, including godwits, willets, and
sandpipers. This habitat function only exists for shorebirds when the area of mudflat is
exposed by the tides. This community supports an extensive invertebrate community that
consists of benthic and interstitial species (crustaceans, bivalves, gastropods, aquatic
insects, and polychaetes) that provide forage to shorebirds. Special status species that are
supported by the tidal mudflat community include Townsend’s big-eared bat, California
clapper rail, delta mudwort, and Mason’s lilaeopsis. These species are further discussed
in Section 4.2.2. At lower intertidal elevations, the tidal mudflat natural community
functions as foraging area for waterfowl and shorebirds.

100

Tidal Freshwater Emergent Wetland
The tidal freshwater emergent wetland natural community is typically a
transitional community between the tidal perennial aquatic, and valley/foothill riparian
and various terrestrial upland communities across a range of hydrologic and edaphic
conditions. In the project area, the tidal freshwater emergent wetland natural community
often occurs at the shallow, slow-moving or stagnant edges of freshwater waterways in
the intertidal zone and is subject to frequent long duration flooding.
The tidal freshwater emergent wetland natural community is distributed in
narrow, fragmented bands along island levees, in-channel islands, shorelines, sloughs,
and shoals. Channelization, levee building, removal of vegetation to stabilize levees, and
upstream flood management have also reduced the extent of this community and altered
its ecological function through changes to flooding frequency, inundation duration, and
quantity of alluvial material deposition.
The tidal freshwater emergent wetland natural community occurs along a
hydrologic gradient in the transition zone between open water and riparian vegetation or
upland terrestrial vegetation such as grasslands or woodlands. In the project area, there
are often abrupt transitions to agricultural habitats and managed wetland natural
communities and also along the boundaries formed by levees and other artificial
landforms. The environmental conditions that support the tidal freshwater emergent
wetland natural community are dynamic with frequent flooding disturbances and
geomorphologic changes (i.e., alluvial deposition and scouring). Its constituent species
composition and ecosystem functions are consequently variable in space and time (The
Bay Institute 1998). As a result of the different sources of variability and the
anthropogenically restricted area in which it can occur, the community vegetation may be
distributed in small patches or in occasional large areas.
Soils underlying the tidal freshwater emergent wetland natural community are
heavily influenced by inundation period, water flow, and alluvial deposition. They are
hydric soils and when mineral based, their texture can vary from clay to sand; and when
based on organic material, can form peat beds (Goman and Wells 2000; Hitchcock et al.
2005; Drexler et al. 2009a). The soils are typically anaerobic due to frequent or
permanent saturation with slow decomposition rates resulting in the accumulation of
organic debris in various stages of decomposition. The composition of the vegetation is
limited to relatively few dominant species that are tolerant of inundation and anaerobic
soil conditions and typically are not tolerant of saline or brackish conditions (Holland and
Keil 1995).
Vegetation. The tidal freshwater emergent wetland natural community is
characterized by erect herbaceous hydrophytes (Holland and Keil 1995). The typical
vegetation of this type, as mapped by CDFW and adopted for vegetation mapping
purposes, is dominated by tall, perennial monocots that reproduce by seed as well as
vegetatively through rhizomes. However, the CDFW vegetation classification was based
on vegetation structure and species composition and did not consider ecosystem functions
101

such as location within or above the intertidal region along drainages. In many areas of
what is functionally tidal freshwater emergent wetland, woody species, especially
willows (Salix spp.), occur in the intertidal region and co-dominate the vegetation
(Atwater 1980; Watson 2006; EDAW 2007a; Watson and Byrne 2009). These intertidal
areas with woody vegetation were not distinguishable in the CDFW data set.
Cattails dominate the vegetation of this community along the Sacramento River;
while throughout the San Joaquin River area, bulrushes, tules, and common reed are more
often the dominant species (Atwater 1980; Watson 2006; EDAW 2007a; Hickson and
Keeler-Wolf 2007; Watson and Byrne 2009). In the far western portion of the Delta,
where tidal waters are generally fresh but may be brackish during periods of low outflow,
saltgrass becomes common (Boul and Keeler-Wolf 2008). Numerous native and
nonnative dicots and rooted aquatics also commonly occur in the tidal freshwater
emergent wetland natural community.
Wildlife. The tidal freshwater emergent wetland natural community provides
productive habitat for wildlife. Its vegetation and associated waterways provide food and
cover for numerous species of birds (e.g., waterfowl, wading birds), mammals, reptiles,
emergent aquatic insects, and amphibians. Fish species use tidal freshwater emergent
wetland habitat for foraging, juvenile rearing, and refugia. Terrestrial species that rely on
tidal freshwater emergent wetland for habitat include Townsend’s big-eared bat,
California black rail, Suisun song sparrow, tricolored blackbird, giant garter snake,
western pond turtle, California red-legged frog, delta mudwort, Delta tule pea, Mason’s
lilaeopsis, and Suisun marsh aster.
Although the remaining areas of tidal freshwater emergent wetlands in the project
area are highly altered, they remain critical wintering grounds for migratory birds. A
small number of wetland associated species, such as waterfowl and egrets, have
successfully adapted to foraging on some types of croplands that were converted from
historical wetland areas (California Department of Fish and Game 2005). Many of the
species of fish that use the tidal perennial aquatic natural community for habitat will also
use the tidal freshwater emergent wetland natural community as habitat. Younger stages
(e.g., larvae and fry) of some species rear in shallow waters that support emergent
vegetation. Many fish species use emergent vegetation as refuge from predation and high
flows (Bay Institute 1998).
Existing Vegetation Types in the Project Area
The dominant vegetation types in the project area include emergent tidal marsh,
riparian scrub/woodland, and submerged and floating aquatic vegetation. Big Break and
Little Franks Tracts are currently characterized by vast expanses of open water habitat.
Although these areas have been flooded for a number of years, these flooded islands have
not accumulated enough sediment to support the reestablishment and expansion of tidal
marsh vegetation. Vegetation cover type maps for each flooded island are shown in
Figures 4-1 (Big Break) and 4-2 (Little Franks Tract).

102

Big Break
Big Break is subject to daily tidal fluctuations and is at a sufficient distance from
the Bay that the tidal waters inundating this area have minimal salinity levels. A remnant
levee runs along the southern border of the open-water area. Riparian scrub vegetation
dominated by arroyo willow and Himalayan blackberry grows along the upper portions
of this levee, but the lower elevations of the levee support a low cover of tidal marsh
vegetation. Extensive stands of perennial emergent marsh are present within the open
water habitat. Different elevations have created a mosaic of emergent species in this
perennial freshwater marsh with common three-square in shallowly inundated areas,
cattail and tule in deeper waters, and California bulrush in the deepest waters (Vollmar
2000).
Flats along the shore support large stands of arroyo willow scrub. Riparian
habitats also support small stands of tree species such as Fremont cottonwood,
Goodding’s willow, northern California black walnut, coast live oak, prunus, and red
alder. A portion of the Big Break study area supports upland habitat. This upland area is
located in the southwestern corner of the study area and primarily supports alkali
grassland. Alkali grassland is dominated by perennial grasses including saltgrass and
creeping wildrye. Associated species are predominantly nonnative annual grasses and
forbs such as perennial pepperweed, wild oats, ripgut brome, telegraph weed, and spring
vetch.
Other upland habitats present at this location include nonnative tree stands and
disturbed or developed areas. The scattered stands of nonnative trees are dominated by
black locust, tree of heaven, and white poplar. Isolated individual trees are
predominantly nonnative species such as eucalyptus, tamarisk and prunus. Disturbed/
developed areas are dominated by nonnative and invasive plant species or support
buildings and/or paved roads. Infestations of egeria and water hyacinth are present
within the extensive open water habitat of Big Break.

103

104

Figure 4-2. Little Franks Tract Vegetation Map.

105

Little Franks Tracts
The two dominant vegetation types occurring at Little Franks Tract are emergent marsh and
riparian scrub. Tule and broadleaved cattail are the dominant species in the emergent marsh, which
occurs on the lower portions of remnant levees and in-channel islands. Associated species in this
vegetation type include sedges, rushes, smartweeds, and Delta mudwort. Riparian scrub is
predominantly found along the higher elevations of remnant levees and in-channel islands. The
dominant shrub/tree species in this area include willow and red alder, but scattered Fremont cottonwood
may be present. The understory is extensively infested with Himalayan blackberry and nonnative thistles
that create impenetrable thickets along the remnant levees. Native herbaceous wetland species in the
understory include water horehound, Suisun Marsh aster, Delta tule pea, and California loosestrife.
Although there was no description in the general plan, a small upland area was evident on the aerial
photograph in the southern portion of the study area. The majority of this flooded island is open water,
which supports infestations of egeria and water hyacinth (Center for Design Research et al. 1988).
Dredged Material Source Sites
Dredged material would be transported from existing dredged material O&M placement sites
currently used by the Sacramento DWSC and Stockton DWSC (Figure 3-8). The project would confine
areas of dredged material removal to only those usable portions of the sites that do not support sensitive
habitats. Impacts to sensitive habitats would be minimized and/or avoided. The existing habitat
conditions at these sites are described below.
Decker Island Site. This site encompasses most of Decker Island, except for a northern parcel
owned by USFWS, which is a wetland restoration site. A large berm running from northeast to
southwest through the site divides it into two distinctive parts: (1) the area east of the berm, which is
characterized by wetlands that transition to an emergent marsh in the southern portion; and (2) the area
west of the berm, which is dominated by non-native grassland, marked by a tamarisk community and
recent disturbance at the site’s center. At the time of survey, active pumping in the southern extent of
the western portion led to flooding, creating a temporary wetland. A wetland margin borders the
western edge of the site and the Sacramento DWSC. The usable portion of the site is located northwest
of the berm that divides the site into two sections. This area is primarily composed of non-native
grassland, irrigated agriculture, and general shrubs and dominated by peppergrass, bromes, and thistle
(Silybum spp.) (USFWS 2010e). There is a large tamarisk community around the center of the northern
half of the site, surrounding a recently disturbed area next to an old ferry landing. No wetlands occur
within the usable portion of the site. Sensitive habitats occurring within the usable portion of the site
include 0.87 acres of riparian habitat and 0.90 acres of open water.
Sherman Island - Scour Pond and McCormick Pit. Sherman Island is approximately 20 feet
below sea level. The island is bounded by the San Joaquin River on the south and the Sacramento River
on the north, and is protected by levees. Scour Pond and McCormack Pit are located along the southern
boundary of Sherman Island as shown in Figure 3-8. Both sites have historically received dredge
materials and has the material has used for levee rehabilitation and reinforcement on Sherman Island.
The vegetation type at the Scour Pond site consists of non-native grassland. A small pond is situated on
the southern boundary of the site. The vegetation type at the McCormack Pit site consists of non-native
grassland and ruderal barren cover types.
106

Bradford Island. The Bradford Island dredged material storage site encompasses 110 acres. The
site is specifically used for dredge materials from the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel along the San
Joaquin River. The vegetation type on the site consists of non-native grassland, ruderal barren cover
types, and native willow stands. The site is frequently used for cattle grazing.

4.2.2

Special Status Species

This section describes special status species that either occur or have the potential to occur in the
project area that may be potentially impacted by the project.
Regulatory Setting
Federal
Federal Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.)
The Federal Endangered Species Act requires that any action authorized by a Federal agency not
be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a threatened or endangered species, or result in the
destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species that is determined to be critical. Section 7
of the Endangered Species Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to consult with the USFWS and
NMFS to ensure that project actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or
threatened species, or result in the destruction or adverse modification of the critical habitat of these
species.
Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. §703-712)
This act implements treaties that the United States has signed with a number of countries to
protect birds that migrate across national borders. The act makes unlawful the taking, possessing,
pursing, capturing, transporting, or selling of any migratory bird, its nest or its eggs.
Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668-668c)
The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act prohibits anyone, without a permit issued by
USFWS, from "taking" bald eagles, including their parts, nests, or eggs. The Act provides criminal
penalties for persons who "take, possess, sell, purchase, barter, offer to sell, purchase or barter, transport,
export or import, at any time or any manner, any bald eagle ... [or any golden eagle], alive or dead, or
any part, nest, or egg thereof." The Act defines "take" as "pursue, shoot, shoot at, poison, wound, kill,
capture, trap, collect, molest or disturb.

107

Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801) (MagnusonStevens Act)
The Magnuson-Stevens Act establishes a management system for national marine and estuarine
fishery resources. This legislation requires that all Federal agencies consult with the National Marine
Fisheries Service (NMFS) regarding all actions or proposed action permitted, funded, or undertaken that
my adversely affect “essential fish habitat”. Essential fish habitat is defined as “waters and substrate
necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity.” The legislation states that
migratory routes to and from anadromous fish spawning grounds are considered essential fish habitat.
The phrase “adversely affect” refers to the creation of any impact that reduces the quality or quality of
essential fish habitat.
State
California Endangered Species Act (Fish and Game Code 2050 et seq.)
The California Endangered Species Act (CESA) generally parallels the main provisions of the
Federal Endangered Species Act and is administered by CDFW. CESA prohibits take of listed species
and state candidate species. State lead agencies are required to consult with CDFW to ensure that any
action it undertakes is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened
species, or result in destruction or adverse modification of habitat.
California Native Plant Protection Act (Fish and Game Code 1900 et seq.)
The California Native Plant Protection Act was enacted in 1977 and allows the California Fish
and Game Commission to designate plants as rare or endangered. There are 64 species, subspecies, and
varieties of plants that are protected as rare under the NPPA. The California Native Plant Protection Act
prohibits take of endangered or rare native plants.
Affected Environment
Information on special status species that may be affected by the project was gathered from
various sources:
•

The USFWS online services species list (US Fish and Wildlife Service, accessed on 16
December 2013);

•

CDFW’s California Natural Diversity Database (California Department of Fish and Game
2013);

•

The California Native Plant Society’s (California Native Plant Society 2013) online
Inventory of Rare and Endangered Vascular Plants of California (California Native Plant
Society .

Each database query for special-status species was based on a search of the USGS 7.5’
quadrangles on which the study area is located (i.e., Jersey Island [480C], Bouldin Island

108

[480D]), and its surrounding ten quadrangles (i.e., Holt [462B], Woodward Island [463A], Brentwood
[463B], Antioch South [464A], Thornton [479B], Terminous [479C], Isleton [480A], Rio Vista [480B],
Birds Landing [481A], and Antioch North [481D]. The resulting USFWS queries, as well as the lists
generated by the CNDDB and CNPS searches, are included in Appendix G. All lists were reviewed;
habitat preferences for each species were compared with the affected areas and project site description.
Those special status species known to occur, or with suitable habitat, in or near the project area are
identified in Table 4-1 and discussed in detail below.

Special Status Plant Species
The Delta is home to many special status plant species, many of which are endemic. Eight
special status plant species have been reported in the two USGS quadrangles (Jersey Island and Bouldin
Island) that include Big Break and Little Franks Tract (Table 4-1). None of these species are Federally
or State-listed as threatened or endangered. Information on these species, including distribution, habitat
requirements, and known/potential presence in the project area is in Appendix G. Another 34 special
status plant species occur in the 10 quadrangles that surround the 2 quadrangles where the project is
located. These species were identified as unlikely to occur in the project area due to unsuitable habitat
conditions and occurrence records. Information on these species is also in Appendix G.
Big Break
The field surveys conducted for the Big Break Marsh Restoration Project located two special
status plant species within tidal marsh vegetation, the Suisun Marsh aster (one population) and Mason’s
lilaeopsis (two populations) (Vollmar Consulting 2000). The records search of CNDDB (2013) reports
populations of the Suisun Marsh aster, Mason’s lilaeopsis, Delta mudwort, Bolander’s water-hemlock,
and Antioch Dunes evening-primrose (Oenothera deltoides ssp. howellii) at or in the vicinity of Big
Break.
Little Franks Tracts
The Franks Tract State Recreation Area 1988 General Plan reported the presence of the
following special-status species: Suisun Marsh aster, rose-mallow (Hibiscus lasiocarpus), Delta tule pea,
and Delta mudwort (Center for Design Research et al. 1988). The records search of (CNDDB 2013)
reports occurrences of the Suisun Marsh aster, eel-grass pondweed, woolly rose-mallow, Delta mudwort,
Delta tule pea, and Mason’s lilaeopsis at or in the vicinity of Little Franks Tract.
Special Status Wildlife Species
Nine special status animal species have the potential to occur in the project area (Table 4-1).
However, 24 special-status wildlife species were identified from database queries and literature searches
as having potential to occur in the study area (Appendix G). Fifteen of these species were eliminated
from further consideration since the alternatives are outside of the species range or no suitable habitat is
present.
Tricolored Blackbird
Status. The tricolored blackbird is a USFWS Bird of Conservation Concern and California State
Species of Special Concern. Tricolored blackbird is a medium-sized blackbird that is distinguished from
other blackbirds by its distinctive white-tipped red shoulder patches on mature males. Females show
varying amounts of red on the shoulders, and their plumage is sooty brown and streaked overall.

111

Distribution and Habitat. The species is largely endemic to California, with smaller populations
in Baja California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. During the breeding season, tricolored blackbirds
inhabit the Central Valley, the low foothills of the Sierra Nevada and Coast Range from Shasta County
south to Kern County, the coast from Sonoma County south to the Mexican border (Beedy 1991).
Tricolored blackbirds nest in small-to-large colonies (up to 50,000 individuals). They often
return to the same nesting areas in subsequent years, but will occasionally relocate their breeding
colonies if suitable habitat is available elsewhere. The tricolored blackbird breeds in large colonies near
fresh water, preferably in emergent wetland with tall, dense cattails or tules, but also in thickets of
willow, blackberry, and wild rose. Nesting colonies of tricolored blackbird are highly susceptible to
disturbance. Ideal breeding habitat for tricolored blackbird includes two elements: (1) dense nesting
substrate (i.e., blackberry or aquatic emergent vegetation), which provides protection from predators;
and (2) a large supply of insects within proximity to nests and occurring at the time of fledging.
Tricolored blackbirds forage in large flocks and may travel up to 4 miles (6.4 km) from nest or roost
sites to forage. Tricolored blackbirds forage on the ground in croplands, grassy fields, flooded land, and
along edges of ponds (Zeiner et al. 1990). In the Delta and Central Valley, foraging habitat consists
primarily of pastures and certain types of agricultural fields.
Potential for Occurrence in Project Area. A California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB)
record search did not identify occurrences within the Jersey Island and Bouldin Island USGS
quadrangles where the project is located. However, since there are recorded occurrences from other
quadrangles near the project area their presence cannot be discounted. There is significant potential for
future management and restoration work to encourage or generate suitable habitat for these species.
Tricolored blackbirds in the proximity of dense nesting substrate or aquatic emergent vegetation may be
present near the overland pumping pipeline layout over Sherman, Jersey, and Bradford Islands.
Western Pond Turtle
Status. The western pond turtle (Emys marmorata) is a California Species of Special Concern.
Distribution and Habitat. The western pond turtle is found west of the Sierra-Cascade crest from
western Washington south to northwest Baja California (Stebbins 2003). Western pond turtles inhabit
fresh or brackish water habitats characterized by areas of deep water, low flow velocities, moderate
amounts of riparian vegetation, warm water and/or ample basking sites, and underwater cover elements
such as large woody debris and rocks. Along major rivers, western pond turtles are often concentrated
in areas of optimal habitat, often in side channel and backwater areas. Turtles may move to off-channel
habitats, such as oxbows, during periods of high flows (Holland 1994).
Although adults are habitat generalists, hatchlings and juveniles require very specialized habitat
for survival through their first few years. Hatchlings spend much of their time feeding in shallow water
with dense vegetation of submergents or short emergents (Jennings and Hayes 1994). Habitats preferred
by juveniles are relatively scarce and subject to disturbance (Jennings et al. 1992). Although an aquatic
reptile, western pond turtles spend time on land basking, overwintering, and nesting, up to 1 km (0.6 mi)
away from aquatic habitats (Holland 1994).

112

Western pond turtle eggs are typically laid in June and July, though may be laid as early as late
April and as late as August (Holland 1994). Nests are generally located in grassy meadows, away from
trees and shrubs (Holland 1994), with canopy cover commonly less than about 10 percent Incubating
eggs are extremely sensitive to increased soil moisture, which can cause high mortality Egg-laying sites
vary from sandy shoreline to forest soil types. Young hatch in late fall, or overwinter in the nest and
emerge in early spring.
Although considered to be just one widely distributed species, it is likely that the pond turtle is a
complex of closely related subspecies, each adapted for a different region. The western pond turtle is
still common enough in the Bay-Delta watershed so that it is not difficult to find them in habitats
ranging from sloughs of the Delta and Suisun Marsh to pools in small streams. The problem is that most
individuals seen are large, old individuals; hatchlings and small turtles are increasingly rare. The causes
of the poor reproductive success are not well understood, but factors that need to be considered include
elimination of suitable breeding sites, predation on hatchlings by nonnative predators (e.g., largemouth
bass, bullfrogs), predation on eggs by nonnative wild pigs, diseases introduced by nonnative turtles, and
shortage of safe upland over-wintering refuges. If present trends continue, the western pond turtle will
deserve listing as a threatened species (it may already) (CALFED 2000).
Potential for Occurrence in the Project Area. There are many CNDDB occurrence records for
western pond turtle in Big Break and vicinity. The tidal sloughs and fresh water marshes of Big Break
provide habitat for Western pond turtles which have been observed basking on rocks, logs, and exposed
banks. The Big Break area has suitable breeding habitat for turtles, and females can lay their eggs in the
sandy banks and well-drained upland soils. There are no CNDDB occurrence records of the turtle at
Little Franks Tract despite the presence of prime riparian and marshy habitat. Western pond turtles in
the proximity of sandy banks and well-drained upland soils may be near the overland pumping pipeline
layout over Sherman, Jersey, and Bradford Islands.
Burrowing Owl
Status. The burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) is California state species of concern.
Distribution and Habitat. Burrowing owls in California historically ranged throughout the
Central Valley, in suitable habitat in coastal areas from Marin County to the Mexican border, and in
lower numbers in desert areas of the northeastern and southeastern portions of the state. Throughout the
vast majority of the burrowing owl's range in California, breeding owls now persist in only small,
declining populations of birds that are highly susceptible to extirpation.
Western burrowing owls prefer open grasslands and shrublands with perches and burrows. They
usually live and nest in the old burrows of California ground squirrels or other small mammals (Zeiner
et al. 1990), but also can nest in piles of wood or other debris. Burrows can be found on the sides of
hills, along roadside embankments, on levees, along irrigation canals, near fence lines, and on or near
other raised areas of land. The breeding season for burrowing owls extends from February 1 through
August 31 (CDFG 2012). Burrowing owls tend to be opportunistic feeders, with large arthropods,
mainly beetles and grasshoppers, comprising a large portion of their diet. The species is primarily
crepuscular (active at dusk and dawn), but will hunt throughout a 24-hour period.

113

Potential for Occurrence in the Project Area. There are three records of occurrence of the
burrowing owl within the project 5 miles of the northern extent of the project area. Field and row crops
and ruderal areas on Sherman and Brannan Islands provide suitable foraging habitat for burrowing owls
where they may nest in burrows in ruderal areas and along the edges of agricultural areas. Burrowing
owls in the proximity of agriculture and pasture lands may be present near the overland pumping
pipeline layout over Sherman, Jersey, and Bradford Islands.
Swainson’s Hawk
Status. The Swainson’s hawk (Buteo swainsoni) is listed as a threatened species under the
California Endangered Species Act (Fish and Game Code, Sections 2050 et seq.). The species was
listed by the California Fish and Game Commission in 1983. The Swainson’s hawk is not Federally
listed, however, the species is covered under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and is included on the
USFWS list of Birds of Conservation Concern (BCC). BCC species are those that the USFWS
considers potential candidates for federal listing.
Distribution and Habitat. Swainson’s hawks nest in the grassland plains and agricultural regions
of western North America from southern Canada (and possibly in the northern provinces and territories,
and Alaska) to northern Mexico. Historically, it nested throughout lowland California. However, the
current Swainson's hawk nesting distribution is limited to the Mojave Desert, northeastern California,
the Central Valley, and a few isolated locations in the Owens Valley. Swainson's hawk typically occurs
in California only during the breeding season (March through September) and winters in Mexico and
Central and South America. The species was once thought to winter exclusively in Argentina; however,
recent telemetry studies (satellite radio) have shown the species to winter in Mexico, with additional
detections in Central America and South America. The Central Valley population migrates only as far
south as Central Mexico (Estep 2008). Additionally, 30 individual hawks have been wintering in the
Delta for several years (Estep 2008), and there are records of small numbers of Swainson’s hawks
wintering in southern Florida and Texas.
Throughout its range, the Swainson’s hawk nests almost exclusively in only a few species of
trees, such as oaks, cottonwoods, sycamores, or willows (Schlorff and Bloom 1983, CDFG 1994) near
large, sparsely vegetated flatlands characterized by valleys, plateaus, broad flood plains, and large open
expanses . Though Swainson’s hawks are not an obligate riparian species, the availability of nesting
substrate is closely tied to riparian areas, usually associated with main river channels. During the
breeding season, Swainson's hawks require suitable foraging habitat in association with suitable nesting
habitat. Swainson's hawk nesting preference is for large valley oaks (Quercus lobata), cottonwoods
(Populus fremontii), or willow (Salix goodingii). In the interior of the Delta, the species will often nest
in smaller trees owing to the lack of large trees (Estep 2001). Nesting sites tend to be adjacent or within
close proximity to suitable foraging grounds, which may include recently harvested hay, wheat, or
alfalfa crops, low-growing crops such as beets or tomatoes, open pasture, nonflooded rice fields, or postharvest cereal grain crops (Bloom 1980; CDFG 1992, 1994). Swainson’s hawks forage in open areas
with reduced vegetative cover that provides good visibility of prey items such as voles, ground squirrels,
pocket gophers, and deer mice.

114

Potential for Occurrence in Project Area. Swainson’s hawks breed close to Franks Tract at
Bouldin Island (CNDDB), however, due the lack of suitable trees for nesting at Big Break and Little and
Franks Tract are not known to breed within the project area. Swainson’s hawk in the proximity of
agriculture and pasture lands may be present the near the overland pumping pipeline layout over
Sherman, Jersey, and Bradford Islands.
Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle
Status. The valley elderberry longhorn beetle (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus) (VELB) is
Federally listed threatened is Federally listed as threatened. The USFWS has designated critical habitat
for VELB along the American River Parkway and in an area within the Sacramento metropolitan area
(54 FR 48229). The species has no State status (the State of California does not list insects).
Distribution and Habitat. The VELB is endemic to the Central Valley and is found in riparian
habitats and associated uplands where the elderberry (sambucus spp.), the beetle’s food plant, grows.
The beetle is a pith-boring species that depends on elderberry plants during its entire life cycle. Larvae
feed on tree pith, while adults eat the foliage and possibly the flowers of the plants. The adult stage of
the VELB is short-lived, and most of the life cycle is spent in the larval stage. The adults are active
from early March through early June with mating occurring in May. Eggs are laid singly, or in small
groups, in crevices in elderberry bark and hatch in about 10 days. Larvae bore into the pith of elderberry
roots, branches, and trunks to create an opening in the stem within which they pupate, remaining in this
stage for one to two years before emerging as adults. After metamorphosing into an adult, the VELB
chews a circular exit hole through which it emerges, sometime during the period of late March to June.
It has been suggested that the VELB is a poor disperser, based on the spatial distribution of occupied
shrubs (USFWS 1997).
Potential for Occurrence in Project Area. There are no CNDDB records in the project area or in
the vicinity of the dredged material placement sites. Field surveys did not identify elderberry shrubs in
the project area. Elderberry shrubs may be present in the overland pumping pipeline layout over
Sherman, Jersey, and Bradford Islands.
California Black Rail
Status. The California black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus) is a State-listed
threatened species.
Distribution and Habitat. The California black rail is a rarely seen, year-round resident of saline,
brackish, and fresh emergent wetlands. Aside from recently discovered populations in the Central
Valley, viable populations of the species are found only in the Suisun Marsh, San Francisco Bay, and the
Delta. The California black rail is associated with tidal and nontidal emergent wetlands. The
population and distribution of this species have declined substantially, primarily as a result of
reclamation of its wetland habitats. Habitat loss and declining population have warranted its listing as
threatened under CESA. Historical and current loss or degradation of salt, brackish, and freshwater
marshes are the major factors that limit this species in the Delta (CALFED 2000).

115

Important habitats for the species include tidal perennial and nontidal perennial aquatic, deadend and open-ended sloughs, seasonal wetland and aquatic, saline and fresh emergent wetland, and
midchannel islands and shoals. Many tidal habitats, including those that support pickleweed, bulrushes,
and saltgrass, are critical types for this species that need to be protected, and only a small percentage of
their historical extent remains. Upper wetland or upland areas adjacent to these habitat areas provide
nesting and escape cover during high tides and floods. Black rails are especially abundant in undiked
tidal marshes of Suisun Marsh. They are most often associated with dense stands of American bulrush
(Scirpus americanus) immediately adjacent to high marsh meadows supporting pickleweed-saltgrass
associations. They are often associated with soft bird’s-beak, an endangered plant of the high tidal
marsh (Grinnell and Miller 1944).
Potential Occurrence in Project Area. California black rails are reported to occur in fringing
tidal marshes adjacent to Big Break, and they are known to occur in tidal marshes in the study area.
Pallid Bat
Status. The pallid bat is a California Species of Special Concern.
Distribution and Habitat. The pallid bat is widespread in California, except for the high Sierra
Nevada Range from Shasta to Kern counties, and in the northwest corner of the state (Zeiner et al.
1990b). Pallid bats occupy a variety of habitats, from arid deserts to grasslands to conifer forests. At
low- to mid-elevations, pallid bats are particularly associated with oak habitat (Pierson and Rainey
2002). Roosts (including day, night, and maternity roosts) are typically located in rock crevices and
cliffs, but can also be found in tree hollows and caves (Hermanson and O’Shea 1983; Lewis 1994;
Pierson et al. 1996, 2001). In more urban settings, roosts are frequently associated with human
structures such as abandoned buildings, abandoned mines, and bridges (Pierson et al. 1996, 2001).
Overwintering roosts require relatively cool and stable temperatures out of direct sun light. Pallid bats
may forage 1 to 3 miles from their day roost, and glean prey from the ground (Zeiner et al. 1990b).
The pallid bat is a colonial species, with a typical maternal colony size of 50 to 300
(Hermanson and O’Shea 1983, Lewis 1994, Pierson et al. 1996). Breeding occurs from late October to
February. With the average litter size of two, the young are born between April and July and are
typically weaned in August (Sherwin and Rambaldini 2005).
Potential for Occurrence in the Project Area. Pallid bats may roost within the riparian forest
near the study area, and may forage over the proposed sites and nearby fields. Big Break is strewn with
old structures that provide potential roosting or hibernaculum habitat for several bat species, including
the pallid bat (EBRPD 2001). Pallid bats in the proximity of riparian forests and structures may be
present near the overland pumping pipeline layout over Sherman, Jersey, and Bradford Islands.
Western Red Bat
Status. The western red bat is a California Species of Special Concern.

116

Distribution and Habitat. In California, western red bats have been observed near the Pacific
Coast, Central Valley, and the Sierra Nevada. Usually found at lower elevations, recent acoustic
surveys in California have documented that western red bats, while relatively rare, are broadly
distributed at elevations up to 8,202 feet in the Sierra Nevada (Pierson et al. 2000, 2001; Pierson and
Rainey 2003). Western red bat roosts have often been observed in edge habitats—near streams, fields,
orchards, or urban areas (Zeiner et al. 1990b). This species roosts non-colonially in dense canopies and
within tree foliage, beneath overhanging leaves (Constantine 1959, Shump and Shump 1982), from 2 to
40 feet above ground level (Zeiner et al. 1990b). Studies in the Central Valley found that summering
populations of red bats are substantially more abundant in remnant riparian stands of cottonwood or
sycamore greater than 164 feet wide than in younger, less extensive stands (Pierson et al. 2000).
Western red bats may forage up to 0.3 to 0.6 of a mile from their day roost (Zeiner 1990b). Red
bats forage at both canopy height and low over the ground (Shump and Shump 1982). This species
feeds primarily on small moths, but its diet may include a variety of other insects such as crickets,
beetles, and cicadas (Zeiner et al.1990b).
Western red bats mate in August and September. Breeding females are found in association with
the same cover requirements as for other roost sites, and with cottonwood/sycamore riparian habitat
along large river drainages in the Central Valley (Ziener et al. 1990b, Pierson and Rainey 2003).
Fertilization is delayed until March or April. After an 80- to 90-day gestation period, pups are born
from late-May through early-July.
Potential for Occurrence in the Project Area. Western red bats may roost near the study area in
trees, and may forage in the nearby fields. CNDDB records indicate that the bats known to occur on
Brannan Island and near Antioch.
Giant Garter Snake
Status. The giant garter snake (Thamnophis gigas) is Federally and State-listed as threatened.
Distribution and Habitat. The giant garter snake is endemic to wetlands in the Sacramento and
San Joaquin valleys (Hansen and Brode 1980). The current distribution extends from near Chico in
Butte County south to the Mendota Wildlife Area in Fresno County. No occurrences of giant garter
snakes are known from the northern portion of the San Joaquin Valley north to the eastern fringe of the
Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, where the floodplain of the San Joaquin River is limited to a
relatively narrow trough (Hansen and Brode 1980, 58 FR 54053). The resulting gap of approximately
60 miles separates the southern and northern populations (Hansen and Brode 1980, CNDDB 2011).
Rice fields and their adjacent irrigation and drainage canals and ditches serve an important role
as aquatic habitat for the snakes. During the summer, some snakes use the flooded rice fields as long as
their prey is present in sufficient densities. In late summer, rice fields provide important nursery areas
for newborns. In late summer/fall, water is drained from the rice fields and the snakes prey items
become concentrated in the remaining pockets of standing water, which allow the snakes to gorge before
the winter their period of winter inactivity (USFWS 1999). It appears that the majority of the snakes
move back into the canals and ditches as the rice fields are drained, although a few may overwinter in

117

the fallow fields, where they hibernate within burrows in the small berms separating the rice checks
(Hansen 1998).
Potential for Occurrence in Project Area. There are only two isolated records of giant garter
snake on the south side of the San Joaquin River in the northern aspect of the species’ range. Although
the historical and current distribution of giant garter snake in the Delta is poorly understood, the south
bank of the San Joaquin River lies within the apparent gap between the northern and southern
populations (CNDDB 2011). The nearest locality record to the south lies more than 50 air miles distant
in Madera County; no giant garter snakes are documented in Stanislaus County between the documented
extremes of the documented extremes of the Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin Valley populations.
A giant garter snake was found on Webb Tract (adjacent to Franks Tract to the North) during
April, 2002 near the ferry dock. Sherman Island (adjacent to Lower Sherman Island to the east) is
identified for recovery efforts in the Draft Recovery Plan for Giant Garter Snakes (USFWS 1999). One
giant garter snake was found in 1998 near Sherman and Decker Islands, but it is not known whether this
snake represented a resident population in the western Delta or was washed into the Delta from highwater flows in the winter. Another garter snake was observed at the north end of the Antioch Bridge
before the mid 1980s (IES 2000).
Intensive trapping surveys conducted within Contra Costa County independently by Eric Hansen
and by Biological, Inc. have failed to detect giant garter snake. Likewise, Swaim intensively trapped in
regions northeast of Oakley in 2003 and 2005, including Marsh Creek, Big Break, and Contra Costa
Canal, without success (Swaim 2004, Swaim 2005a-f, Swaim 2006).
Giant garter snake in potentially using drainage and irrigation channels may be present near the
overland pumping pipeline layout over Sherman, Jersey, and Bradford Islands.
Special Status Fish Species
The Bay–Delta estuary, including the Delta flooded islands, serves as habitat for a variety of
special status fish species, several of which have been listed for protection under the Federal and/or
California Endangered Species Acts. Central Valley steelhead trout are present seasonally within the
Delta. Green sturgeon inhabit Suisun Bay and the Delta. Delta smelt and juvenile Chinook salmon
identified as winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon have been collected within Suisun Bay and the
Delta, including the flooded islands.
Chinook salmon, (winter-run, federally- and state-listed as endangered; Central Valley fall/latefall-run, a federal candidate species and California Species of Special Concern; and spring-run,
federally- and state-listed as threatened) and steelhead, (Central Valley Evolutionary Significant Unit or
ESU, federally-listed as threatened) use the Delta in the vicinity of Little Franks Tract and Big Break as
a migratory corridor. In addition, Delta smelt, a threatened species, have been documented within the
waters of Suisun Bay and the Delta, including the flooded islands. Suisun Bay and the Delta, including
Big Break and Little Franks Tract are in the area designated as Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) for
managed species, including Pacific salmon. Table 4-1 shows the listed species that have the potential to
occur within the project area.

118

Green Sturgeon
Green Sturgeon are listed as a Federally threatened species under the Federal Endangered
Species Act. Under the California Endangered Species Act green sturgeon are listed as a species of
concern.
Distribution and Habitat. Green Sturgeon are found in the lower reaches of large rivers from
British Columbia south to the Sacramento River. The southernmost spawning population is in the
Sacramento River. Spawning populations existed historically in the Eel and Klamath-Trinity River
systems (Adams et al. 2002). In the Central Valley, spawning habitat may have extended to the Butte
Creek watershed. Currently, spawning occurs in the mainstem Sacramento River and some spawning
may occasionally take place in the Feather River (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002). Green Sturgeon have
been observed in the Sacramento River near RBDD, near Hamilton City, and in the Delta and San
Francisco Bay (Moyle 2002). Fish monitoring efforts at RBDD and the Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District
(GCID) pumping facility on the upper Sacramento River have recorded between zero and 2,068 juvenile
North American Green Sturgeon per year (Adams et al. 2002). Catches of sub-adult and adult North
American Green Sturgeon by the IEP investigations between 1996 and 2004 ranged from one to 212
Green Sturgeon per year, with the highest catch in 2001. No Green Sturgeon juveniles or adults have
been documented in the San Joaquin River, although (Moyle 2002) suggests that reproduction may have
taken place in the San Joaquin River because adults have been captured at Santa Clara Shoal and
Brannan Island (Moyle 2002).
Little is known about movements, habitat use, and feeding habits of green sturgeon. Green
sturgeon have been salvaged at the State and Federal fish collection facilities in every month, indicating
that they are present in the Delta year-round. Juveniles and adults are reported to feed on benthic
invertebrates, including shrimp and amphipods, and small fish (NMFS 2005c).
Potential for Occurrence in Project Area. Green Sturgeon may occur seasonally within Big
Break and Little Franks Tract as juveniles and adults. The area may allow the upstream passage of
adults and the downstream emigration of juveniles (NMFS 2006).
Delta Smelt
Status. Delta smelt are listed as a threatened species under both the California and Federal
Endangered Species Acts.
Distribution and Habitat. Delta smelt are endemic to the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta
estuary. Delta smelt inhabit the freshwater portions of the Delta and Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers
and the low-salinity portions of Suisun Bay. They typically are found in shallow water (less than 10
feet) where salinity ranges from 2 to 7 parts per thousand (ppt), although they have been observed at
salinities between 0 and 18.4 ppt. Delta smelt have relatively low fecundity and most live for 1 year.
They feed on planktonic copepods, cladocerans, amphipods, and insect larva (Moyle 2002).
Adult Delta smelt migrate upstream into channels and sloughs of the eastern Delta during fall
and winter in preparation for spawning. Delta smelt live their entire life cycle in the Sacramento–San
Joaquin Delta. USFWS has prepared a recovery plan for Delta smelt that identifies criteria for
119

evaluating the status of the Delta smelt population (USFWS 1996). These criteria include annual indices
of abundance and geographic distribution in the estuary as determined through CDFW’s fall mid-water
trawl surveys. Indices of abundance and geographic distribution of Delta smelt have improved in recent
years. USFWS continues to evaluate the available scientific information regarding the status of Delta
smelt and the performance of various management actions designed to improve protection, reduce
mortality, and enhance habitat quality and availability within the estuary.
Potential for Occurrence in Project Area. As a result of their life history and geographic
distribution, Delta smelt may occur seasonally within Big Break and Little Franks Tract as eggs, larvae,
juveniles, and adults. Juvenile and adult Delta smelt are most abundant in the central Delta in the
vicinity of Little Franks Tract during the fall, winter, and spring (CDFW unpublished data). Larval,
juvenile, and adult Delta smelt are most abundant in the western Delta and Suisun Bay in the vicinity of
Big Break during spring, summer, and fall (CDFW unpublished data).
Sacramento River Winter-run Chinook Salmon
Status. Winter-run Chinook salmon is Federally and State-listed as an endangered species. The
National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) designated critical habitat for Sacramento River winter-run
Chinook salmon in 1993 (58 FR 33212). The critical habitat designation includes the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta and the Sacramento River within all accessible reaches.
Distribution and Habitat. Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon spend 1 to 3 years in
the ocean. Adult winter-run Chinook salmon leave the ocean and migrate through the Delta into the
Sacramento River from December through July, with peak migration in March. Adults spawn from
mid-April through August, and egg incubation continues through October (Moyle 2002). The primary
spawning habitat in the Sacramento River is above Red Bluff Diversion Dam at river mile (RM) 243,
although spawning has been observed downstream as far as RM 218 (NMFS 2001). Spawning success
below the Red Bluff Diversion Dam may be limited primarily by warm water temperatures (Yoshiyama
et al. 1998). Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon smolts (i.e., juveniles that are
physiologically ready to enter seawater) may migrate through the Delta and bay to the ocean from
November through May (Yoshiyama et al. 1998). In general, juvenile abundance in the Delta increases
in response to increased Sacramento River flow (Brandes and McLain 2001).
Potential for Occurrence in Project Area. Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon occur
in the Delta either as adults migrating upstream to their spawning habitat or as juveniles, rearing and
migrating towards the ocean. Winter-run Chinook salmon have the potential to occur in the study area.
Although the majority of adult winter-run Chinook salmon migrate upstream in the main-stem
Sacramento River, there is a probability, although low, that adults may migrate into the central Delta.
The majority of adult winter-run Chinook salmon migrate upstream in the Sacramento River past
Sherman Lake. The occurrence of adult winter-run Chinook salmon in the central Delta, including Big
Break and Little Franks Tract, although expected to be very low, would be limited to winter and early
spring adult upstream migration. Because winter-run Chinook salmon do not spawn within Suisun Bay
or the Delta, there is no probability that habitat enhancement projects in the Delta flooded islands would
adversely or beneficially affect winter-run Chinook salmon spawning or egg incubation.

120

Central Valley Spring-run Chinook Salmon
Status. The Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon ESU was Federally listed as threatened
on 16 September 1999 (64 FR 50394). Their threatened status was reaffirmed in the NMFS final listing
determination issued on 28 June 2005 (70 CFR 37160). Critical habitat for Central Valley spring-run
Chinook salmon was designated by NMFS on 2 September 2005 (70 FR 52488). Designated critical
habitat includes the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary, mainstem Sacramento River upstream to Keswick
Dam, and most of the Sacramento Valley’s perennial tributaries with established spring salmon runs,
including the Feather River and Feather River Hatchery.
Distribution and Habitat. Spring-run Chinook salmon were historically widely distributed and
abundant within the Sacramento and San Joaquin river systems (Yoshiyama et al. 1998). Spring-run
Chinook salmon historically migrated upstream into the upper reaches of the main-stem rivers and
tributaries for spawning and juvenile rearing (Moyle 2002). Construction of major dams and reservoirs
on these river systems eliminated access to the upper reaches for spawning and juvenile rearing, and
completely eliminated the spring-run Chinook salmon population from the San Joaquin River system
(Moyle 2002). Spring-run Chinook salmon abundance has declined substantially (NMFS 2009), and
the geographic distribution of the species in the Central Valley has also declined substantially. Springrun spawning and juvenile rearing currently occur consistently in only a small fraction of their previous
geographic distribution, including populations inhabiting Deer, Mill, and Butte creeks, the main-stem
Sacramento River, several other local tributaries on an intermittent basis, and the lower Feather River
(Moyle 2002). Recent genetic studies show that spring-run Chinook salmon returning to the lower
Feather River are genetically similar to fall-run Chinook salmon. Hybridization between spring-run and
fall-run Chinook salmon, particularly on the Feather River where both stocks are produced within the
Feather River hatchery, is a factor affecting the status of the spring- run Chinook salmon population.
NMFS is in the process of developing a recovery plan for Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon.
Probability of Occurrence in Project Area. Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon occur in
the Delta either as adults migrating upstream to their spawning habitat, or as juveniles, rearing and
migrating towards the ocean. Spring-run Chinook salmon have the potential to occur in the study area
due to the presence of rearing and migratory habitat. Although the majority of adult spring-run Chinook
salmon migrate upstream in the main-stem Sacramento River passing Sherman Lake, there is a
probability, although low, that adults may migrate into the central Delta. The occurrence of adult
spring-run Chinook salmon in the western and central Delta in the vicinity of Big Break and Little
Franks Tract, although expected to be very low, would be limited to the late winter and spring adult
upstream migration. Because spring-run Chinook salmon do not spawn in Suisun Bay or the Delta,
there is no probability that habitat enhancement projects in the Delta flooded islands would adversely or
beneficially affect spring-run Chinook salmon spawning or egg incubation.
Central Valley Steelhead
Status. The Central Valley steelhead is a Federally and State-listed threatened species. The
Central Valley steelhead Distinct Population Segment DPS (formerly ESU) was Federally listed as
threatened on 19 March 1998 (63 FR 13347) and its threatened status was reaffirmed in the NMFS final
listing determination on 5 January 2006 (71 FR 834). Critical habitat for Central Valley steelhead was

121

designated on 2 September 2005 (70 FR 52488), and includes all river reaches accessible to steelhead in
the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and their tributaries.
Distribution and Habitat. Central Valley steelhead historically migrated upstream to the high
gradient upper reaches of Central Valley streams and rivers for spawning and juvenile rearing.
Construction of dams and impoundments on most Central Valley rivers has created impassable barriers
to upstream migration and substantially reduced the geographic distribution of steelhead. Although
quantitative estimates of the number of adult steelhead returning to Central Valley streams to spawn are
not available, anecdotal information and observations indicate that population abundance is low.
Steelhead distribution is currently restricted to the main-stem Sacramento River downstream of Keswick
Dam, the Feather River downstream of Oroville Dam, the American River downstream of Nimbus Dam,
the Mokelumne River downstream of Comanche Dam, and a number of smaller tributaries to the
Sacramento River system, Delta, and San Francisco Bay. The project areas within the San Joaquin river
system serve as (EFH) for managed species, including Pacific salmon. Big Break and Little Franks
Tract support juvenile rearing and migration.
Steelhead have one of the most complex life histories of any salmonid species, exhibiting both
anadromous and freshwater resident life histories. Freshwater residents of the species are referred to as
rainbow trout, and those exhibiting an anadromous life history are called steelhead. The Central Valley
steelhead population is composed of both naturally spawning steelhead and steelhead produced in
hatcheries.
In the Sacramento River, adult winter steelhead migrate upstream during most months of the
year, beginning in July, peaking in September, and continuing through February or March. Spawning
occurs primarily from January through March, but may begin as early as late December and may extend
through April Individual steelhead may spawn more than once, returning to the ocean between each
spawning migration. Juvenile steelhead rear a minimum of 1 year, but typically spend 2 or more years
in fresh water before migrating to the ocean during smoltification (the process of physiological change
that allows ocean survival). Juvenile migration to the ocean generally occurs from December through
August. The peak months of juvenile migration are January to May (McEwan 2001).
Potential for Occurrence in Project Area. Central Valley steelhead occur in the Delta as adults,
migrating upstream to their spawning habitat, and as juveniles and smolts rearing and migrating toward
the ocean. Central Valley steelhead have the potential to occur in the study area due to the presence of
rearing and migratory habitat. Although the majority of adult steelhead migrate upstream in the mainstem Sacramento River, there is a probability that adults migrate through the central Delta and would be
present seasonally in the vicinity of Big Break and Little Franks Tract. The occurrence of adult
steelhead within the Delta, and potentially within Delta flooded islands, would be limited to the winter
and early spring adult upstream migration. Because steelhead do not spawn in Suisun Bay or the Delta,
there is no probability that habitat enhancement projects in Delta flooded islands would adversely or
beneficially affect steelhead spawning or egg incubation.

122

Essential Fish Habitat
The San Francisco Bay, Suisun Bay, and the western and central Delta, including Big Break and
Little Franks Tract, have been designated as Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) by the Pacific Fisheries
Management Council (PFMC) to protect and enhance habitat for coastal marine fish and
macroinvertebrate species that support commercial fisheries. The Sustainable Fisheries Act (PL 104297) requires all Federal agencies to consult with the Secretary of Commerce on proposed activities that
may adversely affect any designated EFH (Office of Habitat Conservation 1999). The EFH provisions
of the act are designed to protect fishery habitat from being lost as a result of disturbance and
degradation. Under PFMC’s Pacific Coast Salmon Fishery Management Plan, the entire San Francisco
Bay–Delta estuary (including the flooded islands) has been designated as EFH for spring-, fall-, late
fall- and winter-run Central Valley Chinook salmon (Pacific salmon). These areas serve as a
migratory corridor, holding area, and rearing habitat for adult and juvenile salmon.
Critical Habitat
The Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and the Bay–Delta estuary serve as a migration corridor
for anadromous salmonids, which have been listed for protection under the California and/or Federal
Endangered Species Acts. Listed salmonids that occur seasonally in the Delta in the vicinity of the
flooded islands include winter-run Chinook salmon, spring-run Chinook salmon, and steelhead trout.
The Sacramento River and Bay–Delta estuary are designated as critical habitat by NMFS for winter-run
Chinook salmon. These areas of the estuary were designated as critical habitat for spring-run Chinook
salmon and steelhead; however, the designation has been suspended pending further review. The Bay–
Delta estuary, including the flooded islands, has been designated as critical habitat by USFWS for Delta
smelt.

4.2.3

Water Quality

This section describes the existing surface and groundwater water resources and quality, and
jurisdictional wetlands in the project area. Water quality analysis is divided into conventional pollutants
and bioaccumulation potential. For this analysis, conventional pollutants analyzed are:
•

pH;

•

Turbidity;

•

Total dissolved solids (TDS);

•

Dissolved oxygen (DO);

•

Nutrients, including total organic carbon (TOC), nitrogen, and phosphorus;

•

Trace elements including arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, zinc.

123

Regulatory Setting
Federal
Clean Water Act
The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the primary Federal law governing water pollution. It
established the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into waters of the U.S. and gives
the USEPA the authority to implement pollution control programs, such as setting wastewater standards
for industries (USEPA 2002). In some states, such as California, the USEPA has delegated authority to
regulate the CWA to state agencies.
Section 401 of the CWA regulates the water quality for any activity that may result in any inwater work or discharge into navigable waters. These actions must not violate Federal water quality
standards. The Central Valley RWQCB administers Section 401 in California, and either issues or
denies water quality certifications that typically include project-specific requirements established by the
RWQCB to ensure attainment of water quality standards.
Section 404 of the CWA requires that a permit be obtained from the USEPA and the Corps when
an action will result in discharge of dredged or fill material into wetlands and waters of the U.S. Under
Section 404, the Corps regulates such discharges and issues individual and/or general permits for these
activities. Before the Corps can issue a permit under Section 404, it must determine that the project is in
compliance with the CWA Section 404(b)(1) guidelines. The 404(b)(1) guidelines specify that “no
discharge of dredged or fill material shall be permitted if there is a practical alternative to the proposed
discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem, so long as the alternative
does not have other significant adverse environmental consequences” (40 CFR 230.10[a]). The USEPA
has “veto” authority over permits issued by the Corps.
When conducting its own civil works projects, the Corps does not issue permits to themselves.
Rather, the Corps would comply with the guidelines and substantive requirements of the Clean Water
Act, including Section 404, and Section 401. The discharge of fill material would be required to comply
with 404(b)(1) guidelines with the inclusion of appropriate measures to minimize pollution or adverse
effects on the aquatic ecosystem. A Section 401 water quality certification will be required from the
Central Valley RWQCB.
The project would also require an NPDES permit since it would disturb 1 or more acre of land
and involves possible storm water discharges to surface waters. Prior to construction, the contractor
would be required to prepare a SWPPP and then submit a Notice of Intent form to the Central Valley
RWQCB, requesting approval of the proposed work. This storm water plan would identify best
management practices to be used to avoid or minimize any adverse effects of construction on surface
waters. Once the work is completed, the contractor would submit a Notice of Termination in order to
terminate coverage by the NPDES permit.

124

State
Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act
The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act of 1970 established the SWRCB and nine
RWQCBs within the State of California. These groups are the primary state agencies responsible for
protecting California water quality to meet present and future beneficial uses and regulating
appropriative surface rights allocations. The preparation and adoption of water quality control plans, or
Basin Plans, and statewide plans, is the responsibility of the SWRCB. State law requires that Basin
Plans conform to the policies set forth in the California Water Code beginning with Section 13000 and
any State policy for water quality control. These plans are required by the California Water Code
(Section 13240) and supported by the Federal CWA. Section 303 of the CWA requires states to adopt
water quality standards which "consist of the designated uses of the navigable waters involved and the
water quality criteria for such waters based upon such uses." According to Section 13050 of the
California Water Code, Basin Plans consist of a designation or establishment for the waters within a
specified area of beneficial uses to be protected and water quality objectives to protect those uses.
Adherence to Basin Plan water quality objectives protects continued beneficial uses of water bodies.
Affected Environment
Primary Factors Affecting Water Quality
Primary factors affecting water quality in the project area include patterns of land use in the
upstream watersheds and the Delta, operations of the State Water Project (SWP) and Central Valley
Project (CVP). . The CVP is operated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation; it is one of the world’s
largest water storage and transport systems. The SWP is a federal water management project under the
supervision of the United States Bureau of Reclamation. The SWP provides irrigation and municipal
water to much of California's Central Valley by regulating and storing water in reservoirs in the waterrich northern half of the state, and transporting it to the water-poor San Joaquin Valley by means of a
series of canals, aqueducts and pump plants, some shared with the SWP.
Point and nonpoint pollutant sources include historic and recent drainage from inactive and
abandoned mines and related debris/sediment, industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plant
discharges, agricultural drainage, urban stormwater runoff, atmospheric deposition, recreational uses,
and metabolic waste (e.g., pathogens) from wildlife. Other major point sources consist primarily of
municipal wastewater treatment plants and nonpoint sources consist of urban stormwater runoff of
pollutants. Natural erosion and instream sediments, atmospheric deposition, and geothermal inputs also
affect Delta water quality. The principal contaminants and conditions affecting water quality in the Delta
are as follows (CALFED Bay-Delta Program 2000).
•

Historical drainage and sediment discharged from upstream mining operations in the late
1800s and early 1900s has contributed metals, such as cadmium, copper, and mercury.

•

Stormwater runoff can contribute metals, sediment, pathogens, organic carbon, nutrients,
pesticides, dissolved solids (salts), petroleum products, and other chemical residues.

125

•

Wastewater discharges from treatment plants can contribute salts, metals, trace organics,
nutrients, pathogens, pesticides, organic carbon, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and
oil and grease.

•

Agricultural irrigation return flows and nonpoint discharges can contribute salts (including
bromide), organic carbon, nutrients, pesticides, pathogens, and sediment.

•

Large dairies and feedlots can contribute nutrients, organic carbon, and pathogenic
organisms.

•

Water-based recreational activities (such as boating) can contribute hydrocarbon compounds,
nutrients, and pathogens.

•

Atmospheric deposition can contribute metals, nutrients, pesticides, and other synthetic
organic chemicals, and may lower pH.

•

Seawater intrusion can contribute salts, including bromide, which affect total dissolved solids
(TDS) concentrations and can contribute to formation of unwanted chemical byproducts in
treated drinking water. Additionally, seawater can contribute sulfate, which can influence the
methylation of mercury.

•

Miscellaneous contaminants and conditions from the San Joaquin River include selenium and
low dissolved oxygen (DO).

Water quality can vary seasonally in response to winter spring runoff and summer-fall lower
flow periods, and can also vary from year to year as a result of precipitation and snow pack levels in the
upper watersheds, and the resulting releases from upstream reservoirs for water supply, flood
management, and environmental obligations (e.g., fish flows, Delta water quality objective
compliance), operations of the Delta Cross Channel, and seasonal and annual variations in SWP and
CVP pumping rates.
As defined by USEPA, water quality standards consist of: (1) the designated beneficial uses of a
water segment; (2) the water quality criteria (referred to as objectives by the state) necessary to support
those uses; and (3) an antidegradation policy that protects existing uses and high water quality. Each
Regional Water Board’s Basin Plan identifies numeric and narrative water quality objectives, together
with the beneficial uses assigned to water bodies and the state anti-degradation policy.
California Toxics Rule
CTR criteria are established only for the aquatic life and human health protection. CTR criteria
for aquatic life protection for some constituents (i.e., most metals, cyanide, various organic compounds)
are specified for freshwater and saltwater conditions. The CTR states that the salinity characteristics
(i.e., freshwater versus saltwater) of the receiving water shall be considered in determining the
applicable criteria. Freshwater criteria shall apply to waters with salinity equal to or less than 1 ppt at
least 95% of the time. Saltwater criteria apply to waters with salinity equal to or greater than 10 ppt at
least 95% of the time in a normal water year. For waters with salinity between these two categories, or
tidally influenced freshwaters that support estuarine beneficial uses, the applicable criteria are the lower
of the freshwater or saltwater values for each substance.

126

Water Quality Control Plan for the Delta Estuary
The Bay-Delta WQCP identifies beneficial uses of water in the Bay-Delta, water quality
objectives for the reasonable protection of those beneficial uses, and a program of implementation for
achieving the water quality objectives. The State of California is currently in the process of updating the
plan including the area where the project would occur. Unless otherwise indicated, water quality
objectives cited for a general area, such as for the south Delta, are applicable for all locations in that
general area, and specific compliance locations are used to determine compliance with the cited
objectives within the area.
The established water quality objectives provide reasonable protection for fish and wildlife. The
beneficial uses in the Bay-Delta Estuary include the following:
•

Shellfish Harvesting – Uses of water that support habitats suitable for the collection of filterfeeding shellfish (e.g., clams, oysters, and mussels) for human consumption, commercial, or
sports purposes.

•

Commercial and Sport Fishing – Uses of water for commercial or recreational collection of
fish, shellfish, or other organisms including, but not limited to, uses involving organisms
intended for human consumption or bait purposes.

•

Navigation – Uses of water for shipping, travel, or other transportation by private, military,
or commercial vessels.

•

Warm Freshwater Habitat – Uses of water that support warm water ecosystems including, but
not limited to, preservation of aquatic habitats, vegetation, fish, or wildlife, including
invertebrates.

•

Cold Freshwater Habitat – Uses of water that support cold water ecosystems including, but
not limited to, preservation or enhancements of aquatic habitats, vegetation, fish, or wildlife,
including invertebrates.

•

Migration of Aquatic Organisms – Uses of water that support habitats necessary for
migration or other temporary activities by aquatic organisms, such as anadromous fish.

•

Spawning, Reproduction, and/or Early Development – Uses of water that support high
quality aquatic habitats suitable for reproduction and early development of fish.

•

Estuarine Habitat – Uses of water that support estuarine ecosystems including, but not
limited to, preservation or enhancement of estuarine habitats, vegetation, fish, shellfish, or
wildlife (e.g. estuarine mammals, waterfowl, shorebirds).

•

Wildlife Habitat – Uses of water that support estuarine ecosystems including, but not limited
to, preservation and enhancement of terrestrial habitats, vegetation, wildlife (e.g., mammals,
birds, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates), or wildlife water and food sources.

•

Rare, Threatened, or Endangered Species – Uses of water that support habitats necessary, at
least in part, for the survival and successful maintenance of plant or animal species
established under State or federal law as being rare, threatened, or endangered.

127

Water Quality Control Plan for Sacramento and San Joaquin River Basins
The Basin Plan for the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers defines the beneficial uses, water
quality objectives, implementation programs, and surveillance and monitoring programs for waters of
the Sacramento and San Joaquin River basins. The Basin Plan contains specific numeric water quality
objectives that are applicable to certain water bodies, or portions of water bodies. Numerical objectives
have been established for bacteria, DO, pH, pesticides, EC, TDS, temperature, turbidity, and trace
metals. The Basin Plan also contains narrative water quality objectives for certain parameters that must
be attained through pollutant control measures and watershed management. Narrative water quality
objectives also serve as the basis for the development of detailed numerical objectives.
Mercury
Mercury occurs as a result of both natural and anthropogenic sources in the environment and
continually cycles in the aquatic environments of the Sacramento and San Joaquin River basins and
Delta. The cycle involves different chemical forms and/or species of mercury as a result of both
chemical and biological reactions in aerobic and anoxic microenvironments. On a world wide scale,
mining sources are geographically localized but, in California’s Central Valley, they are of great
importance. Most additional mercury sources are part of a widespread, global cycle (Jones and Slotten
1996).
Sediment methyl mercury concentrations and methyl mercury to total mercury ratios were
significantly greater in highly vegetated marsh habitats as compared to adjacent Delta channel and
mudflat environments. Methylation potential experiments showed that flooded wetland sediments
exhibited 2 to 30 times greater potential to produce methyl mercury than aquatic sediments of adjacent
channels and flats (Slotten et al. 2003). However, biological findings indicate no distinct localized
increase in net methyl mercury bioaccumulation in flooded wetland tracts vs. adjacent aquatic habitats
within Delta sub-regions. Some of the most well developed, highly vegetated wetland tracts exhibited
reduced levels of localized net mercury bioaccumulation. These results suggest that wetland restoration
projects may result in localized mercury bioaccumulation at levels similar to, but not necessarily greater
than, levels within their surrounding Delta sub-region (Slotten et al. 2003).
Salinity
Salinity concentrations within the Delta are primarily a function of the location of high-salt
content ocean water with daily tidal action, freshwater inflow to the Delta, and the hydrodynamic
processes in the Delta channels that govern channel flow conditions and mixing of water sources with
variable salt content. During winter and early spring, freshwater inflows to the Delta are usually above
the minimum required to control salinity. However, at least for a few months in summer and fall of most
years when freshwater inflows to the Delta have declined, Delta salinity conditions must be carefully
monitored and controlled. Broad-scale salinity control actions are taken in the Delta because its channels
are at or below sea level and unless repelled by continuous seaward flow of fresh water, seawater can
advance into the western Delta and adversely affect compliance with water quality objectives and
beneficial uses provided by Delta water resources.

128

Additional influential factors of the Delta salinity conditions include the San Joaquin River
inflow, in-Delta agricultural drainage, and other miscellaneous inputs (e.g., municipal wastewater, urban
runoff, connate groundwater). San Joaquin River inflows are particularly influential to salinity
conditions in the southern Delta after winter rainfall and runoff from the Sierra Mountains have ceased
and the river is influenced primarily by drainage return flows from the San Joaquin Valley floor. High
concentrations of salts are carried by the San Joaquin River into the Delta and much of the salt load
represents recirculation and increased salt content of water diverted to the San Joaquin valley via the
CVP Delta. Salinity problems in the western Delta result primarily from the incursion of saline water
from the San Francisco Bay when freshwater inflow from the Delta to the bay is low. However, it should
be noted that compared to historical conditions, Delta salinity during low-flow periods is much lower
since the construction of the major dams on Delta tributaries in the Sierra Mountains and foothills,
which allow storage and fresh-water releases during the summer to repel tidal seawater intrusion. For the
Sacramento River in the north Delta, which is not substantially affected by sea-water intrusion due to the
large flow of the Sacramento River, concentrations of all salinity parameters are uniformly much lower
than other Delta locations.

Air Quality

This air quality section describes the pre-project air quality conditions in the project vicinity.
The section first explains the air quality regulatory environment the existing physical air quality
environment, including the area’s climate and atmospheric conditions, the air pollutants of most
concern, air quality conditions, and sensitive receptors in the project area.
Regulatory Setting
Air quality management and protection are regulated by federal, state, and local levels of
government. The primary statutes that establish ambient air quality standards and establish regulatory
authorities to enforce regulatory attainment are the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) and California Clean
Air Act (CCAA). Applicable air quality regulations and responsible agencies are described below.
Federal
Clean Air Act
The Federal 1970 CAA authorized the establishment of national health-based air quality
standards, and also set deadlines for their attainment. The Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
(1990 CAAA) made major changes in deadlines for attaining National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) and in the actions required of areas of the nation that exceeded these standards. Under the
CAA, state and local agencies in areas that exceed the NAAQS are required to develop state
implementation plans (SIP) to show how they will achieve the NAAQS for nonattainment criteria
pollutants by specific dates. SIPs are not single documents; rather, they are a compilation of new and
previously submitted plans, programs (such as monitoring, modeling, permitting, etc.), district rules,
state regulations and federal controls. The USEPA is responsible for enforcing the NAAQS primarily
through reviewing SIPs that are prepared by each state.

129

As required by the Federal CAA, the USEPA has established and continues to update the
NAAQS for specific criteria air pollutants: ozone (O 3 ), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ),
sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), inhalable particulate matter (PM 10 ), fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), and lead (Pb).
The NAAQS for these pollutants are listed under “Federal Standards” in Table 4-2 and represent the
upper-bound levels of pollutant concentrations deemed necessary by the USEPA to protect the public
health and welfare with an adequate margin of safety.
General Conformity Rule and de minimis Levels
Pursuant to CAA Section 176(c) requirements, USEPA promulgated the General Conformity
Rule, which applies to most federal actions, including the Folsom JFP project. The General Conformity
Rule is used to determine if federal actions meet the requirements of the CAA and the applicable SIP by
ensuring that pollutant emissions related to the action do not:
•

Cause or contribute to new violations of a NAAQS.

•

Increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation of a NAAQS.

•

Delay timely attainment of a NAAQS or interim emission reduction.

A conformity determination under the General Conformity Rule is required if the federal agency
determines: the action will occur in a nonattainment or maintenance area; that one or more specific
exemptions do not apply to the action; the action is not included in the federal agency’s “presumed to
conform” list; the emissions from the proposed action are not within the approved emissions budget for
an applicable facility; and the total direct and indirect emissions of a pollutant (or its precursors), are at
or above the de minimis levels established in the General Conformity regulations.
An action will be determined to conform to the applicable SIP if the action meets the
requirements of 40 CFR 93.158(c). In addition, federal activities may not cause or contribute to new
violations of air quality standards, exacerbate existing violations, or interfere with timely attainment or
required interim emissions reductions toward attainment.
State
The CARB is responsible for the development, implementation, and enforcement of California’s
motor vehicle pollution control program, administration of the state’s air pollution research program,
adoption and updating, as necessary, of California Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS), review of
local APCD activities, and coordination of the development of the SIP for achievement of the NAAQS.
California Clean Air Act
The CCAA establishes an air quality management process that generally parallels the Federal
process. The CCAA, however, focuses on attainment of the CAAQS that, for certain pollutants and
averaging periods, are more stringent than the comparable NAAQS. The CAAQS are included in Table
4-2 alongside the NAAQS.

The CCAA requires that AQMDs and APCDs prepare a clean air plan, or air quality attainment
plan if the district violates CAAQS for CO, SO 2 , NO 2 , or O 3 , showing strategies for and progress
toward attaining the CAAQS for which it is in non-attainment. These plans are required to be updated
triennially.
The CCAA requires that the CAAQS be met as expeditiously as practicable, but does not set
precise attainment deadlines. Instead, the act established increasingly stringent requirements for areas
that will require more time to achieve the standards. The air quality attainment plan requirements
established by the CCAA are based on the severity of air pollution problems caused by locally-generated
emissions. Upwind APCDs are required to establish and implement emission control programs
commensurate with the extent of pollutant transport to downwind districts.
Air pollution problems in Sacramento County are primarily the result of locally-generated
emissions. However, Sacramento’s air pollution occasionally includes contributions from the San
Francisco Bay Area or the San Joaquin Valley. In addition, Sacramento County has been identified as a
source of ozone precursor emissions that occasionally contribute to air quality problems in the San
Joaquin Valley Air Basin and the Northern Sacramento Valley Air Basin (SVAB). Consequently, the air
quality planning for Sacramento County must not only correct local air pollution problems, but must
also reduce the area’s effect on downwind air basins.
Local
Air pollution problems in the greater Delta are primarily the result of locally-generated
emissions. Sacramento’s air pollution occasionally includes contributions from the San Francisco Bay
Area or the San Joaquin Valley. In addition, Sacramento County has been identified as a source of ozone
precursor emissions that occasionally contribute to air quality problems in the San Joaquin Valley Air
Basin and the Northern Sacramento Valley Air Basin (SVAB). In addition to permitting and rule
compliance, air quality management at the local level is also accomplished through an Air Quality
Management District (AQMD) imposition of mitigation measures on project environmental impact
reports and mitigated negative declarations developed by project proponents under CEQA. Specific to
project construction emissions, CEQA requires mitigation of air quality impacts that exceed certain
significance thresholds set by the local AQMD/APCD.
Local Agencies
The focused project area encompasses the following air basins: Sacramento Metropolitan Air
Quality Management District (SMAQMD) and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District
(BAAQMD). Air quality in each air basin is regulated by Federal, State, and regional agencies.
Each district is responsible for implementing Federal and State regulations at the local level,
permitting stationary sources of air pollution, and developing the local elements of the SIP. Emissions
from indirect sources, such as automobile traffic associated with development projects, are addressed
through the AQMD’s air quality plans, which are each air quality district’s contribution to the SIP. In
addition to permitting and rule compliance, air quality management at the local level is also
accomplished through AQMD imposition of mitigation measures on project environmental impact
reports and mitigated negative declarations developed by project proponents under CEQA. Specific to
132

project construction emissions, CEQA requires mitigation of air quality impacts that exceed certain
significance thresholds set by the local AQMD.

Environmental Setting
The study area for the project is the SVAB, which includes Sacramento County, where the
project site is located. Criteria air pollutants relevant to the project were determined based on the
existing pollutant conditions in the SVAB. TACs relevant to the project were determined based on
SMAQMD guidance and the project site conditions.
Criteria and Non-Criteria Air Pollutants
Pollutants are typically classified as either criteria or non-criteria pollutants. Federal and
California regulators have established ambient air quality standards for criteria pollutants whereas no
ambient standards have been established for non-criteria pollutants. For some criteria pollutants,
separate standards have been set for different periods. Most standards have been set to protect public
health. For some pollutants, standards have been based on other values such as protection of crops,
protection of materials, or avoidance of nuisance conditions. The criteria pollutants of greatest concern
in Sacramento County are carbon monoxide (CO), ozone, inhalable particulate matter less than 10
microns in diameter (PM 10 ), and fine particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM 2.5 ). A
summary of State and Federal ambient air quality standards for criteria pollutants is shown in Table 4-2.
Air pollutants relevant to the project and their health effects are discussed below and summarized in
Table 4-4. In addition, sensitive receptors are defined and receptors near the project are identified.

Consequently, PM 10 , PM 2.5 , CO, and ozone precursor
(ROG and NO X ) emissions are the primary criteria
pollutants of concern associated with the project.

The primary DPM sources associated with the project
are diesel-powered on-road haul trucks and off-road

Criteria Pollutants
For criteria pollutants, NAAQS and CAAQS have been established to protect public health and
welfare. Criteria pollutants include CO, NO 2 , O 3 , PM 10 , PM 2.5 , and SO 2 . Ozone is a secondary pollutant
that is not emitted directly to the atmosphere. Instead, it forms by the reaction of two ozone precursors –
reactive organic gases (ROGs) and nitrogen oxides (NO X ) – in the presence of sunlight and high
temperatures. The sources of these pollutants, their effects on human health and the nation's welfare, and
their annual emission to the atmosphere vary considerably and are detailed in Appendix I.
Toxic Air Contaminants
A TAC is defined by California law as an air pollutant that “may cause or contribute to an
increase in mortality or an increase in serious illness, or which may pose a present or potential hazard to
human health.” The USEPA uses the term hazardous air pollutant (HAPs) in a similar sense.
Controlling air toxic emissions became a national priority with the passage of the Clean Air Act
Amendments, whereby Congress mandated that the USEPA regulate 188 air toxics. TACs can be
emitted from stationary and mobile sources.
Ten TACs have been identified through ambient air quality data as posing the greatest health risk
in California. Direct exposure to these pollutants has been shown to cause cancer, birth defects, damage
to brain and nervous system and respiratory disorders. TACs do not have ambient air quality standards
because often no safe levels of TACs have been determined. Instead, TAC impacts are evaluated by
calculating the health risks associated with a given exposure.
Air Quality Standards and Attainment Status
Ambient air quality standards are set to protect public health. There are currently both Federal
and State ambient air quality standards by USEPA and state air quality agencies, CALEPA for
California. California air quality standards are generally more stringent that federal standards. The four
designations are further defined as:
•

Nonattainment—assigned to areas where monitored pollutant concentrations consistently
violate the standard in question.

•

Maintenance—assigned to areas where monitored pollutant concentrations exceeded the
standard in question in the past but are no longer in violation of that standard.

•

Attainment—assigned to areas where pollutant concentrations meet the standard in question
over a designated period of time.

•

Unclassified—assigned to areas were data are insufficient to determine whether a pollutant is
violating the standard in question.

Table 4-5 summarizes the level of Federal and State pollutant attainment status for the project
areas by county.

Local Air Quality Management and Sensitive Receptors
Project site standards would follow those enforced by the SMAQMD and the BAAQMD. Air
quality in each air basin is regulated by Federal, State, and regional agencies. The existing air quality
conditions in the project area can be characterized by monitoring data collected in the region. Table 4-6
summarizes air quality monitoring data from the SMAQMD, and the BAAQMD monitoring stations for
3 years for which complete data are available (2008–2010).
The NAAQS and CAAQS apply at publicly accessible areas, regardless of whether those areas
are populated. For the purposes of air quality analysis, sensitive land uses are defined as locations
where human populations, especially children, seniors, and sick persons, are located and where there is
reasonable expectation of continuous human exposure according to the averaging period for the air
quality standards (e.g., 24-hour, 8-hour, and 1-hour). Typical sensitive receptors include residences,
hospitals, and schools.

Climate Change

Regulatory Setting
Federal
The USEPA is responsible for Green House Gases (GHG) regulation at the Federal level. Key
Federal GHG guidance and regulations relevant to the project are summarized below.
In Massachusetts v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, et al., 127 S.Ct. 1438 (2007), the
United States Supreme Court ruled that GHGs fits within the CAA’s definition of a pollutant, and that
the USEPA has the authority to regulate GHGs.
On October 5, 2009, President Obama signed Executive Order (E.O.) 13514; Federal Leadership
in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance, E.O. 13514 requires Federal agencies to set a
2020 GHG emissions reduction target within 90 days; increase energy efficiency; reduce fleet petroleum
consumption; conserve water; reduce waste; support sustainable communities; and leverage Federal
purchasing power to promote environmentally-responsible products and technologies.
On December 7, 2009, the Final Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for
Greenhouse Gases (endangerment finding), under Section 202(a) of the CAA went into effect. The
endangerment finding states that current and projected concentrations of the six key well-mixed GHGs
in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ), and other fluorinated gases including
nitrogen trifluoride (NF 3 ) and hydrofluorinated ethers (HFEs), threaten the public health and welfare of
current and future generations. Furthermore, it states that the combined emissions of these GHGs from
new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines contribute to the GHG pollution which threatens
public health and welfare (USEPA 2012a).
Under the endangerment finding, the USEPA is developing vehicle emission standards under the
CAA. The USEPA and the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration have issued a joint proposal to establish a national program that includes standards that
will reduce GHG emissions and improve fuel economy for light-duty vehicles in model years (MYs)
2012 through 2016. This proposal marks the first GHG standards proposed by the USEPA under the
CAA as a result of the endangerment and cause or contribute findings (USEPA 2012b). These emission
reductions were incorporated into the project analysis.
On February 18, 2010, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) released draft
guidance regarding the consideration of GHGs in NEPA documents for Federal actions. The draft
guidelines include a presumptive threshold of 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e)
emissions from a proposed action to trigger a quantitative analysis. CEQ has not established when GHG
emissions are “significant” for NEPA purposes; rather, it poses the question to the public (CEQ 2010).

137

State
CARB is responsible for the development, implementation, and enforcement of California’s
motor vehicle pollution control program, GHG statewide emission estimates and goals, and development
and enforcement of GHG emission reduction rules. California has taken proactive steps, briefly
described in Table 4-7, to address the issues associated with GHG emissions and climate change.
Table 4-7. Summary of Relevant California GHG Regulations.
Bill, Year
Description
Assembly Bill
Directed California Energy Commission, in consultation with the CARB and
(AB) 4420, 1988
other agencies, to “study and report…on how global warming trends may affect
California’s energy supply and demand, economy, environment, agriculture, and
water supplies.”
AB 1493, 2002
Requires CARB to develop and implement regulations to reduce automobile and
light-truck GHG emissions. These stricter emissions standards apply to
automobiles and light trucks beginning with the 2009 MY. Although litigation
was filed challenging these regulations and EPA initially denied California’s
related request for a waiver, the waiver request has now been granted.
Executive Order
The goal of E.O. S-3-05 is to reduce California’s GHG emissions to: (1) year
(E.O.) S-3-05, 2005 2000 levels by 2010, (2) 1990 levels by 2020, and (3) 80% below the 1990 levels
by 2050.
AB 32,
Sets overall GHG emissions reduction goals and mandates that CARB create a
California Global
plan that includes market mechanisms and implement rules to achieve “real,
Warming Solutions quantifiable, cost-effective reductions of greenhouse gases.”
Act of 2006
Requires statewide GHG emissions be reduced to 1990 levels by 2020. (The
1990 CO2e level is 427 million metric tonnes of CO2e (CARB 2012a)).
Directs CARB to develop and implement regulations to reduce statewide
emissions from stationary sources.
Specifies that regulations adopted in response to AB 1493 be used to address
GHG emissions from vehicles.
Requires CARB to adopt a quantified cap on GHG emissions representing 1990
emissions levels.
Includes guidance to institute emissions reductions in an economically efficient
manner and conditions to ensure that businesses and consumers are not unfairly
affected by the reductions.
E.O. S-01-07, 2007 Requires the carbon intensity of California’s transportation fuels to be reduced
by at least 10% by 2020.
Senate Bill 97
This bill directed the Natural Resources Agency, in coordination with the

Affected Environment
This section addresses the existing conditions of global climate change. Emissions of
greenhouse gasses (GHGs) are a contributing factor, on a cumulative basis, to global climate change.
Global climate change has the potential to result in sea level rise (which may result in flooding of lowlying areas), to affect rainfall and snowfall levels (which may lead to changes in water supply and
runoff), to affect temperatures and habitats (which in turn may affect biological and agricultural
resources), and to result in many other adverse effects. Although global climate change is inherently a
cumulative impact, it is important to remember that any single project is unlikely to be able to generate
sufficient GHGs by itself to have a significant impact on the environment. However, the cumulative
effect of human activities has been clearly linked to quantifiable changes in the composition of the
atmosphere, which in turn have been shown to be the main cause of global climate change.
Global Climate Trends and Associated Impacts
Global warming is the name given to the increase in the average temperature of the Earth’s nearsurface air and oceans since the mid-20th century and its projected continuation. Warming of the climate
system is now considered by a vast majority of the scientific community to be unequivocal, based on
observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and
ice, and rising global average sea level (IPCC, 2007).
Global mean surface temperatures have risen by 0.74 degrees Celsius (°C) ± 0.18°C when
estimated by a linear trend over the last 100 years (1906 to 2005). The rate of warming over the last 50
years is almost double that over the last 100 years (0.13°C ± 0.03°C versus 0.07°C ± 0.02°C per
decade). The causes of this measured warming have been identified as both natural processes and the
result of human actions. For the next two decades, a warming of about 0.2°C per decade is projected for
a range of emissions scenarios.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that variations in natural
phenomena such as solar radiation and volcanoes produced most of the warming from preindustrial
times to 1950 and had a small cooling effect afterward. However, since 1950, increasing GHG
concentrations resulting from human activity such as fossil fuel burning and deforestation have been
responsible for most of the observed temperature increase. These basic conclusions have been endorsed
by more than 45 scientific societies and academies of science, including all of the national academies of
science of the major industrialized countries. Since 2007, no scientific body of national or international
standing has maintained a dissenting opinion (DWR, 2012).
Increases in GHG concentrations in the Earth’s atmosphere are thought to be the main cause of
human-induced climate change. GHGs naturally trap heat by impeding the exit of solar radiation that has
hit the Earth and is reradiated back into space as infrared radiation. Some GHGs occur naturally and are
necessary for keeping the Earth’s surface habitable. However, increases in the concentrations of these
gases in the atmosphere above natural levels during the last 100 years have increased the amount of
infrared radiation that is trapped in the lower atmosphere, intensifying the natural greenhouse effect and
resulting in increased global average temperatures.

139

The effects of warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and oceans affect global and local climate
systems. Observational evidence from all continents and most oceans shows that many natural systems
are being affected by regional climate changes, in addition to temperature increases (IPCC, 2007).
Based on growing evidence, there is high confidence that the following effects on hydrologic systems
are occurring: (1) increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier- and snow-fed
rivers; and (2) warming of lakes and rivers in many regions, with effects on thermal structure and water
quality (IPCC, 2008).
There is very high confidence, based on increasing evidence from a wider range of species, that
recent warming is strongly affecting terrestrial biological systems, including such changes as earlier
timing of spring events (e.g., leaf-unfolding, bird migration, egg-laying); and poleward and upward
shifts in ranges in plant and animal species. Based on satellite observations since the early 1980s, there
is high confidence that there has been a trend in many regions toward earlier “greening” of vegetation in
the spring linked to longer thermal growing seasons resulting from recent warming (IPCC, 2007).
There is high confidence, based on substantial new evidence, that observed changes in marine
and freshwater biological systems are associated with rising water temperatures, as well as related
changes in ice cover, salinity, oxygen levels, and circulation. These include shifts in ranges and changes
in algal, plankton, and fish abundance in high-latitude oceans; increases in algal and zooplankton
abundance in high-latitude and high-altitude lakes; and range changes and earlier fish migrations in
rivers (IPCC, 2007).
Changes in the ocean and on land, including observed decreases in snow cover and Northern
Hemisphere sea ice extent, thinner sea ice, shorter freezing seasons of lake and river ice, glacier melt,
decreases in permafrost extent, increases in soil temperatures and borehole temperature profiles, and sea
level rise, provide additional evidence that the world is warming (IPCC, 2007).
Climate Change Conditions in California
With respect to California’s water resources, the most important effects of global warming have
been changes to the water cycle and sea level rise. Over the past century, the precipitation mix between
snow and rain has shifted in favor of more rainfall and less snow (Mote et al., 2005; Knowles et al.,
2006), and snowpack in the Sierra Nevada is melting earlier in the spring (Kapnick and Hall, 2009). The
average early-spring snowpack in the Sierra Nevada has decreased by about 10 percent during the last
century, a loss of 1.5 million acre-feet of snowpack storage (DWR, 2008). These changes have major
implications for water supply, flooding, aquatic ecosystems, energy generation, and recreation
throughout the state.
Precipitation
Climate change can affect precipitation by changing the overall amount of precipitation, type of
precipitation (rain versus snow), and timing and intensity of precipitation events. Changes to these
factors propagate through the hydrologic system in California and have the potential to affect snowpack,
runoff, water supply, and flood control.

140

Former State Climatologist James Goodridge compiled an extensive collection of longer-term
precipitation records from throughout California. These data sets were used to evaluate whether there
has been a changing trend in precipitation in the state over the past century (DWR, 2006). Long-term
runoff records in selected California watersheds were also examined. Based on a linear regression of the
data, the long-term historical trend for statewide average annual precipitation appears to be relatively
flat (no increase or decrease) over the entire record. However, it appears that there might be an upward
trend in precipitation toward the latter portion of the record. Precipitation in Northern California
appears to have increased between 1 and 3 inches annually between 1890 and 2002 (DWR, 2006).
Snowpack
An increase in the global average temperature is expected to result in a decreased volume of
precipitation falling as snow in California and an overall reduction in the Sierra Nevada’s snowpack.
Snowpack in the Sierra Nevada provides both water supply (runoff) and storage (within the snowpack
before melting), which is a major source of supply for California. According to the California Energy
Commission, the snowpack portion of the water supply has the potential to decline by 30 to 90 percent
by the end of the 21st century (CEC, 2006). A study by Knowles and Cayan projects that approximately
50 percent of the statewide snowpack will be lost by the end of the century (Knowles and Cayan, 2002).
On average, California’s annual snowpack has the greatest accumulations from November
through the end of March. The snowpack typically melts from April through July. California’s
reservoir managers rely on snowmelt to fill reservoirs once the threat of large winter and early-spring
storms and related flooding risks have passed.
An analysis conducted by DWR of the effect of rising temperatures on snowpack shows that a
rise in average annual air temperature of 3°C (5.4°F) would likely cause snowlines to rise approximately
1,500 feet (DWR, 2006). This would result in the equivalent of approximately 5 million acre-feet of
water per year falling as rain rather than snow at lower elevations.
Runoff
Runoff is directly affected by changes in precipitation and snowpack. If the amount of
precipitation falling as rain rather than snow were to increase earlier in the year, flooding potential could
increase. Water that normally would be held in the Sierra Nevada snowpack until spring would flow
into the Central Valley concurrently with the rain from winter storm events. This scenario would place
more pressure on California’s flood control system (DWR, 2006).
Changes in both the amount of runoff and the seasonality of the hydrologic cycle also have the
potential to greatly affect the heavily managed water systems of the western United States. The
hydrology of the Sacramento River watershed is highly dependent on the interaction between Sierra
Nevada snowpack, runoff, and management of reservoirs. Higher snow lines and more precipitation
falling in the form of rain rather than snow will increase winter inflows to reservoirs. Higher winter
inflows will also likely mean that a greater portion of the total annual runoff volume will occur in the
winter, which would translate to higher flows in the Delta in the winter than those that currently occur.

141

Greenhouse Gas Emissions
As defined in Section 38505(g) of the California Health and Safety Code, the principal GHGs of
concern are carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC),
perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF 3 ). With the exception
of NF 3 , these are the same gases named in the USEPA’s Endangerment and Cause or Contribute
Findings for Greenhouse Gases under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act. Each of the principal GHGs
has a long atmospheric lifetime (one year to several thousand years), and is globally well mixed. In
addition, the potential heat trapping ability of each of these gases varies significantly from one another.
On a 100-year timescale, methane is about 25 times as potent as CO 2 , nitrous oxide is about 298 times
as potent as CO 2 , and sulfur hexafluoride is about 22,800 times more potent than CO 2 (IPCC, 2007).
Conventionally, GHGs have been reported as CO 2 equivalents (CO 2 e). CO 2 e takes into account the
relative potency of non-CO 2 GHGs and converts their quantities to an equivalent amount of CO 2 so that
all emissions can be reported as a single quantity.
The primary human-made processes that release these gases include: (1) the burning of fossil
fuels for transportation, heating, and electricity generation; (2) agricultural practices that release
methane, such as livestock grazing and crop residue decomposition; and (3) industrial processes that
release smaller amounts of high global warming potential gases, such as sulfur hexafluoride, PFCs, and
HFCs. Deforestation and land cover conversion have also been identified as contributing to global
warming by reducing the Earth’s capacity to remove CO 2 from the air and altering the Earth’s surface
reflectance. The major sources of GHGs that are relevant to the ARCF GRR project are transportation
sources and construction emissions. These are discussed in greater detail below.
Transportation
Transportation is a major source of GHGs in California, accounting for 36 percent of the State’s
total GHG emissions in 2008 (CARB, 2011). Transportation emissions within California are generated
primarily by combustion of gasoline, diesel, and some alternative fuels by mobile sources. The
indicators of vehicular activity, and resulting GHG emissions, are vehicle miles traveled and the fuel
economies of the individual vehicles composing the vehicular fleet. Vehicle miles traveled are
associated with movement of people and goods on local, regional, and statewide scales.
Construction
Construction emissions are generated when materials and workers are transported to and from
construction sites and when machinery is used for construction activities such as trenching, grading,
dredging, paving, and building. Emissions from construction activities are generated for shorter periods
than operational emissions; however, GHGs remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of years or more, so
once released, they contribute to global climate change unless they are removed through absorption by
the oceans or by terrestrial sequestration.
Construction emissions are not accounted for in a separate category in the California GHG
inventory (or other inventories that use IPCC GHG emissions sectors for accounting purposes).
However, based on the category “Transportation—Not Specified,” which includes off-road vehicles and
142

associated diesel fuel combustion, construction emissions accounted for a maximum of 0.4 percent of
California’s GHG inventory between 2000 and 2008 (CARB, 2011).
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories
A GHG inventory is a quantification of GHG emissions and sinks within a selected physical
and/or economic boundary over a specified time. GHG inventories can be performed on a large scale
(i.e., for global and national entities) or on a small scale (i.e., for a particular building or person).
Many GHG emission and sink specifications are complicated to evaluate because natural
processes may dominate the carbon cycle. Although some emission sources and processes are easily
characterized and well understood, some components of the GHG budget (i.e., the balance of GHG
sources and sinks) are not known with accuracy. Because protocols for quantifying GHG emissions
from many sources are currently under development by international, national, state, and local agencies,
ad-hoc tools must be developed to quantify emissions from certain sources and sinks in the interim.
Table 4-8 outlines the most recent global, national, statewide, and local GHG inventories to help
contextualize the magnitude of potential project-related emissions.

Transportation and Navigation

This section describes the existing transportation system within the study area shown in Figure 43. The existing system includes roadways, navigation channels, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities. In
addition, roadway classification and annual daily traffic counts for various roadway segments in and
near the study area are identified.
Regulatory Setting
Federal
Title 23 of the U.S. Code (USC)
Federal statutes specify the procedures that the U.S. Department of Transportation must follow
in setting policy regarding the placement of utility facilities within the rights-of-way of roadways that
received Federal funding. These roadways include expressways, most State highways, and certain local
roads. In addition, 23 USC 116 requires State highway agencies to ensure proper maintenance of
143

highway facilities, which implies adequate control over non-highway facilities, such as utility facilities.
Finally, 23 USC 123 specifies when Federal funds can be used to pay for the costs of relocating utility
facilities in connection with highway construction projects.
Title 23 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) regulations require that each state develop its own
policy regarding the accommodation of utility facilities within the rights-of-way of such roads. After
FHWA has approved a state’s policy, the state can approve any proposed utility installation without
referral to FHWA, unless utility installation does not conform to the policy. Federal regulations do not
dictate specific levels of operation or minimum delays, however, which are primarily established by
local jurisdiction.
U.S. Coast Guard
Title 14 of the United States Code (USC), Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)Title 33 and other
portions of the CFR , give the U.S. Coast Guard authority for maritime law enforcement on the
navigable waters of the United States, as well as responsibilities for search and rescue, marine
environmental protection, and the maintenance of river aids to navigation, among other roles. Specific to
the Delta, 33 CFR 162 provides regulations for the navigation by both commercial and noncommercial
vessels on the San Joaquin River Deep Water Ship Channel (between Suisun Bay and Stockton) and the
Sacramento River Deep Water Ship Channel (between Suisun Bay and West Sacramento).
State
California Streets and Highways Code
The California Streets and Highways Code authorize the California Department of
Transportation (Caltrans), to control encroachment within the State highway right-of-way.
Encroachments allow temporary or permanent use of a highway right-of-way by a utility, a public entity,
or a private party.
Caltrans’s Right of Way and Asset Management Program is primarily responsible for acquisition
and management of property required for State transportation purposes. Transportation purposes may
include highways, mass transit guideways and related facilities, material sites, and any other purpose
that may be necessary for Caltrans operations. The responsibilities of the Right of Way and Asset
Management Program include managing Caltrans’ real property for transportation purposes, reducing
the costs of operations, disposing of property no longer needed, and monitoring right-of-way activities
on Federally assisted local facilities.

Affected Environment
Regional and Local Roadways
The main roadway and access route to the project areas and borrow sites is Highway 160. This
two lane highway runs north to south through the Delta region. It provides access to most Delta cities
while connecting Sacramento to Antioch. Highway 160 is used primarily by local travelers and some
commuters who enjoy the tranquil setting of the Delta for traveling to and from the Bay Area. Vehicular
access to Big Break and Jersey Island is possible using the existing two lane arterials which include
Main Street, East Cypress Road, and Jersey Island Road in Oakley. Access to Bethel Island and Little
Franks Tract is possible by Bethel Island Road, a two lane arterial. Table 4-9 displays the traffic
volumes on roadways near the project area.

Port of Stockton
The Port of Stockton is located on the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel (DWSC), 75
nautical miles due east of the Golden Gate Bridge. The port is a major transportation center with
berthing space for 17 vessels, 1.1 million square feet of dockside transit sheds and shipside rail
trackage, and 7.7 million square feet of warehousing served by rail. The Port of Stockton has the
capacity to move cargo from vessels directly to truck and rail (Port of Stockton 2012). River
access to the port is through the Suisun Bay, San Joaquin River, and the Stockton DWSC. The
Stockton DWSC connects the Disappointment Slough with the Port of Stockton marine terminal
facilities, a distance of approximately 14 miles (State Water Resources Control Board 2010).
Stockton's DWSC has an average depth of 35 feet, and an average depth at high tide of 40 feet
(Port of Stockton 2010).
Marine Highways
Marine highways are used for point to point cargo movements on inland waterways as
well as inland to ocean ports for transhipment over oceans.One designated Marine Highway (M)
corridors lies within the project area vicinity, the M-580 corridor. The M-580 corridor includes
the San Joaquin River, Sacramento River, and connecting commercial navigation channels,
ports, and harbors in Central California from Sacramento to Oakland. It connects to the M-5
Corridor at Oakland. Most commercial barge traffic within the transportation study area travels
along the Sacramento River DWSC, which begins in Sacramento and heads southwest toward
Suisun Bay, where the canal ends. A new Marine Highway container barge service began
operating between the Port of Oakland and the Ports of Sacramento and Stockton in 2012.

State
California Department of Parks and Recreation Plans Central Valley Vision
The Central Valley Vision project began in 2003, with the goals of understanding the
recreation needs of Central Valley residents over the next 35 years and making recommendations
for actions that the DPR might address through expansion of state park facilities in the region.
Following the November 2006 release of the Central Valley Vision report, DPR released its
Central Valley Vision Draft Implementation Plan in 2008 (California Department of Parks and
Recreation 2008c). The draft 20‐year plan provides a “catalog of potential future projects” that
includes expanding existing parks and adding new parks in the Central Valley. The plan outlines
these potential projects in the Delta: acquiring more land; developing facilities and improving
access at Delta Meadows; developing interpretation and education opportunities at the Locke
Boarding House; expanding facilities at Brannan Island State Recreation Area; and providing
recreation at Twitchell, Sherman, and Lower Sherman islands. The implementation plan also
recommends creation of the California Delta Heritage Corridor, which would link historic Delta
towns, recreation sites, nature areas, and farm stands (California Department of Parks and
Recreation 2008c).
Franks Tract State Recreation Area General Plan
The approved purpose of Franks Tract State Recreation Area is “to perpetuate as a
recreation resource the flooded island in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta known as ‘Franks
Tract’ and to provide permanently the opportunity for water-related recreational activities…” In
addition, “the function of the Department of Parks and Recreation at Franks Tract State
Recreation Area is to provide facilities and services for public enjoyment of the features and
recreational opportunities afforded by this unit” (California Department of Parks and Recreation
1988).
Franks Tract State Recreation Area encompasses the inundated islands of Franks Tract
and Little Franks Tract, and the policies focus on maintaining water quality, protecting soils, and
protecting and enhancing habitat and species. Several policies mention considerations for placing
new structures or facilities. Allowable use levels are “low” at Little Franks Tract and “moderate”
on Franks Tract, except where wetland protection is of greater concern than providing recreation.
The general plan also recommends two land use and development goals: creating additional land
base for recreation activities and providing minimum needed recreation facilities. The plan
outlines the concept of increasing the land base by creating islands in Franks Tract and Little
Franks Tract. Facilities planned for the islands at Franks Tract include beaches, picnic areas,
floating docks, interpretive signage, and an observation platform. The plan outlines interpretive
signage along a water trail for Little Franks Tract. The general plan includes the following land
use and development goals for Franks Tract State Recreation Area.

148

•

Provide low intensity recreational opportunities by creating additional land base
(especially beaches) for recreation activities.

•

Provide only the minimum of recreation facilities to accommodate the needs of boat-in
visitors.

Delta Protection Act and Delta Protection Commission Land and Resource Management
Plan
The Delta Protection Act of 1992 (Act) (California Public Resources Code Section
21080.22, Division 19.5) established the DPC, a State entity to plan for and guide the
conservation and enhancement of the Delta’s natural resources while sustaining agriculture and
meeting increased recreational demand. The Act defines a Primary Zone, which comprises the
principal jurisdiction of the DPC. The Secondary Zone is the area outside the Primary Zone but
within the “Legal Delta;” the Secondary Zone is not in the planning area of the DPC. The DPC
has appeal authority over local government actions in the Delta’s Primary.
Affected Environment
The Delta is a major destination for water based recreationists because of its climatic
conditions, variety and abundance of fish, large maze of navigable waterways, and favorable
water levels during summer. Activities in the Delta include cruising, waterskiing, wakeboarding,
using personal watercraft, sailing, windsurfing, and kiteboarding, as well as fishing and hunting
both from land and by boat.
Boating is the primary recreation activity in the Delta. Throughout the Delta, there are a
variety of boat launching sites. Other recreation opportunities within the project area include
hunting, fishing, hiking, day-use/picnicking, and wildlife observation. Boaters also participate in
other related activities, such as boat camping (typically in houseboats or other large boats with
sleeping accommodations). The area shelters more than 70 species of birds and a great variety of
fish species. Winter temperatures range from 45 to 55 degrees. Summer days vary from 65 to
100 degrees. Cooling Delta breezes often gust to 25 mph, and tides can vary as much as six feet
in one day (Department of Parks and Recreation 1997).
The specific recreation opportunities at Big Break and Little Franks Tract which may be
affected by the project action are described in detail below.
Big Break
Big Break is a popular destination for wildlife viewing hiking/biking, boating, and
fishing. The Big Break Regional Shoreline park facility offers the majority of recreational
experiences within the Big Break area. General boating also takes place at Big Break estuary due
to its accessibility to the rivers and sloughs of the Inland Coast. Numerous private marinas offer
services to boaters and anglers. The facilities that exist in the Big Break area are shown on Table
4-10.

County Facilities
Big Break Regional
Shoreline Park

Big Break Regional Shoreline is located on the southern edge of Big Break in the City of
Oakley and is operated by the East Bay Regional Park District. A visitor center includes
temporary displays about the Delta and is staffed by Park District naturalists who can give
information about the park and specific activities in the area including wetland walks and
adjoining trails. Big Break Regional Shoreline offers picnic and meadow areas, a small shaded
amphitheater, and boat and kayak launch facilities. In addition, the 100-foot long AntiochOakley fishing pier is very popular with local anglers. The park includes covered, outdoor use
areas for interpretive and educational exhibits and programs highlighting Delta ecosystems and
wildlife. A 1,200 square foot interactive map of the Delta allows visitors to see how water flows
through the region (East Bay Regional Park District 2014). The Big Break Regional Trail, which
runs along the southern edge of Big Break through the Ironhouse Sanitary District, provides
access for hikers, bicyclists, and equestrians to the southeastern edge of the estuary. The trail
connects to the northern end of the Marsh Creek Regional Trail, providing access to Brentwood
and Oakley. The Marsh Creek Regional Trail connects to the Delta de Anza Regional Trail via
West Cypress Road, providing access to Oakley, Brentwood, Antioch, Pittsburg, and Bay Point
(East Bay Regional Park District 2014).

150

Bass fishing is currently the most popular recreational activity at Big Break. While shore
fishing offers less success, boaters offshore catch primarily largemouth bass and striped bass,
with some white catfish, bluegill, sunfish, and sturgeon also caught. Over the years Oakley has
hosted hundreds of angling tournaments (Big Break Marina 2014).
Little Franks Tract
Franks Tract State Recreation Area (including Little Franks Tract) is only accessible by
water and is known for excellent year-round fishing and seasonal waterfowl hunting. Due to the
limited access, exposure to strong winds and shallow fluctuating water levels, recreational use is
by anglers and waterfowl hunters. The tract is a popular striped bass fly fishing destination.
Franks Tract is host to numerous bass fishing tournaments put on by charities and corporations.
Fishing is an important recreational activity in the project area.
During the fall and winter, a large variety of waterfowl can be found in Franks Tract.
The recreation area is located in a key position in the Pacific flyway. Year round residents
include gulls, great blue herons, terns, swallows, crows, blackbirds, cormorants and kingfishers.
Numerous marinas along the eastern shore of Bethel Island offer a variety of services for boaters
and anglers. The waterside services provide economic benefits to the local communities. Table
4-11 shows the recreation facilities available at Little Franks Tract.

Cultural Resources

This chapter describes the environmental setting associated with cultural resources,
assesses the effects to cultural resources that would result from implementation of the proposed
program, and presents mitigation measures that would reduce these effects. The key sources of
data and information used in the preparation of this chapter are listed below.
•

A review of existing information.

•

Consultation with interested parties.

•

Archival research.

•

Reconnaissance level surveys of the study area.

Cultural resources are defined in this chapter as prehistoric and historic archaeological
sites, the historic built environment, and traditional cultural properties.
Regulatory Setting
National Historic Preservation Act
The proposed project would require that USACE comply with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (NHPA), and its implementing
regulations (36 CFR 800, Section 106). Section 106 requires that, before beginning any
153

undertaking, a Federal agency must take into account the effects of the undertaking on historic
properties (cultural resources listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places [NRHP]) and afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) an
opportunity to comment on these actions. Federal agencies may comply with Section 106 by
either completing the management steps indicated in the regulations (36 CFR Part 800) or
preparing an agreement document that describes the particular process an agency will use to
complete the same steps for a specific set of undertakings, as described below.
Cultural resources are eligible for the NRHP if they have integrity and significance as
defined in the regulations for the NRHP. Four primary criteria define significance; a property
may be significant if it displays one or more of the following characteristics (36 CFR 60.4). It is
associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our
history (Criterion A); or is associated with the lives of people significant in our past (Criterion B;
or embodies the distinct characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represents the work of a master, or that possesses high artistic values, or it represents a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction
(Criterion C); or it has yielded, or is likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history
(Criterion D).
Some types of cultural resources are not typically eligible for the NRHP. These resources
consist of cemeteries, birthplaces, graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious
institutions or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original
locations, reconstructed historic buildings, properties primarily commemorative in nature, and
properties that have achieved significance within the past 50 years. These property types may be
eligible for the NRHP, however, if they are integral parts of eligible districts of resources or meet
the criteria considerations described in 36 CFR 60.4.
In addition to possessing significance, a property must also have integrity to be eligible
for listing in the NRHP. The principle of integrity has seven aspects: location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association (36 CFR 60.4). To retain historic integrity, a
property needs to possess several, and usually most, of these aspects (National Park Service
2002).The evaluation of a resource’s integrity in relation to its significance will be conducted as
prescribed in National Register Bulletin No. 15: How to Apply the National Register Criteria for
Evaluation (National Park Service 2002).
The Section 106 review process typically consists of the following major steps.
•

Identify the Federal agency undertaking.

•

Identify the area of potential effects.

•

Initiate Section 106 process.

•

Identify historic properties.

•

Evaluated effects to historic properties.

•

Resolve adverse effects.

Study Area and Area of Potential Effects
The study area focused on Big Break and Little Franks Tract to determine the
effectiveness of placing dredge materials. The area of potential effects (APE) is a smaller area
within the study area and is defined as the soil placement areas within the TSP. In addition,
linear alignments for the temporary pipelines to transport materials to the work areas are also
considered part of the APE, as are any as yet unidentified staging areas, if needed. Areas not
considered as part of the APE are the locations where the dredge materials will be taken from
including McCormick, Scour, Decker, and Bradford disposal sites, as well as the Stockton Deep
Water Ship Channel. These areas are established dredge spoils deposition areas or ongoing
maintenance activities and are comprised entirely of displaced material from maintenance
dredging and covered under their own consultation.

The first three reports were prepared as joint Federal and State documents for the Bay
Delta Conservation Plan and cover the entire Delta. More specific information concerning Little
Franks Tract and Big Break follow the general overview.
Prehistoric Setting
Prior to the arrival of Europeans, inhabitants of the Delta occupied the riparian forest,
marsh, alkali basins, oak savanna, and foothill woodland communities found throughout the
Central Valley. In the Delta specifically, they located their main population centers on natural
levees, mounds and other high spots. Their society developed a sophisticated material culture
and established trade system involving a wide range of manufactured goods and raw materials,
and their population and villages prospered in the centuries prior to historic contact (Rosenthal et
al. 2007).

155

The following discussion uses a simple classification based on the three basic periods
proposed by Fredrickson: the Paleo‐Indian, Archaic, and Emergent (Fredrickson 1973, 1974).
The Archaic period has been further divided into the Lower, Middle, and Upper Archaic based
on newer radiocarbon dates, adjusted with modern calibration curves (Rosenthal et al. 2007).
Paleo-Indian
No evidence of the Paleo‐Indian Period (11,550–8,500 BC) has been found in the Delta.
However, basally thinned and fluted projectile points at three separate locations in the southern
portion of the valley show that people were present in the Central Valley during that time
(Rosenthal et al. 2007). Meyer and Rosenthal have shown through geoarchaeological studies
that periodic episodes of erosion and deposition during the Holocene have removed or buried
large segments of the Late Pleistocene landscape (Rosenthal and Meyer 2004; White 2003a).
Therefore, archaeological deposits associated with these ancient landforms have either been
destroyed or are buried beneath more recent alluvial deposits (Rosenthal et al. 2007).
Lower Archaic
Evidence of the Lower Archaic Period (8,000–5,550 BC) is likewise rare in the Delta, but
is characterized by primarily by isolated finds, including stemmed points, chipped stone
crescents, and early concave base points. Intact deposits are even rarer. Only one Lower
Archaic deposit has been found in the Central Valley.
Middle Archaic
The physical Delta itself truly formed during the beginning of the Middle Archaic
(5,550–550 BC) as a result of warmer, drier conditions in the Central Valley; sea level rise; and
the stabilization of fans and floodplains around 5,550 BC (Rosenthal et al. 2007). Around this
time, two distinct settlement‐subsistence adaptations operating in central California developed—
one centering on the foothills and the other on the valley floor (Fredrickson 1994; Rosenthal and
McGuire 2004). Populations during this time sites appear to be increasingly sedentary, as
indicated by refined and specialized tool assemblages and features, a wide range of
non‐utilitarian artifacts, abundant trade objects, and plant and animal remains indicative of
year‐round occupation (Moratto 1984; Ragir 1972; Schulz 1970, 1981; White 2003a, 2003b).
Again, deposits dating to this time period are rare in the valley. After about 2,500 BC, sites
become much more abundant, and have elaborate material cultural, diverse technology, and
dietary assemblages (Rosenthal et al 2007). Additionally, procurement patterns become
logistically based and populations have increasing residential stability (Rosenthal et al 2007).
Upper Archaic
A cooler, wetter Upper Archaic (550 BC–AD 1,100) led to renewed fan and floodplain
deposition and soil formation in the Central Valley (Rosenthal et al. 2007). People in the Upper
Archaic developed new, specialized technologies and there was widespread use of decorative
items including shell beads, Haliotis ornaments, and ceremonial blades (Bennyhoff and
Fredrickson 1994; Moratto 1984; Rosenthal et al 2007). There is evidence of regionalized
156

economies and a heavy reliance on acorns, salmon, fish and deer (Moratto 1984, Rosenthal et al
2007). Large villages also appeared during this time period (Lilliard et al 1939). Sites dating to
this time typically contain large quantities of habitation debris and features (such as fire‐cracked
rock heaps, shallow hearths, house floors, and flexed burials) that reflect long‐term residential
occupation.
Emergent
The archaeological record for the Emergent/Historic Period (AD 1,000) is more
substantial and comprehensive than those of earlier periods in the Central Valley, and the artifact
assemblages are the most diverse (Bennyhoff 1977; Fredrickson 1974; Kowta 1988; Sundahl
1982, 1992). In part this is due to the increasingly complex societies developing in the Delta
region; however, some of this may be because the rarity of earlier sites. The Emergent period
can be divided into Lower and Upper periods. Aspects of culture include the reliance on acorn,
pine nut, and Manzanita; the decentralization of bead production; use of Napa obsidian; and
proliferation of baskets. Use of the bow and arrow also became common (Bennyhoff 1994).
Village sites from the late Emergent were often used into the Ethnographic period.
Ethnographic Setting
Beginning with Euroamerican contact, at least two Native American cultural groups may
have inhabited portions of the Study Area. These groups are the Plains, Bay or Eastern Miwok
and Southern Patwin.
Plains Miwok
The Eastern Miwok, and more specifically the Plains or Bay Miwok, inhabited the lower
reaches of the Mokelumne and Cosumnes Rivers, and the banks of the Sacramento River from
Rio Vista to Freeport (Levy 1978). Although the Plains Miwok shared a common language
subgroup, Utial, and cultural background, they were comprised of several separate, politically
independent nations, or tribelets. The tribelet represented an independent, sovereign nation that
defined and defended a territory. The tribelet chief, usually a hereditary position, served as the
voice of legal and political authority in the tribelet (Levy 1978). Within the project area the
people were likely part of the Julpun tribelet (Bennyhoff 1977).
The arrival of Europeans including trappers, gold miners, and other settlers to California,
the Miwok suffered exposure to introduced diseases. Hostilities between the Miwok and
Europeans took an additional toll on the population. The Spanish mission system forcibly
assimilated many Plains Miwok circa 1811 to 1836 (Bennyhoff 1977). After California was
annexed by the United States, some Miwok were displaced to Central Valley locations, yet many
remained on the rancherias established in the Sierra Nevada foothills. During the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries, the Miwok living on the foothill rancherias adapted to new
lifestyles, such as seasonal wage labor on ranches and farms, to augment subsistence through
hunting and gathering (Levy 1978). Since the early twentieth century, many persons of Miwok
descent survive and maintain strong communities and action-oriented organizations including the
Ione Band of Miwok and Wilton Rancheria (Bennyhoff 1977).
157

Southern Patwin
The Southern Patwin are a series of linguistically and culturally related tribelets that once
occupied a portion of the lower Sacramento Valley west of the Sacramento River and north of
Suisun Bay. The ethnographically documented villages nearest to the APE are Aguasto and
Tolenas, both situated immediately north of San Pablo Bay to the west‐northwest (Kroeber 1925,
1932).
The largest political unit for the Patwin was the tribelet. Patwin tribelets maintained their
own autonomy and sense of territoriality and typically consisted of one primary and several
satellite villages. Villages were located along waterways, often near the junction with another
major topographic feature, such as foothills or another waterway (Kroeber 1925, 1932). While a
common language unified these social units, the Southern Patwin language disappeared shortly
after European contact, but may be related to a Wintuan language. Within the tribelet were
several political and social distinctions, including a chief who oversaw village activities; this
position was passed through inheritance from father to son (Johnson 1978).
The principal subsistence activities of the Patwin were hunting, fishing, and the gathering
of wild plants. Along with the acorn, the primary staple, the Patwin gathered buckeye, pine nuts,
berries, wild grapes, and other plants. Each village had its own location for these food sources,
and the village chief oversaw the procurement of food for the village (Johnson 1978).
Population estimates for Patwin groups, from pre‐contact until 1833, are more than 15,000
(Kroeber 1932; Cook 1955). The Patwin were in contact with the Spanish missions by the late
eighteenth century, and some of the earliest historic records of the Patwin are found among
mission registers of baptisms, marriage, and deaths of Native American neophytes. Mission San
Jose, established in 1797, along with Mission Dolores, actively proselytized Patwin from their
southern villages, and Mission Sonoma, built in 1823, also baptized neophytes, until the
secularization of all missions by the Mexican government in 1832–1836. Afterward, many tribal
territories were divided into individual land grants (Johnson 1978).
The U.S. conquest of California (1846–1848) was followed by a massive influx of
American settlers into Patwin territory. To facilitate the development of ranching, agriculture,
mining, and large settlements, the Patwin were usually moved to reservations. However, some
Patwin assimilated themselves, at least partially, into white culture by working as ranch laborers
(Johnson 1978). Today, some Patwin descendants live on the Colusa, Cortina, and Rumsey
Rancherias; although many of the people living on these rancherias are of general Wintun
descent.
Historic Era Setting
The historic setting is intended to illustrate general themes in the development of the
Delta as a place. The Delta’s history is steeped in land reclamation and development of
agriculture, but also includes commercial activities such as fishing, canning, and industrialized
produce processing. At both Big Break and Little Franks Tract, the activities were limited to
agriculture. Large and small scale agriculture was facilitated by development of transportation
158

routes, first focused on Delta waterways but eventually developing into land routes. The Delta’s
built environment has also been shaped by large‐scale flood control and water management
efforts, as well as recreational activities such as fishing and boating.
Spanish Era to Gold Rush
The first Spanish expedition to reach the Delta was led by Captain Pedro Fages in 1772;
however, the Spanish presence in California remained concentrated mainly along the coastal
strip of missions and presidios, the nearest of which was located west of the Delta. During the
early nineteenth century, Spanish and Mexican soldiers would enter the Delta region on
incursions to capture Native Americans who had fled missions. The Bay Miwok were the first to
be missionized. When Mexico achieved independence from Spain in 1822, California became a
territory of Mexico, but remained a remote frontier province. By the end of the decade,
American fur trappers began to enter the San Joaquin Valley and the Delta after hearing reports
of abundant beaver that circulated after Jedediah Smith’s trapping expeditions through central
California in 1827 and 1828. Fur trapping in and around the Delta resulted in a steep decline of
beaver populations, and fur trappers introduced diseases in the region that heavily affected
Native American tribes (Owens 1991; Sandos 2004; Thompson 1957).
By 1848, when gold was discovered at Sutter’s Mill in Coloma, only a handful of people
had settled in the Delta, but thousands of newcomers traveled Delta waterways en route to the
foothill and mountain mines to the east. Some California newcomers chose to farm instead of
mine. Farmers began to work land at the edge of the Delta, along the natural levees of the major
rivers draining into it. Known as “rim landers,” these early settlers built shoestring levees (3-5
feet tall) atop the natural levees to withstand the highest tidal rises. Later, more extensive levee
construction downstream would transform the Delta (Paul 1973; Street 2004; Thompson 1957).
Land Reclamation
The Swampland Act of 1850 and creation of the State Board of Swamp Land
Commissioners enabled the establishment of districts to reclaim land in the Delta. However,
lack of cooperation among small landowners and later legislation allowed wealthy absentee
owners to take over large portions of the Delta. The speculative, large‐scale land reclamation
brought thousands of Chinese workers to the Delta. They first helped with the construction of
levees and then worked in the resulting agricultural fields (Garone 2011; Lund et al. 2007;
Owens 1991; Thompson 1957). Chinese tenant farmers are known to have worked and lived
within the once reclaimed lands of Big Break during the 1870s and 1880s (Busby 2001) and
Little Franks Tract in the 1910s (Waugh 1986).
People reclaiming the Delta faced many challenges. Levees in the Delta have required
constant and expensive maintenance and repair as they frequently failed and islands flooded.
The beds of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and tributaries beds were raised and choked
by tailings from hydraulic mining in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The floors of the Delta’s peat
islands frequently underwent subsidence from farming and because they were no longer subject
to deposition activities during annual inundation. Groundwater seepage increased, creating
marsh areas. Irrigation for agriculture upstream caused saltwater intrusion deeper into the Delta.
159

New technology helped landowners build larger levees and move floodwater out more
quickly. The introduction of clamshell dredges in 1879 enabled the construction of increasingly
larger and more secure levees. Modern pumps and the introduction of electricity allowed for
more efficient and thorough draining of flooded islands. By the early twentieth century, the rise
of industrial agriculture across the Delta increased pressure for state and Federal action to protect
and facilitate the region’s agricultural economy through flood control efforts, transportation
development, and large‐scale water policy and development in the early twentieth century
(Garone 2007; Thompson 1957; Thompson 2006). Subsidence and deteriorating levees are
ongoing challenges today.
Agriculture
Agricultural activity in the Delta took place on higher lands near natural levees and rises
along the Sacramento River, where farmers raised potatoes, onions, and beans, among other
crops, and grazed cattle and sheep. From the 1860s through the 1880s, reclamation spread
agriculture from alluvium lands upstream into the peat lands of the central Delta. With water
access to a growing urban market in San Francisco, Delta agriculture boomed and crops were
diversified (Lokke and Simmons 1980; Rawls and Bean 2002; Thompson 1957; Thompson
2006).
An ethnically diverse population farmed land created by large‐scale speculative
reclamation through time. These large land holdings were divided into smaller plots with a
resident superintendent. Chinese, Italian, and Portuguese tenant farmers often specialized in
garden or truck farming. Chinese agricultural laborers also became associated with row crops,
especially nineteenth‐century potato cultivation. In the twentieth century, Japanese farmers
frequently engaged in potato and asparagus production. Beginning in the 1920s, Filipino and
Mexican day laborers also worked Delta lands (Azuma 1994; Miller 1995; Thompson 1957).
Modern industrial farming in the Delta region began after World War I. Fuel-powered
tractors became commonplace in the Delta, particularly among the large land companies.
Although large acreage continued to be reclaimed, a good deal of island land was improved
through the introduction of electric pumps. The sale of field crops by consignment to wholesale
markets or shippers nurtured the rise of canneries and wholesale produce houses with product
standards and field buyers. Urban factories were developed in the Delta during this period,
which often employed ethnic laborers to help make sugar out of sugar beets or can fruit,
asparagus, and other vegetables (Armentrout‐Ma 1981; Thompson 1957).
Transportation Development
During the Gold Rush, most Americans who encountered the Delta did so as passengers
of sailboats and steamers en route between San Francisco and the mines east of the Delta. A few
trails and later roadways complemented the water traffic. Only after the start of the twentieth
century did roads begin to dominate traffic in the Delta with the introduction of the automobile
and truck. Ferries connected roads with agriculture on remote islands. Early trails evolved into
roads traveled by stages hauling freight back and forth between the farms and the small towns
160

that took shape behind recently constructed levees. Railroads also played an important role in
the development of agriculture, especially after the beginning of the twentieth century. After
1900, county and state investment nurtured bridge construction, which in turn enabled the
development of year‐round roads serving Delta residents and visitors. During the 1910s and
early 1920s, additional bridge construction and road development connected the era’s increasing
automobile traffic from the earlier established roads to new routes extending to Isleton and Rio
Vista. No longer extant electric interurban railroads also extended into portions of the Delta
during the early twentieth century (Blow 1920; Caltrans 1990; Thompson 1980).
Water Management
The Delta became a focal point of increasingly large‐scale water engineering and
management during the early twentieth century. Pressure to ameliorate ongoing flood threats
due to the legacies of hydraulic mining led to 1917 legislation creating the first Federal flood
control project. The plan included nearly two hundred miles of levees, several hundred miles of
bypass channels, and ultimately the rerouting of floodwaters of the Sacramento, Yuba, and
American Rivers. Large dredges in use in the Delta for decades were now employed to build
new levees and create channels for flood control.
Numerous canals and straightened and widened river channels were by‐products of the
islands and levees created by Delta reclamation. These functioned as an important water source
for irrigation and provided both recreational boating waterway and dredge access for levee
construction and maintenance. Most Delta canals appear to have been opportunistically created
rather than being formally engineered, hence no design or “as‐built” drawings for early canals
and levees have been located. Nevertheless, with Federal involvement in flood control after
1917, and especially in the 1920s, plans were drawn and implemented for standard levees and
canals for the Sacramento Delta (Pisani 2002).
At the end of the 1920s, state engineer Edward Hyatt developed a State Water Plan to
respond to growing water problems. In 1928 the state’s voters approved a constitutional
amendment that limited the holders of riparian water rights to reasonable use of their water,
which opened the way for the state legislature to pass the Central Valley Project Act in 1933.
Most of the Central Valley Project was completed by the early 1950s, including more than 500
miles of canals and 20 dams and reservoirs.
After World War II, the SWRCB began planning for additional large‐scale water
management projects. Then state engineer Arthur D. Edmonston developed a state water plan
entailing major new water impoundment and conveyance development. Known as the State
Water Project (SWP), Edmonston’s plan promised to augment flows to the Delta during dry
years and develop state‐funded canals to convey additional water to the San Joaquin Valley and
new supplies to Santa Clara and Alameda Counties. The plan also called for the development of
pumps to transmit Delta water to what would become known as San Luis Reservoir and to a
huge aqueduct conveying water south to be pumped over the Tehachapi Mountains into Southern
California. In 1960, voters approved the financing for the project, and the first phase was
implemented between 1962 and 1971 (Cooper 1968; Kahrl 1979; Rarick 2005).

161

Recreation
By the first decades of the twentieth century the Delta became a haven for sportsmen and
by the 1920s, with the construction of year‐round roads, bridges, hotels, and campsites, it had
become a destination for the recreational driver, the car camper, and the sightseer. In the
post‐World War II era, the widespread development of tract housing bypassed the Delta,
primarily due to land ownership patterns, limited transportation options, and the overabundance
of water. At the same time, those factors helped to foster an increased demand for recreational
opportunities and the proliferation of house and party boats. Recently, wetlands restoration has
made the Delta a destination for bird watchers as several communities have embraced rare and
endangered birds (Schell 1979; Gardner 1964; Steienstra 2012; Thompson 1957; Young 1969).
History of Big Break
The area currently known as Big Break was most likely occupied by peoples of the
Julpun tribelet of the Plains or Eastern or Bay Miwok (Busby 2001) and is just east of what is
considered to be the tribelet center of Chupcan at what is now Antioch (Bennyhoff 1977, Levy
1978). This village was first noted by Europeans visiting the area, including Captain Pedro
Fages and Fray Juan Crespi in 1772, and Juan Bautista de Anza, Lt. Jose Moraga and Fray Pedro
Font in 1776. A map by Jose de Carnizares noted that this village was abandoned in 1776
(Busby 2001). The Julpunes are thought to have occupied the islands and west bank of the San
Joaquin River and may have moved their main village to the islands due to mission contact
(Bennyhoff 1977). The Bay Miwok were among the earliest American Indians to be missionized
and were primarily taken to Mission San Jose, although some were taken to Mission San
Francisco (Beck and Haase 1974; Levy 1978; Milliken 1995).
Dredging along Dutch Slough between 1904 and 1910 connected Dutch Slough,
Sandmound Slough, Taylor Slough and Piper Slough. The building of levees along the southern
shore of Dutch Slough is largely undocumented in the available literature, but inferences can be
made. Levees were built along the mouth of Marsh Creek, which forms the eastern boundary of
the Big Break Regional Shoreline, as early as 1859, but the unleveed land south of Jersey Island
was flooded by Marsh Creek in 1876 (Thompson 1957). The1910 Jersey Island USGS 7.5’
topographic map shows levees along the southern shore of Dutch Slough. Therefore, it can be
surmised that they were constructed between 1876 and 1910, and probably between 1904 and
1910 when Dutch Slough was being dredged. A clamshell dredge was likely used as they had
come into widespread use during that time.
Agriculture was originally pursued in the APE; but not much is known about crops grown
at Big Break, however, asparagus is reported to have been grown there (East Bay Regional Park
District 2014). According to a letter report prepared by Ward Hill for the East Bay Regional
Park District (2000), the property known as Big Break flooded in 1921 (Little Break). The
levees broke again in 1928, flooding a 2.5 square mile area, which was never reclaimed,
effectively ending any agricultural pursuits.

162

Howard Lauritzen acquired a 40 acre parcel of remaining uplands and the flooded area
near Oakley in the 1930s through a trade with Pittsburg Steel. During the 1930s and 1940s,
Lauritzen used this area to dismantle Navy pontoons and target barges as part of a scrap metal
business. As many as 30 to 40 hulls are still present within the open water of the park area and
along the San Joaquin River shoreline (Hill 2000; Moran 2013).
The property was most recently acquired by the East Bay Regional Parks District and
currently is operated as the Big Break Regional Shoreline.
History of Little Franks Tract
Little Franks Tract, like Big Break, likely fell under the tribelet lands of the Julpun
(Waugh 1986). No villages have been recorded on the tract either through ethnographic or
historic literature. Additionally, no prehistoric archaeological sites indicating ethnographic
villages were recorded prior to inundation.
In 1869, George Roberts planned to reclaim the greater Webb Tract which included
Webb, Franks, and Bethel Tracts as well as Bradford and Jersey Islands by a steam paddy, a
prototype steam powered machine (Thompson 1957). At the time these areas were contiguous
with dry land and the costs associated with levee construction would be reduced because one
wouldn’t have to build levees on the land side. Levees surrounding the greater Webb Tract were
built between 1870 and 1872. Flooding was a common occurrence. Jersey Island was flooded in
1878 and it is likely that the entire greater Webb Tract was inundated at the same time
(Thompson 1957). Franks Tract was again reclaimed between 1902 and 1906 by modern
methods, but flooded in 1907. The levee breaches were repaired and remained intact until
February of 1936, when Franks Tract flooded once again (Thompson 1957). Repairs were made
by the following October , but a combination of high river flows, tides and high winds caused a
levee breach of several hundred feet in February of 1938 (Thompson 1957). Due to the cost of
reclamation the levees were never repaired. A short cross levee, built by John Franks in 1936, to
protect his western holdings, was constructed across the Northwestern arm of the tract and
preserved what became known as Little Franks Tract.
Prior to inundation, agriculture was the primary occupation of those on the island. These
activities supported a racially diverse population on the island which typified that seen in
agricultural settings throughout the delta, especially among migrant workers. The U.S. census
data from 1910 indicate that the island was inhabited by Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Hindu,
Italians, and Americans (Waugh 1986).
Little Franks Tract continued to be used for farming until its acquisition by the State of
California. In 1953, the island was reputed to have little improvement, four barns, a windmill, a
ranch house, siphons, and pumping equipment (Waugh 1986). Little Franks Tract later flooded
in 1981 and again in 1983 and has never been reclaimed (DWR 2009).
Franks Tract’s flooding introduced new activities to the region. Peat dredging for soil
conditioning material followed soon after inundation (Waugh 1986). A portion of the island was
used as a Naval bombing target for air to ground rockets and miniature bombs (California State
163

Military Museum 2008). The island is now a State Recreation Area and activities such as
boating, hunting, and fishing are practiced here.
Methods for Resource Identification
In 2012, a record search for the entire Delta was completed at California Historic
Resources Information Centers for the Bay Delta Conservation Plan (ICF 2012b). A second
search to update this information and retrieve survey data was completed in March 2014 at the
North Central Information Center and the Northwest Information Center. Additional research
was undertaken using in house records and those held by the East Bay Regional Park System, the
State Lands Commission, and National Register of Historic Places.
As both work areas within the APE are completely submerged, no pedestrian survey
could be undertaken. However, a reconnaissance survey in the form of boat trips which included
photographing the remnant levees and other features were undertaken to document the current
condition of these resources. The potential pipeline alignments were not surveyed because their
actual alignment is not currently known, there would be minimal temporary effects to any
cultural resources, and the pipe used is flexible enough to be routed around areas of concern.
Known Cultural Resources
The cultural resources study identified three cultural resources within the APE: the
remnant levees surrounding Little Franks Tract and Big Break and the Sherman Island Levee
(CA-SAC-553H). Each is described and evaluated for its eligibility for listing in the NRHP
separately, below.
Big Break
The levees surrounding Big Break were recorded and evaluated by USACE in November
2013. The current state of the levees is very degraded. Current (2012) aerial photos show that
approximately 20,740.9 feet (3.9 miles) remains of the levees in at least 13 segments. As
discussed above, the levee surrounding Big Break breached in 1928 and the land was never
reclaimed. USACE has determined that while the levee was peripherally related to the themes of
reclamation and agricultural development in the Delta, it does not retain enough integrity of
location, setting, feeling, association, workmanship, materials, and design to be eligible under
Criterion A. It is not associated with any person or persons significant to history (Criterion B).
The levee likewise does not embody the distinct characteristics of a type, period, nor method of
construction, nor represent the work of a master, nor do they possess high artistic values, or
represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual
distinction (Criterion C). The levee has not yielded, nor is it likely to yield, information
important in prehistory or history (Criterion D). Therefore, USACE has determined the levee is
not eligible for listing in the NRHP.
Little Franks Tract

164

The levees surrounding Franks Tract, including those around Little Franks Tract, were
recorded in November 2013. USACE subsequently evaluated the levees and determined that
they were not eligible for listing in the NRHP. Current (2012) aerial photos show that levees
around Little Franks Tract measure approximately 16,863 feet (3.2 miles) in 14 segments
ranging from 53 to 6694 feet long. The current state of the levees is very degraded. While part
of the larger Franks Tract early in its history, Little Franks Tract was saved from inundation in
1938 by a cross levee on the eastern edge built in 1936. However, the levees were overtopped in
1981 and 1983 and the island was never reclaimed. USACE has determined that while the levee
was peripherally related to the themes of reclamation and agricultural development in the Delta,
it does not retain enough integrity of location, setting, feeling, association, workmanship,
materials, and design to be eligible under Criterion A. It is not associated with any person or
persons significant to history (Criterion B). The levee likewise does not embody the distinct
characteristics of a type, period, nor method of construction, nor represent the work of a master,
nor do they possess high artistic values, or represent a significant and distinguishable entity
whose components may lack individual distinction (Criterion C). The levee has not yielded, nor
is it likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history (Criterion D). Therefore,
USACE has determined the levee is not eligible for listing in the NRHP.
Sherman Island Levee
The Sherman Island Levee is located in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. It is an
earthen levee with an approximate length of 18 miles. A two lane paved roadway exists on the
crown. The recording of this levee in 2013 recommended this levee as not eligible for listing in
the NRHP. Likewise, the USACE has determined that while the levee was peripherally related
to the themes of reclamation and agricultural development in the Delta, it does not retain enough
integrity of location, setting, feeling, association, workmanship, materials, and design to be
eligible under Criterion A. It is not associated with any person or persons significant to history
(Criterion B). The levee likewise does not embody the distinct characteristics of a type, period,
nor method of construction, nor represent the work of a master, nor do they possess high artistic
values, or represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction (Criterion C). The levee has not yielded, nor is it likely to yield,
information important in prehistory or history (Criterion D). Therefore, USACE has determined
the levee is not eligible for listing in the NRHP. Therefore, USACE has determined the levee are
not individually eligible for listing in the NRHP. It may be eligible for its connection to the
larger flood control project, but only as a contributing element, however, the placement of pipes
over the levee has no potential to effect historic properties.
Areas not Surveyed
Materials from existing dredge spoils locations are proposed be piped along unknown
corridors to the work areas at Big Break and Little Franks Tract. Because the alignment of these
pipes is currently unknown, only a record search of potential alignments has been performed at
this time. The record search showed that only one known cultural resource is within the
potential corridors: the Sherman Island Levee described above.

165

Consultation
Native American
Native American Tribes with interests in the Delta were contacted by USACE in May
2013. USACE received one response from the Wilton Rancheria with a request for more
information and stated desire to continue to be involved. More detailed information was sent to
all the Tribes in March 2014.
State Historic Preservation Officer
USACE determined that the proposed undertaking would result in no historic properties
affected. Consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer will be completed prior to the
final EIS.

5.0 – ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES

5.1

Introduction

This chapter discusses the potential effects of the alternative plans on the significant
environmental resources described in Chapter 4. The present condition of each resource
analyzed in this chapter is compared with the estimated future condition of the resource after the
following alternative plans are in place:
•

Alternative 1 – No Action

•

Alternative 2 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break via Direct Placement

•

Alternative 6 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break and Little Franks Tract via
Direct Placement and Pumping of Previously Dredged Materials

Project effects on these significant environmental resources are measurable over the
entire restoration footprint or over specific project areas depending upon the configuration of
each resource.
Both beneficial and adverse effects are considered, including direct effects during
construction and indirect effects resulting from the alternatives. Each section, where appropriate,
contains a discussion of the methods used to analyze effects. In addition, the bases of
significance (criteria) for each resource are identified to provide a basis for evaluation of the
significance of any adverse effects. Finally, mitigation measures are proposed reduce any
significant adverse effects for each resource. A summary of the effects and their level of
significance is included in Section 5.7, Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitment of Resources.
The bases of significance follow NEPA requirements. USACE has integrated NEPA
requirements into its regulations, policies, and guidance. Engineering Regulation 1105-2-100,
“Planning Guidance Notebook,” April 2000, establishes the following significance criteria:
•

Significance based on institutional recognition means that the importance of the
effects is acknowledged in the laws, adopted plans, and other policy statements of
public agencies and private groups. Institutional recognition is often in the form of
specific criteria.

•

Significance based on public recognition means that some segment of the general
public recognized the importance of the effect. Public recognition may take the form
of controversy, support, conflict, or opposition expressed formally or informally.

•

Significance based on technical recognition means that the importance of an effect is
based on the technical or scientific criteria related to critical resource characteristics.

For this EIS, the above three NEPA criteria apply to all resources and are not repeated
under each resource section.
167

5.2

Vegetation and Wildlife

This section evaluates the effects of the proposed alternatives on vegetation and wildlife
resources in the project area and potential mitigation measures to reduce impacts to a less-thansignificant level. Effects of the proposed alternatives were analyzed during coordination with the
USFWS under the Federal Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act. Biological field surveys were
conducted at each Project site and in the project vicinity by USFWS, NMFS, and USACE in
November of 2013 to assess vegetation cover types, existing habitat for special status and
wildlife species, and the presence of special status species and invasive plant species. A Habitat
Evaluation Procedures (HEP) analysis was conducted to determine the effects of the proposed
alternatives on vegetation and wildlife resources. This section includes a summary of the HEP
analysis. The HEP analysis is included with the document as Appendix F.

5.2.1

Methodology and Basis of Significance

Methodology
The impacts of the different project alternatives were assessed primarily by the
application of HEP to quantitatively measure habitat value and quality of the habitat for wildlife
at baseline or current conditions, and compares that value with the estimated habitat value at
various points in time throughout a 50-year period of analysis for each project alternative. The
HEP analysis is based on the assumption that the value of habitat to a selected species or group
of species can be described in models using variables that represent habitat suitability of wildlife.
The models produce a Habitat Suitability Index, which is multiplied by the area of available
habitat to obtain habitat units (HUs). The HUs and average annual habitat units (AAHUs) over
the life of the project are then used in the comparison of the effects of the alternatives and in the
quantification of any project-related mitigation.
Under NEPA, the significance of project impacts is a function of context and intensity.
For biological resources, context refers to the importance (ecological, commercial, scientific,
recreational, etc.) or regulatory (i.e. legally protected) status of the resource, and intensity refers
to the magnitude – scale and duration – of the impact. Both beneficial and adverse impacts are
recognized; either can be significant.
In the study area, the habitats of greatest importance are tidal marsh and seasonal
wetlands. These habitats are most important because of their scarcity and high value to fish and
wildlife species. Substantial long-term net reductions in the acreage and/or value of these
habitats would represent significant adverse impacts, underscoring the importance to the
ecosystem of the project’s contribution of new intertidal marsh converted from lesser-valued
open water or grassland habitat. Losses or gains of population and habitat for special status
species may also be significant, depending on the magnitude of the impact relative to the
population size and distribution of the species in the region. Finally, any impact leading to new

168

introductions or the expansion of invasive species would also be considered significant in terms
of potential far-reaching effects on the ecosystem of the project area.
Because the purpose of the project is habitat restoration, the habitat functions and values
that would be provided upon maturity of the habitats proposed for restoration are also described.
The project is designed to establish intertidal marsh habitat at the proposed restoration sites and
that context was considered in evaluating the impacts to vegetation and wildlife.
Basis of Significance
Adverse effects on vegetation and wildlife were considered significant if implementation
of an alternative plan would result in any of the following:
•

Result in a substantial loss of native vegetation or species.

•

Removal, or substantially disturbance of a sensitive natural community (wetlands,
tidal marsh)

•

Substantial reduction in the quality and quantity of important habitat or access to such
habitat for wildlife species.

5.2.2

Alternative 1 – No Action

Under the no action alternative, it is assumed that no action would be taken to restore
intertidal marsh habitat to the flooded islands. It is assumed that restoration action currently
proposed under BDCP and other projects would still be constructed, but not at these locations.
Therefore, overall, vegetation and wildlife resources in the study area are expected to remain
similar to existing conditions.

5.2.3
Placement

Alternative 2 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break via Direct

In order to create intertidal marsh habitat, material from O&M dredging would be
pumped to the restoration site and placed to raise the submerged surface of portions of Big
Break, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on Figure 3-9. O&M dredging and the piping of
material to the placement site is an ongoing USACE operation that is covered under the San
Francisco Bay to Stockton (John F Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channel) Final Environmental
Impact Statement from September 1980.
Effects on Existing Habitats
Under Alternative 2, 42 acres of open water habitat would be converted to freshwater
intertidal marsh habitat via the direct placement of O&M dredged material, as described in
Section 3.9.2. It is anticipated that sensitive vegetative habitat types located on the periphery of

169

Big Break such as existing tidal marsh and riparian vegetation, would be avoided because
placement of dredged material would be restricted to open water, outside these habitats.
Habitat growth at Big Break would occur gradually over time as dredged material
placement occurs. Because dredged material placement is dependent on annual O&M dredging,
which is estimated to produce 100,000 cubic yards per year, project construction would require
at least 5 years. Only clean dredged material found suitable for direct placement for the purpose
of habitat restoration, would be accepted at the project site. As the restoration site progresses
over time, the restored intertidal marsh would become established in 2 to 4 years and provide
valuable new habitat for fish and wildlife species.
The gain of higher value intertidal marsh habitat would more than offset the loss of open
water habitat (Table 5-1). Accordingly, permanent loss of open water habitat would result in a
less-than-significant impact. Because of uncertainties regarding the rate of intertidal marsh
vegetation development to offset the temporary loss of habitat values, a monitoring plan is
proposed as part the project to measure the establishment rate and the quality and quantity of
habitat gained. No mitigation would be required because the project’s conversion of open water
habitat to intertidal marsh habitat would result in a net increase in HU’s and AAHU’s over the
life of the project, a positive environmental effect. See Table 5-1 for net changes to habitat
types.
Effects on Non-Special Status Wildlife Species
The permanent conversion of wetland habitats would result in a substantial improvement
to the wetland functions and values on the project site for fish and wildlife, including special
status species. The creation of intertidal marsh habitat within Big Break would likely create
high-quality habitat for common species of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Common
fish and wildlife species present within the study area may be directly or indirectly affected by
construction. Direct impacts may include mortality or injury to individuals present within the
proposed sites due to dredged material placement, movement of heavy equipment, construction
noise, and turbidity. Indirect impacts would include alteration of habitat conditions after the
completion of construction. The risk of a potential increase in the bioavailability of
contaminants carried in dredged materials is addressed in the water quality section.
Although common fish and wildlife species are not afforded the same levels of protection
as special status species and do not have the same agency consultation requirements under
applicable laws, regulations, and policies described in the regulatory section, common species
generally would receive some protection from measures prescribed for special status wildlife
species. Non-special status species would benefit from the installation of exclusion fencing and
orange barrier fencing along the edge of the construction area that is within 200 feet of suitable
special species habitats and best management practices. Because the proposed restoration would
benefit other fish and wildlife species in addition to special status species, and because measures
would be implemented to reduce impacts, the resulting effect is considered less than significant,
and no mitigation is required.

Introduction or Spread of Invasive Plants as a Result of Project Construction
Invasive plants are already present throughout project area. However, construction
activities could introduce new invasive plants to the project area or contribute to the spread of
existing invasive plants to uninfested areas outside the project area. Invasive plants or their
seeds may be dispersed by construction equipment if appropriate prevention measures are not
implemented. The introduction or spread of invasive plants as a result of the project could have
a significant effect on sensitive natural communities within and outside the project area by
displacing native flora. The implementation of the appropriate best management practices
171

(BMPs) to avoid or minimize the spread or introduction of invasive plants would ensure that the
proposed alternative would not have a significant adverse effect on sensitive natural communities
from the introduction or spread of invasive plants. With implementation of BMPs listed in
Section 5.2.5 below to avoid and minimize the spread or introduction of invasive plant species,
this would be a less-than-significant effect. Terrestrial invasive species at the material source
sites, whether in seed or mature form, would not survive in the aquatic environment after transfer
to the project site. The wet conditions would not allow terrestrial invasive species to germinate.
No additional mitigation is required.

5.2.4 Alternative 6 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break and Little Franks
Tract via Direct Placement and Pumping of Previously Dredged Materials
Alternative 6 includes Alternative 2 with the addition of further increments of intertidal
marsh restoration at both Big Break and Little Franks Tract. In order to construct these
additional increments, previously dredged material would be acquired from past O&M
placement sites, as shown on Figure 3-8. The dredged material would be excavated and pumped
from these source material sites to the restoration sites, and placed to raise the submerged surface
of portions of Big Break and Little Franks Tract, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on
Figure 3-13. Similar to Alternative 2, past O&M dredging is covered under the San Francisco
Bay to Stockton (John F Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channel) Final Environmental Impact
Statement from September 1980. However, effects associated with the pumping of material
from the source material sites are analyzed below. The dredged materials from the DWSCs are
sampled prior to O&M activities and tested for HTRWs. Existing stockpiled materials were
previously tested and records show granular and chemical analyses. The test results are
compared against baseline sampling from the restoration sites. Dredged materials not meeting
the chemical baseline would not be used. Under Alternative 6, 89.5 acres of open water habitat
would be permanently converted to intertidal marsh habitat as shown in Table 5-1.
Effects on Existing Habitats
As in Alternative 2, it is anticipated that sensitive vegetative habitat types located on the
periphery of Big Break such as existing tidal marsh and riparian vegetation, would also be
avoided. However, because this alternative relies on obtaining sediment from dredged material
source sites in addition to O&M dredged material, this alternative could potentially disturb
vegetative habitats located on the dredged material sites. Table 5-1 and Figures 4-1 and 4-2
identify the terrestrial habitats present at the proposed dredged material source sites. The impact
analysis assumes that construction activities required to excavate and transport material would be
designed to avoid disturbance to sensitive habitats by limiting construction activities to usable
non-sensitive areas within these sites.
The excavated material would be transported from the dredged material placement sites
to the restoration sites via a pipeline. While the final locations of the pipeline’s placement have
yet to be determined, it can be assumed that whenever feasible the pipelines will be installed
along the edge of farm roads to avoid disturbance to additional habitats. As a result, since the
farm roads are disturbed dirt roads with no vegetation, there would be no effect associated with
172

this action on vegetation and wildlife. With implementation of the BMPs described in Section
5.2.5 to avoid and minimize the effects to existing habitats, this would be a less-than-significant
effect and no additional mitigation would be required.
As described for Alternative 2, habitat development at Big Break would occur gradually
over time as dredged material placement occurs. As in Alternative 2, construction would require
at least 5 years to complete. Restored intertidal marsh would gradually establish and provide
habitat for fish and wildlife species.
Overall, the permanent conversion of wetland habitats would result in a substantial
improvement to the wetland functions and values on the project site for fish and wildlife,
including special status species. The gain of higher value intertidal marsh habitat would more
than offset the loss of open water habitat (Table 5-1). Accordingly, permanent conversion of
open water habitat to intertidal marsh would result in a net beneficial environmental impact. No
mitigation would be required because the conversion of open water habitat to intertidal marsh
habitat would result in a net increase in HU’s and AAHU’s over the life of the project, which is a
beneficial effect on vegetation and wildlife. Vegetation surveys at Donlan Island, a similar
beneficial use dredge material intertidal marsh restoration project 1.5 miles west of the proposed
project, confirmed an 80 percent or more survival/establishment rate of intertidal marsh
vegetation within two years. The intertidal marsh vegetation at the Donlan project was naturally
recruited. No planting was installed. Given the close proximity to Donlan and identical tidal
flows, the proposed project has the propensity to meet or exceed habitat modeling results, as
shown on Table 5-1.
Effects on Non-Special Status Wildlife Species
Common fish and wildlife species present within the study area may be directly or
indirectly affected by construction. Direct impacts may include mortality or injury to individuals
present within the sites due to dredge material placement, movement of heavy equipment,
construction noise, and turbidity. In addition, temporary disturbance to wildlife from noise and
movement of construction equipment would occur at the dredge material source sites. Indirect
impacts may also include alteration of habitat conditions after the completion of construction.
As described for Alternative 2, common fish and wildlife species would receive some
protection from measures prescribed for special status animals. Exclusion fencing and BMPs, as
described in Section 5.2.5, would minimize impacts. The resulting effect is considered less than
significant, and no mitigation is required because the project’s conversion of open water habitat
to intertidal marsh habitat would result in a net increase in HU’s and AAHU’s over the life of the
project, a positive environmental effect.
Introduction or Spread of Invasive Plants as a Result of Project Construction
As described for Alternative 2, colonization of invasive non-native plant species as a
result of construction could result. However, because Alternative 6 would disturb a larger area
due to the excavation and transport of dredge material from dredged material source sites, the
potential for invasive species to displace or prevent establishment of native species is greater.
173

Construction activities could introduce new invasive plants to the project area or contribute to the
spread of existing invasive plants to uninfested areas outside the study area. Invasive plants or
their seeds may be dispersed by construction equipment if appropriate prevention measures are
not implemented. The introduction or spread of invasive plants as a result of the project could
have a significant effect on sensitive natural communities within and outside the project area by
displacing native flora. The implementation of the appropriate BMPs to avoid or minimize the
spread or introduction of invasive plants will ensure that the proposed project would not have a
significant effect on sensitive natural communities from the introduction or spread of invasive
plants. With implementation of the BMPs described in Section 5.2.5 to avoid and minimize the
spread or introduction of invasive plant species, this would be a less-than-significant effect and
no additional mitigation would be required.

5.2.5

Mitigation

The following measures would be implemented to reduce potential short-term impacts
that could result from the introduction or spread of invasive plant species as a result of project
construction:

5.3

•

The adjacent existing levee would be treated with EPA and State-approved herbicides
to remove weed species and invasive species.

•

Mowing and spraying would be implemented in the restoration areas to control and
reduce continued weed growth.

•

Terrestrial wildlife species would benefit from the installation of exclusion fencing
along the edge of the construction area that is within 200 feet of suitable giant garter
snake habitat.

•

Records and reports would be required to document any actions to maintain the site
and the annual progress of the site.

Special Status Species

This section evaluates the effects of the proposed alternatives on special status species in
the project area. Initial evaluation determined that several species have the potential to occur, or
that suitable habitat exists, in the project area.
5.3.1

Methodology and Basis of Significance

Methodology
Special-status species are defined as animals that are legally protected under the ESA,
CESA, or other regulations and species that are considered sufficiently rare by the scientific
community to qualify for such listing. Based on the USFWS (2013) species list and CNDDB
(California Department of Fish and Game 2013) records search for the quadrangles overlapping
174

the affected area, nine special-status plant and wildlife species were identified as having potential
to occur in the affected area (Table 4-2).
Basis of Significance
Adverse effects on special status species were considered significant if implementation of
an alternative plan would:
•

Directly or indirectly reduce the growth, survival, or reproductive success of species
listed or proposed for listing as threatened or endangered under the Federal or State
Endangered Species Act.

•

Directly or indirectly reduce the growth survival, or reproductive success of
substantial populations of Federal or State species of concern or regionally important
species.

5.3.2

Alternative 1 – No Action

The no action alternative assumes that no action would be taken by the USACE to restore
intertidal marsh habitat to the flooded islands. The flooded islands would remain in their current
state. Under the future without project condition, BDCP restoration actions are assumed to
improve habitat conditions in the Delta for special status species populations as described in
Section 3.3.

5.3.3
Placement

Alternative 2 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break via Direct

In order to create intertidal marsh habitat, material from O&M dredging would be
pumped to the restoration site and placed to raise the submerged surface of portions of Big
Break, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on Figure 3-9. O&M dredging and the piping of
material to the placement site is an ongoing USACE operation that is covered under the San
Francisco Bay to Stockton (John F Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channels) Final Environmental
Impact Statement from September 1980. In-water work would occur over a 5-year period from
August 1 to October 31 each year in association with annual O&M ship channel dredging
operations.
Special Status Plant Species
Because the areas of physical disturbance caused by the project would be largely
confined to open water, there is a low potential for the impacts to special‐status plants, but if one
or more of these species are present in adjoining areas of higher ground necessary for staging and
project construction, project construction could result in their removal. The dredged material
placement component of Alternative 2 has the potential to significantly impact special status
plant species in tidal marsh fringing the construction site. Species that have been documented in
175

the local area that could be affected include Suisun Aster, Mason’s Lilaeopsis, and Delta
Mudwort.
Because the presence and extent of any special status plants in the project construction
area is unknown, this effect is potentially significant. However, the USACE would conduct
surveys of the study area to document the presence of special status plants before project
implementation. Qualified botanists would conduct a floristic survey that follows the CDFW
botanical survey guidelines. If special status plant populations are detected where construction
would have unavoidable impacts, USACE will modify the project design to avoid indirect or
direct effects and/or prepare and implement a compensatory mitigation plan in coordination with
USFWS or CDFW. Such plans may include salvage, propagation, on-site reintroduction in
restored habitats, and monitoring. If there are no special status plant populations detected during
the preconstruction surveys, then there would be no effects to special status plant species from
implementation of Alternative 2.
Special-Status Fish Species
Effects of the proposed Project on special-status fish include both short- and long-term
effects. Short-term effects include direct impacts from construction activities (e.g., increased
suspended sediment and turbidity). Long-term or permanent impacts would result from the
conversion of open water habitat to intertidal marsh habitat.
Short-term Effects on Fish Habitat and EFH
Construction would occur over a 5-year period during the summer and fall of each year, a
time when salmonid juveniles and smolts may be rearing and outmigrating through the Delta,
and when adult salmonids are likely to be moving upstream through the Delta. Adult and
juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead primarily migrate upstream and downstream within the
main-stem Sacramento River. Juvenile Chinook salmon and steelhead may migrate from the
Sacramento River to the central Delta during their downstream migration and may also inhabit
flooded islands as a temporary foraging area and migration pathway during the winter and early
spring migration period. The occurrence of juvenile Chinook salmon in the Delta would be
expected to occur during late fall through early spring when Delta water temperatures would be
suitable for juvenile Chinook salmon migration. Short term effects to juveniles and smolts
during construction would be temporary. The project area is very small in comparison to the
overall central Delta, and there is significant rearing and feeding habitat present in adjacent
aquatic areas. Therefore short-term effects from project construction would be less than
significant. The project would increase primary productivity to juveniles and smolts, which
would be a long-term beneficial effect.
Although the majority of adult Chinook salmon migrate upstream in the main-stem
Sacramento River, there is a probability, although low, that adults may migrate into the central
Delta. The occurrence of Chinook salmon in the central Delta, including Big Break and Little
Franks Tract, although expected to be very low, would be limited to winter and early spring adult
upstream migration. Adult green sturgeon are not expected to be affected by construction

176

activity, since green sturgeon are believed to spawn in the deepest and fastest portions of the
channel (70 FR 17386).
When fish migration timing coincides with the in-water work window, the presence of
overhead equipment and the sound generated by construction activities could temporarily disrupt
essential behavior patterns (e.g., feeding, escape from predators, migration) of adult and juvenile
fish at the construction sites and the surrounding areas. Noise effects may occur at the project
site and general vicinity. Construction would result in elevated levels of suspended sediment,
causing increased turbidity and potential sedimentation of benthic (bottom) habitat used by
juvenile and adult fish for feeding, cover, and other essential behaviors. Direct mortality of
individuals could occur to fish present during construction. Placement of dredged sediment may
also potentially disturb, injure, or kill any fish migrating though the area of the construction sites
during construction.
Non-mobile benthic organisms that are food sources for fish would be smothered by the
placement of dredged material and potentially from placement and anchoring of the sediment
transport pipelines on the bottom and potential up and down movement of the pipeline with the
tides. These areas affected should recover quickly after placement of the dredged material and
removal of the pipelines as these areas are recolonized by benthic organisms. Survival studies at
the nearby Donlon Island project demonstrated that benthic organisms recolonized within a two
year period, providing sufficient primary productivity (food web) benefits.
Resulting short-term effects could include reduced feeding success, and compromised
ability to escape from predators. Toxic substances used by construction equipment including
gasoline and diesel, lubricants, and other petroleum-based products, could enter the waterways
adjacent to the project site as a result of spills or leakage from machinery or storage containers.
The contractor would be required to submit and adhere to a Storm Water Pollution Prevention
Plan (SWPPP) and an in-water work plan subject to approval by the Central Valley RWQCB.
The SWPPP and associated BMPs are discussed further in the Water Quality section (Section
5.4.5). Mortality or physiological impairment of fish or disruption of essential behavior patterns
is possible if exposure to sufficient concentrations occurs.
Short-term direct impacts to special status fish would be considered significant, if
construction were to occur outside of the species work windows. However, USACE would
adhere to the specified species work windows from USFWS and NMFS for salmonid species.
As a result, there would be no effect to listed species, as all work would be occurring outside of
the species migration season.
Long-term Effects on Fish Habitat and EFH
The restoration of intertidal marsh habitat would increase instream structure and aquatic
habitat complexity and the quality of EFH. Planted aquatic vegetation would begin to infiltrate
the shallow water habitat created by dredged material placement and gradually cover the site.
These factors in combination would provide high quality habitat for all life stages of all species
present in the study area and most life stages of special status fishes (except for migrating green
sturgeon). The intertidal marsh habitat would provide escape cover, creating ideal refugia from
177

large predators for small larval and juvenile fishes. The intertidal marsh habitat would be
especially valuable as holding and rearing habitat for all life stages of all special-status species
(except for migrating green sturgeon). Inundated intertidal marsh habitat should provide an
increase in potential delta smelt spawning habitat. Overall, the proposed alternative would have
a net long-term benefit for all life stages of all special-status species. Because the project is
anticipated to result in a long-term benefit to listed species, the project would have a less-thansignificant impact and no mitigation is required.
Special Status Wildlife Species
A number of special status wildlife species have some potential to occur in the study area.
Only a small number of special status wildlife species have the potential to occur in the area
proposed for intertidal marsh restoration since the existing areas proposed for beneficial
placement of dredged material are currently open water. Rather, adjoining areas may support
special status aquatic species that may be disturbed by construction. Since this alternative relies
solely on dredged material placed directly from O&M dredging, no disturbance would result
from the removal and transport of sediment from dredged material source sites. Under
Alternative 2, no project action would occur on land since material would be transferred from the
river channel bottom directly to the restoration site at Big Break. Effects to special status
wildlife species are discussed in the subsections below.
Short-term Effects to Special Status Bird and Bat Species
Noise, vibration, visual, and proximity-related disturbances associated with construction
could adversely affect special status bird and bat species if they are nesting on or adjacent to the
restoration site during construction. Since construction would occur in the August 1 through
October 31 time period outside of the spring nesting season, it is unlikely that nesting birds
would be present. However, if individuals of these species nest during the construction period,
construction disturbances could cause them to abandon their nests or young. The breeding
success of these species could be diminished if disturbances reduce ability of adults to properly
care for their young. Therefore this impact is considered significant. To reduce this impact to a
less-than-significant level, mitigation measures, as discussed in Section 5.3.5 below, would be
implemented.
Mudflats and shallow water (less than 6 inches deep) are important foraging and resting
habitat areas for shorebirds. The project would initially create mudflat habitat by the placement
of dredged material before intertidal marsh vegetation becomes established. The benthic
organisms that colonize these areas would become prey for shorebirds. This impact would be
beneficial to migratory birds.

178

Long-term Effects to Special Status Reptiles and Amphibians
The creation of intertidal marsh along the northern periphery of Big Break adjacent to
Jersey Island could result in long-term benefits to several special-status species. The intertidal
marsh habitat would provide slower moving aquatic habitat suitable for western pond turtles and
giant garter snakes. The intertidal marsh habitat may provide suitable nesting habitat for
tricolored blackbird.

5.3.4 Alternative 6 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break and Little Franks
Tract via Direct Placement and Pumping of Previously Dredged Materials
Alternative 6 includes Alternative 2 with the addition of further increments of intertidal
marsh restoration at both Big Break and Little Franks Tract. In order to construct these
additional increments, previously dredged material would be acquired from past O&M
placement sites, as shown on Figure 3-8. The dredged material would be excavated and pumped
from these source material sites to the restoration sites, and placed to raise the submerged surface
of portions of Big Break and Little Franks Tract, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on
Figure 3-13. Similar to Alternative 2, past O&M dredging is covered under the San Francisco
Bay to Stockton (John F Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channel) Final Environmental Impact
Statement from September 1980. However, effects associated with the pumping of material
from these source material sites is analyzed below. Water used to pump dredged material would
come from onsite and would pass through a fish screen in compliance with NMFS, USFWS, and
CDFW guidance to minimize entrainment of fish. As in Alternative 2, in-water work would take
place from August 1 to October 31 each year for 5 consecutive years .
Special Status Plant Species
As described for Alternative 2, dredged material placement has the potential to
significantly impact special status plant species that may be present in the tidal marsh fringing
the project site. Species that have been documented in the local area that could be affected
include Suisun aster, Mason’s lilaeopsis, and Delta mudwort. The potential for loss of individual
plants is substantially greater than Alternative 2 because Alternative 6 would disturb about twice
as much area to create additional marsh habitat and could impact special status plants if present
at or near the existing dredged material source sites due to the excavation of material. In
addition, there is the possibility of impacting special status plant species from the placement of
miles of pipeline to pump material to Big Break and Little Franks Track. However, whenever
possible, these pipelines would be placed on farm roads that are previously disturbed, therefore
the likelihood of impacts to special status plant populations is very low.
USACE will retain qualified botanists to survey the project area to document the
presence of special status plants before project implementation. The botanists will conduct a
floristic survey that follows the CDFW botanical survey guidelines. If special status plant
populations are detected where construction would have unavoidable impacts, USACE will
modify the project design to avoid indirect or direct effects and/or prepare and implement a
compensatory mitigation plan in coordination with USFWS or CDFW. Such plans may include
179

salvage, propagation, on-site reintroduction in restored habitats, and monitoring. Implementation
of these protective measures should prevent any significant adverse impact to these special status
plant species in the event Alternative 6 is constructed.
Special Status Fish Species
Short-term Effects on Fish Habitat and EFH
Chinook Salmon, Central Valley Steelhead, and Green Sturgeon
As described above under Alternative 2, effects to green sturgeon, Chinook salmon
(winter-run, Central Valley fall/late fall-run, and spring-run), and steelhead would be significant
if construction would occur during the migratory season. However, with the implementation of
USACE and NMFS recommended in-water work windows, there would be no effects to special
status fish species. There would be no additional impacts to fish species from restoration of the
additional acreage under Alternative 6, or from the pumping of previously dredged materials
from the stockpile sites. There is the potential for increased turbidity resulting from excavation
activities at the stockpile sites; however, water quality BMPs, as discussed in Section 5.4.5,
would be implemented to reduce these impacts to less than significant. Long-term impacts
would be consistent with the analysis under Alternative 2.
Delta Smelt
Construction would occur over a 5-year period during the summer and fall of each year, a
time when Delta smelt may be rearing. Construction‐related effects on delta smelt rearing and
migration will be minimized by restricting in‐water construction activities to the August 1
through November 30 work window, thereby avoiding the seasons when these life stages are
most likely to occur. Construction activities would not occur during spawning (January through
July).
Direct mortality of individuals could occur to fish are present during construction.
Placement of dredged sediment may also potentially disturb, injure, or kill any fish in the area of
the construction sites during construction. The sound generated by construction activities could
temporarily disrupt essential behavior patterns (e.g., feeding, escape from predators, migration)
of adult and juvenile fish at the project sites and the surrounding areas. Noise effects may occur
at the project site and general vicinity.
Construction would result in elevated levels of suspended sediment, causing increased
turbidity and potential sedimentation of benthic (bottom) habitat used by juvenile and adult fish
for feeding, cover, and other essential behaviors. Increased turbidity may decrease feeding
opportunities and increased suspended solids could clog and abrade gill filaments (USFWS
2008). Decreased light penetration through the water column may reduce photosynthesis and
reduce the extent of aquatic vegetation upon which delta smelt spawn, as well as the amount of
phytoplankton which are fed upon by the delta smelt’s zooplankton prey. Resulting short-term
effects could include reduced feeding success, and compromised ability to escape from
predators.
180

Toxic substances used by construction equipment including gasoline and diesel,
lubricants, and other petroleum-based products, could enter the waterways adjacent to the project
site as a result of spills or leakage from machinery or storage containers. Mortality or
physiological impairment of fish or disruption of essential behavior patterns is possible if
exposure to sufficient concentrations occurs.
Non-mobile benthic organisms that are food sources for fish would be smothered by the
placement of dredged material and potentially from placement and anchoring of the sediment
transport pipelines on the bottom and potential up and down movement of the pipeline with the
tides. These areas affected should recover quickly after placement of the dredged material and
removal of the pipelines as these areas are recolonized by benthic organisms.
Alternative 6 is likely to adversely affect Delta smelt because construction activities may
result in the injury and mortality of individual fish. The proposed action is not likely to
adversely affect designated critical habitat because the project has been designed to minimize
any impacts to the extent feasible. An approved stormwater management plan will be in place to
minimize any increase in sediment flow and turbidity, as will a plan to prevent the spill of toxic
or potentially toxic materials (including concrete) into the water during all construction. Details
on these measures proposed to reduce impacts to turbidity are included in the Water Quality
section (Section 5.4.5).
Long-term Effects on Fish Habitat and EFH
Chinook Salmon, Central Valley Steelhead, and Green Sturgeon
The restoration of intertidal marsh habitat will increase instream structure, aquatic habitat
complexity, and the quality of EFH. Planted aquatic vegetation will begin to infiltrate the
shallow water habitat created by dredged material placement and gradually cover the site. These
combined factors would provide high quality habitat for all life stages of all species and most life
stages (except for migrating green sturgeon) of special status fishes. The intertidal marsh habitat
would provide escape cover, creating ideal refugia from large predators for small larval and
juvenile fishes. The intertidal marsh habitat would be especially valuable as holding and rearing
habitat for all life stages of all special status fish species (except for migrating green sturgeon).
Inundated intertidal marsh habitat should provide an increase in potential delta smelt spawning
habitat. Overall, Alternative 6 would have a net long-term benefit for all life stages of all special
status fish species. Because Alternative 6 is anticipated to result in a long-term benefit to listed
species, the alternative would have a less-than-significant impact on special status fish species
and no mitigation is required.
Delta Smelt
The restoration of intertidal marsh habitat will increase instream structure and aquatic
habitat complexity. Planted aquatic vegetation will begin to infiltrate the shallow water habitat
created by dredged material placement and gradually cover the site. These factors in
combination would provide high quality habitat. The intertidal marsh habitat would provide
181

escape cover, creating ideal refugia from large predators for small larval and juvenile fishes.
Inundated vegetated wetland should provide an increase in potential Delta smelt spawning
habitat. Overall, the project would have a net long-term benefit to Delta smelt. While incidental
take of Delta smelt may occur during construction, the proposed action to restore intertidal marsh
is anticipated to have long-term benefits to Delta smelt.
Special Status Wildlife Species
A number of special status wildlife species have some potential to occur on the project
sites or within the project vicinity. Only a small number of special status wildlife species,
however, are likely to occur at the proposed intertidal marsh restoration sites since the area is
currently open water. Adjoining areas however may support special status wildlife species that
may be disturbed by construction. Since this alternative relies on both dredged material placed
directly from O&M dredging and material obtained from existing dredged material source sites,
implementation of Alternative 6 would potentially result in effects on wildlife species that would
be greater than Alternative 2 because of the larger construction footprint.
Short-term Effects to Special Status Bird and Bat Species
Noise, vibration, visual, and proximity-related disturbances associated with construction
could adversely affect special status bird and bat species if they are nesting on or adjacent to the
restoration site and dredged material source sites during construction. Since construction would
occur in the August 1 through October 31 time period outside of the spring nesting season, it is
unlikely that nesting birds would be present. However, if individuals of these species nest during
the construction period, construction disturbances could cause them to abandon their nests or
young. The breeding success of these species could be reduced if disturbances reduce the ability
of adults to properly care for their young. Because Alternative 6 has a larger construction
footprint than Alternative 2, the magnitude of potential adverse effects to nesting birds is greater.
Therefore this impact is considered significant. To reduce this impact to a less-than-significant
level, mitigation measures would be implemented as described in Section 5.3.5 below.
Burrowing owls could at the source material sites. Construction activities, including
grading and excavation activities at the source material sites could result in nesting failure, death
of nestlings, or loss of eggs. Effects on burrowing owls could be significant, if they are present
at these sites. Prior to initiation of any excavation activities at the source material sites, a
preconstruction survey for burrowing owls would be completed, in accordance with CDFW
guidelines described in the Staff Report on Burrowing Owl Mitigation. If no burrowing owls are
located during these surveys, then effects to burrowing owls would be less than significant, and
no mitigation would be required. If burrowing owls are located on or immediately adjacent to
the site, then coordination would occur with CDFW to determine the proper measures that would
need to be implemented to ensure that burrowing owls are not impacted by the project. Potential
mitigation measures that could be implemented are discussed in Section 5.3.5 below.
Burrowing owls could be present at the source material sites. If owls are present
construction activities, including grading and excavation could result in nesting failure, death of
nestlings, or loss of eggs. Effects on burrowing owls could be significant, if they are present at
182

these sites. Prior to initiation of any excavation activities at the source material sites, a
preconstruction survey for burrowing owls would be completed, in accordance with CDFW
guidelines described in the Staff Report on Burrowing Owl Mitigation. If no burrowing owls are
located during these surveys, then no effect would occur and no mitigation would be required. If
burrowing owls are located on or immediately adjacent to the site, coordination would occur
with CDFW to determine the proper measures needed to be implemented to ensure that
burrowing owls are not impacted by the project. Potential mitigation measures are discussed in
Section 5.3.5 below.
The increase of primary productivity from new intertidal marsh could benefit burrowing
owls in the vicinity of the project. Burrowing owls tend to be opportunistic feeders, consuming
numerous insects (arthropods, beetles and grasshoppers, etc). The newly developed intertidal
marshes would further support the local food chain.
Construction activities have the potential to result in direct impacts to western red bat and
the pallid bat. Though construction activities are restricted to a localized area and tree removal
or trimming would not occur at the restoration sites, one or more trees may be removed at the
source material sites resulting in direct disturbance or mortality to western red bat maternity
roosts. Indirect impacts to western bat maternity roosts could also occur from noise and
vibration caused by construction activity near maternity roosts. Impacts to the western red bat
would be considered significant; however, implementation of the mitigation measures described
in Section 5.3.5 below would reduce impacts to this species to a less-than-significant level.
Mudflats and shallow water (less than 6 inches deep) are important foraging and resting
habitat areas for shorebirds. The project would initially create mudflat habitat by the placement
of dredged material. The mudflats would then gradually convert to intertidal marsh habitat as
vegetation becomes established. The benthic organisms that colonize these areas would become
prey for shorebirds. This impact would be beneficial to migratory birds. The intertidal marsh
habitat may provide suitable nesting habitat for tricolored blackbird.
Long-term Effects to Special Status Reptiles and Amphibians
The creation of intertidal marsh along the northern periphery of Big Break adjacent to
Jersey Island and at Little Franks Tract could result in long-term benefits to several special-status
species. Because significantly more intertidal marsh habitat is created, Alternative 6 would
result in greater benefits to wildlife than Alternative 2. The intertidal marsh habitat would
provide slower moving aquatic habitat and cover suitable for western pond turtles and giant
garter snakes.
Much of the study area is unlikely to provide giant garter snake aquatic habitat, because
the giant garter snake is typically absent from larger rivers and other water bodies that support
introduced populations of large predatory fish. As a result, the snake is unlikely to be present at
Big Break or Little Franks Tract. Short-term and long-term effects on the snake from
construction activities within the restoration areas are therefore unlikely.

183

Supporting aquatic habitat has a greater potential to occur in areas adjacent to the source
material sites or in the areas where the pipelines would be installed. These areas may include
drainage ditches and irrigation canals. Suitable habitat may be impacted by project construction
within 200 feet of these features. Direct impacts include the removal of basking sites necessary
for thermoregulation, and destruction of burrows or crevices that provide hibernacula. Individual
snakes may be killed or hurt by moving construction equipment and personnel. Construction
disturbance may also cause giant garter snakes to move into areas where they have a greater
chance of being killed by vehicles (i.e., roads) or predation. Because there are only a few
documented sightings of giant garter snake in the general area, there is a low potential for injury
or mortality of the snake during construction activities.
USACE has initiated consultation with USFWS on potential effects to the giant garter
snake from construction of the proposed alternatives. USACE has determined that the proposed
alternatives are not likely to adversely affect the giant garter snake. In the event that project
construction would occur within 200 feet of any drainage ditches or irrigation canals, the
standard mitigation measures, as detailed in Section 5.3.5 below, would be implemented. With
the implementation of these measures, any effects to giant garter snake would be less than
significant.

5.3.5

Mitigation

Special Status Fish Species
The following measures would be implemented to reduce short-term impacts to special
status fish species, including Delta smelt, from construction of the proposed alternatives:
•

During construction, stockpiling of construction materials, portable equipment,
vehicles, and supplies shall be restricted to the designated construction staging areas.

•

A qualified biologist shall provide worker environmental awareness training to
contractors and construction crews regarding all special status fish species known to
potentially occur near the construction sites.

•

A representative (onsite monitor) shall be appointed by USACE to be the point of
contact for any worker who observes a dead, injured, or entrapped special status fish.
Dead or injured fish shall be photographed and the photographs provided to the
USACE, NMFS, and USFWS. If a live specimen is captured in good condition, and a
positive identification cannot be made in the field because of size or lack of other
distinguishing characteristics, the fish shall be immediately returned to the river
downstream of the construction site.

184

Special Status Bird Species
USACE will conduct surveys to locate nest sites of the above mentioned species in
suitable breeding habitats in the spring of each construction year. Surveys will be conducted by
a qualified biologist using survey methods approved by USFWS. Survey results will be
submitted to USFWS before construction is initiated. If nests or young of these species are not
located, construction may proceed. If nest sites or young are located, USACE will consult with
USFWS and CDFW to determine what mitigation measures could be implemented to avoid or
reduce potential disturbance-related impacts to these species. Measures could include a nodisturbance buffer zone established around the nest site. The width of the buffer zone would be
determined by a qualified biologist in coordination with the USFWS. No construction activities
would occur within the buffer zone. The buffer zone would be maintained until the young have
fledged (as determined by a qualified biologist).
Burrowing Owl
Prior to initiation of any excavation activities at the source material sites, a
preconstruction survey for burrowing owls would be completed, in accordance with CDFW
guidelines described in the Staff Report on Burrowing Owl Mitigation. If no burrowing owls are
located during these surveys, then effects to burrowing owls would be less than significant, and
no mitigation would be required. If burrowing owls are located on or immediately adjacent to
the site, then coordination would occur with CDFW to determine the proper measures that would
need to be implemented to ensure that burrowing owls are not impacted by the project. Potential
mitigation measures that could be implemented include:
•

A CDFW-qualified biologist shall conduct appropriate surveys at and around material
source sites, to determine the presence/absence of burrowing owls. At least one
survey shall be conducted no more than one week prior to the onset of any
construction activity.

•

A 250-foot buffer, within which no new activity would be permissible, would be
maintained between project activities and nesting burrowing owls. This protected
area would remain in effect until August 31, or at the CDFW discretion, until the
young owls are foraging independently.

•

No burrowing owls could be evicted from burrows during the nesting season
(February 1 through August 31). Eviction outside the nesting season could be
permitted pending evaluation of eviction plans and receipt of formal written approval
from CDFW authorizing the eviction.

•

If accidental take (disturbance, injury, or death of owls) occurs, the DFG would be
notified immediately.

•

Conduct mandatory worker awareness training for construction personnel.

185

Special Status Bat Species
The following measures would be implemented to reduce short-term impacts to special
status bat species from construction of the proposed alternatives:
•

A qualified biologist would examine trees to be removed or trimmed for suitable bat
roosting habitat before removal or trimming. High quality features (large tree
cavities, basal hollows, loose or peeling bark, larger snags, palm trees, with intact
thatch, etc.) would be identified and the area around these features would be searched
for bats, and bat signs (guano, culled insect parts, staining, etc.). If suitable habitat
and/or bat signs are detected, biologists would conduct evening visual emergence
surveys from half an hour before sunset to 1 to 2 hours after sunset for a minimum of
2 nights. The survey shall be conducted no more than one week prior to the onset of
any construction activity. If no bat roosts are located, no further mitigation is
necessary.

•

If active roosting western red bats are identified within the survey area, CDFW shall
be immediately notified to determine what mitigation measures could be implemented
to avoid or reduce potential disturbance-related impacts to these species.

Special Status Reptile and Amphibian Species
The following mitigation measures are proposed for the protection of the giant garter
snake and its aquatic habitat:
•

Construction activities would be kept to a minimum of 200 feet from the banks of
giant garter snake aquatic habitat.

•

The construction area will be surveyed for giant garter snakes 24 hours prior to
construction activities by a qualified biologist. Survey of the project area would be
repeated if a lapse in construction activity of two weeks or greater occurs. If a giant
garter snake is encountered during construction, then activities would cease until
appropriate corrective measures have been completed or it has been determined that
the snake would not be harmed.

•

In order to prevent harm to giant garter snake, construction activities will be
prohibited within a 200-foot buffer zone around the small pond, which is situated on
the southern boundary of the Scour Pond site, is appropriate. In addition, prior to
commencing construction activities, the Scour Pond site shall be surveyed for giant
garter snake by a qualified biologist. If a giant garter snake is encountered, then all
construction activities must cease until corrective measures are taken and the site is
resurveyed.

186

5.4

Water Quality

This section evaluates the effects of the proposed alternatives on the water resources,
surface and ground water quality conditions, and jurisdictional wetlands in the project area.
Qualitative effects on water quality were estimated based on construction practices and
materials, location, and duration of construction. Standard pollution prevention measures
including erosion and sediment control measures, proper control of non-stormwater discharges,
and hazardous spill prevention and response measures would be implemented as part of the
project design.
Jurisdictional wetlands are located throughout the Delta area. A wetlands delineation has
not been performed for this project area, however, ground surveys have been conducted to
determine the potential for wetlands. The area where intertidal marsh restoration will occur in
open waters and not wetlands so no affects to wetlands would occur at the placement sites. The
source material sites are existing piles of material that were placed in areas that are not
considered wetlands. There are areas adjacent to the source material sites that could potentially
be mapped as jurisdictional wetlands, however, work will not be allowed in these areas for either
removal of material or pipeline system. No fill material will be placed in drainage ditches.
Because the project would not impact jurisdictional wetlands it is not discussed further in this
section.

5.4.1

Methodology and Basis of Significance

Methodology
Effects on water quality resources were analyzed qualitatively based on existing water
quality monitoring data Coordination with the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control
Board (CVRWQCB) would occur prior to placement to determine if additional testing would be
required. This coordination would evaluate the source material for hazardous substance
thresholds as applied to in-water fill material and determine if project placement activities would
affect water quality.
Basis of Significance
Adverse effects on water quality were considered significant if implementation of an
alternative plan would:
•

Substantially degrade surface water quality such that it would violate criteria or
objectives identified in the CVRWQCB basin plan or otherwise substantially degrade
water quality to the detriment of beneficial uses.

•

Adversely affect salinity flow patterns at water conveyance facilities (affect the X2
line).

187

•

Disturb existing channel banks, channel beds, or levees to the extent that erosion and
sedimentation could be accelerated.

•

Remove, fill, or substantially disturb a jurisdictional wetland.

5.4.2

Alternative 1 – No Action

The no action alternative assumes that no action would be taken by the Corps to restore
intertidal marsh habitat to the flooded islands. The flooded islands would remain in their current
state and water quality would not change from current conditions. However, features associated
with the BDCP and other authorized water purveyance projects could still be constructed; any
effects on water quality associated with those projects would still occur.
5.4.3
Placement

Alternative 2 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break via Direct

In order to create intertidal marsh habitat, material from O&M dredging would be
pumped to the restoration site and placed to raise the submerged surface of portions of Big
Break, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on Figure 3-9. O&M dredging and the piping of
material to the placement site is an ongoing USACE operation that is covered under the San
Francisco Bay to Stockton (John F Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channels) Final Environmental
Impact Statement from September 1980.
At the restoration site silt curtains, hay bales, or similar tools would be used to keep the
dredged material contained within the placement zone and to prevent leakage into adjacent
waterways. USACE is currently working the CVRWQCB to obtain Clean Water Act Section
401 Certification. The conditions set forth in the certification would be followed to prevent
adverse affects to water quality. Water quality monitoring would occur during construction
activities to ensure that the project is in compliance with 401 Certification conditions. Similar
activities currently being performed by USACE in the Delta (dredging) were coordinated with
the CVRWQCB and a Section 401 Certification was obtained. Conditions of Section 401
Certifications for similar projects included monitoring to comply with the Basin Plan, reporting
monitoring results, and maintaining low turbidity, pH, and dissolved oxygen levels.
Coordination with the CVRWQCB would establish construction requirements to prevent
violation of water quality standards set forth in the Basin Plan and to ensure that water quality is
not substantially degraded through project activities. Standard dredging protocol for testing of
material prior to dredging activities will be followed. This protocol includes the testing of
materials before dredging begins to determine if they meet standards for placement in water and
upland areas. If material being dredged meets the criteria, it would be used to create the
intertidal marsh habitat. If material does not meet the water quality standards, it would be
processed under the dredging standards and not used for this project. The placement of material
to restore intertidal marsh habitat at Big Break would not affect salinity in the study area. No
channel banks, channel beds, or levees would be altered in a way that would cause additional

188

erosion. As a result, effects to water quality from implementation of Alternative 2 would be less
than significant, with the implementation of the conditions of the Section 401 Certification.

5.4.4 Alternative 6 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break and Little Franks
Tract via Direct Placement and Pumping of Previously Dredged Materials
Alternative 6 includes Alternative 2 with the addition of further increments of intertidal
marsh restoration at both Big Break and Little Franks Tract. In order to construct these
additional increments, previously dredged material would be acquired from past O&M
placement sites, as shown on Figure 3-8. The dredged material would be excavated and pumped
from these source material sites to the restoration sites, and placed to raise the submerged surface
of portions of Big Break and Little Franks Tract, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on
Figure 3-13. Similar to Alternative 2, past O&M dredging is covered under the San Francisco
Bay to Stockton (John F Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channels) Final Environmental Impact
Statement from September 1980. However, effects associated with the pumping of material
from the source material sites is analyzed below.
A pipe system would be constructed to transport soil from the source material site to Big
Break and Little Franks Tract to create intertidal marsh habitat. The pipe system under
Alternative 6 would be the same as the one used for O&M dredging. The pipe system would be
constructed to prevent the transported material from entering the waterways. Monitoring of the
pipe would be required during all pumping activities. The system is pressurized with shutoff
capabilities in the event of an unexpected leak or break in the pipe.
Material from the source material sites has been tested during the dredging process and
met all the standards for placement in upland areas. Coordination with the Central Valley
RWQCB is on-going and may require additional testing of the materials prior to use for intertidal
marsh restoration. If testing is required, it would occur at the source materials sites. Only
material that meets RWQCB standards for in-water placement would be used for this project.
Only materials that meet approval for placement would be used and material would be placed in
a manner that it would not migrate into other areas, using measures such as turbidity curtains and
sacrificial hay bales to control sediment plumes. As a result of the implementation of these
measures, impacts to water quality are anticipated to be less than significant, with mitigation.

5.4.5

Mitigation

The contractor would be required to prepare a National Pollution Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit and prepare and implement Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWPPP) and an in-water work plan. The SWPPP and in-water work plan details actions that
would be taken during construction to reduce the risk of discharge into waterway and mitigation
measures that would be taken in the event of an unforeseen spill. The Section 401 Certification
permit is provided by the Central Valley RWQCB and will include requirements for any testing
and monitoring for the project. The conditions set forth in the permit would be followed to
reduce impacts to less than significant. The exact conditions are unknown as USACE is still in
189

the process of working with the Central Valley RWQCB for certification. By implementing the
conditions and requirements set forth in the applicable Section 401 Certification no significant
impacts to water quality are likely during construction of either alternative.

5.5

Air Quality

This section evaluates the effects of the proposed alternatives on air quality in the project
vicinity. Both construction and operation emissions were estimated and then compared with
Federal, State, and local air quality criteria for the area. Based on the results of the comparison,
best management practices and mitigation measures are identified to offset and/or reduce air
quality emissions from the project. The air quality project area encompasses the following air
basins: Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD) and the Bay
Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD).

5.5.1

Methodology and Basis of Significance

Methodology
To complete the analysis, information was collected on projected construction activities,
duration, and timing, equipment use, and activities for each construction year. Emissions
associated with vehicle exhaust for employee commute vehicles and delivery trucks were
estimated using SMAQMD’s Road Construction Emission Model Version 7.1.5, (Appendix I).
Construction equipment usage from similar projects was analyzed to estimate daily and annual
exhaust emissions. Emissions are considered significant if emissions exceed the thresholds
established by the applicable air quality agencies. Modeling assumptions for each project
alternative and methodology are provided in Appendix I.
The following emission sources and activities were analyzed:
•

On-site construction off-road equipment emissions (all criteria pollutants) – based on
OFFROAD2011 emission factors and estimated equipment schedules.

•

On-site pickup trucks (all criteria pollutants) – based on EMFAC2011 models and
estimated vehicle miles traveled.

•

Off-site worker vehicle emissions (all criteria pollutants) – based on EMFAC2011
models and estimated vehicle miles traveled.

•

On-site pickup trucks and off-site worker vehicles entrained fugitive dust emissions
for paved and unpaved road entrained dust (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ) – based on AP-42
methodology and estimated vehicle miles traveled.

190

Basis of Significance
Adverse effects on air quality were considered significant if implementation of an
alternative plan would:
•

Conflict with or obstruct implementation of an applicable air quality plan.

•

Violate any local or State air quality management district CEQA standard or
contributes substantially to an existing or projected air quality violation.

•

Result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant for which
the project is in nonattainment under applicable Federal or state ambient air quality
standards (including releasing emissions which exceed quantitative thresholds for
ozone precursors).

•

Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations.

•

Create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people.

•

Generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that exceed thresholds.

•

Conflict with an applicable plan, policy, or regulation adopted for the purpose of
reducing the emissions of GHGs.

State Implementation Plan and General Conformity De Minimis Thresholds
Federal actions need to demonstrate conformity to any SIPs of the regional air basin.
Each action must be reviewed to determine whether it: 1) qualifies for an exemption listed in the
General Conformity Rule (GCR); 2) results in emissions that are below GCR de minimis
emissions thresholds; or 3) would produce emissions above the GCR de minimis thresholds
applicable to the specific area. The General Conformity de minimis levels for this project are
shown below (Table 5-2). These thresholds were applied to the project’s estimated emissions and
used to determine effect significance as detailed below.

SMAQMD Thresholds
Relevant SMAQMD thresholds of significance are summarized below. The project
would not include any operational and maintenance activities that generate emissions, only
thresholds applicable to construction are presented.
The SMAQMD has established an emission significance threshold for NO X from
construction activities. If the project construction emissions exceed the daily NO X threshold of
85 pounds per day (lbs/day) after on-site mitigation, the project applicant must pay mitigation
fees to offset any excess emissions. The SMAQMD currently assesses mitigation fees of $17,080
per ton of NO X but these fees may change annually depending on updates to the applicable
guidance.
For construction projects disturbing more than a maximum daily area of 15 acres, PM 10
CAAQS are applied as thresholds except for areas with existing or projected nonattainment
designations for the PM 10 CAAQS. Due to the SVAB’s nonattainment designation, SMAQMD
has determined that a project’s emissions in the SVAB would be significant and considered
substantial contributors if they equal or exceed 5 percent of the PM 10 CAAQS. The substantial
contribution thresholds of the PM 10 CAAQS are 2.5 micrograms per cubic meter over 24 hours
or more than 1 microgram per cubic meter averaged over a year project.
If a construction project implements SMAQMD’s Basic Construction Emission Control
Practices (SMAQMD 2011) and does not exceed a maximum daily disturbed area of 15 acres,
SMAQMD does not consider a project to have the potential to exceed or contribute to the
concentration-based threshold of significance for PM 10 . In this situation, PM 10 impacts are
considered less-than-significant with incorporation of mitigation.
SMAQMD has also designated the CAAQS as construction thresholds for PM 2.5 , CO,
and SO 2 . SMAQMD has not designated a construction threshold for ROG. The CAAQS
thresholds for PM 10 , PM 2.5 , CO, and SO 2 are shown in Table 5-3. Because PM 2.5 is a subset of
PM 10 , SMAQMD assumes that construction projects that do not generate concentrations of PM 10
that exceed the concentration-based threshold of significance would also be considered less-thansignificant for PM 2.5 impacts. For other criteria pollutants, NO X , SO 2 , and CO, SMAQMD
requires that the proximity of a project to sensitive receptors and the duration of emissions be
used to determine whether concentrations need to be estimated (SMAQMD 2011). Because the
project’s emission sources would originate more than 500 feet from sensitive receptors, the
project meets the CARB guidance distance and no further roadway-related air quality evaluation
of pollutant concentrations is recommended (SMAQMD 2011).
Emissions generated by O&M dredging are analyzed in a separate NEPA document. Past
and proposed O&M dredging is covered under the San Francisco Bay to Stockton (John F
Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channels) Final Environmental Impact Statement from September
1980. However, effects associated with the pumping of material from these source material sites
is analyzed below.

192

193

BAAQMD Thresholds
The BAAQMD thresholds of significance were obtained from the CEQA Guide to Air
Quality Assessment, which lists a threshold of 54 pounds per day or 10 tons per year for ROG,
NO X , and PM 2.5 construction emissions and a PM 10 threshold of 82 pounds per day or 15 tons
per year (BAAQMD 2010). Table 5.3 shows the thresholds for criteria pollutants for the
BAAQMD. There are no quantitative thresholds for construction dust emissions; instead,
impacts are considered less than significant if the BAAQMD Best Management Practices are
employed to control dust during construction activities, including excavation.
The BAAQMD TAC threshold is an increased cancer risk of more than 10 in 1,000,000
for a person with maximum exposure potential and increased non-cancer risk of 1.0 Hazard
Index (chronic or acute). The BAAQMD also has a concentration threshold of 0.3 μg/m3 for
PM 2.5 . These thresholds are applicable to both construction emissions and operations emissions.
Unlike the volume-based thresholds for criteria air pollutants, the TAC thresholds are used for
specific receptor locations when a risk analysis is required for specific project components, such
as stationary sources or the use of diesel-powered equipment, including construction equipment.
There are no sensitive receptors located in the vicinity of the Delta Study alternatives, therefore
there would be no impacts associated with TAC exposures due to implementation of this project.
The 2010 BAAQMD CEQA Guidelines recommend analyzing localized CO
concentrations for projects that would increase traffic volumes at affected intersections to more
than 44,000 vehicles per hour. However, given the minimal increase in vehicle trips due to newly
required maintenance activities, the proposed project would not affect local CO concentrations
during operations Therefore, CO concentrations have not been quantified in this analysis.
BAAQMD considers projects that exceed these criteria air pollutant standards also to
result in a cumulatively considerable air quality impact upon the region. According to
BAAQMD, no further cumulative analysis should be required beyond the analysis of whether a
proposed project’s impacts would contribute considerably to ambient levels of pollutants or
GHGs. Analysis of effects from GHGs is included in the Climate Change section below (Section
5.6).

Federal General Conformity Criteria
The USEPA developed the General Conformity Rule, which became effective on January
31, 1994, to implement Section 176c of the Federal Clean Air Act. The underlying principle of
the General Conformity Rule is that Federal actions must not cause or contribute to any violation
194

of a NAAQS. A conformity determination is required for each pollutant where the total of direct
and indirect emissions caused by a Federal action in a nonattainment area could exceed de
minimis threshold levels listed in the General Conformity Rule (40 CFR 93.153). If the total
direct emissions associated with the project are below the de minimis levels indicated in Table 52, general conformity requirements do not apply, and the project is considered in conformity and
would not result in an adverse effect.
Because the project region is in attainment for the criteria pollutants indicated in Table 54 except ozone (serious) and PM 10 (moderate), a conformity assessment for ozone and PM 10
must be completed. That assessment will evaluate whether the project’s construction or
operational emissions would exceed 25 tons per year of ROG or NO X , or 100 tons per year of
PM 10 . The Sacramento area is currently a serious non-attainment area for the Federal 8-hour
ozone standards; therefore, the 50 tons per year threshold applies for ozone precursors.

Construction Schedule
Though the project has not been approved and funded. A tentative project construction
schedule has been created for modeling and cost estimating purposes. The schedule applies to
both alternatives. Alternative 2 requires O&M dredging source materials for years 2018 through
2022. Alternative 6 includes the Alternative 2 schedule in conjunction with the pumping
schedule of stockpiled materials to their respective restoration sites. The tentative schedule is
shown on Table 5-5 below.

*In the air quality analysis below, emissions are displayed by material source and construction year rather than by restoration
increment.

5.5.2

Alternative 1 – No Action

The no action alternative assumes that no action would be taken by the Corps to restore
intertidal marsh habitat to the flooded islands and the flooded islands would remain in their
current state. Consequently, no construction emissions would result, and there would be no
direct short-term air quality effects as a result of this alternative. However, features associated
with the BDCP and other authorized water purveyance projects could still be constructed and any
effects on air quality associated with those projects would still occur.

5.5.3
Placement

Alternative 2 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break via Direct

In order to create intertidal marsh habitat, material from O&M dredging would be
pumped to the restoration site and placed to raise the submerged surface of portions of Big
Break, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on Figure 3-9. O&M dredging and the piping of
material to the placement site is an ongoing USACE operation that is covered under the San
Francisco Bay to Stockton (John F Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channels) Final Environmental
Impact Statement from September 1980.
Equipment exhaust emissions would be generated by worker vehicles, marine, pumping,
and placement equipment. Details of the equipment types or construction activities required for
each project activity, as well as the resulting criteria pollutant emissions from these equipment
types or construction activities, are provided in Table 5.7. The primary sources of each criteria
pollutant from this alternative’s activities are:
•

NO X : placement activities, marine vessels; and

•

ROG and CO: placement activities, marine vessels.

Table 5-6 describes the potential emission sources for Alternative 2.

In considering the potential effects associated with Alternative 2, the following
considerations are incorporated into this analysis from the O&M dredging:
•

O&M in 2018 would be conducted in a manner consistent with the current dredging
operation, with equipment and BMPs being gradually upgraded over time, as
necessary.

•

Dredging and pumping for Alternative 2 would occur in the same manner as current
O&M dredging.

•

No additional pumps would be required for Alternative 2 beyond what is currently
being used for O&M dredging.

•

No additional boats would be required beyond what is currently being used for O&M
dredging

•

Current O&M dredging requires additional earthwork to prepare and manage the
dredged material placement sites that would not occur during construction of
Alternative 2. This would include the use of land-based equipment such as dozers,
scrapers, and loaders, which would generate additional levels of criteria pollutants
that would not occur as a part of Alternative 2.

Based on the assumptions listed above, as well as the equipment list provided in Table 56, Alternative 2 would generate lower emissions of criteria pollutants than current O&M
dredging. As a result, construction of Alternative 2 would generate beneficial effects to air
quality, because it would prevent the pollution that would otherwise occur during standard
dredging operations. As a result, there would be no impact to air quality under Alternative 2 and
no additional modeling needs to occur.

197

5.5.4 Alternative 6 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break and Little Franks
Tract via Direct Placement and Pumping of Previously Dredged Materials
Alternative 6 includes Alternative 2 with the addition of further increments of intertidal
marsh restoration at both Big Break and Little Franks Tract. In order to construct these
additional increments, previously dredged material would be acquired from past O&M
placement sites, as shown on Figure 3-8. The dredged material would be excavated and pumped
from these source material sites to the restoration sites, and placed to raise the submerged surface
of portions of Big Break and Little Franks Tract, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on
Figure 3-13. Similar to Alternative 2, past O&M dredging is covered under the San Francisco
Bay to Stockton (John F Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channels) Final Environmental Impact
Statement from September 1980. However, effects associated with the pumping of material
from these source material sites is analyzed below.
As discussed above, Alternative 2 would have no effects on air quality; therefore, the
work proposed under Alternative 2 is not included in the analysis below. Each construction year
would include the placement of material from O&M dredging at Big Break as a part of standard
annual O&M.
Alternative 6 includes actions in both Sacramento and Contra Costa Counties. Big Break
and Little Franks Tract are both located in Contra Costa County, as is the Bradford Island
dredged material placement site. The source material sites for Big Break increments 2, 3, and 5
are located in Sacramento County. Therefore, air quality emissions in the analysis below are
compared to the thresholds for both SMAQMD and BAAQMD.
Alternative 6 criteria pollutant construction equipment exhaust emissions include PM 10 ,
PM 2.5 , NO X , ROG, CO 2 , and CO. Equipment exhaust emissions would be generated by worker
vehicles, marine vessels, pumping, loading, and placement equipment. Details of the equipment
types or construction activities required for each project activity, as well as the resulting criteria
pollutant emissions from these equipment types or construction activities, are provided in Table
5.9. The primary sources of each criteria pollutant from this alternative’s activities are:
•

NO X : Pumping, placement activities, marine and off-road equipment;

•

ROG and CO: placement activities, marine;

•

PM 10 and PM 2.5 : off-road equipment (at existing dry land placement sites)

Emissions estimates for Alternative 6 represent a worst case scenario for the purpose of
estimating potential mitigation costs. Actual emissions estimates would be calculated after the
award of contract. The contractor and air quality district would work together to calculate more
precise emissions based on the contractors proposed project equipment inventory. Table 5-9
describes the potential emission sources for Alternative 6.

discussed below, as the only proposed work in 2018 is the annual O&M dredging work at Big
Break. The estimated emissions for the remainder of the construction years are presented below
and compared to the applicable local air district’s thresholds. In addition, a 20 percent reduction
is shown from the use of the required SMAQMD Best Construction Emission Control Practices
and BAAQMD Basic Construction Mitigation Measures.

Alternative 6 would increase the emissions of criteria pollutants in the study area. For
construction years 2019 through 2021, these emissions would exceed the BAAQMD threshold
for NO X . All construction years would be below the SMAQMD thresholds. However, with the
implementation of the BAAQMD Basic Construction Mitigation Measures, Alternative 6 would
not exceed any of the local thresholds.

Alternative 6’s implementation of the required BAAQMD Basic Construction Mitigation
Measures and exhaust emission mitigation measures would reduce the NO X emissions associated
with the restoration of intertidal marsh habitat at Big Break and Little Franks Tract and the
excavation of the Bradford Island dredged material placement site to below the thresholds. In
addition, the required SMAQMD Best Construction Emission Control Practices would also be
implemented to further reduce construction emissions associated with the excavation of the
Sacramento County source material sites. Therefore, Alternative 6 construction-related
emissions would be less than significant with mitigation. The required BAAQMD Basic
Construction Mitigation Measures and the SMAQMD Best Construction Emission Control
Practices are presented in Section 5.5.5 below.

5.5.5

Mitigation

Based on the estimates shown in Tables 5-8 through 5-11, construction would result in
the temporary increase in emissions of criteria pollutants. In order to reduce the emissions to
less than significant, the contractor would be required to implement the BAAQMD Basic
Construction Mitigation Measures and the SMAQMD Basic Construction Emissions Control
Practices listed below. In addition, USACE would require the project’s contractors to implement
the following BMPs to further reduce the emissions from the project. The Delta Study would not
exceed any local air quality thresholds or the Federal de minimis thresholds.

201

BAAQMD Basic Construction Mitigation Measures
In accordance with BAAQMD guidelines, all proposed projects should implement the
Basic Construction Mitigation Measures listed below whether or not construction-related
emissions exceed applicable thresholds.
•

All exposed surfaces (e.g., parking areas, staging areas, soil piles, graded areas, and
unpaved access roads) shall be watered two times per day.

•

All haul trucks transporting soil, sand, or other loose material off-site shall be
covered.

•

All visible mud or dirt track-out onto adjacent public roads shall be removed using
wet power vacuum street sweepers at least once per day. The use of dry power
sweeping is prohibited.

•

All vehicle speeds on unpaved roads shall be limited to 15 mph.

•

All roadways, driveways, and sidewalks to be paved shall be completed as soon as
possible. Building pads shall be laid as soon as possible after grading unless seeding
or soil binders are used.

•

Idling times shall be minimized either by shutting equipment off when not in use or
reducing the maximum idling time to 5 minutes (as required by the California
airborne toxics control measure Title 13, Section 2485 of California Code of
Regulations [CCR]). Clear signage shall be provided for construction workers at all
access points.

•

All construction equipment shall be maintained and properly tuned in accordance
with manufacturer‘s specifications. All equipment shall be checked by a certified
visible emissions evaluator.

•

Post a publicly visible sign with the telephone number and person to contact at the
lead agency regarding dust complaints. This person shall respond and take corrective
action within 48 hours. The Air District‘s phone number shall also be visible to
ensure compliance with applicable regulations.

SMAQMD’s Basic Construction Emissions Control Practices
The SMAQMD requires construction projects to implement basic construction emission
control practices to control fugitive dust and diesel exhaust emissions (SMAQMD 2011).
USACE would implement the following measures for the project:
•

Water all exposed surfaces twice daily. Exposed surfaces include but are not limited
to: soil piles, graded areas, unpaved parking areas, staging areas, and access roads.

•

Cover or maintain at least two feet of free board space on haul trucks transporting
soil, sand, or other loose material on the site.
202

•

Use wet power vacuum street sweepers to remove any visible trackout mud or dirt
from adjacent public roads at least once a day. Use of dry power sweeping is
prohibited.

•

Minimize idling time either by shutting equipment off when not in use or reducing the
time of idling to 5 minutes [required by California Code of Regulations, Title 13,
sections 2449(d)(3) and 2485]. Provide clear signage that posts this requirement for
workers at the site entrances.

•

Maintain all construction equipment in proper working condition according to the
manufacturer’s specifications. The equipment must be checked by a certified
mechanic and determined to be running in proper condition before it is operated.

Fugitive dust mitigation would require the use of adequate measures during each
construction activity and would include frequent water applications or application of soil
additives, control of vehicle access, and vehicle speed restrictions. USACE would implement the
dust mitigation measures listed below.
•

Limit vehicle speeds on unpaved roads to 15 miles per hour, or

•

Water at least every two hours of active construction activities or sufficiently often to
keep the area adequately wetted.

•

Remove any visible track-out from a paved public road at any location where vehicles
exit the work site: this removal effort shall be accomplished using wet sweeping of a
HEPA filter-equipped vacuum device daily.

•

Suspend any excavation operations when wind speeds are high enough to result in
dust emissions across the property line, despite the application of dust mitigation
measures.

•

To mitigate stockpile handling and stockpile wind erosion fugitive dust emissions,
active storage pile would be kept adequately wetted using wet suppression controls.

•

To mitigate fugitive dust emissions from storage piles that would remain inactive for
more than seven days, USACE would ensure implementation of one or more of the
following measures:
o Wet suppression controls
o Cover with tarp(s) or vegetative cover, and/or
o Install wind barriers across open areas.

203

Exhaust Emission Mitigation Measures
The project will ensure that emissions from all off-road diesel powered equipment used
on the project site do not exceed 40% opacity for more than three minutes in any one hour. Any
equipment found to exceed 40 percent opacity (or Ringelmann 2.0) shall be repaired
immediately. Non-compliant equipment will be documented and a summary provided to USACE
and SMAQMD monthly. A visual survey of all in-operation equipment shall be made at least
weekly, and a monthly summary of the visual survey results shall be submitted throughout the
duration of the project, except that the monthly summary shall not be required for any 30-day
period in which no construction activity occurs. The monthly summary shall include the quantity
and type of vehicles surveyed as well as the dates of each survey.
Use of Electric Equipment
Construction equipment powered by electricity, rather than diesel fuel, eliminates criteria
pollutant emissions from diesel combustion.
Mitigation Fees
The Contractor would provide payment of the appropriate SMAQMD and BAAQMD
required NO X mitigation fee to offset the project’s NO X emissions if they exceed SMAQMD’s
threshold of 85 lbs/day and BAAQMD threshold of 54 lbs/day.

5.6

Climate Change

This section identifies the basis of significance for impacts to climate change, discusses
how these criteria are determined for NEPA, provides specific emissions standards, thresholds,
or other measurements for the various pollutants and, as necessary, applicable mitigation
measures.

5.6.1

Methodology and Basis of Significance

Methodology
The methods for evaluating impacts are intended to satisfy Federal and State
requirements, including NEPA. As discussed in the air quality assessment (Section 5.2.4),
emissions were estimated based on the type of equipment being used, the level of equipment
activity, and the associated construction schedules.
Emission estimates for on-road vehicles were based on emission data from SMAQMD’s
Road Construction Emission Model Version 7.1.5 model for on and off-road vehicle emissions.
Project marine construction equipment emissions (all criteria pollutants) were based on data from
CARB’s Harbor Craft Emissions Model.
204

In addition, the following four criteria were considered and incorporated into the GHG
analysis:
•

Is the design of the proposed project inherently energy efficient?

•

Are all applicable BMPs that would reduce GHG emissions incorporated into the
design of the proposed project?

•

Would the proposed project implement or fund its fair share of a mitigation strategy
designed to alleviate climate change?

•

Would implementing the proposed project improve processes or efficiency, resulting
in a net reduction of GHG emissions?

Basis of Significance
SMAQMD has not established thresholds for GHG emissions; instead, each project is
evaluated on a case-by-case basis using the most up-to-date methods of calculation and analysis.
The impacts of the proposed project alternatives related to climate change should be evaluating
using the criteria listed below. According to CEQA Guidelines, the proposed project could result
in significant impacts if it would:
•

Generate GHG emissions, either directly or indirectly, that may have a significant
impact on the environment.

•

Conflict with an applicable plan, policy, or regulation adopted for the purpose of
reducing the emissions of GHGs.

•

The following significance criteria will be used to determine the significance of GHG
emissions from this project:

•

If the relative amounts of GHG emissions resulting from implementation of the
proposed project are substantial compared to emissions major facilities are required to
report (25,000 CO 2 e per year).

•

If the proposed project has the potential to contribute to a lower carbon future.

No existing threshold levels for GHGs have been developed at the Federal level for
NEPA projects. USEPA has established a reporting threshold of 25,000 metric tons of CO 2 that
applies to most entities that emit more than 25,000 metric tons per year.

5.6.2

Alternative 1 – No Action

The no-action alternative assumes that no action would be taken by the Corps to restore
intertidal marsh habitat to the flooded islands. The flooded islands would remain in their current
state. Therefore, there would be no GHG emissions associated with construction activities under
205

the project. Similarly, there would be no long term operational (indirect) GHG emissions under
this alternative.

5.6.3
Placement

Alternative 2 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break via Direct

In order to create intertidal marsh habitat, material from O&M dredging would be
pumped to the restoration site and placed to raise the submerged surface of portions of Big
Break, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on Figure 3-9. O&M dredging and the piping of
material to the placement site is an ongoing USACE operation that is covered under the San
Francisco Bay to Stockton (John F Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channels) Final Environmental
Impact Statement from September 1980.
GHG emissions would be emitted from the project due to fuel combustion from marine
vessels and construction equipment, and workforce vehicles. Workers would commute from
their homes to the construction site and park in one of the staging areas.
While the emissions associated with this alternative would not violate the GHG reporting
threshold of 25,000 metric tons per year, these emissions would still contribute to the overall
cumulative GHG emissions, as discussed in the cumulative analysis discussion below (Section
5.3). As a result, USACE would implement mitigation measures, as discussed below, to increase
this alternative’s energy efficiency and further reduce the GHG emissions from this alternative.
Consequently, this alternative’s GHG emissions, with mitigation, would be reduced from the
estimated emission levels. Therefore, Alternative 2 construction-related GHG emissions would
be less-than-significant with mitigation.

5.6.4 Alternative 6 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break and Little Franks
Tract via Direct Placement and Pumping of Previously Dredged Materials
Alternative 6 includes Alternative 2 with the addition of further increments of intertidal
marsh restoration at both Big Break and Little Franks Tract. In order to construct these
additional increments, previously dredged material would be acquired from past O&M
placement sites, as shown on Figure 3-8. The dredged material would be excavated and pumped
from these source material sites to the restoration sites, and placed to raise the submerged surface
of portions of Big Break and Little Franks Tract, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on
Figure 3-13. Similar to Alternative 2, past O&M dredging is covered under the San Francisco
Bay to Stockton (John F Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channels) Final Environmental Impact
Statement from September 1980. However, effects associated with the pumping of material
from these source material sites is analyzed below.
While the emissions associated with Alternative 6 would be greater than Alternative 2,
the total emissions would not exceed the GHG reporting limit for stationary sources of 25,000
metric tons per year. While this reporting limit is not a formal threshold for construction
projects, it offers a point of comparison to consider in climate change analyses.
206

The emissions associated with Alternative 6 would still contribute to the overall
cumulative global GHG emissions, as discussed in the cumulative analysis discussion below
(Section 5.10). As a result, USACE would implement mitigation measures, as discussed in
Section 5.6.5 below, to increase this alternative’s energy efficiency and further reduce GHG
emissions from this alternative. Consequently, this alternative’s GHG emissions, with
mitigation, would be reduced from the estimated emission levels as much as practicable.
Therefore, Alternative 2 construction-related GHG emissions would be less than significant with
mitigation.

5.6.5

Mitigation

USACE would implement the following mitigation measure to reduce potential impacts
to climate change:
•

Improve fuel efficiency of construction equipment by minimizing idling time either
by shutting equipment off when not in use or reducing the time of idling to no more
than 3 minutes (5 minute limit is required by the state airborne toxics control measure
[Title 13, sections 2449(d)(3) and 2485 of the California Code of Regulations].
Provide clear signage that posts this requirement for workers at the entrances to the
site.

The following mitigation measures are relevant to impacts, but will likely not be required
by USACE. However the selected contractor will be encouraged to implement these measures
where practical:
•

Maintain all construction equipment in proper working condition according to
manufacturer’s specifications. The equipment must be checked by a certified
mechanic and determined to be running in proper condition before it is operated.

•

Train equipment operators in proper use of equipment.

•

Use the proper equipment size for the job.

•

Use equipment with new technologies (repowered engines, electric drive trains).

•

Perform on-site material hauling with trucks equipped with on-road engines (if
determined to be less emissive than the off-road engines).

•

Use a CARB approved low carbon fuel for construction equipment. (NO X emissions
from the use of low carbon fuel must be reviewed and increases mitigated.)

•

Encourage and provide carpools, shuttle vans, transit passes and/or secure bicycle
parking for construction worker commutes.

•

Use SmartWay certified trucks for deliveries and equipment transport.

•

Develop a plan to efficiently use water for adequate dust control.

207

5.7

Transportation and Navigation

This section evaluates the construction-related effects of the alternatives on the
transportation system and commercial navigation within the project area. This analysis considers
short and long-term disruptions to traffic and shipping commerce.

5.7.1

Methodology and Basis of Significance

Methodology
This section evaluates the construction-related effects of the alternatives on roads and
traffic in the study area. Also analyzed are affects to deep draft navigation during construction.
This analysis considers short-term effects to navigation along the San Joaquin and Sacramento
Deep Water Ship Channels.
Basis of Significance
Adverse effects on transportation were considered significant if implementation of an
alternative plan would result in any of the following:
•

Cause an increase in traffic which is substantial in relation to the existing traffic load
and capacity of the street system;

•

Substantially increase hazards due to a design features or incompatible uses;

•

Result in inadequate emergency access;

Adverse effects on navigation were considered significant if implementation of an
alternative plan would result in any of the following:
•

Disruptions to any deep water ship channel commerce activities;

•

Increase or creation of safety hazards;

•

Disruption of the DWSC O&M activities.

5.7.2

Alternative 1 – No Action

The no action alternative assumes that no action would be taken by the Corps to restore
intertidal marsh habitat to the flooded islands. The flooded islands would remain in their current
state. Alternative 1 would have no effects on existing transportation and navigation or related
operations and maintenance in the project area.

208

5.7.3
Placement

Alternative 2 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break via Direct

Transportation
There would be no affects on transportation under this alternative because all of the work
would be accomplished using piping along waterways and agricultural lands. Therefore no
mitigation would be required.
Navigation
In order to create intertidal marsh habitat, material from O&M dredging would be
pumped to the restoration site and placed to raise the submerged surface of portions of Big
Break, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on Figure 3-9. O&M dredging and the piping of
material to the placement site is an ongoing USACE operation that is covered under the San
Francisco Bay to Stockton (John F Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channels) Final Environmental
Impact Statement from September 1980. The location where placement would occur is not part
of the navigation channel and therefore, no affects to navigation would occur under this
alternative.

5.7.4 Alternative 6 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break and Little Franks
Tract via Direct Placement and Pumping of Previously Dredged Materials
Alternative 6 includes Alternative 2 with the addition of further increments of intertidal
marsh restoration at both Big Break and Little Franks Tract. In order to construct these
additional increments, previously dredged material would be acquired from past O&M
placement sites, as shown on Figure 3-8. The dredged material would be excavated and pumped
from these source material sites to the restoration sites, and placed to raise the submerged surface
of portions of Big Break and Little Franks Tract, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on
Figure 3-13. Similar to Alternative 2, past O&M dredging is covered under the San Francisco
Bay to Stockton (John F Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channels) Final Environmental Impact
Statement from September 1980. However, effects associated with the pumping of material
from these source material sites is analyzed below.
Transportation
Alternative 6 includes the pumping of the previously dredged material from Decker
Island to Big Break. In order to pump the material to Big Break pipes would be placed across
Highway 160, which is also the levee. Because Highway 160 is also the levee structure,
degrading the levee to place the pipes even with the existing road is not feasible. Therefore, the
piping would be placed across the road and plated with large steel sheets to allow for traffic to
continue use of Highway 160. The pipes and steel plates would be installed during evening
hours when traffic in this area is very minimal. Coordination with the California Department of
Transportation (CalTrans) would occur prior to the installation of the pipes across the road.
Additionally, the contractor would be required to obtain any required permits and approvals from
209

CalTrans. Piping would also be required from the Scour Pond to Big Break, however, it can be
placed under the Antioch Bridge and would not affect traffic. The project would not result in a
significant increase in traffic, as there is no hauling associated with the project. The completed
project would not generate additional traffic. As a result, with the required coordination with
CalTrans and by installing the pipelines over Highway 160 at night, this impact would be
considered less than significant, and no additional mitigation would be required.
Navigation
Temporary pipeline crossing at the Stockton DWSC would be required to pump materials
to Big Break from the source materials site. The pipeline would be submerged for the life of the
project. Pipe segments would be weighted to the channel bottom at an elevation low enough to
ensure that the top of the pipe would remain below the authorized channel depth in order to
avoid impacts to commerce ships. A specialized marine craft with a crane would be required for
the pipe weighting process. Temporary weighting would occur at the Decker Island to Sherman
Island (Sacramento River), Sherman Island to Jersey Island (San Joaquin River), and Jersey
Island to Big Break (Dutch Slough) crossings. Additional in-water pipelines would be floated
along the channel edges for the duration of the project. The pipelines would be moved as
necessary by tender boat crews for safety, vessel passage, and pumping logistic purposes.
Pipeline crossing the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel would be placed in locations
which would not impact the authorized channel depth. The contractor would be required to
work with Coast Guard, Port of Stockton, and USACE representatives to determine proper
channel bottom locations of temporary pipelines crossing based on recent sounding reports All
marker buoys and safety requirements of the U.S. Coast Guard would be met. As a result,
impacts to navigation from the piping of material would be less than significant with mitigation.

5.7.5

Mitigation

Transportation
The placement of steel plates over the pipe on Highway 160 would be included as part of
the construction contract. A traffic control plan would be submitted to CalTrans for approval
and any permits required would be obtained by the contractor. The traffic control plan would
include measures taken to allow for emergency vehicle access during placement of the pipe and
steel plates across Highway 160. This would reduce impacts to less than significant and no
additional mitigation would be required.
Navigation
The anchored pipeline would remain in place and would not be moved for the duration of
the project. The pipeline would be anchored so that it would not impact the authorized
navigation channel. Because the pipeline would be placed so that ships can pass, no impacts to
the navigation channel would occur and no mitigation is required.

210

5.8

Recreation

5.8.1

Methodology and Basis of Significance

Methodology
This section evaluates the construction-related effects of the alternatives on recreation
resources. This analysis considers short-term recreation effects within the project area at Big
Break and Little Franks Tract and discusses long-term beneficial effects to recreation. None of
the alternatives would affect recreation associated with local marinas because access to these
recreational facilities and opportunities would not be affected by implementation of any of the
alternatives.
Basis of Significance
Adverse effects on recreation were considered significant if implementation of an
alternative plan would:
•

Substantially disrupt any institutionally recognized recreational facility or activity.

•

Precludes existing recreational users from long-term use of existing recreation
resources within and around Big Break and Little Franks Tract.

5.8.2

Alternative 1 – No Action

The no-action alternative assumes that no action would be taken by the Corps to restore
intertidal marsh habitat to the flooded islands and the flooded islands would remain in their
current state. Alternative 1 would have no effect on existing recreation in the project area. The
public would continue to use existing recreation facilities consistent with present conditions.

5.8.3
Placement

Alternative 2 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break via Direct

In order to create intertidal marsh habitat, material from O&M dredging would be
pumped to the restoration site and placed to raise the submerged surface of portions of Big
Break, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on Figure 3-9. O&M dredging and the piping of
material to the placement site is an ongoing USACE operation that is covered under the San
Francisco Bay to Stockton (John F Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channels) Final Environmental
Impact Statement from September 1980.
The restoration of intertidal marsh habitat at Big Break would not require the closure of
any local recreation facilities such as harbors, parks, marinas, or resorts. Many people use the
area around the project for multiple recreation activities, and would continue to use these areas
211

during construction and once restoration has been completed. Therefore, impacts to recreation
facilities are less than significant.
The shallow waters of Big Break provide prime bass fishing habitat, like many areas
throughout the Delta. Creation of 42 acres of intertidal marsh habitat at Big Break would
remove a small portion of bass habitat, but a much larger portion of Big Break would remain
prime habitat. Because a large portion of habitat would remain available for bass fishing, the
effects are considered less than significant. Additionally, there are sufficient areas in the Delta
that will continue to provide bass fishing habitat to anglers. Bass fishing in the Delta is an
institutionally recognized activity and would continue without affects because of the small
amount of land being converted to intertidal marsh habitat. Therefore, with the coordination
actions discussed in Section 5.8.5 below, effects to recreation would be less than significant.

5.8.4 Alternative 6 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break and Little Franks
Tract via Direct Placement and Pumping of Previously Dredged Materials
Alternative 6 includes Alternative 2 with the addition of further increments of intertidal
marsh restoration at both Big Break and Little Franks Tract. In order to construct these
additional increments, previously dredged material would be acquired from past O&M
placement sites, as shown on Figure 3-8. The dredged material would be excavated and pumped
from these source material sites to the restoration sites, and placed to raise the submerged surface
of portions of Big Break and Little Franks Tract, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on
Figure 3-13. Similar to Alternative 2, past O&M dredging is covered under the San Francisco
Bay to Stockton (John F Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channels) Final Environmental Impact
Statement from September 1980. However, effects associated with the pumping of material
from these source material sites is analyzed below.
Piping the source material to the restoration sites would require the pipes to cross the San
Joaquin River, Dutch Slough, and False River. These waterways are used for recreation
activities such as boating, fishing, and personal water craft. The pipe would be weighted to the
river bottoms at these crossing locations so that recreation boating can safely pass along the
waterway. Any areas that pose a danger to boaters would be property marked with U.S. Coast
Guard approved markings. Prior to any construction activities, coordination would occur with
the U.S. Coast Guard to determine the appropriate actions to keep water sport activities safe.
Because boaters would continue to have access to the San Joaquin River, Dutch Slough, Big
Break, and False River impacts are considered less than significant. Once construction is
complete the pipes and hazard markers would be removed from the waterway.
No recreation facilities would be temporarily or permanently closed with the restoration
of the islands. Due to the vast amount of recreation facilities and activities available in the area,
people would continue to use facilities during and after restoration is complete.
Big Break and Little Franks Tract are currently shallow waters that provide prime bass
fishing habitat. The replacement of open shallow water with intertidal marsh habitat in these
tracts would force local bass to relocate to other shallow waters of the Delta. There are many
212

areas adjacent to the restoration site that would continue to provide prime bass fishing for
anglers. Although prime bass fishing habitat would be lost, the Delta offers many other locations
in close proximity to the project that include bass habitat. Therefore this impact is considered
less than significant and no mitigation is required.

5.8.5

Mitigation

The creation of intertidal marsh habitat could be controversial with bass fisherman due to
the consequent reduction of prime bass habitat in the project area. However, extensive bass
habitat remains throughout adjacent shallow water areas, providing ample opportunities for
anglers. Additionally, the restoration would provide shoreline habitat for other fish species, in
turn providing new food sources for bass.
During pumping operations equipment personnel would be required to provide safe
passage to recreational boaters. All obstacles and hazards to recreational boaters would be
clearly identified with U.S. Coast Guard approved markers and buoys. Coordination with the
U.S. Coast Guard to ensure that boaters can safely pass along the rivers in the project area would
occur prior to the start of any restoration activities. Equipment would be moved if necessary to
accommodate recreational boaters.
Prior to construction, coordination would occur with local recreation facilities to:
•

Inform boaters and anglers of project activities;

•

Provide project safety information including maps of any restricted access areas; and

•

Maps would be updated, as needed, to identify the new intertidal marsh restoration
areas.

Coordination with recreational fisherman and boaters, as described above, would ensure
that impacts associated with construction of the project would be reduced to less than significant.

5.9

Cultural Resources

5.9.1

Methodology and Basis of Significance

Methodology
Analysis of the impacts was based on evaluation of the changes to the existing historic
properties that would result from implementation of the project. The term “historic property”
refers to any cultural resource that has been found eligible for listing, or is listed, in the NRHP.
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (NHPA), outlines the
process in which Federal agencies are required to determine the effects of their undertakings on

213

historic properties. In making a determination of the effects to historic properties, consideration
was given to:
•

Specific changes in the characteristics of historic properties in the study area.

•

The temporary or permanent nature of changes to historic properties and the visual
study area around the historic properties.

•

The existing integrity considerations of historic properties in the study area and how
the integrity was related to the specific criterion that makes a historic property
eligible for listing in the NRHP.

Basis of Significance
Any adverse effects on cultural resources that are listed or eligible for listing in the
NRHP (i.e., historic properties) are considered to be significant. Effects are considered to be
adverse if they:
•

Alter, directly or indirectly, any of the characteristics of a cultural resource that
qualify that resource for the NRHP so that the integrity of the resource's location,
design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or association is diminished.

5.9.2

Alternative 1 – No Action

Under the no action alternative, it is assumed that no action would be taken to restore
intertidal marsh habitat to the flooded islands. It is assumed that restoration action currently
proposed under BDCP and other projects would still be constructed, but not at these locations.
As there are no historic properties within the APE no effects to historic properties would occur.
No further action would be required by USACE.

5.9.3
Placement

Alternative 2 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break via Direct

In order to create intertidal marsh habitat, material from O&M dredging would be
pumped to the restoration site and placed to raise the submerged surface of portions of Big
Break, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on Figure 3-9. O&M dredging and the piping of
material to the placement site is an ongoing USACE operation that is covered under the San
Francisco Bay to Stockton (John F Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channels) Final Environmental
Impact Statement from September 1980. As no historic properties have been identified within
the APE, no effects to historic properties would occur. No further action would be required by
USACE.

214

5.9.4 Alternative 6 – Intertidal Marsh Restoration at Big Break and Little Franks
Tract via Direct Placement and Pumping of Previously Dredged Materials
Alternative 6 includes Alternative 2 with the addition of further increments of intertidal
marsh restoration at both Big Break and Little Franks Tract. In order to construct these
additional increments, previously dredged material would be acquired from past O&M
placement sites, as shown on Figure 3-8. The dredged material would be excavated and pumped
from these source material sites to the restoration sites, and placed to raise the submerged surface
of portions of Big Break and Little Franks Tract, as described in Section 3.9 and shown on
Figure 3-13. Similar to Alternative 2, past O&M dredging is covered under the San Francisco
Bay to Stockton (John F Baldwin and Stockton Ship Channels) Final Environmental Impact
Statement from September 1980. However, effects associated with the pumping of material
from these source material sites is analyzed below.

The USACE would avoid any cultural resources discovered when placing the pipes
between the dredge spoils stockpiles and the placement sites. There would be little or no ground
disturbance associated with the placement of pipes. Therefore, these actions would not affect
any buried sites that may or may not be present. An archaeological monitor will be present for
the placement of cross channel temporary pipelines to intervene in the event cultural resources
are discovered within the path of the pipeline. If a site cannot be avoided the USACE will
reopen consultation with the SHPO. As no historic properties have been identified within the
submerged portions of the APE, USACE has determined that there are no historic properties
affected. No further action would be required by USACE.

5.9.5

Mitigation

USACE has determined that no historic properties exist within the APE of the project.
Therefore, none of the alternatives considered will result in an adverse effect to historic
properties. If unanticipated discoveries are made USACE will follow 36 CFR §800.13.

5.10

Growth-Inducing Effects

NEPA regulations require an EIS to consider the potential indirect effects of a proposed
action. These indirect effects occur later in time or farther away in distance, but are still
reasonably foreseeable, and “may include growth inducing effects and other effects related to
induced changes in the pattern of land use, population density or growth rate” (40 CFR Section
1508.8[b]). For this project, any growth-inducing effects would be related to: (1) the relative
magnitude of temporary and permanent jobs created by the project; (2) the need for new workers
in the project area; (3) the need for additional housing to accommodate new workers and
families; and (4) the economic stimulus or growth due to an increase in population, recreational
demand, and/or tourist-oriented land development.

215

However, based on the small size and type of project, the restoration work would be not
expected to induce any growth in or near the project area. The regional work force would be
adequate to provide sufficient workers for the relatively small number of temporary construction
jobs (approximately 20 temporary positions) created by the project. No new temporary or
permanent jobs would be needed to maintain or monitor the restored habitat once construction is
completed. As a result, no additional housing would be needed. Since the project would only
restore wildlife habitat in a rural part of the Delta, no increase in population, recreational
demand, and/or tourist-oriented land development is expected. Consequently indirect project
effects for Alternative 2 or Alternative 6, if measurable at all, would be extremely minor and
well below any reasonable threshold of significance. Therefore, growth-inducing effects would
be less than significant and no mitigation is required.

5.11

Cumulative Impacts

The Council on Environmental Quality’s regulations for implementing NEPA define a
cumulative effect as “the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact
of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions
regardless of what agency (federal or nonfederal) or person undertakes such other actions.
Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking
place over a period of time” (40 CFR 1508.7).
This section discusses the potential cumulative effects of the Delta Study when added to
other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions. As presented in Section 5.1, eight
resources (vegetation and wildlife, special status species, water quality, air quality, climate
change, transportation and navigation, recreation, and cultural resources) are identified as
potentially impacted by the project. These resources could experience a cumulative effect
related to the project, and are therefore evaluated below. As described in Section 4.1, other
resources (hazardous and toxic waste, hydrology and hydraulics, land use, socioeconomics,
utilities and services, and geology) would not be affected, and are therefore not evaluated below.

5.11.1 Methodology and Geographic Scope of the Analysis
Methodology
The cumulative effects analysis determines the combined effect of the proposed project
with other closely related, reasonably foreseeable projects. Cumulative effects were evaluated
by identifying projects in and around the Delta region that could have significant adverse or
beneficial effects. These potential effects are compared to the potential adverse or beneficial
effects of the proposed alternatives to determine the type, length, and magnitude of potential
combined cumulative effects of the proposed project together with the other related reasonable
foreseeable projects. Significance of cumulative effects is determined by meeting Federal and
State mandates and specific criteria identified in this document for the affected resources.

216

Geographic Scope
The geographic area that could be affected by the project varies depending on the type of
environmental resource being considered. Potentially affected air and water resources extend
beyond the confines of the project footprint due to the dynamic nature of these resources. Table
5-23 presents the general geographic areas associated with the different resources addressed in
this cumulative effects analysis.

5.11.2 Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Future Projects
This section briefly describes other projects in the project area. The exact construction
timing and sequencing of these projects are not yet determined or may depend on uncertain
funding sources. All of these projects are required to evaluate the effects of the proposed project
features on environmental resources in the area. In addition, mitigation or mitigation measures
must be developed to avoid or reduce any adverse effects to less than significant based on
Federal and local agency criteria. Those effects that cannot be avoided or reduced to less than
significant are more likely to contribute to significant cumulative effects in the area.
The Delta Islands and Levees Feasibility Study and Related Projects would be located
in a rapidly growing area of eastern Contra Costa County. Relevant projects are projects that are
related or similar projects that are reasonably foreseeable, and have the potential to affect the
same resources and fall within the same geographic scope. A cumulative impact refers to two or
more individual effects which, when considered together, are significant or compound or
217

increase other environmental impacts. The individual effects may be changes resulting from a
single project or a number of separate projects.
U.S Army Corps of Engineers Projects
Sacramento River Deep Water Ship Channel Operations and Maintenance (Port of
Sacramento)
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Water Resources, and the Port
of Sacramento, conduct annual maintenance dredging of the Sacramento Deep Water Ship
Channel. Fine sediments cause shoaling, which must be removed to maintain adequate depth for
commercial shipping traffic using the navigation channels. Failure to perform maintenance
dredging would result in unsafe conditions and a restriction to access to the Port of Sacramento
from the San Francisco Bay. Failing to dredge the channel poses both a substantial risk to
human safety, as well as an economic harm to the Port and the commercial activities that use the
Ports’ facilities.
Dredged materials are removed by using a hydraulic cutter head suction dredge for
dredging, and a dragline and clamshell crane are used for rock placement. The material is then
deposited at previously authorized dredged material placement (DMP) sites. Dredge slurry is
routed to the DMP sites via pipelines. DMP sites are diked and dredge slurry is allowed to settle
and consolidate at these sites. Decant water is then discharged back into the waterway, from
some sites, as determined during annual coordination. Dredged spoils are allowed to dry and
remain stockpiled at the sites for periodic use for levee repairs, livestock grazing, and other
purposes.
San Francisco Bay to Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel Operations and
Maintenance (San Joaquin River)
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Water Resources, and the Port
of Stockton, conduct annual maintenance dredging of the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel.
Annual maintenance dredging is performed in the same general manner as described above for
the Sacramento Deep Water Channel.
In addition, maintenance bank protection work is needed to maintain the integrity of
existing bank protection placed to prevent erosion of the ship channel levees. Such bank erosion
usually occurs due to wave action caused by ship traffic. Maintenance bank stabilization, in the
form of rock replenishment, would stabilize the channel alignment and preserve the general
uniformity of the bank lines. The levees protect ship channel traffic from adverse crosscurrents
during the occurrence of flood flows in the Yolo Bypass and also protect adjacent lands from
flooding during high flows. Implementation of the Delta Study is highly dependent upon the
availability of dredged material from O&M operations within the Stockton DWSC. The
availability of dredged material could affect the timing and completion of the Delta Study.

Department of Water Resources/State of California Projects
Bay Delta Conservation Plan
The BDCP is a comprehensive conservation strategy for the Delta to advance the
planning goal of restoring ecological functions of the Delta and improving water supply
reliability in the state of California. The conservation strategy is designed to restore and protect
ecosystem health, water supply, and water quality within a stable regulatory framework. The
BDCP reflects the outcome of a multiyear collaboration between DWR, Reclamation, State and
Federal fish and wildlife agencies, State and Federal water contractors, nongovernmental
organizations, agricultural interests, and the general public. The BDCP sets out a comprehensive
conservation strategy for the Delta designed to restore and protect ecosystem health, water
supply, and water quality within a stable regulatory framework.
Dutch Slough Tidal Marsh Restoration Project
The Dutch Slough Tidal Marsh Restoration Project, in an area formerly slated for urban
development, will soon become 1,178 acres of critically needed habitat for fish and wildlife in
the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The project is a cooperative effort between State, Federal,
and private agencies, including DWR, CDFW, State Coastal Conservancy, Reclamation
Districts, Natural Heritage Institute, City of Oakley, Ironhouse Sanitary District, and private
consultants. In 2013, the Dutch Slough Tidal Marsh Restoration Project began construction.
The project's location in the western Delta offers the opportunity, soil types, and lack of
subsidence to create a large area of tidal marsh and complex intertidal channels favored by native
Delta species. Shaded channels, native grasslands, and riparian forests will be restored in the
upland portions of the site. The habitats to be restored are like those that historically dominated
the Delta, and their restoration is considered a critical action to increase numbers of native
sensitive species and improve general ecological health of the Delta. This project will not only
provide critical habitat for native plants, fish, and wildlife that are in rapid decline in the Delta,
but will also provide outdoor recreation and resources for the residents of the Delta and Bay
Area.
City of Oakley Projects
City Community Park
The City of Oakley is proposing a Community Park and Public Access Conceptual
Master Plan (hereinafter referred to as “City Community Park Project”) for 55 acres adjacent to
the Dutch Slough Restoration Project and four miles of levee trails on the perimeter of the
project lands. The City Community Park will provide parking and trailheads for the public access
components of the Dutch Slough Restoration Project. The project is currently under design.

219

Cypress Grove
The Cypress Grove EIR was certified by the City of Oakley in 2003. This development is
under construction and will consist of 637 new residential units on approximately 147 acres. The
project is adjacent to and south of the Contra Costa Canal and adjacent to and east of Marsh
Creek.
Oakley Westerly Annexation
In 2005, the Contra Costa County Local Agency Formation Commission approved
annexation of approximately 80 acres south of East Cypress Road and east of Sellers Avenue to
the City of Oakley. Subdivision 8904 (24 acres known as Tuscany Estates and formerly the
Baldocchi property) is undergoing tentative map review. Tuscany Estates consists of 100 homes.
East Cypress Corridor Specific Plan and Summer Lake
The City of Oakley prepared a Supplemental EIR for the East Cypress Corridor Specific
Plan which was finalized in February 2009. The specific plan proposed the development of up
to 5,759 residential units on an approximately 2,500-acre site adjacent to 1.5 miles of the Contra
Costa Canal, from the Rock Slough trash rack to Cypress Road. The specific plan area is within
the City of Oakley's sphere of influence. The City of Oakley proposed to annex the entire
specific plan area. Approximately 500 homes are in the East Cypress Corridor Specific Plan
area. Most of the existing homes are along Sand Mound and Dutch Sloughs.
Dutch Slough Properties Development
The City of Oakley has approved plans to develop approximately 1,342 residential units
on approximately 300 acres immediately south of the Dutch Slough Restoration Project site
between the Contra Costa Canal and Cypress Road. The development area south of the Contra
Costa Canal consists of 140 acres of the Emerson property, which is estimated to have
approximately 662 residential units. The City certified an EIR and approved a tentative map in
November of 2007 for 506 residential units on 120 acres of the Gilbert property and 44 acres of
the Burroughs property, which is anticipated to have approximately 174 residential units. The
project was completed in 2012.

5.11.3 Cumulative Impacts Analysis
Vegetation and Wildlife
Implementation of the proposed alternatives would contribute to restoration and
expansion of sensitive marsh habitat and would benefit aquatic and wildlife species in decline
due to the steady loss of this habitat type in the Delta. The minimization and avoidance
measures would be implemented during construction to minimize impacts to biological resources
by preventing the spread of non-native plant species to the greatest extent practicable. As a
result, the Delta Study would not contribute to a cumulative impact on vegetation and wildlife.
220

The Delta Study, in combination with the other restoration projects discussed in Section 5.11.2,
such as the Dutch Slough Restoration Project, would contribute to the overall future health of the
Delta and would improve overall habitat conditions. As a result, any cumulative impacts
associated with the Delta Study would be beneficial.
Special Status Species
Implementation of the project has the potential to contribute to the loss or degradation of
sensitive habitats and to adversely affect special-status species, but planned project mitigation
measures, described in Section 5.3 above, would limit adverse impacts to a less-than-significant
level. By creating new intertidal marsh habitat, the Delta Study would bring significant
ecosystem benefits to special status fish species, such as salmonids, steelhead, and green
sturgeon. In conjunction with the restoration actions proposed by other projects, such as the
Dutch Slough Restoration Project, the proposed restoration project will assist in recovery of
species listed under the Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) and California Endangered
Species Act (CESA) by creating new nearshore habitat for these species and improving the
overall health of the Delta’s ecosystem.
Aquatic Species
Proposed projects could have potential impacts on Delta Smelt and other listed fish
species in the greater project vicinity. The new housing developments would increase the
human population in the area, potentially leading to more recreation pressure at the site
(boating, fishing, and litter). The increased volume of municipal sewage from the new
developments would likely introduce more pollutants to the waters. In the context of these
adverse development pressures on Delta ecosystems, implementation of the project, together
with other regional marsh and wetlands restoration projects, would provide long-term net
benefits to listed fish species through the construction of primary productivity areas and mud
flats,
Reptilian Species
The Delta Study could affect, but is not likely to adversely affect the giant garter snake.
The other related projects discussed above could cause adverse impacts to the giant garter snake
in the greater project vicinity. Multiple shoreline projects may contribute to disturbance of giant
garter snake refugia and over wintering habitat. Implementation of the Delta Study and other
regional restoration projects would result in long-term net benefits to the giant garter snake by
expanding primary productivity areas and refugia.
Water Quality
Construction activities have the potential to temporarily degrade water quality through the
direct release of soil and construction materials into water bodies or the indirect release of
contaminants into water bodies through placement activities. Related projects, including the San
Joaquin River Deep Water Ship Channel Operations and Maintenance, the Dutch Slough Tidal
Marsh Restoration Project, the Dutch Slough Properties Development, and the Ironhouse
221

Sanitary District project could be under construction during the same timeframe as this project.
If construction occurs during the same timeframe water quality could be diminished primarily
due to increased turbidity.
Further urban development could increase runoff as the amount of impervious surfaces is
increased. The new housing developments may cause more stormwater runoff laden with
contaminants common in urban/suburban areas (i.e. pesticides, lawn fertilizers, hydrocarbons).
The increased volume of municipal sewage from the new developments could also introduce
more pollutants to Delta waters. The method by which treated wastewater is discharged would
determine the severity of the impact to water quality from new and proposed residential
subdivisions near the study area. All projects would be required to coordinate with the RWQCB
and overall water quality will be required to meet the Basin Plan objectives. The proposed
marsh restoration activities associated with the Delta Study would result in less-than-significant
effects to water quality. Degradation of water quality from the project would be short term and
limited to the construction period. The project would not cumulatively contribute to long-term
adverse effects that may result from development projects.
Air Quality
Construction of the proposed alternatives would result in emissions of criteria pollutants;
however, with the implementation of mitigation measures these emissions are expected to be
below the thresholds of the CAA and the CCAA. All of the related projects discussed above
would cumulatively contribute to emissions of criteria pollutants throughout the region,
particularly if projects are constructed concurrently, which could have a significant cumulative
effect on air quality. It is anticipated that each of these projects would implement separate
mitigation plans, as required by air quality control agencies, to reduce the emissions to below
significance levels.
Construction of the Delta Study is tentatively scheduled for 2018 through 2023,
depending upon Congressional authorization and appropriation. However, on a regional level,
local area projects would still contribute to a significant cumulative effect, and coordination with
the SMAQMD and BAAQMD would need to occur prior to construction to reduce these effects.
Climate Change
It is unlikely that any single project by itself could have a significant impact on the
environment with respect to GHGs. However, the cumulative effect of human activities has been
linked to quantifiable changes in the composition of the atmosphere, which, in turn, have been
shown to be the main cause of global climate change (IPCC 2007). Therefore, the analysis of the
environmental effects of GHG emissions is inherently a cumulative impact issue. While the
emissions of one single project will not cause global climate change, GHG emissions from
multiple projects throughout the world have a cumulative effect on global climate change.
It is expected that the primary GHG impacts from present and planned Delta area projects
would arise from their construction phases. On an individual basis, each of these projects would
mitigate emissions below the general reporting threshold. If these projects are implemented
222

concurrently, it is possible that the combined cumulative effects could be above reporting
requirements for GHG emissions. However, with the implementation of mitigation measures,
which would be required for each of these projects, it is possible that the effects could be reduced
to less than significant.
Transportation and Navigation
The Delta Study would not have a significant impact on local roadways in the study area.
The only potential impacts are associated with the piping of material over Highway 160. While
the local projects do include housing development projects, which would increase roadway
useage, none of these projects are located on Sherman Island, where Highway 160 would be
impacted. The Delta Study would not impact any roadways in the vicinity of the development
projects. As a result, there is no cumulative effect from the construction of these proposed
projects.
USACE does not anticipate any cumulative effects as a result of the dredging and
placement activities of the Sacramento DWSC, the operations and maintenance activities on the
Stockton DWSC along the San Joaquin River, and the Delta Study. The operations and
maintenance activities on the Stockton DWSC are essential to the proposed alternatives. Project
activities near the Sacramento DWSC would not interfere with ship movement since dredging
and pumping equipment must be positioned to allow ship passage. Overall cumulative effects to
navigation would not be significant.
Recreation
The proposed project would provide a variety of recreational opportunities for both active
and passive recreation and education. Cumulative impacts to recreation are primarily related to
other construction projects that could occur during the same time frame as those considered for
this study and within the same vicinity as this study. Temporary construction effects would be
minimized through design modifications and coordination with the public and recreation
agencies ensuring that any residual effects would be minimized. The specific placement sites do
not offer unique ‘sense of place’ recreation experiences; adjacent open water areas can provide
similar or identical recreation experiences. During dredging and pumping operations equipment
personnel are required to provide safe passage to recreational boaters. All obstacles and hazards
to recreational boaters would be clearly identified by flagging and buoys. Equipment would be
moved if necessary to accommodate recreational boaters. Therefore, the project would not result
in significant cumulative impacts to recreation.
Cultural Resources
Cumulative impacts to cultural resources would be primarily related to other construction
projects that could occur during the same timeframe as those considered for this study and within
the same vicinity as this study. A cumulative overall impact to cultural resources is not likely,
since the project does not have significant cultural resources.

223

5.12

Unavoidable Significant Effects

The CEQ’s NEPA Compliance Guide states that any significant adverse environmental
effects that cannot be avoided if the project is implemented must be described. This description
includes significant adverse effects that can be mitigated, but not reduced to a level of
insignificance.
The analysis indicates that one or more of the alternatives could result in unavoidable
significant effects on water quality, air quality, and recreation.
•

Turbidity may adversely affect aquatic listed species.

•

Bass anglers may be temporarily affected by the temporary loss of fishing areas.

Most of these significant effects could be reduced to a level of insignificance by
implementing appropriate conservation and mitigation measures. However, some unavoidable
effects to air quality cannot be reduced to less than significant even when mitigation measures
are implemented.

5.13 Relationship Between Short-Term Uses of the Environment and Long-Term
Productivity
In accordance with NEPA (40 CFR 1502.16), this section discusses the relationship
between local short-term uses of the human environment and maintenance of long-term
productivity for the project. Short-term effects on vegetation and wildlife, water quality, and air
quality would be limited to the construction phase of the project. No short-term uses of the
environment are expected after the project is placed in operation. The water quality and air
quality would return to pre-project levels after construction is completed.
In addition, the long-term productivity of the environment in the Delta would be
increased by restoring aquatic, riparian, and adjacent terrestrial habitats for native plants and
wildlife, including special status species.

5.14

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitment of Resources

In accordance with NEPA (40 CFR 1502.16), this EIS discusses any irreversible and
irretrievable commitment of resources that would be involved in the alternative plans. Significant
irreversible environmental changes are defined as uses of nonrenewable resources during the
initial and continued phases of the alternatives that cannot be undone.
The alternatives would result in the irretrievable commitment of open water habitat. In
addition, they would result in the irretrievable commitment of construction materials, fossil fuels,
and other energy resources needed to construct the project. Operation and maintenance are not
expected to increase the use of construction materials or fossil fuels
224

CHAPTER 6. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS
The status of the proposed action’s compliance with applicable Federal environmental
requirements is summarized below. Prior to initiation of construction, the work would be in
compliance with all applicable Federal laws and Executive Orders.

6.1

Federal Laws

Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, PL 86-70; 16 U.S.C. 668, et seq. Full
Compliance. The USFWS is the Federal agency responsible for administering this act, which
prohibits possessing, selling, transporting, or trading a bald or golden eagle or eagle part, alive or
dead. Areas in the Delta have both foraging and breeding habitat for these eagles. Prior to
initiation of construction, surveys would be conducted by a USFWS-approved biologist to
determine the presence of these eagles and/or their nests in or near the work areas. If active nests
are found, the USFWS would be contacted for advice and recommendations for how to avoid
disturbance and whether a permit is necessary. Unless eagles are found in the project area prior
to construction, the project would be in full compliance with this Act.
Clean Air Act, as amended, PL 91-604; 42 U.S.C. 1857h-7, et seq. Full Compliance.
The USEPA is the Federal agency responsible for managing the Nation’s air quality. USEPA
establishes national ambient air quality standards, and oversees the air quality plans developed
and implemented by the states. SMAQMD and BAAQMD are responsible for developing local
district air quality management plans and enforcing regulations pertaining to air emissions in the
Delta. As discussed in Section 5.2.5, the proposed action would not exceed national air quality
standards based on modeled estimates of emission rates during construction of the project.
On November 30, 1993, the USEPA promulgated final general conformity regulations at
40 CFR 93B for Federal activities. These regulations apply to a Federal action in a nonattainment or maintenance area if the total emissions of the criteria pollutants and precursor
pollutants caused by the action equal or exceed certain de minimis amounts, thus requiring the
Federal agency to make a determination of general conformity. As discussed in Section 4.2.5, at
least part of the Delta is in non-attainment for ozone, PM 10, and PM 2.5 . As discussed in Section
5.5, the proposed action would not exceed de minimis thresholds based on modeled estimates of
emission rates during construction of the project, and would be in full compliance with the CAA.
Clean Water Act, PL 92-500; 33 U.S.C. 1251, et seq. Partial Compliance. The
USEPA is the Federal agency responsible for managing the Nation’s water quality. USEPA
establishes national water quality standards and oversees the water quality plans developed and
implemented by the states. The CVRWQCB and SFRWQCB are responsible for developing
local district water quality management plans, issuing permits, and enforcing regulations
pertaining to water quality in the Delta. In addition, USACE is responsible for issuing Section
404 permits for projects that involve discharge of fill material into Waters of the U.S.

225

The proposed action would involve discharge of fill material into Waters of the U.S. in
the Delta. Although USACE does not issue permits for their own projects, USACE does
comply with the guidelines and substantive requirements of Section 404, including Sections
404(b)(1) and 401. As discussed in Section 5.2.4, a Section 404(b)(1) analysis was conducted on
the TSP and is included in Appendix H. The analysis concluded that the project would not result
in significant effects to water quality. The construction contractor would be required to
implement the measures listed in the analysis to avoid or minimize adverse effects on the aquatic
ecosystem. Section 401 water quality certification would be obtained from the RWQCB prior to
initiation of construction.
The proposed action would also require an NPDES permit since it would disturb 1 or
more acre of land and involve possible storm water discharges to surface waters. Prior to
initiation of construction, the contractor would be required to prepare a Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan and then submit a Notice of Intent form to the RWQCB, requesting approval of
the work. This storm water plan and an In-Water work plan would identify the measures to be
implemented by the contractor to avoid or minimize any adverse effects of construction on
surface waters.
After the issuance of a 401 certification the project would be in compliance.
Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, PL 93-205; 16 U.S.C. 1531, et seq.
Partial Compliance. The Corps obtained a list of the Federally threatened, endangered,
proposed, and candidate species that have the potential to occur in the Delta via the USFWS
website on December 16, 2013. Based on the locations of the proposed work, the listed species
that could be affected by the proposed action include the Delta smelt and the giant garter snake
under the jurisdiction of the USFWS and green sturgeon, Central Valley steelhead, Central
Valley spring-run Chinook salmon, and Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon under the
jurisdiction of NMFS. The Corps has determined that the proposed alternatives would have no
effect to the listed fish species under the jurisdiction of NMFS. A letter will be sent to NMFS on
requesting concurrence with the no effect determination. The Corps is currently preparing a
Biological Assessment discussing the potential effects of the proposed action on Delta smelt and
giant garter snake. The Biological Assessment was submitted to USFWS, along with letters
requesting initiation of formal consultation with each of these agencies on April 2, 2014. The
consultation letters and BA are included in Appendix G. Once USFWS has issued a Biological
Opinion, the Delta Study will be in full compliance with this Act.
Farmland Protection Policy Act, PL 97-98; 7 U.S.C. 4201, et seq. Full Compliance.
The NRCS is the Federal agency responsible for administering this act, which requires Federal
agencies to coordinate a Farmland Conversion Impact form with the NRCS whenever their
projects or programs would affect land designated as prime or unique farmland. The proposed
action would not remove or alter any land that is protected under this Act. As a result the project
is in full compliance with this Act.
Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958, as amended, PL 85-624; 16 U.S.C. 661,
et seq. Partial Compliance. The USFWS is the Federal agency responsible for administering
this act, which requires Federal agencies to coordinate with USFWS and State wildlife agencies
226

during the planning of projects that would result in the control or modification of a natural
stream or body of water. The FWCA intends that wildlife conservation be given equal
consideration with other features of these projects. Because of the sensitivity of the Delta,
USACE initiated coordination with USFWS early in the planning process.
As discussed in Section 5.2.1, the USFWS is preparing the draft CAR. This report details
the vegetation, wildlife, and fisheries resources in the project area; evaluates the potential effects
of the proposed action on those resources; determines required mitigation for adverse effects;
and provides recommendations for consideration by USACE. Although adoption of the
recommendations is not required by the act, USACE usually adopts the recommendations unless
there is an overriding consideration not to do so. The CAR will be included in the Final EIS to be
distributed for public and agency review. Once the CAR is finalized and the recommendations
are considered by USACE, the Delta Study would be in full compliance with the FWCA.
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1996, as
amended, PL 104-267; 16 U.S.C. 1801, et seq. Full Compliance. The Magnuson-Stevens Act
establishes a management system for national marine and estuarine fishery resources. This
legislation requires that all Federal agencies consult with NMFS regarding all actions or
proposed actions permitted, funded, or undertaken that may adversely affect Essential Fish
Habitat (EFH). Under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, effects on habitat managed under the Pacific
Salmon Fishery Management Plan must also be considered. USACE has determined that the
proposed action would not adversely affect EFH for Federally managed fisheries.
Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1928, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 715, et seq. Full
Compliance. USFWS is the Federal agency responsible for administering this act, which
implements a treaty between the U.S. and Great Britain (for Canada), Mexico, Japan, and the
Soviet Union (now Russia) for the protection of migratory birds. Unless permitted by
regulations, this law prohibits anyone to "pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, attempt to take, capture
or kill … any migratory bird …or any part, nest, or egg of any such bird" (16 U.S.C. 703).
Areas in the Delta have foraging, resting, nesting, and breeding habitat for numerous migratory
birds. To the extent possible, the Corps would schedule construction outside periods of
migration or nesting to avoid or minimize effects on migratory birds. In any case, prior to
initiation of construction, surveys would be conducted by a USFWS-approved biologist to
determine the presence of migratory birds and/or their nests in or near the work areas. If active
nests are found, the USFWS would be contacted for advice and recommendations for how to
avoid disturbance and whether a permit is necessary. With the implementation of these actions,
the Delta Study would be in full compliance with this Act.
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, PL 91-190; 42 U.S.C.
4321, et seq. Partial Compliance. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) is responsible
for ensuring that Federal agencies operate in accordance with NEPA, which requires full
disclosure of the environmental effects, alternatives, potential mitigation, and environmental
compliance procedures of most Federal management, regulation, or funding activities that affect
the environment. NEPA requires the preparation of an environmental document to ensure that
Federal agencies accomplish the law’s purposes. This draft EIS is in partial compliance with

227

NEPA. Full compliance will be achieved when the final EIS and Record of Decision are filed
with the USEPA.
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, PL 89-655; 16 U.S.C. 470a,
et seq. Partial Compliance. The SHPO in each state is responsible for ensuring that Federal
agencies comply with Section 106 of this act, which requires that they consider the effects of a
proposed undertaking on properties that have been determined to be eligible for, or included in,
the National Register of Historic Places. The Section 106 review process consists of four steps:
(1) identification and evaluation of historic properties; (2) assessments of the effects of the
undertaking on historic properties; (3) consultation with the SHPO and appropriate agencies to
develop a plan to address the treatment of historic properties; and (4) concurrence from the
SHPO regarding the agreement or results of consultation.
As discussed in Section 4.2.12, both archeological and historic sites are found in the
Delta. The Corps has reviewed records for the Big Break and Little Franks Tract areas, which
include the proposed work areas for this study. No cultural or historic sites were identified
during document research or during a site inspection by water craft. Correspondence with
interested Tribes regarding the study was initiated via letter dated April 2013. Based on this
documentary research, consultation with local Indian Tribes, and field work the project is in
partial compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 until concurrence of no
effect is received from the SHPO.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, PL 94-580; 7 U.S.C. 1010, et seq.
Full Compliance. The USEPA is the Federal agency responsible for administering this act,
which regulates the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous
waste. To date, no potentially hazardous materials areas or spills have been observed during
field visits to the Delta. The Delta Study is currently in full compliance with this Act.
During PED, a Phase I Site Assessment of the proposed work areas will be conducted,
including a database search of recorded spills and a windshield survey of the areas. Any
identified hazardous waste at the work sites would be required to be cleaned up completely by
the local sponsor prior to initiation of construction of the proposed action. The contractor would
also be required to develop a spill prevention, containment, and countermeasures plan to avoid or
minimize any effects due to minor accidental spills of fuels, lubricants, and other supplies during
construction. Completion of these commitments would put the Delta Study in full compliance
with this Act.
Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, as amended, PL 90-542; 16 U.S.C. 1271, et seq. Full
Compliance. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 was enacted to preserve selected
rivers or sections of rivers in their free-flowing condition in order to protect the quality of river
waters and to fulfill other national conservation purposes. There are no designated Wild and
Scenic Rivers in the Delta. The Delta Study is not subject to this Act.

228

6.2

Executive Orders

Executive Order 13112, Invasive Species, February 3, 1999. Full Compliance. This
EO directs Federal agencies to prevent the introduction of invasive species, provide for their
control, and minimize their economic, ecological, and human health effects. As discussed in
Section 4.2.1, invasive species, including aquatics and weed species, are found throughout the
Delta. Prior to construction, the construction contractor would be required to prepare an invasive
species control plan to be approved by the Corps and acceptable to appropriate Federal and State
resource agencies. The Delta Study would be in full compliance with this order.

Executive Order 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in
Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations, February 11, 1994. Full Compliance.
This EO directs Federal agencies not to exclude persons from participation in, deny persons the
benefits of, or subject persons to discrimination under their programs, policies, and activities
because of their race, color, or national origin. As discussed in Section 4.1.5, the proposed
action would have no disproportionate effects on minority or low-income populations in the
Delta, as there are no populations of this kind in the study area. Therefore, the Delta Study
would not be subject to this order.
Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, May 24, 1977. Full Compliance.
This EO directs Federal agencies to avoid, to the extent possible, long- and short-term adverse
effects associated with the occupancy or modification of the base flood plain (1% annual event),
as well as to avoid direct and indirect support of development in the base flood plain, wherever
there is a practicable alternative. As discussed in Section 4.1.3, the proposed action would have
no measurable effect on the (FEMA’s 100-year) floodplain in the Delta. In addition, because of
the nature of the proposed work, the proposed action would not directly or indirectly support
development in the floodplain. The Delta Study would be in full compliance with this order.
Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands, May 24, 1977. Full Compliance.
This EO directs Federal agencies to minimize the destruction, loss, or degradation of wetlands,
and to preserve and enhance their natural and beneficial values. As discussed in Section 5.2.1,
the proposed action would have a net positive effect on Delta wetland by adding approximately
97 acres of new intertidal marsh to the aquatic ecosystem. Consequently the Delta Study would
be in full compliance with this order.

229

CHAPTER 7 – PUBLIC AGENCY INVOLVEMENT AND REVIEW
This chapter describes the public involvement activities associated with the Delta Islands
and Levees Feasibility Study. These activities included agency meetings and coordination; a
community outreach program with public workshops, notices, and media; and distribution of the
draft documents for public review and comment.

Public Meetings and Workshops

On January 31 2013, USACE published a notice of intent (NOI) in the Federal Register
(Vol. 78, No. 921) to prepare an EIS. In February 2013, two scoping meetings were held for the
project study. The meetings were held to educate the public about the study efforts and to garner
input on the proposed scope, in accordance with NEPA. On February 19, 2013, the first meeting
was conducted from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. at the Old Sugar Mill in Clarksburg. The second meeting
was conducted on February 19, 2013 from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. at the Sheraton Grand Hotel in
Sacramento.
230

The meeting locations were chosen because they are central to the region. The meeting
times were chosen to accommodate both the workday schedules of public agency representatives
and the general public, including residents and business owners.
The meetings were open-house style workshops in which attendees could read and view
the information about the proposed alternatives and interact with project staff, including
representatives of USACE and DWR. The views expressed in the scoping meeting are
summarized in Section 7.4 below.
For more detail on comments received, information available at the meetings, and a
summary of key issues that were raised, see Appendix A which contains a scoping report. A
similar open-house format will be used for the public feasibility study draft report and EIS.
USACE will ensure all agencies, organizations, and individuals who provide comments will be
provided a copy of the final integrated report.

7.3

Comments on the NOI

Under NEPA, no time limit exists to receive written comments in response to the NOI.
Appendix A contains the NOI and the comments received at the February 2013 scoping
meetings. The views expressed in the scoping meeting are summarized as follows:

7.4

•

Clarifications on data and history of the Delta;

•

Concerns of siltation in Delta channels;

•

Recommendation for coordination with other agencies and efforts in the Delta; and

•

Recommendation to evaluate environmental effects of alternatives to water supply,
water quality, and aquatic and terrestrial biology.

Public Review and Comments on the Draft Report

This draft Integrated Report will be circulated for a 45 day review to Federal, State, and
local agencies; organizations; and individuals who have an interest in the project. A notice of
availability of the draft EIS will be published in the Federal Register following distribution for
public review. Public workshops will be held during the public review period to provide
additional opportunities for comments on the draft document. These meetings will be held at the
following times and places:
•

Wednesday May 7, 2014, 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the Old Sugar Mill in Clarksburg,
California.

231

•

Friday May 9, 2014, 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. at the Sheraton Grand Hotel in Sacramento,

CHAPTER 8 – TENTATIVELY SELECTED PLAN
This chapter describes the Tentatively Selected Plan (also called the preferred alternative
for NEPA purposes), as well as procedures and cost sharing requirements to implement the plan.
A schedule and list of further studies are also included.
8.1

Tentatively Selected Plan

The plan identified as the Tentatively Selected Plan is Alternative 6 (see Figure 8-1). The
Tentatively Selected Plan is described in detail below.

Figure 8-1. Tentatively Selected Plan.

235

8.1.1

Features and Accomplishments

The principle features of the Tentatively Selected Plan are: (1) placement of 500,000
cubic yards of fill material into Big Break from Operations and Maintenance dredging from the
Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel to restore tidal habitat elevations; (2) placement of 124,000
cubic yards of fill material into Big Break via pumping previously dredged material from the
McCormick dredged material placement site; (3) placement of 210,000 cubic yards of fill
material into Big Break via pumping previously dredged material from the Scour dredged
material placement site; (4) placement of 125,000 cubic yards of fill material into Big Break via
pumping previously dredged material from the Decker dredged material placement site; and (5)
placement of 153,000 cubic yards of fill material into Little Frank’s Tract via pumping
previously dredged material from the Bradford dredged material placement site. Additionally, a
Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan will be developed and included in the final report.
Monitoring and Adaptive Management costs, which are anticipated to be minimal, will be
included in first costs and operations, maintenance, repair, replacement, and relocations
(OMRR&R) costs, as appropriate. The preliminary total first project cost of this alternative is
$29.0 million.
The Tentatively Selected Plan provides a unique opportunity to restore 89.5 acres of
intertidal marsh in the Delta, habitat which is now largely non-existent in this ecosystem of
national significance. Prior to levee construction in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the
Delta was comprised almost solely of tidal marsh. As levees were constructed, floodplains were
disconnected from the waterways and land began to subside and compact as it was farmed and
developed for human use. Delta lands are now as much as 20 feet below sea level, much too low
for intertidal marsh habitat without incorporation of subsidence reversal, which is typically cost
prohibitive. For this reason, restoration of tidal marsh has been very limited throughout the
central Delta in particular, where subsidence is most extensive and also where tidal marsh was
historically most prevalent. The Tentatively Selected Plan links the proposed ecosystem
restoration actions to historic and ongoing USACE navigation projects, providing a cost effective
mechanism to implement otherwise costly subsidence reversal, resulting in restoration of habitat
for multiple Federally listed species, notably salmonids and Delta smelt. The restored habitat
would also benefit the millions of migratory fowl on the Pacific Flyway as they travel through
the Delta, part of the largest estuary on the West Coast.
The national significance of the Delta has been demonstrated many times through
decades of Federal authorizations and partnerships. The CALFED Bay-Delta Program, which
emerged from water crises of the 1990s, is a unique collaboration among 25 State and Federal
agencies to improve California’s water supply and the ecological health of the Bay-Delta. The
San Francisco Estuary Partnership is a coalition of resource agencies, non-profits, citizens, and
scientists working to protect, restore, and enhance water quality and fish and wildlife habitat in
the Bay-Delta. Most recently, the 2009 California Bay-Delta Memorandum of Understanding
Among Federal Agencies named the Bay-Delta “among the most important estuary ecosystems
in the Nation” and committed the Federal agencies to work in partnership with the State and
stakeholders to carry out the vision of “a healthy and sustainable Bay-Delta ecosystem that
provides for a high-quality, reliable, and sustainable long-term water supply for California, and
restores the environmental integrity and sustainability of the system.” The Tentatively Selected
236

Plan recommends Federal action to restore 89.5 acres intertidal marsh, one of the most sought
after habitat types in this unique, important estuary.
Specific features of the Tentatively Selected Plan include:
Big Break Operations and Maintenance Dredged Material Placement
For an estimated period of five years, material from Operations and Maintenance
dredging in the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel will be directly placed via pipeline into a
41.9 acre area of Big Break adjacent to the north remnant levee. The area would be contained by
a perimeter of sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to contain the suspended material and
minimize turbidity. Material would be placed in the area until a target elevation of 4.5 ft (NAVD
88) is achieved, which would require 500,000 cubic yards of material. Bulrush (Typha sp.) will
be planted over the area (10% coverage) to develop intertidal marsh habitat.
Pumping Previously Dredged Material from McCormick Placement Site
Previously dredged material from the McCormick placement site will be mixed into
slurry and pumped into a 10.4 acre area of Big Break adjacent to the north remnant levee. The
area would be contained by a perimeter of sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to contain the
suspended material and minimize turbidity. Material would be placed in the area until a target
elevation of 4.5 ft (NAVD 88) is achieved, which would require 124,000 cubic yards of material.
Bulrush (Typha sp.) will be planted over the area (10% coverage) to develop intertidal marsh
habitat. A general schematic of the pumping process is shown in Figure 8-2:

Figure 8-2. Pumping Diagram.
237

Pumping Previously Dredged Material from Scour Pit Placement Site
Previously dredged material from the Scour placement site will be mixed into slurry and
pumped into a 17.6 acre area of Big Break adjacent to the north remnant levee. The area would
be contained by a perimeter of sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to contain the suspended
material and minimize turbidity. Material would be placed in the area until a target elevation of
4.5 ft (NAVD 88) is achieved, which would require 210,000 cubic yards of material. Bulrush
(Typha sp.) will be planted over the area (10% coverage) to develop intertidal marsh habitat.
Pumping Previously Dredged Material from Decker Placement Site
Previously dredged material from the Decker placement site will be mixed into slurry and
pumped into a 10.4 acre area of Big Break adjacent to the north remnant levee. The area would
be contained by a perimeter of sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to contain the suspended
material and minimize turbidity. Material would be placed in the area until a target elevation of
4.5 ft (NAVD 88) is achieved, which would require 125,000 cubic yards of material. Bulrush
(Typha sp.) will be planted over the area (10% coverage) to develop intertidal marsh habitat.
Pumping Previously Dredged Material from Bradford Placement Site
Previously dredged material from the Bradford placement site will be mixed into slurry
and pumped into a 9.2 acre area of Little Frank’s Tract adjacent to the north remnant levee. The
area would be contained by a perimeter of sacrificial hay bales and silt curtains to contain the
suspended material and minimize turbidity. Material would be placed in the area until a target
elevation of 4.5 ft (NAVD 88) is achieved, which would require 125,000 cubic yards of material.
Bulrush (Typha sp.) will be planted over the area (10% coverage) to develop intertidal marsh
habitat.
Flood Risk Communication and Emergency Response Planning and Coordination
In addition to the Tentatively Selected Plan, continued flood risk communication and
flood warning and preparedness planning through the existing USACE FPMS Program authority
are recommended to reduce the consequences of flooding in the Delta as described in Chapter 3.

8.1.2

Regional Benefits

Although designed to stand alone, the Tentatively Selected Plan complements other
efforts underway in the California Bay-Delta. The State of California, U.S. Bureau of
Reclamation, resource agencies, and other agencies are developing the Bay Delta Conservation
Plan to achieve the co-equal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and
protecting, restoring, and enhancing the Delta ecosystem. The Tentatively Selected Plan was
formulated to not impede or be dependent upon the Bay Delta Conservation Plan; however, the
Tentatively Selected Plan does contribute to the goal of restoring the Delta ecosystem.
238

Specifically, restoration of intertidal marsh is a high priority for the Delta as less than 5% of the
historic tidal marsh remains throughout the Delta.

8.1.3

Operation, Maintenance, Repair, Replacement, and Rehabilitation

Once construction of each operable project element is complete, that project element
would be turned over to the non-Federal sponsor. The non-Federal sponsor would then be
responsible for the OMRR&R of the completed project elements in accordance with the
OMRR&R manual.
Maintenance requirements, which are anticipated to be minimal, will be discussed in
detail in the OMRR&R manual. Based on the high rate of vegetative success at the nearby
Donlon Island reference site, the restoration plantings are expected to be self-sufficient, therefore
requiring no maintenance. A minimal amount of maintenance of such items as signs,
containment barriers, and other items that protect the restoration areas could be required. Also,
periodic checklist type inspections on an annual or biannual basis would be required to monitor
the site for severe adverse effects. A description of monitoring activities will be included in the
Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan, which will include criteria for ecosystem success,
as well as the estimated cost and duration of the monitoring. Monitoring will continue until
criteria for ecosystem restoration success have been met. Monitoring activities will be cost
shared for a period of ten years; however, if monitoring is required beyond the ten year period,
the cost of monitoring will be a non-Federal sponsor responsibility, per Section 2039 of the
Water Resources Development Act of 2007.
OMRR&R costs will be developed in conjunction with the Monitoring and Adaptive
Management Plan and included in the final report. Subsequent to the completion of the design of
the project features and prior to construction, a draft OMRR&R manual would be prepared in
coordination with the non-Federal sponsor and affected agencies. A final OMRR&R manual
would be prepared after the completion of construction and provided to the non-Federal sponsor.

8.1.4

Real Estate

Acquisition of about 103.05 acres in fee title along with about 955.76 acres of temporary
work area easements and 35.45 acres of temporary pipeline easements are required for the
Tentatively Selected Plan. Fee title would be acquired over submerged lands at Big Break and
Little Frank’s Tract; temporary work area easements at borrow sites and staging areas; and
temporary pipeline easements for placement of dredged material slurry pipelines where the
navigational servitude is unavailable. The non-Federal sponsor would acquire these estates as
part of its project obligations.
Real estate acquisition for the Tentatively Selected Plan is split among 16 landowners.
All fee acquisitions are located on currently flooded islands with no infrastructure, therefore
relocations are not required.

239

8.1.5

Plan Economics

The project first cost was estimated on the basis of October 2013 price levels and
amounts to $29,018,000. Table 8-1 shows this cost by primary project feature. Estimated
average annual costs were based on a 3.5 percent interest rate, a period of analysis of 50 years,
and physical construction ending in 2022. Table 8-2 shows the average annual costs and outputs.

Risk and Uncertainty

In general, the ability of the Tentatively Selected Plan to provide the expected
accomplishments depends on the validity of pertinent assumptions, base data, and analytical
techniques used in this study; the successful completion of future studies, designs, and
construction; and appropriate operation, maintenance, and repair after construction.
Other risks include constructability and resiliency to sea level rise. Subsidence reversal
techniques have several factors that could affect constructability, such as estimated volumes of
available material and containment of sediments in open water; however, successful
implementation of similar projects (Donlon Island and Venice Cut) in the vicinity of Big Break
and Little Frank’s Tract indicate these risks are low. As the detailed designs of the Tentatively
Selected Plan are developed during Preconstruction Engineering and Design (PED), these risks
will be addressed as appropriate. Additionally, Delta water levels are projected to rise during the
life of the project; however, the life cycle of the intertidal marsh vegetation is expected to be
more than sufficient to accrue organic material and increase land elevation, naturally
compensating for changes in sea level.
The HEP, used to quantify ecosystem restoration benefits, provides a reasonable
representation of the outputs of the project. During detailed design of the project, hydraulic
modeling would be performed to develop the specific habitat regime. The use of the well
documented, successful reference sites for the basis of the HEP model increases the certainty of
expected benefits.

242

8.2

Plan Implementation

This section describes the remaining steps to potential authorization of the project by
Congress and implementation by USACE and the sponsor.

8.2.1

Report Completion

The draft feasibility report/EIS will be circulated for public and agency review for 45
days. A public meeting will be held to obtain comments from the public, agencies, and other
interested parties. After completion of the public review period, comments will be considered
and incorporated into the feasibility report/EIS, as appropriate. Comments received during the
public and agency review, as well as responses, will be included as an appendix to the final
report. The final feasibility report/EIS will be provided to any public agency that provided
comments on the draft report.

8.2.2

Report Approval

As required by NEPA, USACE would issue a notice of availability of the final report and
file the report with the USEPA. The USEPA notice of availability published in the Federal
Register starts a 30-day public review period. USACE Headquarters would receive comments
from Federal and State agencies, and complete its policy review of the final report.
After its review of the final feasibility report/EIS, including consideration of public, state
and agency comments, USACE Headquarters would prepare the Chief of Engineers Report.
This report would be submitted to the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, who
would coordinate with the Office of Management and Budget and submit the report to Congress.
Assuming that the non-Federal sponsor remains willing to cost-share the project on the agreed
terms, and assuming availability of Federal funding, detailed engineering studies and design
efforts for the selected plan would be initiated, pending future Federal authorization and
appropriations. A project management plan outlining Federal and non-Federal obligations,
requirements, tasks, costs, and schedule from design through construction would also be
prepared.
8.2.3

Project Authorization and Construction

If the project is authorized by Congress, construction funds must be appropriated for the
project by Congress before a Project Partnership Agreement (PPA) can be signed by the USACE
and sponsor and before project design and construction could begin.

243

8.2.4

Division of Responsibilities

Federal Responsibilities. The USACE would accomplish PED studies. After the PPA
is signed and the non-Federal sponsor provides the required cash contribution, lands, easements,
rights-of-way, relocations, and disposal areas the Federal Government would construct the
project.
Non-Federal Responsibilities. Under the PPA, the non-Federal sponsor would be
responsible to USACE for all costs and maintenance requirements.
Views of Non-Federal Sponsor. The non-Federal sponsor supports the Tentatively
Selected Plan.
Financial Capability of Sponsor. The non-Federal sponsor has indicated that it intends
to fund the project, pending further development through the final report and supporting
documents.
Project Cost-Sharing Agreements. After Congressional approval, a Design Agreement
must be executed between the USACE and the non-Federal sponsor in order to cost share the
development of detailed plans and specifications. Before construction is started, the Federal
Government and the non–Federal sponsor would execute a Project Partnership Agreement
(PPA). The PPA defines the responsibilities of the parties throughout the project’s design,
construction and operational phases and specifies the non-Federal sponsor’s required financial
and real estate contributions.

8.2.5

Schedule

If the project is authorized in 2016, construction activities could start as early as 2018.
Following is a schedule showing the approval and construction phases of the project, assuming
optimal funding.

During PED, some additional studies would be undertaken as part of developing detailed
designs for the project. Upon initiation of PED, any new information that has been collected by
others would be considered before undertaking these additional studies. These studies include:
•

Hydraulic modeling for project design;

•

Topographic surveys for project design;

•

Investigation (by the USACE Engineering Research and Development Center Waterways Experiment Station) of installation of sacrificial hay bales for costeffective erosion protection;

•

Cultural resource surveys;

•

Develop operation and maintenance manual.

CHAPTER 9 – RECOMMENDATIONS
The following text will be included in the final report, pending public review, policy
review, technical reviews, and subsequent comments and revisions:
I recommend that the recommended plan (Tentatively Selected Plan – Alternative 6) be
authorized for implementation, as a Federal project, with such modifications thereof as in the
discretion of the Commander, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, may be advisable. The estimated
first cost of the recommended plan is $29,018,000 and the estimated annual OMRR&R cost is to
be determined in the final report (October 2003 price levels). The Federal portion of the
estimated first cost is $18,933,000. The estimated fully funded Federal first cost, based on
projected inflation rates specified by Corps budget guidance, is $19,324,000. Federal
implementation of the recommended project would be subject to the non-Federal sponsor
agreeing to comply with applicable Federal laws and policies, including but not limited to:
a. Provide 35 percent of total project costs as further specified below:
1. Provide 35 percent of design costs in accordance with the terms of a design
agreement entered into prior to commencement of design work for the project;
2. Provide all lands, easements, and rights-of-way, including those required for
relocations, the borrowing of material, and the disposal of dredged or excavated
material; perform or ensure the performance of all relocations; and construct all
improvements required on lands, easements, and rights-of-way to enable the
disposal of dredged or excavated material all as determined by the Government to
be required or to be necessary for the construction, operation, and maintenance of
the project;
3. Provide, during construction, any additional funds necessary to make its total
contribution equal to 35 percent of total project costs;
b. Shall not use funds from other Federal programs, including any non-Federal contribution
required as a matching share therefor, to meet any of the non-Federal obligations for the
project unless the Federal agency providing the funds verifies in writing that the funds are
authorized to be used to carry out the project;
c. Prevent obstructions or encroachments on the project (including prescribing and
enforcing regulations to prevent such obstructions or encroachments) such as any new
developments on project lands, easements, and rights-of-way or the addition of facilities
which might reduce the outputs produced by the project, hinder operation and
maintenance of the project, or interfere with the project’s proper function;
d. Shall not use the project or lands, easements, and rights-of-way required for the project as
a wetlands bank or mitigation credit for any other project;
e. Comply with all applicable provisions of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real
246

Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, Public Law 91-646, as amended (42 U.S.C.
4601-4655), and the Uniform Regulations contained in 49 CFR Part 24, in acquiring
lands, easements, and rights-of-way required for construction, operation, and
maintenance of the project, including those necessary for relocations, the borrowing of
materials, or the disposal of dredged or excavated material; and inform all affected
persons of applicable benefits, policies, and procedures in connection with said Act;
f. For so long as the project remains authorized, operate, maintain, repair, rehabilitate, and
replace the project, or functional portions of the project, including any mitigation
features, at no cost to the Federal Government, in a manner compatible with the project’s
authorized purposes and in accordance with applicable Federal and State laws and
regulations and any specific directions prescribed by the Federal Government;
g. Give the Federal Government a right to enter, at reasonable times and in a reasonable
manner, upon property that the non-Federal sponsor owns or controls for access to the
project for the purpose of completing, inspecting, operating, maintaining, repairing,
rehabilitating, or replacing the project;
h. Hold and save the United States free from all damages arising from the construction,
operation, maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, and replacement of the project and any

1986, Public Law 99-662, as amended (33 U.S.C. 2213[j]), which provides that the
Secretary of the Army shall not commence the construction of any water resources
project or separable element thereof, until each non-Federal interest has entered into a
written agreement to furnish its required cooperation for the project or separable element.
The recommendations contained herein reflect the information available at this time and
current departmental policies governing formulation of individual projects. They do not reflect
program and budgeting priorities inherent in the formulation of a national Civil Works
construction program nor the perspective of higher review levels within the Executive Branch.
Consequently, the recommendations may be modified before they are transmitted to the
Congress as proposals for authorization and implementation funding. However, prior to
transmittal to the Congress, the sponsor, the States, interested Federal agencies, and other parties
will be advised of any modifications and will be afforded an opportunity to comment further.
