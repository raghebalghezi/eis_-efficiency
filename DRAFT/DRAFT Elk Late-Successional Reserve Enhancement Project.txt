Abstract: The Shasta-McCloud Management Unit of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest (Forest) is proposing
to restore and enhance the Elk Late-Successional Reserve (LSR) and restore dry meadow habitat and thin
stands in adjoining Matrix lands in and around Elk Flat. Treatments proposed on approximately 3,482 acres of
National Forest System Lands fall within five broad categories: 1) Forest Restoration; 2) Meadow
Restoration; 3) Fire Restoration and Fuels Reduction; 4) Hydrologic Function and Soils Restoration; and 5)
Transportation System Management and Decommissioning of Unauthorized Routes.
The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) considers four alternatives in detail. Alternative 1, the
Modified Proposed Action and the Forest Service preferred alternative, is the Proposed Action that was
scoped to the public with modifications. Alternative 4 is the no action alternative. Alternatives 2 and 3 were
developed in response to public comments received during scoping. Alternative 2 responds to concerns over
road construction. Since the project does not propose new Forest Transportation System (FTS) road
construction, it limits new temporary road construction. Thinning, meadow enhancement, and machine piling
treatments beyond ¼ mile from an existing FTS or inventoried Unauthorized Route (UA) would not be
implemented. Prescribed fire would still be conducted. Alternative 3 responds to the issue regarding
treatments in natural stands within Northern Spotted Owl (NSO) designated critical habit (CH). No
underburning or thinning would be implemented within natural stands in the CH. Plantations within the CH
would still be included in the project.

Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other relevant Federal and State laws and regulations. This
Environmental Impact Statement discloses the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts that
would result from the proposed action and alternatives. The document is organized into a Summary followed
by four chapters, Appendices, and Index:
Summary: The Summary provides a brief synopsis the key elements of the DEIS. The summary emphasizes
the major conclusions, key issues, and the decision to be made.
Chapter 1. Purpose and Need for Action: The chapter includes information on the history of the project
proposal, the purpose of and need for the project, and the agency’s proposal for achieving that purpose and
need. This section also details how the Forest Service informed the public of the proposal and how the public
responded.
Chapter 2. Alternatives, including the Proposed Action: This chapter provides a more detailed description
of the agency’s proposed action as well as alternative methods for achieving the stated purpose. These
alternatives were developed based on significant issues raised by the public and other agencies. This
discussion also includes resource protection measures. Finally, this section provides a summary table of the
environmental consequences associated with each alternative.
Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences: This chapter describes the
environmental effects of implementing the proposed action and other alternatives. This analysis is organized
by resource area, followed by required disclosures.
Chapter 4. Consultation and Coordination: This chapter provides a list of preparers and agencies consulted

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Summary
Introduction
The Forest Service has prepared this environmental impact statement in compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other relevant Federal and State laws and regulations. This
environmental impact statement discloses the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts that
would result from the proposed action and alternatives considered in detail.
Additional documentation, including more detailed analyses of project area resources, may be found in the
project planning record located in the online project record.

Location
Located in Siskiyou County, California, the Elk Late-Successional Reserve Enhancement project (Project or
Elk Project) is approximately 9 miles northeast of the community of McCloud and 70 miles northeast of
Redding.

Management Direction
Forest Plan land allocations of Late Successional Reserve, Matrix-Commercial Wood Products, and Riparian
Reserves comprise the 3,519-acre project analysis area (project area). The Project area includes the entire Elk
Flat LSR, which constitutes approximately 76 percent of the project area, plus adjoining Matrix-Commercial
Wood Products Emphasis lands in and around Elk Flat meadow. Riparian Reserves overlay the LSR and
Matrix lands along intermittent and ephemeral streams.
Late-successional reserves were established as part of the conservation strategy for species associated with
late-successional and old-growth forest ecosystems under the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP, 1994). They
maintain a functional late-successional and old-growth forest ecosystem and Shasta-Trinity National Forest
Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) standards and guidelines are designed to maintain and
protect these important ecosystems from large-scale losses due to uncharacteristic wildfire, insect and disease
epidemics, and major human impacts. Natural ecosystem processes such as gap dynamics, natural
regeneration, pathogenic fungal and insect activity, and low-intensity fire remain active (NWFP pp. Standards
and Guidelines, p. B-1) The Forest Plan includes standards and guidelines for LSR and the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest Late Successional Reserve Assessment (LSRA) provides LSR-specific guidance (Forest Plan
pp. 4.37, 4.43; LSRA p. 174).
Commercial Wood Products lands are managed to obtain an optimum timber yield of wood fiber within the
context of ecosystem management (Forest Plan p. 4.67). Riparian Reserves maintain or enhance riparian
areas, wildlife and fisheries habitat, and water quality by emphasizing streamside and wetland management
(Forest Plan p. 4.59).
Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) associated with adjoining private lands and structures overlays portions of
the project area. As part of the National Fire Plan, Federal agencies conduct fuels reduction in and around the
WUI to reduce the risk of stand-replacing wildfire to people, communities and natural resources while
restoring forest ecosystems to more closely match their historical characteristics.

Purpose and Need for Action and Proposed Actions
Existing Condition
The majority of forest stands in the Elk Flat LSR lack high quality late-successional habitat and are deficient
in structural diversity. High stand densities slow tree diameter growth through competition for limited

resources and impede the transition of early- and mid- successional forest to late-successional habitat. Most of
the project area is ponderosa pine forest with about five percent of the project in a mixed conifer forest type,
where increased elevation transitions from essentially flat ground. Pine plantations ranging in age from just
over 10 years to over 40 years old account for 25 percent of the project area. The Elk Flat Meadow is the only
non-forest vegetation type and accounts for 15 percent of the project area. The natural stands range in age
from 60 to 120 years old.
Although most of the project area is ponderosa pine type forest, white fir is often the dominant species in the
natural stands. Past harvest practices selectively removing the large, overstory pine and Douglas-fir, along
with decades of fire suppression have combined to encourage proliferation of white fir in the ponderosa pine
forests. Preferential removal of the large overstory trees left smaller, more shade tolerant trees such as white
fir.
Past fire suppression practices have encouraged unnaturally high density, heavy ladder fuels in the understory
and accumulation of brush. Fire suppression essentially removed a natural process from the landscape that
otherwise would periodically remove surface fuels, much of the young small diameter understory trees and a
portion of midstory and overstory trees. This transition in species composition occurs because white fir is
able to establish in a shaded understory environment and over time grow into the overstory. In contrast, pines
require more light and openings to successfully regenerate and do not survive well in a shaded understory
environment. The mixed conifer stands are similar in species composition to the ponderosa pine stands, but
generally contain a higher proportion of white fir in the overstory. Approximately 1,500 acres (54 percent of
land capable of producing late-successional forest) consists of this mid-successional forest of dense,
overstocked stands that are near or exceed site capability.
These over-crowded trees grow very slowly and stand vigor suffers. The existing conditions will delay or
prevent development into late-successional forest on approximately 1,500 acres of early and mid-successional
forested stands. The same conditions that affect successional development reduce the value of these forests for
connectivity to existing late-successional forest.
High densities bring high tree mortality rates. Approximately 10 percent of the Elk Flat LSR is currently
comprised of large pockets of standing dead and down trees that increase the risk of additional habitat loss
through increased fire hazard. Black stain root and Heterobasidion root disease, combined with the
overstocked conditions, prolonged drought and insect attacks also contribute to mortality. The high numbers
of standing dead trees pose an increased safety risk to visitors. The Forest Plan and LSRA define desired fuel
loadings as 5 tons per acre in the Matrix-Commercial Wood Products portion of the project area and 5 to 35
tons per acre in the LSR. Dead trees have fallen to the ground creating hazardous conditions approaching 60
tons per acre of surface fuels in some areas that may increase to 100 plus tons as tree mortality spreads in
coming years.
The Forest Service recognizes that natural disturbance is an important process within late-successional forest
ecosystems, but both human and natural processes have altered the disturbance regime in the Elk Flat LSR
such that without action, further habitat loss will result from density-related mortality, root disease, insect
attacks and predicted lethal fire effects. Without action, the ongoing stand-replacing events in the Elk Flat
LSR will continue, jeopardizing existing and future late-successional habitat. Nesting, roosting, foraging,
denning and dispersal habitat for late-successional dependent species would remain at risk, including
approximately 720 acres of designated critical habitat for the northern spotted owl.
Conifer encroachment is diminishing the dry meadow areas of the McCloud Flats including Elk Flat. The
meadow at Elk Flat is less than 50 percent of its extent in 1944 (USDA-FS, 2011 p. 69). Restoration of the
natural fire regime and fire return interval would contribute to maintenance of the dry meadow vegetation
conditions. Intermittent streams, such as Ash Creek and Swamp Creek, are recognized as providing
considerable ecological value, especially in the absence of perennial flow, to systems dependent on them.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Hydrologic processes, such as flooding, that maintained Elk Flat in the past are disrupted by lack of
connection to Swamp Creek and its intermittent channel system. Historical road systems have diverted flow
from Swamp Creek, concentrating flow and disconnecting it from spreading out over the meadow.
Ash Creek lacks riparian plant communities and floodplain interaction. Scattered riparian vegetation is limited
to discontinuous locations where sunlight can reach the forest floor along Ash Creek, but is absent along
Swamp Creek as well as other smaller intermittent channels. Woody debris recruitment is a necessary
component in channels; however, input in large amounts is causing woody debris dams and channel widening.
An accelerated rate of bank erosion along Ash Creek, where the accumulation of woody debris is high, diverts
water around log jams.
Hardwoods have a high value to wildlife for foraging, nesting, denning and resting, as well as providing
habitat for prey species. Aspen and California black oak occur as a scattered, very minor vegetation
component within the project area, generally in the understory at a reduced abundance and decreased vigor.
Fire exclusion has allowed white fir understories to become established in many stands. As white fir develops,
it eventually overtops and shades out hardwoods.
There are approximately 6.5 miles of unauthorized routes in the project area. Unauthorized routes were not
designed as part of the Forest Transportation System (FTS). They are not maintained and are not open to legal
vehicular access, are not shown on the Forest’s Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM). Unauthorized routes often
present a potential resource concern for soils, vegetation, erosion, and wildlife. A 0.1-mile segment of an
unauthorized route accesses a popular dispersed recreation site on the edge of Elk Flat meadow. There is no
legal vehicular access to this long-established use area.

Purpose and Need for Action and Proposed Action
In comparing the desired conditions with existing conditions, the Forest Service identified one primary and
five secondary purposes for action. To meet the needs identified for these six purposes, the Forest proposes
activities within five broad categories of actions: forest restoration, fire restoration and fuels reduction,
meadow restoration, hydrologic function and soils restoration, and transportation management and
unauthorized route decommissioning. The six purpose and needs, with the corresponding objectives and
proposed actions are:

Primary Purpose and
Need

Objectives and Proposed Actions

4. Hardwoods - Retain
hardwoods as a stand
component at density
levels commensurate with
development of latesuccessional stands

Objectives – Assure hardwoods thrive and remain in stands at naturally
occurring levels.
Actions - Forest restoration, fire restoration, aspen restoration adaptive
management treatments:
- thinning with oak release (about 30 acres in total) and aspen release
(about 24 acres in total)
- fire restoration to maintain natural processes within the oak and
aspen release areas
- aspen restoration adaptive management to monitor success and
assure aspen restoration if initial release fails to stimulate suckering

5. Hydrologic Function
Restoration - Increase
Streamflow, Raise Water
Table Elevation and
Improve Water Quality
and Vegetation Conditions
within Riparian Reserves
Associated with Elk Flat,
Ash and Swamp Creeks
and Their Tributaries.

Objectives – Correct floodplain function, improve streambank stability,
improve health of riparian vegetation, and return the natural fire interval in
riparian reserves.
Actions - Hydrologic function restoration
- decommissioning of unauthorized routes that intersect stream
channels, floodplain and stream recontouring on approximately 8.1
acres
- recontouring stream channel and floodplains, add embedded woody
debris on approximately 7.2 acres
- thinning in Riparian Reserves to promote riparian vegetation on
approximately 211 acres (previously included in the natural stand
thinning, under P&N #1)
- revegetation in the Riparian Reserves on approximately 94.9 acres
- underburning through riparian reserves underburning will promote
riparian vegetation health.

6. Transportation
Management - Manage
the National Forest
Transportation System
and Decommission
Unauthorized Routes

Objectives – Restore unauthorized routes and provide legal access to an
established dispersed site.
Actions – Transportation system management
- decommissioning 6.4 miles of unauthorized routes
- adding 0.1 mile of existing unauthorized route to the managed road
system

Figure Appendix E-1 and Figure Appendix E-2 show the maps of the Proposed Actions. Thinning in natural
stands will leave approximately 60 to 100 trees per acre, depending on the average size of the trees. Higher
densities will be retained where wildlife rest/roost clumps of larger trees combine with smaller trees (less than
10 inches DBH) to provide age and structural diversity that contributes to habitat function. Lower densities
would be applied in areas that are primarily dominated by ponderosa pine, higher densities would be retained
in mixed conifer, and white fir dominated stands. Instead of applying one target density across a stand, the
variable density thinning prescription would help promote within-stand structural variation that contributes to
habitat function for late-successional species, while providing the needed growing space, nutrients and water
for the remaining trees.
All thinning treatments incorporate site-specific prescription elements designed to enhance late-successional
habitat. Unthinned patches composing at least 10% of treated stands are excluded from silviculture treatments
as unthinned patches. Areas in the LSR that provide relatively large blocks of late-successional habitat will
have no or moderate thinning treatments. These areas are not currently at risk, or are at risk but are being left
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

Elk Flat Late-Successional Reserve Enhancement

untreated to maintain current nesting, roosting, denning and foraging habitat for the northern spotted owl,
fisher and northern goshawk.
Radial thinning surrounding individual large pines is incorporated to increase retention of these valuable trees
in stands. Small (less than 2-acres) group selections, replanted with non-host (for black stain root disease)
species, will be inserted to break up disease centers and provide structural and species diversity. Conifer
removal surrounding oak and aspen trees will encourage hardwood species retention, health and vigor.
Thinning variations around insect or disease centers will remove symptomatic trees and create a buffer to
prevent root-to-root contact between infected and non-infected pine. Light level increases on the forest floor
inhibit black stain root disease progression; and regenerating mortality areas with a mix of non-host conifer
species as well as widely spaced pine would discourage reinfection. Small group selections would regenerate
pine in areas of dense, homogenous white fir and increase age diversity in older plantations.
While most conifers would be removed outside unthinned patches in the portion of Elk Flat meadow, in the
LSR land allocation, largest, predominant pines would be retained. More conifers would be retained along the
edges to “feather” the meadow treatment into surrounding stands.
Prescribed fire through underburning would be utilized every 5 to 10 years for 2 to 3 entries across the project
area to return fire to the ecosystem. Where surface fuels are particularly heavy, machine piling and pile
burning would occur before the first underburn entry.
Recontouring of existing disturbed areas impacting stream channels and floodplains will help return natural
floodplain function and elevate the water table at Elk Flat. Thinning in Riparian Reserves will increase
sunlight for riparian vegetation, regulate woody debris entry into stream channels, and strengthen
streambanks.
One 0.3 mile segment of an existing road needs reconstruction, otherwise NTS roads used in the project
would be maintained. Maintenance level-1 roads would be opened for the project, and then closed again at the
conclusion. 6.4 miles of unauthorized routes would be decommissioned and 0.1 miles would be added to the
NTS to access the dispersed area at Elk Flat.

Public Involvement
Scoping
The Notice of Intent (NOI) was published in the Federal Register on February 28, 2013 (USDA-FS, 2013).
The NOI asked for public comment on the proposal by April 1, 2013. In addition, as part of the public
involvement process, the agency prepared a scoping document that was mailed to interested individuals,
organizations and agencies on February 14, 2013 (USDA-FS, 2013b). A Notice of Intent was published in the
Redding Record Searchlight on February 27, 2013 and March 3, 2013. Public meetings were held March 5
and March 26, 2013 in McCloud and Mt. Shasta. The Forest Service received 11 comment letters or emails.
All comments were reviewed. Issues were identified from public scoping comments. Issues are statements of
cause and effect, linking environmental effects to actions. Issues serve to highlight effects or unintended
consequences that may occur from the proposed action and alternatives, giving opportunities during the
analysis to reduce adverse effects and compare trade-offs for the decision maker and public to understand
(FSH 1909.15 Ch. 12.4).

Key Issues
The Forest Service sorted the issues into two groups: key and non-key issues. Key issues were defined as
those directly or indirectly caused by implementing the proposed action. Non-key were identified as those that
are: 1) outside the scope of the proposed action; 2) already decided by law, regulation, Forest Plan, or other
xii

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

higher level decision; 3) irrelevant to the decision to be made; or 4) conjectural and not supported by
scientific or factual evidence. Other Comments were non-issues (e.g. no cause effect) or were identified as a
question or a general statement (general in nature).
The Forest Service identified the following key issues during scoping:
Issue 1 – Large Trees and Snags
Large tree and snag removal and group selection logging would directly harm forest health and latesuccessional ecosystems in Late-Successional Reserves, Riparian Reserves and Critical Habitat; prevent
rather than facilitates forest succession processes; and is not consistent with the Northwest Forest Plan.
Issue 2 – Road Construction
Road construction directly harms forest health and wildlife and results in long-term impacts to soil health
and productivity.
Issue 3 – Critical Habitat
Treatments within designated critical habitat for the northern spotted owl violate the 2011 Revised
Recovery Plan and the 2012 Final Critical Habitat Rule for the Northern Spotted Owl.
Issue 4 – Mushroom Collection in Elk Flat
There will be negative impacts to Boletus mushroom growth and collection activities within Elk Flat.
Issue 5 – Machine Piling
Machine piling has disproportionately harmful impacts on watershed and soil resources.

Alternatives
Key Issues 2 and 3 prompted development of alternatives to the proposed action considered in detail. Issues 4
and 5 prompted development of alternatives considered but not in detail. Analysis of concerns brought
forward in Issue 1 is included in Chapter 3. Alternatives 1, 2, 3 and 4 are considered in detail. Details of the
Alternatives are provided in Chapter 2. Summaries of actions by alternatives are provided in Table 22 through
Table 26 (pp. 77 to 81) and Maps are in Appendix D.

Alternative 1-Modified Proposed Action
Alternative 1 is the Modified Proposed Action and the Agency Preferred Alternative. Alternative 1 is also the
environmentally preferred alternative in the long term. It is a slightly modified version of what was scoped as
the Proposed Action. Appendix H describes the incremental changes between the Proposed Action and
Alternative 1. Alternative 1 Proposed Action is summarized above in the Purpose and Need for Action and
Proposed Actions starting on page vii. The proposed treatments would be implemented through a combination
of commercial and non-commercial thinning using mechanical and hand methods.

Alternative 2-No New Temporary Road Construction Other Than Those Required for
Landing Use/Access
Alternative 2 responds Key Issue 2 regarding temporary road construction impacts on forest health and
connectivity within the LSR. It is similar to Alternative 1 with the exception that no temporary roads would
be constructed to complete project activities other than to access landings (typically, a landing “driveway” is
about 200 feet). Project activities would be completed utilizing the existing FTS roads and existing
unauthorized routes in the project area. Alternative 1 identified the need for approximately 2.9 miles of new
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

xiii

Elk Flat Late-Successional Reserve Enhancement

temporary road to complete thinning activities and no new permanent road construction was proposed. While
the total acreage between Alternatives 1 and 2 treated is the same, the difference is between the treatment
types. This alternative reduces the ability to mechanically treat approximately 103 acres with a corresponding
decrease in needed landings. Hydrologic function restoration completed through mechanical means also drops
slightly as access to the work areas decreases. All other project design criteria, thinning, fuels treatments, and
road actions are the same as Alternative 1. Despite no new construction of temporary roads under Alternative
2 other than what is needed to access landings, the total project area would still be underburned and in
accordance with RPMs. Maintenance and other actions relating to the FTS system would be the same under
Alternative 2 as Alternative 1; however, the maintenance would be less intensive due to reduced hauling.

Alternative 3-No Treatment of Natural Stands within Designated Critical Habitat for
the Northern Spotted Owl
Alternative 3 is responsive to the issue regarding the assertion that treatments within designated critical
habitat for the northern spotted owl (NSO) violate the 2011 Revised Recovery Plan and the 2012 Final
Critical Habitat Rule. Alternative 3 is the environmentally preferred alternative in the short-term. Under
Alternative 3, no NSO critical habitat would be treated, with the exception of the thinning and other
mechanical treatments proposed in seven plantations (7, 12, 13, 14, 208, part of 15, and part of 6). No units
within critical habitat would be underburned under Alternative 3. In comparison to Alternative 1, the
plantations in critical habitat that are prescribed for machine piling and pile burning would require additional
fireline construction to provide a barrier between the pile burning areas and the surrounding untreated natural
stands. Alternative 3 treats 270 fewer acres with silvicultural harvest than Alternative 1. All other project
design criteria, thinning and fuels treatments and road actions outside of critical habitat are the same as under
Alternative 1.

Alternative 4-No Action
Alternative 4 is the no action alternative. The analysis of the no action alternative provides reviewers a
baseline to compare the magnitude of environmental effects of the action alternatives. Alternative 4 is the
continuation of the existing condition, current management and ongoing activities in the project area. Current
management and ongoing activities in the project area, as permitted under past, current or potential future
NEPA may include road maintenance, hazard tree felling, fuelwood collection, over-snow vehicle use
associated with the Pilgrim Creek Snowmobile Park, dispersed recreation (e.g., sightseeing, hunting), forest
products collection and other permitted special uses. Additional thinning in unit 401 under the Pilgrim
Vegetation Management Project is pending. This analysis includes modeling of stand growth and fire behavior
that is predicted if no new action is taken in the project area. Under no action, no treatments or road actions
would be implemented to accomplish the purpose and need and project resource objectives.

Alternatives Considered but Not in Detail
Five additional alternatives, as well as the original Proposed Action, were considered but not in detailed
analysis. These Alternatives were either duplicative (the original Proposed Action), or did not adequately meet
the Purpose and Need for Action or would cause more harm to the environment. Alternatives considered but
not in detail include: Alternative 5 – No Treatment in Elk Flat Meadow to preserve Boletus mushroom
habitat; Alternative 6 – Limit Harvest to Trees Less Than 10 Inches in Diameter; Alternative 7 – Eliminate the
Use of Machine Piling within Treatment Units and Substitute Hand Piling; Alternative 8 – Limit Harvest to
Trees Less Than 20 Inches in Diameter with the Elk Flat Late-Successional Reserve; and Alternative 9-No
New Temporary Road Construction. Chapter 2 provides a detailed discussion of these Alternatives and why
they were not considered in detail starting on page 117.

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Conclusions
This DEIS discloses the environmental effects of four alternatives, including no action. The no action
alternative is included to provide a baseline to compare the environmental effects resulting from
implementing one of the action alternatives.
Table 29 in Chapter 2, starting on page 94, provides a summary of the effects described in Chapter 3.
Table 29 summarizes effects as they relate to the five Key Issues, six Purpose and Need statements, and other
resource effects. In some cases, effects between the action alternatives are similar. The project is consistent
with the Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan and applicable laws, executive
orders, and policies.

Effects Relative to Purpose and Need for Action
All action alternatives would meet the project purpose and need to varying degrees. Alternative 1 meets it to
the highest degree. In some cases, Alternatives 2 and 3 are equal to Alternative 1 but otherwise provide a
reduced response.

Primary Purpose
1. Risk Reduction in Early, Mid and Late-Successional Habitat and Increased Stand Resilience
to Disturbance (Objectives I and III of the LSRA) (LSRA pp. 174-179) 1
Alternative 1 provides the most risk reduction through the most extensive treatments for insect and disease
activity, the most acres treated for stand density reduction, and the most fuels reduction and the greatest extent
of fire regime restoration. Alternative 1 provides the highest likelihood of stand resilience immediately post
project through the next twenty years. Alternative 2 is the next most effective response followed by
Alternative 3. Alternative 3 leaves the natural stands within critical habitat at a similar risk to No Action and
the Purpose and Need for Action would not be met within those stands.

Secondary Purposes
2. Accelerate Development of Late-Successional and Old-Growth Forest Characteristics
(LSRA Objective II) and Promote Late-Successional Habitat Connectivity (LSRA Objective
IV)
All action alternatives thin plantations and meet this Purpose and Need for action. Alternative 2 treats 14
fewer acres of plantations than Alternatives 1 and 3. No action jeopardizes the potential of development of
late-successional habitat. Alternative 1 also treats the most natural stands that may also be in a dense midsuccessional condition that jeopardizes development of late-successional habitat. Alternative 2 is slightly less
effective than Alternative 1. Alternative 3 leaves mid-successional natural stands in critical habitat untreated,
even with prescribed fire, leaving those stands in the same condition as No Action. The Purpose and Need for
Action would not be met within the critical habitat natural stands under Alternative 3. All three action
alternatives respread old windrows in two plantations to restore soil conditions and productivity.

1

In this context the LSRA is referring to young stands and plantations (up to 12.9” DBH) as early seral (LSRA p. Appdx.
E) and reducing the risk of setting these young stands back successional through large-scale disturbance. The objective
does not include areas that are not capable or are most valuable as early-seral habitat such as meadow.

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

Elk Flat Late-Successional Reserve Enhancement

3. Restore Meadow Habitat in Elk Flat
Alternatives 1 and 3 restore Elk Flat meadow in full. Alternative 2 has a 25-acre reduction in conifer removal,
but still provides for return of fire to the ecosystem. No Action jeopardizes retention of the early seral
meadow habitat at Elk Flat.

4. Retain Hardwoods as a Stand Component at Density Levels Commensurate with
Development of Late-Successional Stands
All three action alternatives fully restore aspen. In alternative 1 oak release would occur as a component of
thinning treatments in stands totaling 567 acres. Alternative 2 has 33 fewer acres and Alternative 3 has 148
fewer acres of stands treated with an oak release component, compared to Alternative 1. No action and the
untreated areas of Alternatives 2 and 3 do not meet this Purpose and Need for Action.

5. Increase Streamflow, Raise Water Table Elevation and Improve Water Quality and
Vegetation Conditions within Riparian Reserves Associated with Elk Flat, Ash and Swamp
Creeks and Their Tributaries
All three action alternatives meet this Purpose and Need by restoring riparian vegetation and floodplains in
the Riparian Reserves and treating stands to improve resilience to disturbance and attain all of the Aquatic
Conservation Objectives (ACS). Thinning within the Riparian Reserves favors diversity, health and vigor of
riparian vegetation, regulates input of woody debris, and enhances instream structure. Alternatives 2 and 3
have slightly reduced benefits because of fewer acres treated. No Action does not meet this Purpose and Need
for Action; current trends in hydrology would continue degrading the watershed and riparian areas and ACS
Objectives would not be met.

6. Manage the National Forest Transportation System and Decommission Unauthorized
Routes
All three action alternatives meet this Purpose and Need for Action. They decommission 6.4 miles of
unauthorized routes and provide access to the dispersed site at Elk Flat.

Effects Relative to Key Issues
Issue 1 – Large Trees and Snags
All action alternatives leave large predominant and dominant trees but decrease some trees over 24 inch DBH
for density reduction in dense mid and late successional stands. Modeling results at year 20 project there
would be considerably more trees per acre over 24 inches than presently exist, but do not account for insect
and disease mortality. Observed mortality in the project area and research on density related pine mortality
both indicate that higher numbers of trees per acre over 24 inches DBH are very unlikely to develop or persist
over time. Density reduction thinning in all action alternatives would promote the resilience and survival of
the residual large trees and meet the Purpose and Need.
Snags would be retained in all action alternatives except where hazard abatement is needed for human safety
considerations. An estimate of 20 percent reduction was used to reflect snags removed for hazard abatement,
but given the intent to retain snags as feasible, a higher proportion may be retained.

Issue 2 – Road Construction
No alternatives construct new FTS roads. All action alternatives decommission 6.4 miles of existing
inventoried unauthorized routes. The No Action alternative does not decommission the routes. All three action
alternatives construct new temporary road that is decommissioned at the end of the project. While Alternative
2 was developed in response to this issue, Alternative 3 has slightly less estimated miles of new temporary

xvi

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

road construction due to the decreased thinning acres. Alternative 1 constructs 2.9 miles, Alternative 2 1.6
miles (to access landings only), and Alternative 3 includes 1.5 miles.

Issue 3 – [NSO] Critical Habitat
A temporary reduction in the quantity and quality of northern spotted owl foraging habitat designated as
critical habitat (PCE 3) will occur under Alternatives 1 and 2. PCE 3 will be degraded (habitat quality
reduced) on approximately 224 acres, and will be downgraded to dispersal habitat (PCE 4) on approximately
46 acres under Alternatives 1 and 2. The overall habitat function in the affected stands will not be removed.
The treatments will affect less than one percent of the ECS-3 Critical Habitat Subunit and are considered
discountable in terms of reducing the overall intended function of this Critical Habitat Subunit. Degraded
foraging habitat still functions at the pre-treatment habitat level since important habitat elements are
maintained in the post-treatment condition. Degraded habitat generally returns to its pre-treatment quality
levels over 20 years. These are time estimates barring any events such as epidemic insect or disease
outbreaks, or uncharacteristic stand replacing fires that can reset the seral stage in a stand, or part of a stand.
Alternative 3 treats 152 acres of Critical Habitat in plantations. There will be no reduction of nesting/roosting
habitat or high quality foraging habitats treated by any alternative, and no treatments or effects will occur
within suitable habitat designated as critical habitat under Alternative 3. Alternative 3 does not have shortterm adverse effects, but meets the Final Critical Habitat Rule on 472 fewer acres than Alternatives 1 and 3.
316 acres (44%) of the PCE3 is maintained in current condition. All the PCE2/PCE3 remain at risk of loss
from ongoing density-related mortality and the potential for uncharacteristic wildfire as the current trends
would continue. All 120 acres of nesting/roosting are also maintained under current trends. At the project
scale, 12 fewer acres of PCE1 would be treated to encourage progression to PCE3/PCE4.
No Action (Alternative 4) would the continue current trends leaving critical and existing and developing latesuccessional habitat elements vulnerable to loss from overstocking, insect and disease outbreaks and a
potential reduction or removal of habitat or connectivity within 40 to 60% of the project area CH from
potential passive crown fire.

Issue 4 - Boletus Mushroom Collection in Elk Flat [Boletus Habitat in Elk Flat]
All action alternatives reduce current or potential boletus mushroom habitat at Elk Flat through Meadow
Enhancement treatment designed to restore and maintain early-seral meadow habitat in response to Purpose
and Need #3. All action alternatives retain unthinned patches that would retain some existing boletus habitat
within Elk Flat meadow. Alternative 2 includes 25 fewer acres (at 354 acres of Meadow Enhancement) than
Alternatives 1 and 3 (379 acres).

Issue 5 – Machine Piling
Alternative 3 includes the least amount of machine piling at up to 1,365 acres. Alternative 2 has up to 1,402
acres and Alternative 1 has the most at 1,461 acres. All units are expected to meet soil quality standards at the
completion of the project. Existing detrimental compaction in four units would be alleviated. No action would
leave the existing compaction. Effects to watershed health are mostly short-term disturbance to water-holding
properties.

Decision to be Made
The Forest Supervisor is the deciding official and will decide whether to implement Alternative 1- Modified
Proposed Action, or implement one of the other action alternatives that meet the project purpose and need, or
take no action.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 1. Purpose of and Need for Action
Introduction
The Forest Service has prepared this environmental impact statement in compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other relevant Federal and State laws and regulations. This
environmental impact statement discloses the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts that
would result from the proposed action and alternatives considered in detail.
Additional documentation, including more detailed analyses of project area resources, may be found in the
project planning record located in the online project record.

Background
Many of the past century’s traditional approaches to land management and increasing ecosystem health
problems have contributed to deficient late-successional habitat across the landscape and to more severe
wildland fires. The Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP, 1994) calls for timely management decisions to ensure
better results in projects that reduce the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire and restore forest health. Authorized
under the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA), this project is designed to move the landscape
toward the desired condition for the Elk Flat Late-Successional Reserve (LSR). Project design is guided by
the visions, goals, strategies and design criteria embodied in the NWFP, the Shasta-Trinity National Forest
Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan, 1995) (including Management Areas 2 and 3), and the
Forest-Wide Late-Successional Reserve Assessment (LSRA, 1999). There are no specific objectives for the
Elk Flat LSR in the LSRA; however, the project is consistent with general objectives from the LSRA. It is
also consistent with or incorporates recommendations from:
•

the Forest Plan Aquatic Conservation Strategy (ACS) objectives,

•

Located within the California Cascades Province (Agee, 1993), 75 percent of the 3,519 acre project area is
classified as Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest. Southeast of Elk Flat, stands transition to a drier East
Side Pine forest type. To the west and northwest, approximately 10 percent of the project area is classified as
Sierra Mixed Conifer (SMC) 2 and 15 percent as perennial grassland (PGS) under the California Wildlife
Habitat Relationship (CWHR) System (CDFW, 2008). 3
Average elevation throughout most of the project area is 4,150 feet, and as lands transition from essentially
flat to gentle predominantly east facing slopes, elevation increases to 4,400 feet. While the CWHR classifies
the majority of the project area as ponderosa pine type, field reviews show there is a variety of species classes,
primarily due to lack of fire to reduce white fir and cedar regeneration. Field reviews also show there are
older remnant (or predominant) Douglas fir, white fir, cedar and sugar and ponderosa pine trees (see cover,
Figure 6 p. 18)
The ponderosa pine-dominated natural stands are primarily within the eastern and southeastern extent of the
project area. It is also a stand component in other lower elevation portions of the project area in mixed-conifer
pine, and white fir-pine stands. The SMC forest type increases where there is an increase in elevation;
dominated by white fir, incense cedar, ponderosa and sugar pine, and higher incidences of Douglas fir and
black oak. Plantations range in age from just over 10 years to over 40 years, and account for 25 percent of the
project area. The majority of the 20 to 40+ year-old plantations are ponderosa pine, with younger plantations
having a wider range of species. The Elk Flat meadow is the only non-forest vegetation type and accounts for
15 percent of the project area.

2

The name “Sierra Mixed Conifer” should not be confused by the fact that the project falls within the Southern Cascade
Mountain range. The SMC vegetation type is mapped within mid to higher elevations throughout much of the central
North-South axis of the State of California including the Sierra Nevada and Southern Cascade mountain ranges.
3

The CWHR crosswalks to the CalVeg classification system and is used in the Forest’s 2007 existing vegetation layer to
display reginal dominance types. Those types within the project area break down further into ponderosa pine (PP), mixed
conifer fir (MF), ponderosa pine-white fir (PW) and mixed conifer pine (MP). Table 2 above only lists the CWHR
vegetation types for the project area as a general reference. More information is available at

Based on Common Stand Exams completed in 2007 and additional fieldwork, measured tree ages in the
natural stands ranges from 55 to 95 years with a minor scattered component of older remnant trees (see
definition of predominant tree in the Glossary, p. 257). Stand ages range between 60 to 100 years in some
stands and 80 to 120 years in others (USDA-FS, 2007). Younger understory trees are present to varying
degrees but in most instances are strongly suppressed by the mid and overstory, notably in homogenous
pockets of white fir.

Management Direction
Land allocations (Table 3 and Figure 2) and management areas from the Forest Plan include:
LSR - Late-successional reserves (LSR) associated with the Elk Flat LSR (designated as RC-360 in
the LSRA (LSRA, 1999) comprise approximately 87 percent of the project area (3,074 acres).
Matrix – 445 acres of Matrix lands with commercial wood products (CWP) emphasis.
Riparian Reserves –240 acres of Riparian Reserves associated with Ash and Swamp Creeks and
their tributaries overlay the Matrix and LSR allocations. Ash Creek bisects the Elk Flat LSR, flowing
intermittently from late spring through early fall. The ephemeral channel of Swamp Creek cuts across
the eastern section of the project area within and along Elk Flat meadow. Riparian Reserves overlay
other land allocations and do not represent additional acres.

Late-Successional Reserves Allocation: Prescription VII-Late-Successional
Reserves and Threatened, Endangered, and Selected Sensitive Species.
Late-Successional Reserves (LSRs) were established in the Forest Plan and are intended to provide oldgrowth forest habitat, provide for populations of species that are associated with late-successional forests, and
to help ensure that late-successional species diversity will be conserved. Management direction in LSRs is to
protect and enhance conditions of late-successional forest ecosystems, which serve as habitat for latesuccessional and old-growth related species, including the northern spotted owl (NWFP, 1994 p. 8) (Forest
Plan pp. 4-37 to 4-43) (LSRA, 1999 p. 1).
Protection of LSRs includes reducing the risk of large-scale disturbance, including stand-replacing fire, insect
and disease epidemics, and major human-caused impacts (LSRA p. 1). Both protection and enhancement can
include application of silviculture and other treatments designed to reduce the risk of loss and/or accelerate
development of late-successional stand characteristics (Forest Plan pp. 4-37 to 4-39), (LSRA, 1999 pp. 174203). The LSRA further describes that the overriding goal of management in LSRs is not only to maintain and
protect, but also restore, conditions of late-successional forest ecosystems. Inherent in meeting this goal is the
contribution towards the recovery of listed and petitioned late-successional associated species and treatments
designed to provide these habitat conditions through time support the objectives for LSRs (LSRA, 1999 p.
174).
Forest Plan goals describe that the network of LSRs is designated to provide for a viable population of
northern spotted owls throughout their historic range (Forest Plan pp. 3-27). The Forest Plan adopts the
NWFP as the Federal contribution to the recovery of the northern spotted owl. The Forest also expects the
network of land allocations that are withdrawn from active timber management 4 (e.g., wilderness,
administratively withdrawn areas, wild and scenic rivers, others) to provide habitat adequate to maintain
viable, well-distributed populations of federally listed or proposed and Forest Service sensitive species (pp. 327). Where active management occurs in Late-Successional Reserves and Riparian Reserves, standards and
guidelines and project design features for snags, logs, hardwoods, biodiversity and protection and
enhancement of habitats also contribute towards this goal.
The Forest Plan standards and guidelines direct that the Forest maintain or enhance habitat for threatened,
endangered, and sensitive (TE&S) species consistent with individual species recovery plans (pp. 4-30),
though recovery plans themselves are not regulatory.

Relationship to Other Plans
Late-Successional Reserve Assessment
The LSR allocation is managed under Forest Plan Prescription VII, Late-Successional Reserves and
Threatened, Endangered, and Selected Sensitive Species. In accordance with NWFP Standards and Guidelines
(NWFP, 1994 pp. C-11), the Forest prepared the Late-Successional Reserve Assessment (LSRA). The purpose
of the LSRA was to develop management strategies for the LSRs, determine their sustainability, and provide
information to decision makers for managing LSRs to meet Forest Plan goals and objectives. It describes four
objectives that guide development and application of treatments in LSRs.

Including those land allocations such as Late-Successional Reserves or Riparian Reserves that may be treated to
reduce the risk of losing habitat, to enhance habitat, and to contribute to Aquatic Conservation Strategy objectives but that
do not regularly contribute to allowable sale quantity.

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

The Elk Flat LSR is described as a priority for treatment objective II, which is to “promote the continued
development of late-successional forests” (LSRA, 1999 p. 178). The project is also designed to meet the other
three treatment objectives (p. 175):
I. Protect existing late-successional habitat from threats (of habitat loss) that occur inside and outside
LSRs.
III. Protect mid and early-successional vegetation from loss to large-scale disturbance events.
IV. Promote connectivity of late-successional habitat within LSRs.
As described in the LSRA and NWFP, where levels of risk in an LSR are particularly high, they may require
additional measures. Consequently, management activities designed to reduce risk levels are encouraged in
those LSRs even if a portion of the activities must take place in current late-successional habitat. While risk
reduction efforts should generally be focused on young stands, activities in older stands may be appropriate if:
1. the proposed management activities will clearly result in greater assurance of long-term
maintenance of habitat,
2. the activities are clearly needed to reduce risks, and
3. the activities will not prevent the LSR from playing an effective role in the objectives for which
they were established (NWFP pp. C-13) (LSRA, 1999 p. 174).

Matrix Allocation: Prescription VIII-Commercial Wood Products (CWP)
Commercial Wood Products lands are managed to obtain an optimum timber yield of wood fiber within the
context of ecosystem management. Investments will be made in road construction, fuels management,
reforestation, vegetation management, and timber stand improvement. Timber stands will be managed to
obtain optimum growth and yields using cultural practices (Forest Plan pp. 4-67).

Riparian Reserves Allocation: Prescription IX-Riparian Management
Riparian Reserve standards and guidelines apply to all Forest lands where Riparian Reserves overlap other
allocations. Riparian Reserves are managed under Prescription IX, Riparian Management to maintain or
enhance riparian areas, wildlife and fisheries habitat, and water quality by emphasizing streamside and
wetland management (Forest Plan pp. 4-59). All management activities must meet or not prevent attainment
of the Aquatic Conservation Strategy (ACS) Objectives (NWFP pp. B-9, 10) (Forest Plan, 1995 pp. 4-53).
Riparian Reserve widths are determined by the category of stream or waterbody and are established during
the watershed analysis process. Two watershed analyses (WA) have been completed that include the Elk
project area (USDA-FS, 2011; USDA-FS, 2012).

Other Designations
Wildland-Urban Interface
Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) as defined in the Forest’s Fire Reference System (USDA-FS, 2015)
encompasses approximately 1,135 acres of the project area (see Appendix D, Maps, Figure Appendix E-8).
The policy of providing for firefighter and public safety is implicit in considering all fire and fuels desired
conditions, regardless of land allocation and management direction (USDA-FS, 2009).

Northern Spotted Owl Critical Habitat
The FWS revised critical habitat for the NSO on December 4, 2012 and the Rule was finalized January 3,
2013 (USDI-FWS, 2012). There are 720 acres in the project area, part of Unit 8, Subunit 3-East Cascades
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

South [ECS-3]. Critical habitat is located in the western portion of the Elk Flat LSR; it is not designated in the
surrounding private lands or the project’s ponderosa pine-dominated stands or meadow at Elk Flat.
The Final Rule describes the East Cascades Unit (pp. 71930-71931) and ECS-3 subunit. ECS-3 consists of
112,179 acres of land managed by the Forest Service under the NWFP, and Forests that overlay the subunit
(Shasta-Trinity, Klamath, Modoc). Its function is to “provide demographic support in an area of sparsely
distributed, high-quality habitat and Federal land and to provide population connectivity between subunits to
the north and south”. Special management considerations in ECS-3 are “required to address threats to the
essential physical or biological features of critical habitat from current and past timber harvest, losses due to
wildfire and the effects on vegetation from fire exclusion, and competition with barred owls” (p. 71931). The
Final Rule states: “the increase and enhancement of NSO habitat in this subunit is especially important for
providing essential connectivity between currently occupied areas to support the successful dispersal of
NSOs, and may also help to buffer NSOs from competition with the barred owl” (p. 71931).
As with the Recovery Plan, the Final Rule describes that in the drier, more fire-prone regions of the NSOs
range, habitat conditions will likely be more dynamic, and active management may be required to reduce the
risk to essential physical or biological features of critical habitat from fire, insects, disease and climate
change. It also describes that long-term NSO recovery could benefit from forest management actions that
restore or maintain ecological processes and resilience (USDI-FWS, 2012 p. 71908).
While the Rule recommends active management, it also describes that treatment activities should be focused
on lower quality habitat with lower relative habitat sustainability and be based on ecological restoration and
application of ecological forestry principles, or be focused where ecological conditions are most departed
from the natural or desired range of variability. It recommends:
1. Following the NWFP guidelines and focusing on lands in or outside LSRs where uncharacteristic
disturbance has occurred, or where the landscape management goal is to restore more natural or
resilient forest ecosystems;
2. Avoiding or minimizing activities in active NSO territories (or high-quality habitat in those
territories), and;
3. Using an active adaptive forest management framework to assess effects of activities on NSOs
and their prey (USDI-FWS, 2012 pp. 71882-71883).

Other
The project area is not in a congressionally designated or inventoried roadless area, a Key Watershed (Forest
Plan p. 4.59) or a municipal watershed.

Revised Recovery Plan for Northern Spotted Owl
The Revised Recovery Plan for the Northern Spotted Owl (Recovery Plan) was released in June 2011 (USDIFWS, 2011). The Recovery Plan identifies primary range-wide threats to the northern spotted owl (NSO) as
competition with barred owls; ongoing loss of spotted owl habitat as a result of timber harvest, habitat loss or
degradation from stand-replacing wildfire and other disturbances; and the loss and reduced distribution of
spotted owl habitat due to past activities (pp. vii, II-2). It describes a Recovery Strategy that includes habitat
conservation and active forest management to address these threats, including conserving more occupied
habitat and unoccupied high-value habitat; and encouraging and initiating active management actions that
restore, enhance and promote development of high value habitat, consistent with broader ecological
restoration goals (pp. III-4 to III-5).
Specific to the dynamic, disturbance-prone, drier forests of the California Cascades physiographic province
where the Elk project is located, it recommends active management “in a way that reconciles the overlapping
8

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

goals of NSO conservation, responding to climate change and restoring dry forest ecological structure,
composition and processes, including wildfire and other disturbances” (pp. III-20 to III-21). The California
Cascades scores high in the Recovery Plan in terms of threats from ongoing habitat loss as a result of wildfire,
and the effects of fire exclusion on vegetation change (pp. I-8). Management recommendations within dry
forest ecosystems is fully described in the Recovery Plan, including seven principles that should be part of
any dry forest restoration treatment (pp. III-20 to III-40).
Those principles, and recommendations under Recovery Actions 10 and 32, were utilized throughout project
development. Refer to Appendix H for additional discussion on how the project is meeting the goals and
standards and guidelines from the Forest Plan (pp. 3-27, 4-30). There are no other available species recovery
plans that apply to the project.

Purpose and Need for Action
Introduction and Summary
The purposes, or objectives, of the project are derived from the project area management direction, including
the Forest Plan and LSRA objectives, priorities and criteria. The need for action is determined by comparing
the existing conditions with the desired conditions relative to the identified purposes. 5 Existing conditions,
causal mechanisms and needs for action in relation to the Forest Plan desired conditions were identified in
Step 5 of the Edson WA and Chapter 5 of the Mount Shasta WA. Guided by the needs identified in the WAs,
the interdisciplinary team further examined forest and meadow habitat and stream channel morphology within
the project area to determine existing conditions including age, stocking, mortality, fuel loading, and presence
of insects and disease, and stream channel function. One primary and five secondary purposes were identified.
The primary purpose is:
1. Risk Reduction in Early, Mid and Late-Successional Habitat and Increased Stand Resilience to
Disturbance (Objectives I and III of the LSRA) (LSRA pp. 174-179) 6
Secondary purposes are:
2. Accelerate Development of Late-Successional and Old-Growth Forest Characteristics (LSRA
Objective II) and Promote Late-Successional Habitat Connectivity (LSRA Objective IV)
3. Restore Meadow Habitat in Elk Flat
4. Retain Hardwoods as a Stand Component at Density Levels Commensurate with Development of
Late-Successional Stands

5

The Forest Plan describes the desired condition, which is embodied in the forest goals and objectives, further clarified
by the standards and guidelines, and is described for each Management Area (Forest Plan p. 4.6). The LSRA provides
desired condition descriptions (starting page 162) and conditions existing at the time of publication in 1999 (LSRA,
Chapter 2). The Recovery Plan provides objectives for conserving NSO habitat. Additionally, compliance with regulatory
frameworks, consistency with policy, and consideration of best available science (per 40 CFR 1607.3) also helps guide
identification of desired condition.
6

In this context the LSRA is referring to young stands and plantations (up to 12.9” DBH) as early seral (LSRA p. Appdx.
E) and reducing the risk of setting these young stands back successional through large-scale disturbance. The objective
does not include areas that are not capable or are most valuable as early-seral habitat such as meadow.

Conditions within Riparian Reserves Associated with Elk Flat, Ash and Swamp Creeks and Their
Tributaries.
6. Manage the National Forest Transportation System and Decommission Unauthorized Routes
Rationale for each purpose and the identified need for action in the project area is discussed in detail below.
Crosswalks to Forest Plan direction are included.

Purpose and Need Discussion
1. Reduce Risk from Insects, Disease and Fire in Early-, Mid- and LateSuccessional Habitat, and Increase Stand Resilience to Disturbance (LSRA pp.
174-179) 7
Need for Action
Action is needed because the existing conditions have departed from the desired conditions for:
1. insect and disease conditions,
2. stand composition, structure, and density,
3. fire regime, fuel loading and fire behavior.
The majority of the forested portion of the project area is departed from the natural fire regime and is at risk
of large-scale undesirable disturbance due to existing fuel loading from the ongoing mortality that has
occurred from high stand densities and associated stress from insects, disease and drought conditions. Without
action, further stand and structural composition will be lost due to a combination of continued density related
mortality, root disease, insect attacks and predicted lethal fire effects. These losses have and would continue
to result in a further loss and decline of late-successional habitat and a failure to maintain or meet Forest Plan
direction and LSRA objectives for the LSR and surrounding stands.

Background
As described in the NWFP (pp. B-7) and (LSRA p. 2) natural disturbance is an important process within latesuccessional forest ecosystems but humans have altered the disturbance regimes. Natural fire disturbance
serves a key role in creating and maintaining vegetation community diversity and in consuming fuels
accumulations. Due to fire suppression, some forests have become quite dense and multistoried, primarily
from the invasion of shade-tolerant species. Density reduction in mid-level canopy layers by thinning may
reduce the probability of crown fires occurring. At the same time, these forests may have become much more
vulnerable to insects and diseases. The Recovery Plan describes that frequent and extensive outbreaks of
native forest insects, such as bark beetles, have occurred historically in the western U.S. However, the
anthropogenic influences through past management and fire suppression have altered the landscape vegetation
patterns, subsequently altering the timing, duration and magnitude of outbreaks (pp. III-27).
Frequent low- to moderate-severity fires can remove dead fuel accumulations, as well as a minor portion of
living vegetation, while leaving most of the larger overstory vegetation intact. It also frees up resources,
7

In this context the LSRA is referring to early seral forest habitat, which is defined as young stands and plantations (up to
12.9” DBH) (LSRA p. Appdx. E)), and reducing the risk of setting these young stands back successionally through largescale disturbance. The objective does not include areas that are not capable or are most valuable as early-seral habitat
such as meadows.

which reduces competition among the surviving vegetation. This allows residual and overstory trees to grow
more quickly and forest stands to develop more structural diversity. Small openings and areas of reduced
overstory shading can also be created by frequent low- and moderate-severity fire, which allows understory
vegetation to develop. Frequent low intensity disturbances of insects and disease can also create canopy
openings and gaps in various strata of vegetation, and disease played an important role in shaping and
maintaining special habitats in pre-settlement conditions (USDA-FS, 2011 p. 67). Without these frequent,
lower intensity disturbances, forest stands continually grow until dieback begins, largely as a result of
competition between trees for resources (e.g. water, nutrients, and sunlight). Under conditions of increasingly
high density and competition for resources, tree growth slows or stagnates, tree vigor declines and forest
stands become increasingly at risk for large-scale disturbance from events including insect outbreaks and high
intensity fire.
The 1994 NWFP describes large-scale disturbances as natural events, such as fire, that can eliminate spotted
owl habitat on hundreds of thousands of acres (pp. C-12). As a principle objective of silvicultural systems
within LSRs, it identifies prevention of large-scale disturbances by fire, wind, insects and diseases that can
destroy or limit the ability of the reserves to sustain viable forest species populations (p. B-5). It also calls for
timely management decisions to ensure better results in projects that reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire
and restore forest health (pp. B.1, C.12 - 13). The Plan’s 20-year monitoring report summary for the ‘Status
and Trend of Late-successional and Old-growth Forests’ states: “some portions of the NWFP area have been
setback by decades from achieving those outcomes [expectations for older forest abundance, diversity, and
connectivity] particularly resulting from large wildfires in the fire-prone portions of the NWFP area” ( (Davis,
et al., 2015). Also, the summary report for the 20-year monitoring of the ‘Status and Trend of Northern
Spotted Owl Habitat’ states: “large wildfires continue to be the leading cause for loss of NSO habitats on
federal lands. Most of these fire-related losses have occurred within the network of large reserves that were
designed for the protection and restoration of habitat for long-term northern spotted owl conservation” (Davis,
et al., 2015). The summary report further notes that the loss rates in fire prone portions of the NSOs range
exceeded the expected 2.5% rate for the 20-year period at rates of 3.9-7.4% per decade, including the
California Cascades area. Most large wildfires and resulting habitat losses have occurred in the federally
reserved land use allocations [including LSRs] designed for NSO conservation (Davis, et al., 2015). Climate
change is also expected to expand the area of fire-prone landscapes and an increased frequency of large
wildfires this century has already been observed.
The California Cascades Province is identified as being an area of elevated risk to large-scale disturbance
from changes in the characteristics and distribution of mixed-conifer forests that have resulted from fire
suppression. Risk reduction and efforts are encouraged where they are consistent with the overall
recommendations in management guidelines and the Recovery Plan notes that in some cases in dry forests,
failure to intervene or restore forest conditions may lead to dense stands heavy with fuels and in danger of
stand-replacing fires and insect and disease outbreaks. Active management is recommended to restore dry
forest ecological structure, composition and processes, including wildfire and other disturbances (pp. III-20).
Within both the California Klamath and California Cascades Provinces, the greatest threat to further loss and
degradation of habitat for late-successional associated species is catastrophic wildfire (LSRA p. 174). As
noted in the Recovery Plan (USDI-FWS, 2011 pp. III-6-7):
Natural landscape resilience mechanisms have been decoupled by fire exclusion and wildfire suppression
activities (Hessburg et al. 2005, Moritz et al. 2011). Before the era of management, patchworks of burned
and recovering vegetation, caused by mostly small and medium-sized fires, reduced the likelihood of the
largest fires, which usually resulted from extreme weather events. Twentieth century fire suppression
eliminated most of these fires, and forest landscapes are now susceptible to large wildfires.
The LSRA (p. 175) identifies the late-successional habitat in the Elk Flat LSR as at risk of loss to large-scale
disturbance due to a high percent of expected late-successional sustainable level (5th highest LSR on the
Forest at the time the LSRA was published). This LSR was included among the highest priority for treatment
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

11

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

on the Forest for early to mid-successional habitat (objective III), however ongoing mortality between 2009
and present creates a high priority under criteria b, c, and d (pp. 179-180).
Desired and existing conditions relative to risk reduction (stand composition and structure, density, insects
and disease, and fire and fuels) are described below.

Insects and Disease
Desired Condition
It is desirable to keep insects and related mortality at levels more closely associated with historic levels. This
would fall into the range of no more than 0.2 to 0.5% of standing live biomass mortality/acre/year with
occasional spikes of 1 to 1.5% during drought periods (LSRA p. 163). The Edson WA identified maintaining
resilience of forest stands with respect to insects and disease as a key concern to address (p. 22).
Mortality levels caused by bark beetles in ponderosa pine stands are directly related to increases in stand
densities (Zhang, et al., 2013; Oliver, et al., 1997; Oliver, 1995). In the absence of other forms of disturbance,
stands grow increasingly dense over time until a threshold is reached and bark beetle mortality occurs. It has
been widely held that a zone of imminent mortality begins when Stand Density Index 8 (SDI) reaches 230. At
this point mortality from bark beetles begins to increase; culminating at a maximum SDI of 365 (Oliver, et al.,
1997; Oliver, 1995). As stands approach this maximum SDI, bark beetle outbreaks and wide-spread mortality
develops, often killing large overstory pines and dropping stand densities to near or below an SDI of 230
(Oliver, et al., 1997; Oliver, 1995). Recent research (Zhang, et al., 2013) found that the imminent mortality
SDI may be as high as 425, depending on site index, however the relationship of stand density driven pine
beetle mortality remains the same. This relationship is evident with the widespread pine mortality from
western pine beetle in the Elk project area.

Existing Condition
Although ponderosa pine mortality has been occurring regularly across the entire McCloud Flats, primarily
due to black stain root disease (Leptographium wageneri) and western pine beetle (Dendroctonus brevicomis),
pine mortality has increased dramatically over the past five years in the project area. Ponderosa pine trees
weakened by black stain root disease provide a ready food supply that can support large build-ups of pine
beetle populations. When the western pine beetles attack trees, they emit a chemical signal to attract more
beetles, causing them to aggregate and expand out as they look for more food sources.
Due to the combined overstocking that increases individual tree stress stressed trees and the root disease, there
are pockets of recent and ongoing mortality in ponderosa pine in numerous stands throughout the project area
(Snyder, 2012). With a large beetle population outbreak, pine that are not infected with black stain root
disease, but are otherwise stressed by dense conditions or other factors, will also be attacked and killed. Direct
field observations and long term (six consecutive years or more) aerial detection of pine mortality patterns
indicative of black stain root disease have identified certain stands as known or likely areas of black stain root
disease.
Mortality pockets range from several (10 to 25) trees to over 70 acres. In 2011, approximately 245 acres of
pine mortality was identified based on field observations and aerial photography imagery taken in 2010.
Expanded areas of mortality were observed in 2012 and 2014 and have continued to expand (Payne, 2015b).

8

Stand Density Index (SDI) is a measure that expresses relative stand density in terms of number of trees as related to
the quadratic mean diameter in the stand. In other words, SDI is the degree of tree crowding within the stand.

12

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Considerable bark beetle mortality has also occurred throughout the project area outside of stands where black
stain root disease has been detected due to tree stress caused by dense conditions and other factors. Ongoing
mortality is expected to continue as overstocked stand conditions support elevated bark beetle populations,
including in areas where black stain has not been found.
The combination of overstocking (high stand density), root disease, and subsequent western pine beetle
infestation has and continues to result in mortality of the larger diameter (20-inch, plus) ponderosa pine that
were providing desirable habitat. This loss is particularly striking considering the lack of live large overstory
pine or other species in the project area. Mortality is also spreading throughout pine plantations of various
ages. Since the LSRA was published (1999), mortality levels in the Elk Flat LSR have increased dramatically,
now putting it at “high risk to loss by large-scale disturbance due to adjacent areas of extreme fire hazard:
identified as having two or more years of moderate or high levels of insect and disease-related mortality . . .”
(LSRA p. 180).
Figure 3 shows the areas of mortality mapped on the south end of the project area based on field review and
aerial imagery from 2009 and 2010. Figure 4 compares aerial imagery in the vicinity of unit 206 (the

Heterobasidion root disease is also present in the project area and has infected white fir in units 160 (Snyder,
2012) and evidence is present in other units. The presence of slow-growing tops on many understory and
intermediate white fir suggest that Heterobasidion is widespread within the stand. Because the use of borate
stump treatments (used to reduce the spread of Heterobasidion) did not become a routine treatment until the

latest revision of the Forest Plan, there are numerous Heterobasidion root disease pockets on the McCloud
Flats. Both black stain and Heterobasidion root disease may be present in the same stand.
Dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium spp.) infections are also present in both white fir and ponderosa pine. Fir
engraver beetles (Scolytus ventrallis) are present in dead and dying white fir. With few exceptions dwarf
mistletoe and fir engraver beetle presence is generally light and not above endemic levels.

Stand Composition, Structure and Density
Desired Condition
Composition and Structure
The Forest Plan (pp. 4-4) calls for a diversity of plants at all ecosystem scales. The desired condition within
LSR is late-successional and old-growth forest in which structure and composition are consistent with site
conditions and ecological processes (LSRA p. 162). Late-successional forests include mature and old-growth
age classes. The intent in LSR it to maintain natural ecosystem processes such as gap dynamics, natural
regeneration, pathogenic fungal activity, insect herbivory, and low-intensity fire (NWFP pp. B-1).
The Forest Plan (pp. 4-81, 4-85) describes late-successional stands as containing large numbers of “OldGrowth” trees with large branching, flattened or dead tops, and high levels of decadence (broken tops, old and
decaying wood). These older stands are structurally diverse and often multi-storied. The LSRA describes latesuccessional conditions as structurally diverse (p. 169). Conditions should not be uniform across the
landscape. Denser patches should be intermixed with the more open areas. Decadence should be present or
even obvious in the stand; snags and coarse woody material would be common, although in varying
concentrations throughout the stand. Deformed, broken and diseased trees would also be common enough to
provide nesting and roosting opportunities for wildlife. There would be gaps created by natural mortality
where early-successional vegetation is present. Desired forest vegetation structure and composition would
vary according to the vegetation community, soil conditions, site class, elevation, slope, aspect, climatic
influences and other site circumstances. Table 4 provides the late-successional and old-growth characteristics
from the NWFP and the LSRA.

Snags - Snags should be in a variety of size and decay classes and distribution should range from individuals
to larger aggregations. Desired numbers of snags should vary based on vegetation type with the average
number of snags at 3 to 7 per acre at least 20 inches in diameter. It is desired to have scattered individual
snags and down logs as well as larger aggregations that result from natural events such as wildfire, insect

outbreaks and wind-storms. Larger aggregations are desired as long as they do not put other important latesuccessional characteristics at risk to large-scale disturbances. The desired levels identified in the vegetative
descriptions (Tables 3-1 through 3-4 of the LSRA) represent an average for a landscape or treatment area (i.e.
100 acres). Numbers of snags and down logs can vary on any particular acre (LSRA, 1999 p. 164).
Coarse Woody Debris (CWD) - Large woody material is defined as at least five logs per acre in contact with
the soil surface. Desired logs are about 20 inches in diameter and 10 feet long, representing a range of
decomposition classes. Logs in decomposition classes 3 through 5 should be protected from burning and
mechanical disturbance.
These conditions can begin to appear when forest stands are between 80 and 140 years old, depending on site
conditions, species composition and site history (LSRA p. 162). In pine-dominated forest, stands under
normal conditions are more open with relatively fewer snags and logs. On dry sites, stands may be well over
180 years before these characteristics develop. Figure 6 depicts approximate desired conditions for late
successional habitat.

Figure 6. The Approximate Desired Conditions for Late-Successional Stands: Stand 150 Showing Spacing and Structure
(November 2012)

The LSRA describes sustainable levels of late-successional habitat within LSRs as between 50 to 60% (of
land capable of sustaining late-successional habitat) (p. 196). Vegetation would be varied over the landscape,
consisting of dense multi-layered stands, more open multi-layered stands, dense and open single storied
stands, a variety of trees per acre with differing size classes, snags, down logs, etc. The desired character is in
line with site capability, elevation, slope, aspect and soil conditions.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Density
The desired condition for density for late-successional and old-growth stands on the McCloud Flats is 50 to
70% of normal basal area 10 (Dunning, et al., 1933), (LSRA, 1999 p. 167), and should apply to stands 150 to
200 years old. This density range would allow stands to maintain desired characteristics for a longer time
without an imminent threat of high levels of mortality. After the 200-year timeframe, basal area should not be
as much of a concern in order to allow decadence and increased mortality processes to occur naturally.
The Forest Plan (pp. 4-79, 4-82, 4-86) describes density-related desired condition as forest stands managed at
levels that maintain and enhance growth and yield to improve and protect forest health and vigor, recognizing
the natural role of fire, insects and disease and other components that have a key role in the ecosystem. Stand
understories would appear more open with less ingrowth particularly in stands on sites where wildfire plays a
key role in stand development. The actual target stand densities depend on stand species, site quality, stand
age, and stand objectives (i.e. stand densities are maintained at lower levels to grow larger old trees within
LSR).

Existing Condition
Composition and structure
Most of the project area consists of dense relatively homogeneous forested stands of medium- and small-sized
trees. Understory vegetation is sparse to nonexistent in these dense stands because most of the site resources
are being taken up by the overstory and because little sunlight reaches the forest floor. In contrast,
approximately 20% of forested stands are open canopied and have available growth resources to support an
appreciable understory vegetation layer. Currently the ecological processes that develop old-growth habitat
are departed from their natural regimes.
Table 5 describes the seral stages present in the proposed treatment units in the project area. The Forest Plan
description by Wildlife Habitat Relationship (WHR) classification, canopy closure, and DBH (Forest Plan pp.
4-15) does not correspond well with the Elk project area where high site quality leads to early large tree
development, atypical to the size/successional stage correlation described in the Forest Plan.

# Capable of supporting late-successional forest
^ Mostly Elk Flat Meadow. While designated as capable, it is a meadow type rather than a forest type.

Many of the natural stands in the Elk Flat LSR contain elements of late-successional habitat and provide stand
structural conditions suitable as either reproductive or foraging habitat for NSO, northern goshawk or fisher
habitat (summarized for the project area in the Chapter 3 wildlife section and described in detail in the
Biological Assessment for the NSO). These stands generally meet the Forest Plan classification elements of
older late-seral stands (4c in Table 5) except for stand age and canopy closure, which are required to exceed
70% to meet the Forest Plan classification. This divergence between habitat suitability for these latesuccessional dependent wildlife species and Forest Plan seral classification reflects the stand elements within
a portion of the project area, namely ponderosa pine, that cannot sustain over the long term at densities which
provide canopy cover greater than 70 percent.
Within the LSR, 2,836 acres are capable of supporting late-successional habitat (LSRA p. 125). Of the land
capable of supporting-late successional habitat, 1,306 acres (46% of capable land within the LSR) were in
late-successional habitat when the LSRA was published in 1999. Currently, there is a shortage of high quality
late-successional habitat in the LSR. Many late-successional stands are deficient in structural diversity.
Although most of the project area falls in to the CWHR classification of ponderosa pine, in the natural stands
white fir (Abies concolor) is often the dominant species in all size classes. Ponderosa pine forests typically
contain a mix of tree species but the proliferation of white fir and relative scarcity of ponderosa pine reflects
past harvest practices and decades of fire suppression policies.
Initial logging occurred in the project area in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Large overstory ponderosa pine,
sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) were preferentially removed, with
smaller trees and less marketable species left uncut. Though in some areas of the project, there are remnant
trees (predominants) of these species.

20

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Fire suppression essentially removed the natural and historic fire regime from the landscape, which would
have periodically reduced surface fuels, much of the young small diameter understory trees and a portion of
mid and overstory trees. Current stand conditions reflect an increase in a shade-tolerant understory and
midstory, composed primarily of white fir and incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens). This transition occurred
because white fir and cedar are able to establish in a shaded understory environment and grow into the
overstory over time. White fir, followed by incense cedar and ponderosa pine are the most common species in
the understory. Douglas-fir and sugar pine represent a minor understory component. Pine requires more light
and openings to successfully regenerate, and does not survive well in a shaded understory environment.
Ponderosa pine is a component of large overstory trees (30 inches DBH and greater) where it is found in
combination with white fir, incense cedar, Douglas-fir and sugar pine. The mixed conifer stands are similar in
composition to the ponderosa pine stands but generally contain a higher proportion of white fir in the
overstory in combination with ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, incense cedar and sugar pine.
Prior to the recent western pine beetle outbreak, snags occurred individually and in small groups throughout
the natural stands. The 2007 stand exams (conducted prior to the heavy mortality onset in 2009-2012) found
an average of 4.7 snags per acre within natural stands (50% of project area), with a median size of 20 inches
DBH. The current mortality has likely increased snag densities to 10 or more snags per acre in the same size
class. It is recognized that snags and large CWD provide important habitat elements and are important
features to promote and maintain across the landscape. However, with the significant additional widespread
mortality in pine, these snags will decay, drop and create large fuel loadings >100 tons per acre unless
otherwise treated.
Density
Stands have grown increasingly dense over time, causing understory vegetation to die out due to overtopping
and competition, and causing overstory trees to grow slowly due to inter-tree competition for resources. Nonconifer vegetation, including understory shrubs and herbaceous vegetation, are lacking in the project area and
are at levels considerably lower than would be expected under historic natural fire regimes. Both natural and
plantation forest stands in the Elk Flat LSR are highly to extremely dense in relation to the survivability of
pine (see also discussion about density related bark beetle vulnerability in ponderosa pine on page 12).
The 2007 stand exams recorded basal areas ranging from 156 to 342 square feet per acre with an average tree
diameter of 16 inches. Because of the lack of low intensity fire or other past disturbance, stand densities
increased as trees have continued to grow larger. Tree growth has slowed as stands approach and reach their
maximum carrying capacity. Density related mortality is expected to continue to increase and spread
throughout the project area. Many of the largest dominant and predominant ponderosa pine trees have died, or
are dying in the project area.
The majority of the mid- and late-successional stands in the project area consist of dense, overstocked stands.
Approximately 80% has dense (ranging from 40-90+%) canopy cover. The preponderance of small- and
medium-sized trees reflects the lack of differentiation that occurs under dense, stagnant growth conditions.
Many of these stands have reached or exceeded a density threshold causing individual tree growth, health and
overall stand vigor to decline. The current pine mortality demonstrates the limiting stand density relationship
and resulting loss of desirable late-successional tree features including large overstory pine. While stand
densities remain high, the risk of further loss of these stand elements persists.
Older plantations (greater than 40 years) currently exceed the threshold SDI of 365. These overstocked,
monoculture ponderosa pine plantations are not developing desirable habitat features but are expected, with
treatment, to provide an important source of future (next few decades) habitat. In the interim, they remain at
risk of widespread mortality due the high density.

Figure 7 illustrates the overly dense conditions in some natural stands in the project area. Figure 8 shows a
stand with average basal area of 283 square feet per acre, an SDI of 419 and an average tree diameter of 16
inches. While basal area is often used as a measure of NSO (and other species) habitat suitability, other factors
such as average tree diameter, species composition, decadence, and snag/CWD size also contribute to the
overall suitability. Figure 9 illustrates the overly dense conditions in plantations.

Fire and Fuels
Fire regime, fuel loading, and potential fire behavior contribute to risk of large-scale disturbance.

Desired Condition
Fire Regime
The Forest Plan states the goal of returning fire to its natural role in the ecosystem (pp. 4-4). Stand
understories appear more open with less ingrowth particularly stands on sites where wildfire plays a key role
in stand development (pp. 4-79, 4-86).
Prior to historical logging, the natural fire regime was frequent low to moderate intensity fire, and much of the
forest stands would have been fairly open-canopied with brush, forbs and grasses underneath. More dense
stands of mixed conifers would have been present at higher elevations, along riparian corridors and on northfacing slopes where local moisture levels are higher and fires were less frequent. The Edson WA describes
pre-settlement fire regime (USDA-FS, 2011 p. 89). Prior to European settlement of the region, wildland fire
was the primary factor that influenced the vegetation patterns across the watershed.
Historically, approximately 91% of the Elk project area experienced a high frequency (0 to 35 years) low to
mixed severity fire return interval. 11 Fires started by lightning probably burned large areas during periodic
11

Fire return interval is the average period between fires under a presumed historical fire regime.

droughts with mixed severity, perpetuating shrubs and very open conifer forest. Native American sites in the
watershed indicate that some wildland fires were deliberately started to maintain early-successional
vegetation that favored game species such as deer and elk. Prior to organized fire suppression frequent low to
moderate severity fire occurred as a combined result of summer drought, winter precipitation and lightning.
Mature trees in this forest type are adapted to frequent surface fire. Historically, periodic wildfires limited the
main species composition of dry sites to pines (cedar and fir are more susceptible to fire-induced mortality
than pine due to their branch characteristics and bark qualities).
The LSRA (p. 163) notes it is desirable to have low to moderate intensity fires burn in LSRs. Low intensity
fires can reduce fine fuels and ladder fuels, create a seedbed for a diversity of herbaceous plants, and create a
patchy understory open enough for spotted owl movements. Moderate intensity fires are desirable if they
create small openings in the canopy of less than one to five acres. This allows for ingrowth of tree seedlings
and other early successional plants, and creates snag patches and concentrations of down woody debris which
are important for prey base habitat. Burned openings are most desirable if they occupy only a small
percentage (five to ten percent) of the stands providing habitat. Introducing a fire cycle more similar to what
occurred in pre-suppression times will reduce the risk of catastrophic fires. Large stand replacing, high
intensity fires are not desirable within LSRs.
The desired condition is a fuels profile where fire plays a natural role in the ecosystem with conditions that
result in low to moderate fire behavior. When a natural ignition occurs within the project area, it would be
allowed to play its natural role in the ecosystem.
Fuel Loading
Research has described natural frequent low-intensity fire in dry pine and mixed conifer forests in the West as
"fuels limited" fire regimes (Agee, 1993; Schoennagel, et al., 2004). In other words, fuels sufficient to sustain
and carry a fire are a more limiting and determining factor than weather or climatic conditions.
The Forest Plan describes dead and down material presence for LSR (pp. 4-44) and matrix lands (pp. 4-67).
Actual fuel loadings vary according to vegetation type, but average from 5 to 35 tons per acre in LSR and 5
tons per acre in matrix lands with CWP emphasis.
The LSRA (p. 163) describes the desired variability of fuel conditions across the landscape as some high
concentrations of fuel intermixed with areas of low fuel accumulations. Heavier scattered pockets of fuels
would occur on relatively cool, moist sites, such as those found on north and east facing slopes, or low on
slopes adjacent to perennial riparian areas. South and west slope aspects and upper slope positions, which are
typically drier and harsher, would generally contain lighter fuel loadings, with fewer scattered pockets of
heavy fuel. Site capability also influences fuel loadings. Fuels would break down with the assistance of fire
and cycle nutrients back into the soil in a form available to vegetation. There would be a low, manageable
level of excess residual natural and activity fuels that remains after management activities are implemented
that would not contribute to increased probabilities of high severity wildfire within the LSR.
Fire Behavior
The LSRA (p. 163) describes the desired fuel conditions as those that promote low to moderate fire behavior.
Low to moderate intensity disturbances (such as fire, wind, insects and disease) create canopy openings and
gaps in vegetation, establish trees beneath the maturing overstory trees either in gaps or under the canopy, and
close canopy gaps by lateral growth or growth of understory trees (p. 162).
The wildfire behavior goal is to develop a fuels profile that will have moderate wildfire intensities determined
by flame length (a measure of fire intensity) on a 90th percentile (mid to late summer or hotter) fire weather
day over most of the land base. The desired flame length and rate of spread would be those in which overstory
trees are not likely to be killed (LSRA pp. 164-165). The LSRA recommends a fuels profile with moderate
wildfire intensities determined by flame length (a measure of fire intensity) of four feet or less, allowing for
24

safe direct attack by hand crews, and rates of spread less than twenty chains (1 chain = 66 feet) per hour
(LSRA p. 165). Fuel Models 12 2 and 9 are the desired condition. Fuel Models 2 and 9 are present, but the fire
behavior within these fuel models is moderated by surface fuels and tree densities not exceeding desired
levels.
•

Fuel Model-2 – Fire spread would be primarily through the fine herbaceous fuels, either curing or
dead. These would be surface fires where the herbaceous material, litter and dead-down stemwood
from the open timber overstory contribute to fire intensity.

•

Fuel Model-9 – Fires would move through the surface litter. Fuel bed depth would be less than 1
foot.

Existing Condition
Fire Regime
The Mt. Shasta region has experienced nearly 100 years of fire suppression resulting in a vegetation structure
and composition that is vastly altered from historical conditions. The restricted size and frequency of fires
across the landscape has resulted in increased stand density, a shift from fire-tolerant to fire-intolerant species,
and reduced structural diversity throughout the region and watershed area. As a result, severe wildfires have
increased throughout the Cascade Range, especially in the low and mid-elevation forests (USDA-FS, 2012 p.
58; Skinner, et al., 2006). Effective fire suppression within the dry forested landscape of the California
Cascades Province where the project is located has resulted in changes to forest structure, stand density and
species composition, changing the fire regime from frequent low intensity surface fires, to infrequent, stand
replacement fires (Agee, 1993). In the past several decades, the frequency of large wildfires and the acres
burned each year have increased across the western United States (Miller, et al., 2012), (Agee, et al., 2005).
Many of these fires are burning with uncharacteristic severity and scale (Agee, et al., 2005).
The Elk project area has experienced the results of effective fire suppression. Large-scale, frequent, lowintensity fires have not occurred in the project area. The result has been an accumulation of surface and
understory fuels and overstocked stands that are more susceptible to drought stress, insects and disease. Fire
cannot play its natural role (short interval, low to mixed intensity fire regime) in the project area at this time.
In a fire, dramatic changes to the stands could occur due to fire size, intensity, severity, and landscape
patterns. (NWCG, 2006).
The entire project area is in fire regime condition class 3 (high departure) (USDA-FS, 2012a). The fire regime
has been substantially altered from the natural (historic) range resulting in a high risk of losing key ecosystem
components. Fire frequencies have departed from natural frequencies by multiple return intervals. There is no
record of large fires in the project area in the last 100 years. There are numerous areas with fire scared trees
indicating smaller fires throughout the project area.
Fuel Loading
Departure from the natural fire regime has led to dense accumulations of live and dead fuels, combined with
the recent mortality from bark beetles. Current surface fuel loadings in the Elk Flat LSR range from 5 to 19
tons per acre. Where there are high levels of existing and ongoing mortality, fuel loads are expected to
increase to 35 to 100+ tons per acre when these dead and dying trees fall. Approximately 10% of the Elk Flat
LSR is currently comprised of large pockets (10 to 70+ acres) of standing dead trees that present a current and

future threat to the surrounding habitat and Forest visitors due to increasing fuel loads and safety
considerations. Smaller mortality pockets range from groups of 5 to 10 trees up to ½-acre, primarily in the
ponderosa pine component, with additional root disease-related mortality occurring in white fir stands.
Many conifer stands are overly dense
with many small trees in the understory
layer that can act as fuel ladders, allowing
fire to move quickly from the forest floor
into the upper canopy layer. Stand species
composition is shifting from
predominately pine to pine mixed with
incense cedar and white fir. Incense cedar
and white fir are prolific throughout the
understory and mid-story of many stands.
The shift in species composition from
pine to cedar and fir increases the risk of
loss due to wildfire. Figure 10 shows a
typical mixed conifer stand with heavy
ground fuel accumulation.
Fire Behavior

influence fire behavior in the event of a
fire start. Mortality pockets provide a
component of late-successional reserve conditions in the form of multiple snags, standing dead trees and large
CWD. However, the current and future fuel loads, and risk of natural and human caused fire starts would
result in high heat and spotting that could ignite other dense forested stands within the project area. The
current strategy for responding to a fire in this area is to not commit firefighters in the mortality zone, but
back off to a safe location to manage the fire, potentially increasing risk to late-successional forest. The
natural stands and older plantations are susceptible to high severity fire effects due to fire suppression and
natural fire exclusion over the past 100 years.

In the case of a wildfire during the summer season, fire behavior modeling predicts rates of spread, flame
lengths, and resistance to control that would result in high acreage burned and significant post-fire adverse
effects on resources. Three fuel models account for approximately 85% of the LSR: Fuel Models-10, -2 and 9 (LSRA p. 126).

•

Fuel Model-10 is characterized by dense late-successional conifer stands (Timber Condition Classes
4N, 4G, and greater) with heavy amounts of dead and down woody fuels. The understory is densely
populated with intermediate size conifers. A wildfire carried by these fuels would be intense enough
to cause crowning (fire moving from the understory to the tree crowns), fire spotting ahead of the
main fire and rapid rates of spread during high winds. Large stand replacing fires can be expected.

•

Fuel Model-2 is characterized by poorer timbered sites and young plantations with grass and brush
where surface fires can spread easily with pockets of fuels generating high heat intensities.

•

Fuel Model-9 is characterized by closed-canopy conifer stands (Timber Condition Classes 3N, 3G,
4N, and 4G) with densely stocked pole size trees in the understory. Typically, these stands contain
pockets of dead and down woody fuels that create high fire intensities during surface fires that can
easily spread through the understory to the crowns of the dominant conifers.

of the recorded occurrences. However, fire hazard/risk in the 1999 LSRA was determined to be
moderate/moderate due to several large pockets of standing dead trees. Because of the ongoing western pine
beetle outbreak, a higher level of snags than would normally occur under a natural fire regime developed
throughout most of the project area. Existing snag estimates are 10 snags 20 inches DBH per acre. Some of
these snags have already fallen and become down wood, and snags will continue to fall the over the next few
years without treatment. While snags and large down logs are an important habitat component in the project
area, they are also a high fire hazard at the current densities. Widespread high concentrations of snags and
down wood create a fuel hazard. Extensive dense fuels increase the risk of undesirable high intensity fire that
could kill adjacent residual trees as well as newly regenerating stands growing up through the dead and down
trees.
With the current and projected fuel loads, the risk from potential for human caused fire starts has increased,
notably along roads. Additionally, the low level of recent timber-stand management activities such as thinning
to reduce forest stand density, has resulted in overcrowded stands with slowed tree growth and poor vigor.
The recent insect-caused mortality compounds the current hazardous fuel conditions. Without treatment, these
areas of dead and dying trees will add significantly to the potential fire behavior hazard. Once the trees have
fallen, surface fuel loadings are estimated to exceed 100 tons per acre in the mortality pockets. These areas
would be characterized as a Fuel Model 13. Appendix B of the Fireline Handbook (NWCG, 2006) describes
fire activity in Fuel Model 13 as:
“Fire is generally carried by a continuous layer of slash. Large quantities of greater than 3-inch material
are present. Fires spread quickly through the fine fuels and intensity builds up as the large fuels start
burning. Active flaming is sustained for long periods and a wide variety of firebrands can be generated.”
A wildfire in these pockets with high fuel loading would be a high intensity. This may require firefighters to
back off to an area where intensity will be less. Equipment would have a difficult time working in these areas,
making the tactic of creating control lines with dozers unlikely.
With the existing conditions and ongoing mortality, portions of the project area are expected to experience
passive crown fire and flame lengths greater than 4 feet. This would not allow ground forces to directly attack
the flanks or head of the fire. Equipment and/or aircraft would be needed to manage a fire under these
conditions. Modeling indicates up to 40% mortality from a wildfire in the natural stands, under 97th percentile
weather conditions. With these conditions, fire managers are limited in the tactics that would be effective.
Potentially, this could impact adjacent landowners, as a fire that starts within the project area could move onto
private lands.
While fire modeling does not predict a running crown fire, the predicted high heat and potential for torching
and spotting in the heavy mortality areas presents a risk to current and developing late-successional habitat,
adjacent private lands and WUI. Without action, the mortality will continue to increase and spread throughout
the project area, contributing to higher levels of standing and dead fuels and increasing the risk of high
severity, stand-replacing fire.

2. Accelerate Development of Late-Successional and Old-Growth Forest
Characteristics (LSRA Objective II) and Promote Late-Successional Habitat
Connectivity (LSRA Objective IV)
Need for Action
Action is needed because the existing conditions will delay or prevent development of late-successional forest
in early and mid-successional forested stands in the project area. The same conditions that affect successional
development reduce the value of these forests for connectivity to existing late-successional forest.

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Background
Development of old-growth forest characteristics including snags, logs on the forest floor, large trees, and
canopy gaps that enable establishment of multiple tree layers and diverse species composition are a primary
objective in LSR. Some of the mid-successional forest is already providing components of late-successional
forests. Most of the mid-successional forest in natural stands provides habitat that is utilized by a latesuccessional dependent species (NSO, northern goshawk, fisher, rare mosses). Restoration treatments in earlysuccessional forests can accelerate development of some of the structure and composition of latesuccessional forests (NWFP, 1994 pp. B-6). The NWFP standards and guidelines (p. B-1) encourage
accelerating development of overstocked young plantations and early-successional forests (p. B-5) into stands
with late-successional and old-growth forest characteristics.
While the LSRA describes that plantations are important in the development and sustenance of latesuccessional habitat and associated species (p. 172), the plantations in the project area are predominantly a
monoculture of ponderosa pine which contribute little current habitat value for late-successional species. The
stand and species composition of the early- and mid-successional stands (both natural and plantations) are
critical factors to consider when assessing current and future potential habitat suitability and value for these
species. With treatment, these stands may support late-successional forest conditions over the long-term, and
potentially succeed and replace current late-successional stands that will fail (p. 173). Also as described in the
LSRA, emphasis should be placed on moving older plantations toward conditions that will provide additional
support to prey base and foraging habitats for the fisher and northern goshawk, and dispersal habitat for
northern spotted owl.
The Forest Plan (pp. 4-81, 4-85) also directs managing younger to mature forest stands (in LSR) to replace
older dead and dying stands as they no longer are suitable for old-growth ecosystem dependent organisms.
The LSRA identifies Elk Flat LSR as a priority for promoting development of late-successional forest (LSRA
p. 178) and notes the importance of maintaining young plantations as healthy and fast growing. Stocking
levels and fuel accumulations should be at levels that reduce the likelihood of loss to catastrophic fire and that
encourage the growth of large trees (LSRA pp. 162-163). The Forest Plan also directs connecting travel
corridors for wildlife species, particularly late-successional dependent species (pp. 4-14), and maintaining or
improving soil productivity (pp. 4-5). The LSRA describes connectivity of early and mid-successional habitat
(pp. 181-182) as:
a. Areas of early- and mid- successional forest adjacent to "isolated" stands of late-successional habitat
that will respond to treatment in order to promote greater connectivity and reduce fire hazards
throughout LSR.
b. Areas of early- and mid-successional forest that coincide with landscape features that may be
important to dispersing animals.

Desired Condition
The desired condition is to achieve and maintain individual tree growth, health and resilience of contiguous
early and mid-successional pine and mixed-conifer habitat across the Elk Flat LSR and adjacent matrix lands
to foster connectivity and develop late-successional habitat. Connectivity provided by Riparian Reserves is
also important and described starting on page 33.

Existing Condition
Early and mid-successional forest in the project area totals approximately 1,500 acres 13. Most of the midsuccessional forest consists of dense, overstocked stands. Many of these stands support density levels that are
13

This does not include Elk Flat, which is early seral, but not a forest type.

near or exceed site capability because they are often slow growing and lacking stand vigor. Growth
projections indicate potentially high levels of mortality with associated surface and standing dead fuel
increases that can add to uncharacteristic fire behavior and effects. Under the current conditions of
increasingly high density and competition for resources, tree growth slows, tree vigor declines and attainment
of late-successional status and quality of connectivity is decreased, delayed or prevented.
The practice of “brush to trees” windrowing 14 in the 1950’s through the 1970’s plowed brush fields into
windrows, displacing from four to eight inches of topsoil, followed by conifer planting. Topsoil was scalped
to tear out brush and to remove duff and seeds to expose bare soil for planting. Windrowed brush was burned,
leaving large rows of topsoil rich in soil organic matter. The loss of soil productivity between the windrows
directly affects site productivity and sustainability resulting in reduced or delayed tree and stand development.

3. Restore Meadow Habitat in Elk Flat
Need for Action
A need exists to restore the natural opening and dry meadow ecosystem at Elk Flat. Elk Flat appears to be in a
drying phase which is allowing tree encroachment to occur. A high water table supports meadow vegetation
and discourages tree growth. When the water table is lower, trees can out-compete meadow vegetation
because of their deeper roots. Currently, the water table is greater than one meter below the ground surface in
most years, so this meadow area is probably best classified as a dry meadow/grassland area with conifer
encroachment (Weixelman, 2015). Specifically, the following processes need restoration or application to
maintain the dry meadow ecosystem:
1. Restoration of early seral vegetative conditions that are more reflective of those before fire
suppression; and restoration of herbaceous species that would maintain sufficient sod and root
densities to discourage tree establishment and keep the area open.
2. Re-introducing fire as a disturbance element that contributes to maintaining the dry meadow
vegetation conditions.
3. Restoration of the natural water table to encourage and support meadow vegetation and discourage
tree encroachment. Water table restoration is elaborated on in Purpose and Need #5 below(see p.
33).

Background
Elk Flat is a natural opening, a dry meadow (Weixelman, et al., 2011) and the outwash plain for Swamp
Creek. Openings were probably maintained in the past by outwash and mudflow events. Although the
frequency and duration of these events is unknown, soil pits show a wide range of stratification indicating
recurring outwash was deposited.
The fire interval and intensity may have been very different between the surrounding forest and Elk Flat.
There is little physical evidence on the role of fire in maintaining the open condition; however, the meadow
edges probably shared the same fire interval as the surrounding conifer forests and this may have helped
limited conifer encroachment. Nineteenth-century historical anecdotes indicate that Elk Flat was about three
to four miles wide and without trees (USDA-FS, 2011 p. 99). A range of fire intervals and intensities would
have depended on the occurrence of fuels. Lighter fuels, grasses and forbs of the meadow interior would have
likely supported low intensity surface fire that would contribute to maintaining the opening.
14

Windrowing is a site preparation method in which topsoil is scalped and piled. It was used in the past prior to tree
planting as a way to remove competing vegetation.

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Elk Flat meadow contains deep soils formed in glacial outwash and mudflows overlain by several feet of the
more recent outwash deposits (USDA-FS & USDA-SCS, 1983). Soils are deep and somewhat excessive to
well-drained. Due to the deep soils overlain by outwash, a seasonal water table elevation sufficient to support
a high density of grasses and upland sedges probably maintained enough sod and root densities to discourage
tree establishment and keep the area open. In the past during successive high water years, there may have
been shallower water tables, thus increasing grassy cover, and during drier periods lowering water tables and
reduced grassy cover (Weixelman, 2015).
Within the project area, 353 acres of Elk Flat meadow are in LSR allocation, with the remaining 378 acres in
matrix with Commercial Wood Products (CWP) emphasis. Forest Plan Standard and Guidelines provide for
maintenance of at least five percent of each timber type/seral stage (pp. 4-14).

Desired Conditions
The Forest Plan directs that management of natural openings will be determined at the project level,
consistent with desired future conditions (pp. 4-14). In the Forest Plan supplemental management direction
for Management Area 2 (pp. 4-81), Elk Flat meadow is specifically identified for management of early seral
stage vegetation (WHR Seral Stage 1, Table 4-3). Forest goals that contribute to identification of the desired
future conditions in the Elk Flat meadow include:
•

maintaining a rich diversity of plants, fish, and wildlife and maintaining the diversity and quality of
habitats that support viable populations of plants, fish, and wildlife (pp. 4-4). 15

•

restoring fire to its natural role in the ecosystem when establishing the desired future condition (p.
4.4). 16 maintaining natural wildlife species diversity by continuing to provide special habitat elements
within the Forest’s ecosystems (p. 4.6).

The LSRA (p. 205) lists protection and improvement of meadow areas as the desired condition and neutral to
the objectives of LSR. The Edson WA identified opportunities to restore the distribution, size and functions
associated with wet and dry meadows, including Elk Flat (p. 116) and to evaluate the potential for
maintaining meadows through reintroduction of fire and vegetation management (p. 105).
Low intensity surface fires would not necessarily produce scarring on the larger trees or produce significant
charcoal in the soil layers; it is possible that low intensity surface fires maintained the open nature of the
meadow in the past (Weixelman, 2015). The best evidence available that demonstrates the size of the Elk Flat
opening before the control of fires are 1944 aerial photographs (see Figure 12). The desired condition is:

15

Elk Flat does not provide fish habitat, but it does contribute to diversity of plants and wildlife.

16

While it is suspected that fire did not maintain the habitat in Elk Flat, returning fire to the landscape as an agent that
helps maintain the early seral vegetation is consistent with the Forest Plan goals

4. The early seral area of Elk Flat is restored to its historic size
as evident in the 1944 photographs. Scattered conifers are a
natural component of the meadow. The largest trees are
retained, primarily the predominants that established prior to
1944 and within LSR, those with late-successional
characteristics (see Figure 11).
5. Fire is re-introduced to act as a natural disturbance agent
and to promote conditions more reflective of a natural fire
regime prior to fire exclusion.

Existing Conditions
Conifer encroachment is diminishing the dry meadow area at Elk
Flat. Based on 1998 aerial photography analysis, the extent of the
meadow at Elk Flat was less than 50% of its extent in 1944 (USDAFS, 2011 p. 69). The photo comparison below shows 2012 and 1944
aerial photography and demonstrates continued decline of meadow
area from encroaching conifer (see Figure 12).

Suppression

Figure 12. 2012 Aerial Photograph of Elk Flat Left Compared to 1944 Photograph on the Right Showing Increased Conifer
Encroachment in the Dry Meadow Ecosystem

The meadow at Elk Flat is predominantly comprised of herbaceous plants and perennial grasses. Remnant
islands of conifer trees (primarily ponderosa pine, but some white fir and incense cedar) are present, and
young regeneration and stringers from these islands and the adjacent forest stands are encroaching on the
meadow. Rapid conifer establishment in the meadow is evident where dense even-aged dog-haired stands of
ponderosa pine regeneration line the meadow periphery (see Figure 13) and the stream channels.

Hydrologic conditions also influence the existing condition at Elk Flat. Due to the current gully confinement,
and lower seasonal water table, Swamp Creek is no longer able to hydrate the meadow. However, during
periods of snowmelt and rainfall, relict multiple channels on the meadow experience minor flooding and
transport sand and gravels, which is a minor contribution to the larger-scale disturbance required to maintain
the natural opening. 17 Hydrologic function restoration is discussed in Purpose and Need #5.

4. Retain and Enhance Hardwoods as a Stand Component at Density Levels
Commensurate with Development of Late-Successional Stands.
Need for Action
The need exists to assure hardwoods thrive and remain in stands at naturally occurring levels throughout the
Elk Project area.

Background
The Forest Plan identifies hardwoods as having high value to wildlife for foraging, nesting, denning, resting
and shelter, as well as providing habitat for prey species. Acorn production is especially important as a food
source (pp. 3-25). The Edson WA describes aspen as a keystone species, vital to maintaining biodiversity (p.
68), and identifies hardwood decline as a concern for vegetation and forest resilience in the watershed (pp.
103, 108, 120).
Without disturbance, forest stands continue to follow a process of natural succession in which encroaching
conifers establish in the understory, excluding the shade-intolerant hardwoods and eventually fully occupying
the sites. Conifer species, particularly white fir establishing in the understory, increasingly dominate the overstory canopy, overtop aspen and oak, and successfully out-compete hardwoods for available sunlight, water
and nutrients. The LSRA notes hardwoods are a desired component (p. 162) in existing plantations.
17

Restoring the full hydrology would require upper watershed restoration of road drainage. This is outside the scope of
this project and is recognized as needing further consideration in the Edson WA (USDA-FS, 2011).

32

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Hardwood groups and individuals should be retained and managed as stand components at appropriate levels
for the development of late-successional stands.

Desired Conditions
Forest Plan goals that contribute to identifying the desired future conditions for hardwoods in the project area
include:
•

maintaining a rich diversity of plants, fish, and wildlife and maintaining the diversity and quality of
habitats that support viable populations of plants, fish, and wildlife (pp. 4-4).

•

maintaining natural wildlife species diversity by continuing to provide special habitat elements within
the Forest’s ecosystems (pp. 4-6).

Additionally the Forest Plan directs that within LSR, hardwoods should be maintained at naturally occurring
levels and enhanced (Forest Plan pp. 4-42, 4-44). Within Matrix CWP emphasis they are sustained on a
landscape basis consistent with the desired future conditions. The desired condition in the McCloud Flats
Management Area is to maintain hardwoods as a stand component where they exist (Forest Plan pp. 4-82).
The desired condition for hardwoods is groups and individual hardwoods restored to naturally occurring
levels. Openings and canopy gaps would be restored to the historic size and conditions that reflect a natural
fire regime prior to fire exclusion. Aspen stands would be at a sustainable level on a landscape basis and
aspen would be encouraged to reclaim sites it historically occupied.
Figure 14 shows a previously treated area (North Flats project), located in the southern portion of the project
area with released oak representing the desired condition.

Existing Conditions
Aspen (Populus tremuloides) and California black oak
(Quercus kelloggii) occur as a scattered, minor vegetation
component within the project area, generally in the
understory at reduced abundance and decreased vigor. Fire
exclusion has allowed white fir understories to become
established in many stands. As white fir develops, it
eventually overtops and shades out hardwoods (USDA-FS,
2011 p. 37).

5. Increase Streamflow, Raise Water Table
Elevation and Improve Water Quality and
Vegetation Conditions within Riparian
Reserves Associated with Elk Flat, Ash
and Swamp Creeks and Their Tributaries.
Need for Action
A need exists to improve and maintain Riparian Reserve
function by raising water table elevation, reconnecting
floodplains to the stream channel, and promote the
development of riparian vegetation along Ash Creek and
Swamp Creek to increase streambank stability. Specifically,
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

Figure 14. Previously Treated Area at Southern
End of the Project Area that Represents a Desired
Condition for Hardwoods

33

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

a need exists to:
•

Riparian Vegetation - Improve conditions that favor the growth of riparian vegetation, and restore
streamflow and vegetation conditions to support establishment of riparian vegetation within the
Riparian Reserves associated with Ash and Swamp Creeks and their tributaries. Riparian vegetation is
scattered along Ash Creek and limited to areas where sunlight has reached the forest floor. Understory
vegetation is nearly absent in the dense stands and there is a need to increase exposure to sunlight to
promote riparian plants within the Ash Creek Riparian Reserve.

•

Water Table – Increase and maintain water table elevation. Although intermittent stream flow is an
inherent background characteristic for both Ash Creek and Swamp Creek, conditions could improve
that would incrementally raise water table elevation, leading to increased water storage and flow
duration.

•

Channel Banks - Strengthen channel banks. Banks are more susceptible to erosion in the project area
than the channel upstream. In contrast, abundant riparian vegetation and in-stream bedload structure
demonstrate active processes of channel evolution that are deficient within the project area.

•

Road Interaction - Reduce road interactions with stream channels. The compacted road surfaces
concentrate surface flows, increase stream power and increase erosive energies flowing into channels.
In Elk Flat, old road crossings and unauthorized routes capture streamflow to Swamp Creek resulting
in channel entrenchment, headward erosion into the meadow and subsequently lowering the water
table.

•

Floodplain Restoration – Reduce overland flow from adjacent compacted surfaces such as old
landings and unauthorized routes, and restore floodplain function at existing previously used landings
on floodplains. These features alter the flood topography, do not support hydrologic function and
prevent attainment of ACS objectives. Restoring floodplain topography is needed in these areas to
restore floodplain processes and functions and associated water table elevation.

•

Woody Debris - Increase instream channel structure. Excessive inputs of large wood from whole tree
failure create log-jams that obstruct the channel and cause widening. There is a need to moderate the
rate of large woody debris input to incremental, to support channel structure and allow channels to
detain sediment load, construct banks and facilitate floodplain interaction.

•

Habitat and Natural Corridor - There is a need to meet the Forest Plan desired future condition for
Riparian Reserves to meet dispersion habitat requirements for the NSO and other late-successional
dependent species such as fisher and northern goshawk (Forest Plan pp. 4-80), as well as appear as
natural corridors throughout the Matrix (Forest Plan pp. 4-81). Past landings reduce floodplain
function and are detrimental to the appearance and function of a natural corridor.

Background
The Forest Plan and ACS Objectives (pp. 4-53) provide objectives that watersheds need to maintain or
improve their processes and functions at a 5th field watershed scale. Additionally the Edson WA identified
Riparian Reserve habitat improvement opportunities through improved stand condition and reduced fuels, and
reduced road density in close proximity to riparian and aquatic habitats (p. 124).

Desired Conditions
The desired condition is a restored hydrologic environment within the project area in support of the ACS
objectives as listed on page 4-53 of the Forest Plan. The desired condition is to meet or not prevent attainment
34

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

of all nine ACS objectives. The following ACS objectives highlight the greatest difference identified between
the existing condition and the desired condition:
ACS Objective #4. Maintain and restore water quality necessary to support healthy riparian, aquatic,
and wetland ecosystems. Water quality must remain within the range that maintains the biological,
physical, and chemical integrity of the system and benefits survival, growth, reproduction, and
migration of individuals composing aquatic and riparian communities.
ACS Objective #7. Maintain and restore the timing, variability, and duration of floodplain inundation
and water table elevation in meadows and wetlands.
ACS Objective #8. Maintain and restore the species composition and structural diversity of plant
communities in riparian areas and wetlands to provide adequate summer and winter thermal
regulation, nutrient filtering, appropriate rates of surface erosion, bank erosion, channel migration,
and to supply amounts and distributions of coarse woody debris (CWD) sufficient to sustain physical
complexity and stability.
ACS Objective #9. Maintain and restore habitat to support well-distributed populations of native
plant, invertebrate and vertebrate riparian-dependent species.

Existing Conditions
There are only intermittent channels and no perennial streams in the project area. Ash Creek is the dominant
channel, flowing through the project and transporting more water more frequently than any other intermittent
channel. Swamp Creek is an intermittent channel that carries seasonal or stormflow of very short duration
with a substantial sediment load. These are the most distinctive channel forms found though there are many
less well-formed channels nearby as evidence of historical activity.
Upstream of the project area, abundant riparian vegetation, well-defined inner gorges and instream bedload
structure demonstrate active processes of channel evolution. However, these processes are interrupted in the
project area. Reaches of channel are disconnected from their floodplain. Shade from dense overstory
vegetation prevents sun-loving riparian vegetation from establishing and thriving. Unauthorized roads
intercept streamflow in channels and divert flow during runoff events. The hydrologic and watershed
resources within the project boundary do not support ecological processes necessary to maintain properly
functioning conditions. Specifically, existing conditions departing from desired conditions and outside a
natural range of variability include:
•

Existing Landings from Past Activity in Riparian Reserves reduce floodplain function and
potential diversion of surface flow.

•

Unauthorized Routes not designed and not maintained. Topography and unauthorized routes often
interact with streams during flood events in the project area. Many of these routes become connected
when they capture surface runoff that would otherwise infiltrate into the ground and concentrate it on
the road surface. When these routes collect runoff, they often pick up and transport fine sediment and
leave the winnowed coarser rock, which is then detrimental to the overall hydrology. Unauthorized
routes U41N09B, U41N02YB, U41N46B, U41N13B, 41N12D, U41N10AB and U41N10AC all
intercept channels in one or more locations. High road prisms may also control flow by intercepting
or damming runoff while low road prisms may concentrate flow.

•

Road Interactions - The interactions of topography, roads and streams are magnified by several
roads that are in close proximity. Several sources of water that contribute flow to a given location can
and does lead to flooding and sediment inputs into streams. Ash Creek receives such inputs at several

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

35

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

locations during moderate flow and melting events, such as the intersection of the Military Pass Road
(41N19X) with 41N09 (see Figure 15).

Figure 15. Forest Road 41N19X Surface Runoff into Ash Creek

36

•

Hydrologic Function - Intermittent streams, such as Ash Creek and Swamp Creek, provide
considerable ecological value, especially in the absence of perennial flow, to systems dependent on
them. Hydrologic processes, such as flooding, that maintained Elk Flat in the past have been
disrupted by lack of connection to Swamp Creek and its intermittent channel system. Historical road
systems have diverted flow from Swamp Creek, concentrating flow and eroding Swamp Creek into a
gully, disconnecting it from spreading out over the meadow.

•

Woody Debris - Woody debris recruitment is a necessary component in channels; however, input in
large amounts is causing woody debris dams and channel widening. An accelerated rate of bank
erosion along Ash Creek, where the accumulation of woody debris is high, diverts water around log
jams (see Figure 16).

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Figure 16. Log jam collecting sediment and causing bank erosion along Ash Creek.

•

Riparian Vegetation - Ash Creek lacks riparian plant communities and floodplain interaction.
Scattered riparian vegetation is limited to discontinuous locations where sunlight can reach the forest
floor along Ash Creek, but is absent along Swamp Creek as well as other smaller intermittent
channels.

6. National Forest Transportation System (FTS) Management and Decommission
Unauthorized Routes
Need for Action
A need exists to increase FTS efficiency and provide access to a dispersed recreation area in Elk Flat. The
project Transportation Analysis Process (TAP) recommends adding approximately 0.10 miles of existing
unauthorized route that is currently utilized as public access to a dispersed recreation area in Elk Flat. This
segment would be added to the FTS as an open, maintenance level 2 road to provide legal motorized access
(Bonivert, 2015a).
A need exists to remove several existing unauthorized routes in the project area and restore these areas to a
more natural condition.

Background
The Record of Decision for Motorized Travel Management (MTM ROD) established the National Forest
System transportation network (FTS or “system”) on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest (USDA-FS, 2010a).
The MTM ROD acknowledged that unauthorized routes not added to the FTS may in the future be considered
for removal from the landscape and restored to the natural condition, converted to trails, or added to the FTS
in future NEPA analyses (USDA-FS, 2010a p. 4). The Pilgrim Vegetation Management Project’s Road
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

37

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Analysis documents the analysis of some roads within the Elk project boundary and provides
recommendations for changes to the FTS to reduce the open road density. A similar process evaluated the
remainder of the system and unauthorized routes in the project area during identification of the purpose and
need for action.
Roads and routes were considered for impacts to wildlife connectivity, stream channels and floodplain
function within the LSR and the meadow at Elk Flat. Additionally the road system and unauthorized routes
were evaluated in the context of broader FTS management with the desired and existing condition described
here.

Desired Condition
The Forest Plan directs providing and maintaining roads per pages 4-16 to 4-17. In particular, it recommends
retaining roads that will be needed for future activities (beyond one season) such as forest health, timber
management, fire protection, recreation management, mining, wildlife and range. Non-inventoried roads
[unauthorized routes] would be analyzed to determine whether they should be added to the transportation
system or obliterated as time and funding allow.
In identifying the desired condition and the need for action, the forest- wide goals for facilities, including
roads, were reviewed:
Goal 8: Manage the Forests' transportation system to facilitate resource management activities, protect
wildlife, meet water quality objectives, and provide recreational access (page 4-4).
Goal 9: Provide and maintain those administrative facilities that effectively and safely serve the public
and Forest Service work force (page 4-4).
The desired condition is a safe, efficient transportation system in the project area with the minimum road
density needed to meet administrative, recreational, and cultural access needs while protecting natural
resources (Forest Plan, 1995 pp. 4-4, 4-16, 4-17). Open road density would only include FTS roads that are
open to vehicle use as designated on the Forest Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM). Unauthorized routes not
needed for the FTS system would be restored to a natural condition (USDA-FS, 2010a p. 4).

Existing Condition
The 18.64 miles of existing road system provides access to old landing locations, plantations and adjacent
private inholdings. Maintenance levels can indicate an approximate average cost of maintenance per mile.
Roads are typically closed for resource protection, cost-efficiency and to reduce open road density. Closed
roads may be opened and made available for resource management as needed, then closed again. The project
area contains an approximate FTS open road density of 2.72 miles per square mile.
Approximately 6.5 miles of unauthorized routes exist in in the project area. A 0.1-mile segment of an
unauthorized route accesses a popular dispersed recreation area on the edge of Elk Flat meadow. Currently the
route is not approved for motor vehicle use on the MVUM, preventing legal motorized access to the area.

Proposed Action
Introduction and Summary
The Proposed Action (PA) was developed to meet the purpose and need for action by moving the existing
conditions toward desired conditions. The PA is briefly introduced here in Chapter 1 as a qualitative
description of the types of activities proposed to achieve the Purpose and Need for Action. Chapter 2 presents
the PA and alternatives to it in detail, including the connected actions, geographic locations, scale, and
38

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

timeframes of the actions along with the required Resource Protection Measures (RPMs) and Monitoring. 18
Silvicultural prescription details and unit-specific information is provided in Appendix B.
The interdisciplinary team incorporated guidance from the Forest Plan, the LSRA, and the Northwest Forest
Plan along with management recommendations from the Edson and Mt. Shasta WAs, the National Fire Plan
and the Forest’s Fire Reference System in developing the PA. 19 The PA is an incrementally modified version
of the original Proposed Action as presented in public scoping and the notice of intent. The original PA was
dropped from detailed consideration (see p. 117). The incremental changes to the PA are listed in Appendix H.
This Modified PA is presented as Alternative 1.
The PA falls into five broad categories that may contain overlapping treatments:
6. Forest Restoration Treatments – Thinning, with site-specific prescription elements, reforestation
and adaptive management strategies.
7. Fire Restoration and Fuels Reduction Treatments – Piling, pile burning and underburning.
8. Meadow Restoration – Meadow vegetation enhancement, with reintroduction of fire
(underburning) and restoration of hydrologic function through road decommissioning and
recontouring.
9. Hydrologic Function and Soils Restoration –Floodplain recontouring, decommissioning
unauthorized routes that intersect stream channels, forest restoration (thinning and revegetation in

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Decision Framework
After reviewing this environmental impact statement and supporting documents, and considering all public
input on the project, the Forest Supervisor of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest will decide whether to
implement the Proposed Action as described, select another action alternative that meets the purpose and
need, or take no action. The decision would be in accordance with Forest Plan goals, objectives, and desired
future conditions.
If an action alternative is selected, the decision would specify:
When proposed activities could begin and whether there are any time restrictions,
How roads in the project area would be managed,
What mitigation and monitoring requirements would take place.

Public Involvement
Under 36 CFR 215, the Notice of Intent (NOI) was published in the Federal Register on February 28, 2013. 20
The NOI asked for public comment on the proposal by April 1, 2013 (USDA-FS, 2013). In addition, as part of
the public involvement process, the agency prepared a scoping document that was mailed to interested
individuals, organizations and agencies on February 14, 2013 (USDA-FS, 2013b). A Notice of Intent was
published in the Redding Record Searchlight on February 27, 2013 and March 3, 2013. Public meetings were
held March 5 and March 26, 2013 in McCloud and Mt. Shasta. The Forest Service received 11 comment
letters or emails. Appendix C summarizes the scoping effort, results and responses to scoping comments.
Outside of the formal scoping period, the Forest has reached out to the public, resource and other agencies
and Tribes for input on the Elk Project since 2010:
•

Schedule of Proposed Actions (SOPA) – Status and basic information about the Elk project has been
continually listed in the Forest’s SOPA since January 2010 (USDA-FS, 2010-2015).

•

Field Trips – As a potential stewardship contract project, the proposed action was developed
collaboratively (USDA-FS, 2008). The Elk Late Successional Reserve Enhancement Project
Stewardship Collaborative Working Group hosted by the Shasta Valley Resource Conservation
District (RCD) conducted two field trips to the project area in 2012 for stewardship collaboration
feedback during project development. Working Group members represent various agencies,
organizations, neighboring landowners and Tribal governments with a stake in implementation of a
stewardship project in the area. Field trips took place on July 26 and August 9 and project feedback
was collected and considered during development of the Proposed Action (RCD, 2012).

•

Tribal Consultation – Tribal Consultation information is provided in Chapter 3 (see p. 236).

•

FWS Consultation – FWS consultation is summarized in the Chapter 3 wildlife section and detailed
in Appendix E).

20

Subsequent to scoping, the regulations changed making the project subject to 36 CFR 218, Subparts A and B.
Pursuant 36 CFR 218, only those who submit timely project-specific written comments regarding a proposed project or
activity during a public comment period are eligible to file an objection. Individuals or representatives of an entity
submitting comments must sign the comments or verify identity upon request.

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit Open Houses –Elk Project information was made available along
with the opportunity for discussion at annual open houses in 2014 (February 5 and 6) and in 2015
(February 10 and 12) in McCloud and Mt. Shasta.

Issues
The project’s interdisciplinary team (IDT) sorted the issues into two groups: key and non-key issues. The IDT
identified key issues as those directly or indirectly caused by implementing the proposed action. Non-key
issues were identified as those that are: 1) outside the scope of the proposed action; 2) already decided by law,
regulation, Forest Plan, or other higher level decision; 3) irrelevant to the decision to be made; or 4)
conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)
NEPA regulations explain this delineation in Sec. 1501.7, “…identify and eliminate from detailed study the
issues which are not significant or which have been covered by prior environmental review (Sec. 1506.3)…”
Appendix C provides the comments. The IDT identified the following key issues. Issues are paraphrased from
the sometimes lengthier or duplicative comments.

Issue 1 – Large Trees and Snags
Large tree and snag removal and group selection logging directly harms forest health and latesuccessional ecosystems in Late-Successional Reserves, Riparian Reserves and Critical Habitat; prevents
rather than facilitates forest succession processes; and is not consistent with the Northwest Forest Plan.

Discussion and Indicators
While the commenter did not define “large tree,” two alternatives are responsive to the issue of harvest tree
size selection. Alternative 6-Limit Harvest to Trees Less than 10 Inches in Diameter, suggested by a
commenter, limits tree removal to those under 10 inches DBH and is described on page 119. It is eliminated
from detailed study because modeling the stands shows that while it would reduce fuel ladders in the shortterm, it would not meet the need to reduce the risk of late-successional habitat loss due to overstocking that is
ongoing in the project area, nor would it sufficiently reduce existing standing and dead fuels. Similarly,
Alternative 8-Limit Harvest to Trees Less Than 20 Inches in Diameter within the Elk Flat Late-Successional
Reserve, described on page 120, is responsive to this issue. This alternative was dropped from detailed
consideration because preliminary modeling showed it would not meet the purpose and need for action for the
same reasons as Alternative 6, with the exception that it would still meet the meadow restoration purpose and
need since Elk Flat meadow is in Matrix.
The discussions for Alternatives 6 and 8 provide rationale for why these alternatives were dropped from
detailed consideration. The Modified Proposed Action is summarized as it relates to larger trees and snags and
the corresponding effects on forest health, late-successional ecosystems in the Elk Flat LSR, designated
critical habitat for NSO, successional processes and compliance with the Northwest Forest Plan. Chapter 3
(starting p. 124) provides the effects analysis related to this issue. Indicators and measures specific to effects
to large trees and snags are:
c. number of trees greater than 24 inches DBH immediately post-treatment and projected in 20 years
based on comparative modeling of the alternatives,
d. number of snags greater than 20 inches DBH projected in 20 years based on comparative modeling.

Issue 2 – Road Construction
Road construction directly harms forest health and wildlife and results in long-term impacts to soil health
and productivity.

44

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Discussion and Indicators
This issue is interpreted to pertain only to temporary road construction because the Modified Proposed Action
(Alternative 1) does not include new permanent road construction. 21 Alternative 2 (considered in detail) and
Alternative 9 (considered but not in detail) respond to this issue.
Alternative 9-No New Temporary Road Construction, discussed on page 120, was not considered in detail due
to concerns with project feasibility, potential environmental harm, and meeting Forest Plan Visual Quality
Objectives. The discussion for Alternative 9 provides rationale for why this alternative was not considered in
detail.
Alternative 2 - No New Temporary Road Construction Other than Those Required for Landing Use/Access
limits rather than eliminates new temporary road construction.
Chapter 3 (starting pp.208 and 225) provides the effects analysis related to this issue. Indicators specific to
road impacts are:
e.
f.
g.
h.

miles of new temporary road construction,
total open road density post-implementation in comparison to No Action,
miles of existing unauthorized route decommissioning, and
acres meeting soil quality standards post-implementation.

Forest Transportation System roads are not considered within the soils resource under the Forest Plan (pp.
Appdx. O-2).

Issue 3 – Critical Habitat
Treatments within designated critical habitat for the northern spotted owl violate the 2011 Revised
Recovery Plan and the 2012 Final Critical Habitat Rule for the Northern Spotted Owl.

Discussion and Indicators
Alternative 3 -No Treatments of Natural Stands within Designated Critical Habitat for the Northern Spotted
Owl is responsive to this issue and is considered in detail. As Recovery Plans are not regulatory, they cannot
be violated. However, as described earlier in this Chapter, Forest Plan standards and guidelines direct that the
Forest maintain or enhance habitat for threatened, endangered, and sensitive (TE&S) species consistent with
individual species recovery plans (p. 4.30).
Emphasizing the protection and enhancement of the forest vegetation conditions and elements that serve as
suitable habitat for late-successional dependent species (including the NSO) is integral to the Purpose and
Need for Action and Forest Plan management direction. The predicted effects on NSO, all suitable habitat,
dispersal habitat as it relates to connectivity, and designated critical habitat are analyzed for all alternatives
considered in detail to measure the achievement of the Purpose and Need. This information is summarized in
Chapter 2 (
Table 29, p. 94) and in Chapter 3 in the Wildlife section.
The indicators specific to this issue are as follows:
a. acres of critical habitat, per primary constituent element, maintained/benefitted in NSO core areas,
home ranges and the project area,
21

One existing FTS road will be reconstructed.

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

45

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

b. acres of critical habitat, by primary constituent element, degraded, downgraded or removed through
treatments in NSO core areas, home ranges and the project area,
c. acres of suitable and dispersal habitat projected in 20 years within critical habitat, and
d. acres of capable habitat projected within 20 to 30 years within critical habitat.
These issue indicators are used to measure the scale of how the alternatives considered in detail meet the
management guidance, and the special management considerations for critical habitat subunit ECS-3, in the
2012 Final Critical Habitat Rule for the Northern Spotted Owl.

Issue 4 – Mushroom Collection in Elk Flat
There will be negative impacts to Boletus mushroom growth and collection activities within Elk Flat.

Discussion
Alternative 5, No Treatments in Elk Flat Meadow, described on page 117 is responsive to this issue. It is not
considered in detail because it would not meet the Purpose and Need for Action of meadow restoration in Elk
Flat. The discussion for Alternative 5 provides rationale for why this alternative was not considered in detail
and summarizes the protections integrated into the Modified Proposed Action pertaining to edible
mushrooms.
Chapter 3 provides the analysis of effects to edible mushrooms (specifically Boletus habitat) in Elk Flat, for
all alternatives considered in detail, and as compared with the no action alternative (see discussion starting on
p. 186).

Issue 5 – Machine Piling
Machine piling has disproportionately harmful impacts on watershed and soil resources.

Discussion and Indicators
Alternative 7-Eliminate the Use of Machine Piling within Treatment Units and Substitute Hand Piling,
described on page 119, responds to this issue but was not considered in detail because it is not supported by
the local monitoring data and best available science for soil types within the project area. The discussion for
Alternative 7 provides rationale for why this alternative was not considered in detail and summarizes the
protections integrated into the Modified Proposed Action pertaining to preserving soil productivity.
Chapter 3 provides the analysis of effects to the soil resource for all alternatives considered in detail and as
compared with the no action alternative (see discussion starting on p. 208). Indicators for this issue include:
e. acres of machine piling, and
f. attainment of soil quality standards post-implementation.
Additionally, at the watershed scale, both qualitative and quantitative (Equivalent Roaded Area) analyses
include disturbance from machine piling by alternative. Each action alternative is compared to the No Action
alternative (see discussion starting on p. 193).

Other Related Efforts
There are no related actions that will affect the Proposed Action or Purpose and Need for Action.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 2. Alternatives, Including the Proposed Action
Chapter 2 describes the Proposed Action and compares the alternatives to the Proposed Action considered for
the Elk project. It includes a description of each alternative considered. The Proposed Action in Chapter 2 is a
description of how, how much, and where actions would be implemented
Alternatives are presented as either “Alternatives Considered in Detail” (starting with Alternative 1on p. 57)
or as Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study (starting p. 81).The alternatives are
presented in comparative form, defining the differences between each alternative and providing a clear basis
for choice among options by the decision maker and the public. The Comparison of Actions - Alternatives (p.
76) provides tables comparing the alternatives by the principal actions.
Table 29 (p. 94) summarizes the Chapter 3 analysis of effects to resources, effects related to the Purpose and
Need for Action, and effects pertaining to the key issues.

Description of Actions
All action alternatives include the following actions, but differ in quantity and spatial application of these
actions. General descriptions of the actions, and their tie to the Purpose and Need for Action, are provided
below. Appendix B provides detailed information as needed. Resource Protection Measures (RPMs) common
to action alternatives are listed starting on page 81, required monitoring on page 90, and standard operating
procedures in Appendix D.
Vegetation manipulation and fuels treatments are proposed in concert and are developed consistent with the
guidance in management direction and other informing sources to best address the Purpose and Need for
Action. Processes that historically created late-successional and old-growth ecosystems include (NWFP pp.
B-2): tree growth and maturation; death and decay of large trees; low to moderate intensity disturbances (such
as fire, wind, insects and disease as described) that create canopy openings and gaps in various strata of
vegetation; establishment of trees beneath the maturing overstory trees either in gaps or under the canopy; and
closing of canopy gaps by lateral growth or growth of understory trees (LSRA p. 162). These processes result
in forests moving through different stages of late successional and old-growth conditions that may span
several hundred years.

Forest Restoration Treatments
Forest restoration treatments include thinning and reforestation. Variations and prescription elements are
based on site-specific conditions.

Thinning
Thinning is the selective removal of certain trees to manage overcrowding while retaining desirable attributes
such as large trees and species and structural diversity. Thinning promotes the survival and health of larger
overstory trees while maintaining and developing a variety of habitat conditions within the stands. Thinning
reduces individual tree stress by freeing up resources, such as water, nutrients and available sunlight for the
remaining trees to increase their resilience to drought, disease and insect impacts. Thinning also reduces live
ladder and canopy fuels, increasing a stand’s resilience to high severity wildfire effects.
Thinning is divided broadly by whether the stand is natural or a plantation. Thinning of natural stands
responds primarily to Purpose and Need #1 - Risk Reduction in Early, Mid and Late-Successional Habitat and
Increased Stand Resilience to Disturbance. Plantation thinning responds primarily to Purpose and Need #2 Accelerate Development of Late-Successional and Old-Growth Forest Characteristics and Promote LateSuccessional Habitat Connectivity.
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

47

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Variable density thinning would accomplish thinning treatments for natural stands and some older plantations.
Variable density thinning does not include a singular density target, rather it retains a range of densities by
including unthinned patches (also referred to in some literature as skips), areas of heavy thinning or small
openings (radial release of pine and black oak, gaps, or group selections), and thinning within a target basal
area range elsewhere within the stand.
Thinning prescriptions were specifically developed to reduce the risk of losing habitat for late-successional
species, increase conifer species diversity in plantation areas and natural stands, treat black stain and
Heterobasidion root disease, and reduce the risk of developing future extensive mortality areas. Proposed
thinning prescriptions reduce stand density, break up fuel continuity, promote the healthy growth of residual
trees, and promote species and structural diversity. Residual basal area targets and tree selection criteria retain
canopy cover and habitat elements while addressing the current unsustainable stand densities.
Generally, thinning would leave the largest healthiest trees that are expected to survive long term into the
future, with exceptions for species diversity. Trees to be removed would primarily be midstory intermediate
and smaller co-dominant trees, particularly the shade tolerant white fir that has grown up through the
understory over the last several decades. For example, in some cases white fir that are larger in relation to
adjacent healthy trees of other less common mixed conifer species such as Douglas fir and incense cedar
would be removed to promote species diversity.
Thinning would retain and promote late-successional habitat structures and features while reducing
overstocking, treating fuels, and promoting the survival of pine while maintaining a mix of tree species. Stand
variability is important for providing habitat. Variable density thinning (see discussion under Natural Stand
Thinning below), along with other silviculture prescription elements are designed to support and develop latesuccessional habitat through promoting structure heterogeneity, while addressing undesirable (unsustainable)
stand densities and excess fuels.

Prescription Elements
Specific elements of the thinning prescriptions would be applied in thinning units based on site-specific
conditions including:

Tree Selection
Tree selections will be made per the general marking guidelines as described starting page B-22 and as
applicable for the stand conditions in the treatment unit. Predominant trees are retained across all
prescriptions.

Unthinned Patches
Whether natural stand or plantation, thinning within the LSR includes leaving unthinned patches (UTPs)
within treatment units within LSR allocation to retain variable conditions and stand elements that promote
structural heterogeneity for wildlife and late-successional forest values. Unthinned patches vary in size and
placement, but typically range between 12 and 50 percent of the unit acreage. The UTPs would be selected by
identifying the best available NSO and fisher habitat elements within a unit. Snag retention areas would
comprise the unthinned patches in units with heavy mortality when other valuable features are not available to
retain. See Appendix A page B-24 for more information on unthinned patch designation and Table Appendix
B-2 on page B-6 for unit-specific unthinned patch acreage.

Habitat Roost/Rest Clumps
As available, six roost-rest clumps per acre dispersed throughout the unit boundary would be retained. Habitat
roost-rest clumps are distinct groups of tightly spaced overstory trees and snags, often with late-successional
characteristics and with smaller (less than 10-inch size class) shade tolerant trees growing underneath. These
48

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

clumps can range from a tight group of 3 to 6 trees or snags to 1/10 of an acre. See Appendix A page B-25 for
more discussion.

Radial Release of Predominant Pine
Radial thinning around a maximum of two predominant pine per acre, except unit 157 which is four trees per
acre, would be implemented where it would have the greatest beneficial effect on predominant pine that are
relatively healthy but crowded by advanced second growth trees. Radial thinning generally removes smaller
diameter trees within a 50-foot radius of the bole except for other predominant trees of any species. Radial
thinning would reduce density, remove fuels and promote tree vigor and long term survival of these larger
older trees. See page B-25 for more discussion on radial thinning and Table Appendix B-2 on page B-6 for
unit-specific radial release information.

Biomass Thinning
Biomass-sized trees (4 to 9.9-inch DBH) would be mechanically thinned on a prescribed spacing, or to a
prescribed basal area, in those natural and plantation thinning units that have a biomass thinning component
as listed in Table Appendix B-2 on page B-6. Biomass material that is thinned would either be removed from
the unit or left on site, such as when thinning is accomplished by mastication. Masticated material would
remain on site until to decay or be treated with prescribed fire.

Oak Release
The oak release treatment removes adjacent conifers in an egg-shaped clearing with the long side to the south
of the oak tree (see diagram Figure Appendix B-1 on p. B-27). Predominant trees and dominant trees that
have late-successional characteristics and healthy sugar pine would not be removed. In NSO Critical Habitat,
oak release would additionally retain any 24 inch and larger Douglas-fir, sugar pine or incense cedar.

Aspen Release
To help restore aspen it would be released by removing conifer encroaching within 150 feet. If predominant
conifer or healthy sugar pine larger than 10” DBH are present, up to 10 conifer per acre would be retained
within the 150 foot area (see p.B-27). All predominant conifer would be retained even if in excess of 10 trees
per acre.

Plantation Thinning
Plantation thinning reduces stand density, breaks up fuel continuity and promotes the healthy growth of
residual trees as well as species and structural diversity. Plantation thinning removes trees (other than large
predominant pine) that have been successfully attacked and are dying or likely to die when they are not
needed to meet wildlife snag retention needs. See the detailed description starting on page B-27.

Older Plantation Thin – Plantations 40 Years or Older
The older pine plantations would be thinned to an average of 80 to 100 square feet of basal area to reduce
stand density and retain the largest healthiest pine; however, some areas would have a higher basal area
retained based on site-specific conditions. Group selections ranging from one to two acres (covering
approximately 20% of the stands) would facilitate development of more diverse and resilient stands. Group
selections would contribute to developing a second age class in the six stands where more structural diversity
is needed. The older plantation thinning treatment varies by site specific features such as bordering the Elk
Flat meadow or the presence of black stain or western pine beetle and in some cases also includes
interplanting to address past and ongoing mortality, stocking deficiencies and to promote species diversity.
(See the Reforestation section below for information about planting the group selections.)

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

49

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Young Plantation Thin – Plantations Younger than 40 Years
Young plantation thinning reduces density for plantation development, removes ladder fuels and retains and
promotes species diversity. Young plantation thinning would thin trees 4 inches DBH and larger to 75 to 100
TPA depending on site specific conditions while retaining the healthiest largest trees. Thinning would remove
ladder fuels and promote species and structural diversity.

Thinning of Natural Stands
Natural stand thinning of approximately 60 to 120 year old stands applies a target basal area to each stand
varying between 125 to 175 square feet per acre, but may be higher or lower as listed in Table Appendix B-2
starting on page B-6. Variations in treatment elements are based on site-specific characteristics such as stand
type and predominant species, northern spotted owl and fisher habitat, the presence of aspen, oak or insect or
disease activity. Thinning of natural stands retains some lower and mid story trees and higher densities in
mixed conifer and white fir dominated stands as compared to ponderosa pine stands. Higher densities in the
vicinity of roost/rest clumps would be retained. Other variations include favoring or cultivating species that
are more valuable to NSO and fisher habitat such as Douglas-fir, sugar pine and incense cedar, by creating
small (average 1/10th to 1/4th acre) gaps in white-fir dominated stands to develop structural heterogeneity and
encourage understory development. Habitat diversity would be enhanced through retention of a fairly closed
overstory and understory in patches, retaining trees overstory trees that will make desirable snags to meet
future snag requirements if needed, and retaining dominant trees that meet the criteria (see B-22) which may
result in higher than target basal areas in places.
Where Heterobasidion root disease occurs, one-to two-acre group selections would open the canopy to
facilitate pine regeneration in areas of dense homogenous white fir that have developed as a result of past
management practices and the exclusion of natural frequent fire.

Reforestation
Reforestation through planting of seedlings would promote stand resiliency by planting a mix of species that
include non-host trees for black stain and Heterobasidion root disease and help assure pine reestablishment in
areas where it is lacking. Hand planting would be conducted in mortality openings (Interplanting) and in
group selections (Planting Group Selections) where natural regeneration is not expected to sufficiently
establish within five years of thinning or fuels treatments or where a mix of tree species is desired to promote
diversity or certain species are not expected to establish naturally.
Openings created by mortality pockets between one and two acres would be evaluated post-treatment for
interplanting needs. All group selections regardless of size, and openings created by mortality pockets two
acres or larger would be planted. Table Appendix B-2 (starting p. B-6) lists approximate acres of group
selections and mortality openings in applicable units.
Mechanical site preparation would be implemented as needed in larger openings (generally more than five
acres) to remove competing understory vegetation, such as grass, prior to planting. Mechanical site
preparation is typically completed with a small tractor with a wildland rototiller or drum masticator. Where
mortality openings are smaller (generally less than 5 acres) and less contiguous, site preparation would be
conducted as needed by hand scalping using hand tools.
Planting in areas generally five acres or larger would occur in a pattern of widely spaced clusters or groups of
three to five seedlings, otherwise known as cluster planting, for a total of approximately 250 trees per acre, to
establish seedling dominance in the vicinity of the cluster. Excess smaller saplings adjacent to the dominant
conifers within the clusters may be removed during post-planting monitoring and release treatments. Smaller
openings, generally less than 5 acres, would be planted with up to approximately 150 trees per acre scattered
as individuals throughout the planted area.

Forest Restoration Adaptive Management
Aspen Restoration Adaptive Management
If aspen release monitoring indicates clumps or stands are not actively suckering within three years of conifer
removal, underburning or mechanical soil disturbance treatments (disking) may be used to stimulate
suckering. If aspen monitoring indicates browse damage at a level that may prevent achievement of healthy
aspen establishment, the appropriate type and size of fencing would be installed and removed when no longer
necessary. See pages B-27 for more information.

Salvage Adaptive Management
Under adaptive management, in the event conditions deteriorate further post-decision and post marking,
salvage of dead and dying trees may occur in conjunction with harvest in 12 ponderosa-pine dominated
treatment units (listed in Table Appendix B-2). Areas would typically be within or adjacent to larger mortality
areas, which are the result of the ongoing overstocking, insect or disease problem and RPMs would still apply.

Biomass Adaptive Management for Changed Market Conditions
Biomass (4 to 9.9 inch DBH) material would be mechanically thinned on a prescribed spacing, or to a
prescribed basal area, in those units that have a biomass thinning component (as listed in Table Appendix B-2
on p. B-6). Depending on the market conditions at the time of implementation, material that is 4 to 6.9 inches
DBH may not be mechanically thinned and removed, but instead would be treated on site with a combination
of mechanical treatments, hand thinning or thinned through the use of prescribed fire during the underburning
operations. Modifications to the limits of acceptable mortality for this size class during underburning under
adaptive management are defined in the RPMs (see RPM 24).

Forest Restoration Connected Actions
The following connected actions would be necessary to implement the vegetation treatments described above.
Road actions including connected actions to vegetation treatments are described separately starting on page
55. Hazard reduction in heavy mortality areas along some roads and property lines, including some areas
within thinning units, is connected to fuels and other various actions including thinning, and is described
separately on page 56.

Borate Fungicide
Borate fungicide such as Sporax® or Cellu-Treat® would be applied to stumps over 14 inches in harvested
areas within 4 hours of harvest to prevent the spread of Heterobasidion annosum.

Release of Reforested Areas
Reforestation treatments would be monitored for the need to control competing vegetation such as grasses,
forbs, brush and dense naturally seeded in conifers from the surrounding stand (typically white fir in an area
where ponderosa pine is being reestablished) that could inhibit the survival and growth of desirable seedlings.
Hand or mechanical cutting of competing vegetation may be implemented within the first one to five years
following reforestation, depending on monitoring results. Hand treatments would be most anticipated in the
areas of less than five acres where mechanical site preparation was not utilized.

Fire Restoration and Fuels Reduction Treatments
The following fuel reduction treatments would contribute to meeting the desired condition for fire and fuels
for Purpose and Need #1 (see p. 23). Detailed information is provided in Appendix A starting on page B-35.

Underburn
Underburning or broadcast burning (burning in a stand with little or no overstory, such as the meadow
restoration units) involves a prescribed burn utilizing a low to moderate intensity fire, often under a timber
canopy. 22 Due to the high degree of departure from the natural fire regime, one burn entry is unlikely to
achieve the objective of returning the natural role of fire to the ecosystem. Instead, 2 to 3 incremental
underburns, repeated every 5 to 10 years would be implemented. 23 The entire area would not be underburned
in any one year, contributing to a diverse mosaic of treated area conditions. Achieving underburning
treatments would require the following connected actions:
•

Heavy concentrations of natural or activity-generated coarse woody debris would be machine piled
and piles would be burned as a pretreatment before underburning to limit adverse fire severity effects
to wildlife habitat and overstory trees.

•

Natural and activity-generated fuels would be ignited by ground crews or aerial ignition and burned
with a low to moderate intensity surface fire, creating a mosaic of vegetative retention.

•

Naturally ignited fires moving across the project area could accomplish second and third entry
underburning objectives.

Machine Pile and Pile Burn
Where there are heavy concentrations of coarse woody debris, typically more than 40 tons per acre (or as
specified by the Project RPMs), machine piling and burning of some piles would be utilized as a pretreatment
before underburning to increase consumption of excess fuels over what underburning would accomplish and
to limit adverse effects to overstory trees and wildlife habitat.
•

Treatment-generated and natural fuels in excess of desired retention levels would be piled with
mechanized equipment such as an excavator or tractor with a mounted brush rake or grapple designed
to minimize soil disturbance.

•

Piling will focus on the high fuel load/mortality pockets and machine piling passes will be limited to
the extent needed to reduce fuel loads to the levels described in the resource protection measures.

•

Treated areas would not be rigorously cleaned of slash material, and duff materials would be largely
left in place for soil cover and erosion protection consistent with Forest Soil Quality Standards (Forest
Plan p. Appdx. O), RPMs and BMPs.

•

Piles would be burned when there is low fire danger and per the project burn plan, which is designed
in compliance with the RPMs.

22

The terms “underburning” and “broadcast burning” may be used interchangeably in this document and the project
record in general.

23

While 2 to 3 underburn entries are anticipated to fully restore the natural fire regime, the acreages in the Alternative
summaries reflect the total acres to be underburned and are not multiplied for possible repeat entries.

Fuels Modifications for Site-Specific Conditions
Extensive Mortality Area (EMA)
An approximately 79-acre area of contiguous pine mortality within five units where hazardous conditions
from the numerous snags present a safety concern to project implementers, the general public and the project
area. To reduce the hazard, the Extensive Mortality Area would be burned (see discussion of underburning
above) to reduce heavy fuels, most likely utilizing aerial ignition techniques since it is unsafe to put
firefighters on the ground or conduct other machine-based fuels reduction within this area. It is anticipated
burning the EMA would achieve a 70-80% reduction in hazard trees with an expected 20% low intensity, 50%
moderate intensity, and 30% high intensity burn. The Extensive Mortality Area fuels subunit overlays the
underlying thinning units, however, no thinning will take place within it.
Extensive Mortality Area Adaptive Management - If conditions at the time of treatment are unsafe for
thinning operations in all or portions of the remainder (outside of the Extensive Mortality Area) of the five
units, a combination of felling and machine piling as feasible to provide operational safety, and burning would
be employed as an adaptive management strategy. The Extensive Mortality Area is not listed separately in
Table Appendix B-2 or Table Appendix B-3 but enhances the treatments already described for the underlying
units.

Fuels Connected Actions
The following connected actions would be necessary to implement the fuels treatments described above.
Hazard reduction in heavy mortality areas along some roads and property lines, including some areas where
fuels actions takes place, is connected to the fuels actions, as well as the vegetation actions, and is described
separately on page 56.

Fireline Construction
Control lines to prevent prescribed fire from entering private lands or to manage prescribed fire within the
project area would be constructed by hand crews or small to medium crawler tractors where existing barriers
are not available. Rehabilitation of control lines post-burning includes dragging the bermed material, brush,
and small trees back over the line. See page B-35 for more detail.

Meadow Restoration
Meadow restoration includes a combined suite of actions of meadow enhancement treatment, aspen release
and aspen restoration adaptive management, underburning in the meadow, hydrologic function restoration at
Elk Flat, and meadow restoration connected actions.

Meadow Enhancement
Thinning for meadow enhancement within and surrounding Elk Flat is different from thinning a forested stand
in that there is no target density level such as a desired basal area or spacing. Rather than manage for a
forested stand, the intent is to create conditions more reflective of those found historically; namely few
scattered pine within an otherwise open meadow. A tree’s size, age and position – both within the meadow
and in relation to adjacent trees, are considerations when selecting trees for retention or removal.
Predominant trees would be retained. All other trees that have grown into and along the meadow edges would
be removed. A basal area of approximately 60 square feet per acre of the largest diameter trees would be
retained where the meadow transitions into natural stands and young plantation stands along the edge. This
thinning prescription would create a ‘feathered’ effect of few trees within the meadow, transitioning to an
open forest stand along the meadow’s edge. Within 100 feet of the meadow’s edge, young plantations would
be thinned to a lower basal area/trees per acre to achieve the ‘feathered’ effect (see description in Young
Plantation thinning in Appendix A starting on page B-28).

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Aspen Release and Aspen Restoration Adaptive Management in Elk Flat
Aspen encountered in Elk Flat meadow would be released by conifer removal consistent with the meadow
enhancement prescription for conifer removal.

Broadcast Burning in the Meadow
Prescribed burning would be utilized every five to ten years after initial treatments to maintain the meadow as
described for underburning (below), mimicking the effects of a historic natural fire regime and serving as an
important tool in restoring and enhancing ecological function and processes by promoting soil nutrients, grass
and forb regeneration. While prescribed fire would be employed across Elk Flat, it is recognized that
vegetation varies; some areas of the meadow will carry fire readily while other areas may not Prescribed
burning is described below in “Underburn”.

Hydrologic Function Restoration at Elk Flat
Within Elk Flat meadow, hydrologic function would be restored through the decommissioning of
unauthorized routes as described in Hydrologic Function actions below, to restore overland sheetflow and
infiltration in the floodplains to restore groundwater storage to a more natural condition.

Meadow Restoration Connected Actions
Meadow restoration treatments would include the connected actions for road maintenance and borate
fungicide described under Forest Restoration above.

Hydrologic Function and Soils Restoration
Stream Flow, Water Table Elevation, and Riparian Vegetation Restoration
The following hydrologic and Riparian Restoration actions meet the Purpose and Need of improving
streamflow, water table elevation and vegetation conditions within Riparian Reserves associated with Ash and
Swamp Creeks and their tributaries (also see p. 33 and Appendix A starting on p. B-39):
•

Recontouring - The Ash and Swamp Creek floodplains would be recontoured to restore portions of
reaches previously disturbed in past activities. Heavy equipment would recontour existing landings,
skid trails and unauthorized routes. Low profile/embedded woody debris structure would be added by
burying woody debris on the floodplain.

•

Decommissioning - Unauthorized routes and old landings that interact with creeks and divert or
capture runoff or prevent floodplain function would be decommissioned to a natural grade to help
promote infiltration, natural water table elevation and floodplain function.

•

Riparian Revegetation - Restored, recontoured and thinned areas within Riparian Reserves would be
planted with hardwood, riparian, or mesic species native to the area and most appropriate for the
location to help restore riparian vegetation and strengthen streambanks.

•

Thinning treatments within Riparian Reserves would retain current stand densities for terrestrial
shading and thermal regulation in some locations and in other locations, reduce densities and shade to
promote development of riparian understory, stream bank stabilizing vegetation such as willow and
near-stream shading.

Windrow Respreading
Windrows would be respread using equipment such as a small tractor with a blade to redistribute top soil
more evenly (P&N #2 starting p. 9).

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Transportation System Management and Road and Landing Actions
The following road actions respond to the Purpose and Need for action directly or are connected actions
necessary to implement treatments to meet the Purpose and Need for Action, or both. Existing FTS roads,
existing routes and temporary roads would provide access for harvest operations. Most roads are suitable for
hauling forest products with pre-haul maintenance. Appendix A provides road-specific information in Table
Appendix B-5 on page B-41.

Addition to the FTS
A 0.10 mile segment of unauthorized road U41N10A in the Matrix land allocation would be added to the
system as a maintenance level 2 road, and maintained under action alternatives. The road will remain open
after completion of the project. As noted in the Purpose and Need (See #6 on page 37), road U41N10A is
needed for current and long-term management objectives as recommended by the Travel Analysis Process
completed for the Elk Project (Bonivert, 2015a p. Appdx. X).

Transportation Connected Actions
Maintenance
Roads used in implementation of the project would be actively maintained to standard during use.
Maintenance activities can include grading, resurfacing, culvert cleaning, hazard tree removal, snow plowing,
and slide removal (36 CFR 220.6(d)(4) as well as dust abatement as needed. Roads requiring additional
actions such as reconstruction or closure would also be maintained. Also see Appendix A starting page B-43.

Reconstruction
One road, the 41N01YB, totaling approximately 0.27 miles, is proposed for reconstruction entailing clearing
and brushing, and surface reconditioning. The work required to restore 41N01YB will focus on restoring the
road to usable condition. No surface upgrades are proposed. Also see Appendix A page B-44.

Closure
Maintenance level 1 (see footnote 106 on page 43 for explanation of Maintenance Levels) roads would be
temporarily opened for access to treatment units, then at completion of the project, reclosed to vehicular
traffic by blocking the entrance utilizing installation of an earthen berm, a guardrail barricade or natural
obstacles with consideration for cost, effectiveness and resource protection. A detailed description of closure
is provided in Appendix A on page B-47.

Temporary Roads and Landings
Temporary roads in thinning and meadow enhancement units across the project area would be used or
constructed to provide access for harvest operations. To avoid new disturbance and as feasible, unauthorized
routes would serve as temporary roads rather than constructing new temporary roads when feasible. Sections
of unauthorized routes used as haul routes would be improved for equipment access and hauling as needed.
Once project operations are completed temporary roads would be decommissioned. Given the generally flat
terrain, temporary roads would require minimal construction measures. The need for more extensive work
such as cuts and fills or drainage structures is very limited. Table Appendix B-5 lists unauthorized routes that
would be available for use as a temporary road and then decommissioned at the end of the project.
Landings averaging approximately 0.75 acres would be used or constructed to facilitate the transfer of
materials from treatment units to trucks for hauling. All new landing locations would be preapproved.
Existing landings would be utilized when operationally feasible and if in compliance with RPMs; legacy
landings in Riparian Reserves will not be utilized and all new landings will be constructed outside of Riparian

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Reserves. Landings and skid trails would be decommissioned when no longer needed for the project (see
Decommissioning below).
Also see RPMs 13 on page 84, 14 on page 84, 15 on page 84, 45a on page 90, and more detail in Appendix A
page B-44.

Decommissioning
Existing unauthorized routes including those unauthorized routes used as temporary roads, new temporary
roads, landings and main skid trails would be decommissioned at the completion of the project. 24
Decommissioning typically involves physically blocking the entrance at a minimum to allow natural
revegetation, and may also include ripping to promote natural revegetation and restoration, and water bars to
prevent erosion when necessary, including the necessary cleanup work. Decommissioning of existing
unauthorized routes helps implement the Purpose and Need for Action (See #6 on page 37), while the
construction, use and decommissioning of new temporary roads is necessary to implement the Proposed
vegetation treatment actions and protect the resources. The extent of decommissioning activities would be
contingent on the extent of construction disturbance. Typically, the entrance would be blocked, drainage
patterns restored and the temporary road surface disturbed to break down compaction and allow the
reestablishment of vegetation. Decommissioned roads and routes do not receive maintenance. A detailed
description of decommissioning is provided in Appendix A on page B-47.

Other Connected Actions
Hazard Reduction
Hazard Reduction is a connected action to the vegetation and fuels treatments described above to increase
safety during implementation in areas of particularly high mortality that are near roads, or near property lines
that also have fire line construction. Hazard Reduction is shown on the alternative fuels maps. All snags
would be felled as a connected action for project implementation within 150 feet of some system roads and
300 feet of private property in units 158, 159, 162, 175, 176, 179, 204 and 206 to improve safety during
implementation. Felled snags would be removed as sawlogs or biomass material if feasible, or through
machine piling and burning. Hazard Reduction treatment is not listed separately in Table Appendix B-2 or
Table Appendix B-3 but enhances the treatments already described. Elsewhere on the project, where snags
pose a hazard to the public or operations, snags would be felled. Coarse woody debris including any felled
snags would be retained at levels described in RPM 40, p. 89.

Implementation and Compliance Requirements
Implementation would require numerous routine connected actions such as a burn permit and smoke
management plan in compliance with Siskiyou County regulations, a California Water Quality Control Board
Conditional Waiver of Waste Discharge (CVRWQCB, 2010), (All timber sales that may have the potential to
impact water quality are evaluated, identified and monitored and reported by the forest service and the state
under a Conditional Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements to assure BMPs are applied to prevent impacts
to water quality (CVRWQCB, 2010).) routine contract administration for elements of the proposed action
completed through various contractual mechanisms and hauling of harvest material to mills and cogeneration
facilities. All connected actions not specifically detailed in the discussions above are standard operating
procedures.
24

The Forest Plan directs the dedication of no more than 20 percent of the land harvested by uneven-aged systems be
dedicated to non-productive purposes such as roads, trails, landings, etc. Appendix O defines detrimental soil disturbance
for compaction as porosity less than 90 percent of the total porosity found under undisturbed or natural conditions.

Alternatives Considered in Detail including Resource Protection
Measures and Monitoring
The proposed action as scoped in February 2013 and described in the Notice of Intent (NOI) (USDA-FS,
2013) was incrementally modified by corrections incorporated to address rapidly changing conditions in the
project area, ongoing tribal and federal agency consultation, typographical errors in the scoping materials, and
refinement or clarification of the descriptions of actions. This modified Proposed Action is considered in
detail as Alternative 1. Additionally, the No Action Alternative (Alternative 4), and two action alternatives
(Alternative 2 – No New Temporary Road Construction, and Alternative 3 – No Treatments in Natural Stands
in Northern Spotted Owl Critical Habitat) were developed in response to the key issues raised during scoping
and are considered in detail.

Alternative 1 - The Modified Proposed Action
The Modified Proposed Action (Alternative 1) and the Alternatives to it are described here and summarized
starting on page 76.
Alternative 1 is the Modified Proposed Action and the Agency Preferred Alternative. The proposed treatments
would be implemented through a combination of commercial and non-commercial thinning using mechanical
and hand methods. In addition to thinning activities, existing natural and activity generated fuels within the
entire project area would be treated with a combination of machine piling and burning given the size and
amount of existing and expected future down fuel, hand piling in sensitive areas such as EEZs or historic
properties as needed, (see RPMs 1c and 11) lop and scatter, or underburning (or any combination thereof) to
meet the desired condition for fuel load objectives and begin the process for returning natural fire to the
landscape.

Forest Restoration and Meadow Enhancement Treatments
Table 7 on page 59 summarizes the Alternative 1 Forest Restoration treatments listed below. Also see the
description of forest and meadow restoration treatments starting on page 47. The restoration of the natural fire
regime and hydrologic functions for Meadow Restoration are included in those section below. This section
includes the Meadow Enhancement portion of Meadow Restoration.

Thinning
Alternative 1 thins approximately 2,190 acres of units in which approximately 1,859 acres are treated
(thinning treatments occur within the unit boundaries but not in the unthinned patches that are also within the
unit boundaries, therefore thinning treatment acres or harvest acres are less than unit acres) as follows:
•

Natural Stand Thinning – Alternative 1 applies natural stand thinning to 1,526 unit acres in which
1,273 acres outside of the UTPs will be treated. See the description of Natural Stand Thinning starting
on pages 50 and B-31.

•

Plantation Thinning – Alternative 1 applies plantation thinning to 664 unit acres in which 584 acres
outside of UTPs will be treated. Within these acres, 344 unit acres (303 treatment acres) apply to
older plantations, and 320 unit aces (281 treatment acres) applies to younger plantations.

Table 7 on page 59 further breaks down the natural and plantation thinning by prescription elements. Table
Appendix B-2 (starting p. B-6) lists each unit including all thinning units by alternative. The site-specific
prescription elements are also listed, and implemented as the site-specific conditions within the units are
encountered.

Meadow Enhancement
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

57

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Alternative 1 treats the 518-acre unit 402 with the meadow enhancement prescription described on page 53.
Within the 518 acre unit, 379 acres include harvest activities. Additionally, 56 acres of young plantation
thinning at the edge of the meadow also include an altered thinning prescription within 100 feet of the
meadow as described on page B-28, to feather the meadow enhancement into the plantation.
Unit 401, treated under the Pilgrim project in 2012 25 will also receive underburning under the Elk project to
further enhance meadow characteristics and is included in the Project area. Unit 401 underburning acres are
included in the underburning-only units described below.

Adaptive Management Strategies
•

Biomass Adaptive Management for Changed Market Conditions - Biomass (4 to 9.9-inch DBH)
material will be mechanically thinned on a prescribed spacing, or to a prescribed basal area, in those
units that have a biomass thinning component (as listed in Table Appendix B-2). Depending on the
market conditions at the time of implementation, material that is 4 to 6.9 inches DBH may not be
mechanically thinned and removed, but would be treated on site with a combination of mechanical
treatments, hand thinning or thinning through the use of prescribed fire. Modifications to the limits of
acceptable mortality for this size class during underburning under adaptive management are defined
in the RPMs (see RPM 24, Table 28, p.86).

•

Salvage Adaptive Management - Alternative 1 applies salvage adaptive management to 811 acres in
12 ponderosa pine-dominated units as listed in Table Appendix B-2. Additional dead and dying trees
may be salvaged during harvest operations as approved by the Forest Service if mortality expands
between the unit layout and when a unit is closed during operations.

•

Aspen Restoration Adaptive Management - As described on pages 51, and B-34, Alternative 1
releases aspen whenever it is encountered in a thinning or meadow enhancement unit through
application of the marking guidelines. Thinning units 157, 175 and 402 are known to contain aspen.
Under adaptive management, if aspen monitoring fails to show a positive establishment within three
years then underburning or soil disturbance would be utilized to stimulate suckering.

Table 7 Summarizes Alternative 1 vegetation restoration treatments. Part I of the table lists the unit acres,
unthinned patch acres (within the units) and the remaining acres, which are thinned or receive meadow
enhancement conifer removal. Those acres within units receiving thinning or meadow enhancement are listed
as “harvest acres”. Thinning is divided into natural stands and plantations. Within each of these categories, the
table further groups treatments by prescription elements. Part II of the table summarized subtreatment acres
applied under natural stand thinning, plantation thinning, and meadow enhancement. These subtreatment
acres are the actual estimated acres of each subtreatment, not the unit or larger harvest acres unless noted.

25

The Pilgrim Vegetation Management Project (FSEIS ROD January 10, 2011) dry meadow restoration described in the
Pilgrim FSEIS (January 2010) has not been fully completed. Thinning was completed in 2012 however the prescribed
basal area of 80 ft2/ac was not met over the entire unit and some, primarily intermediate trees contribute to a higher basal
area than desired. Removal of all trees under 14” DBH was also not completed; instead they were thinned to a set
spacing. Additional thinning in unit 401 to fully implement the Pilgrim prescription will occur under the Pilgrim Record of
Decision. The Pilgrim Project prescribed 25 acres of underburning in unit 401 which has not been completed. The Elk
project underburns the full 147-acre unit boundary to more fully meet meadow enhancement desired conditions, and the
the underburning is analyzed in the Elk Project.

Reforestation actions are described starting on pages 50 and B-33. Table Appendix B-2 provides individual
unit reforestation actions. Table 8 below provides a summary of reforestation actions for Alternative 1.
Reforestation acres are not spatially new areas, but reflect additional actions on acreages listed in the primary
vegetation or fuels treatments. The second column displays the actual proposed site preparation, planting, and
release acres within larger units (entire units are not proposed for reforestation). Site preparation and release
acres indicate the areas where the need for reforestation actions would be evaluated on a case by case basis.
Some machine piled units are not expected to need additional site preparation treatment and are not included
in the table for site preparation.

26

Unit 152-1 is the exception because the primary prescription puts it in the “Natural Stand Thinning with Radial thin,
Group Selection, and Plant Groups” treatment but it also includes interplanting.
27

Acreage estimates for the subtreatments are the total accumulated when applied in smaller areas where the sitespecific condition that prompts the treatment is encountered. The exception to this is harvest acres were used to estimate
the biomass thinning and borax stump treatments.

28

This figure includes aspen release in association with the Meadow Enhancement Prescription.

Since oaks are widely scattered across a number of natural stand thinning and plantation thinning units, oak release
treatment was not broken down by natural stand or plantation. See Appendix A page A-26 for a list of units known to

Fire Restoration and Fuels Reduction Treatments
Fuels restoration treatments and their connected actions are generally described in the Description of Actions
section (starting p. 51).
•

Underburning - Underburning as described (p. 52) would be completed on 3,482 acres unless
restricted by RPMs. Burning will be completed when weather conditions allow for fire managers to
meet the desired objectives. It is possible that it will take several years to accomplish burning across
the project area. Table Appendix B-2 (starting p. B-6) lists units where underburning-only would be
implemented without prior thinning. The total acres reflect underburning area, without multiplication
for the potential 2 to 3 underburns every 5 to 10 years.

•

Machine Piling - Machine pile and pile burn treatments would occur on up to 1,461 acres as shown in
the Alternative map for fuels and described on page 52. Table Appendix B-3 list units where machine
piling and pile burn treatments may occur to address potentially high fuel loading from ongoing
mortality. The table lists the maximum potential piling acres (unit acres minus the unthinned patches)
and the percentage and acres of each unit estimated to need piling based on field review by the fuels
specialist. Monitoring would determine the actual need and extent of piling at the time of
implementation.

•

Extensive Mortality Area Fuels Subunit - The approximately 79-acre area of contiguous pine
mortality within units 112, 158, 175, 204 and 206 as shown in the alternative map for fuels would be
treated as described (see p. 53).

Table 9 below provides the summary of fuels treatments. Appendix A provides additional detail (p. B-35). The
alternative maps show the fuels prescriptions.

30

The extensive mortality area also covers smaller portions of several adjoining units. The planting acres in the adjoining
units is included within the “interplanting” row of the table.

Fuels Connected Actions (miles)

Road and Landing Actions
Proposed road actions are a combination of those needed to meet the Purpose and Need for Action and those
needed to implement other actions (connected actions). Addition of approximately 1/10th of a mile of
currently existing unauthorized route to the FTS and decommissioning of approximately 6.4 miles of existing
unauthorized routes meets the Purpose and Need for Action. Some road actions for decommissioning
unauthorized routes also meet Purpose and Need related to hydrology as described below. The remainder of
the actions, maintenance, opening and closure, reconstruction and temporary road use and construction are
connected actions. Landing construction and use is also a connected action to facilitate transportation of
harvested material. Alternative 1 requires approximately 78 landings to implement the vegetation treatments.
Of these, approximately 38 already exist and if operationally feasible and approved for use, would be utilized
rather than constructing new landings. Existing landings were identified through a combination of aerial
photography interpretation, field notes and site visitation. Actual use or construction of landings would be
approved on a site-specific basis by the sale administrator specific basis as requested by the timber operator.
Table 10 provides the road and landing summary for Alternative 1. General descriptions of these actions are
provided above in the Description of Actions starting on page 47. Detailed descriptions are provided in
Appendix A including road-specific actions (starting page B-39 and Table Appendix B-5 and Table Appendix
B-6). Refer to the Alternative 1 map for a graphic display, though this map does not display temporary roads
as placement of these roads is subject to agreement with the implementation purchaser in accordance with
resource protection measures.

31

Within the constraints and guidelines detailed by the resource protection measures. There are unthinned patches that
may not be burned or would have no direct ignition, and other sites that will have fire excluded within this total acreage.

Other Connected Actions
Hazard reduction would be implemented on 87 acres in units 158, 159, 162, 175, 176, 179, and 206 as
described on page 56 to improve safety during implementation. Other hazard trees or snags throughout the
project area may also be felled as needed for safety.

Alternative 2 - No New Temporary Road Construction Other than Those
Required for Landing Use/Access
Alternative 2 is responsive to the issue regarding temporary road construction impacts on forest health and
connectivity within the LSR. It is similar to Alternative 1 with the exception that no temporary roads would
be constructed to complete project activities other than to access landings (typically a landing “driveway” is
about 200 feet). Project activities would be completed utilizing the existing FTS roads and existing
unauthorized routes in the project area. Alternative 1 identified the need for approximately 2.9 miles of new
temporary road to complete thinning activities and no new permanent road construction was proposed. This
alternative reduces the ability to mechanically treat approximately 103 acres with a corresponding decrease in
needed landings. All other project design criteria, thinning and fuels treatments and road actions are the same
as Alternative 1. While the total acreage between Alternatives 1 and 2 treated is the same, the difference is
between the treatment types. Despite no new construction of temporary roads under Alternative 2 other than
needed to access landings, the total project area would still be underburned and in accordance with RPMs.
Maintenance and other actions relating to the FTS system would be the same under Alternative 2 as
Alternative 1, however the maintenance would be less intensive due to reduced hauling.

Forest and Meadow Restoration Treatments
Thinning
Alternative 2 thins approximately 2,124 acres of units in which approximately 1,800 acres are treated outside
of UTPs as follows:

64

•

Natural Stand Thinning – Alternative 2 applies natural stand thinning to 1,476 (50 fewer than Alter
native 1) unit acres in which 1,230 acres outside of the UTPs (43 fewer than Alternative 1) will be
treated. See the description of Natural Stand Thinning starting on pages 50 and B-31.

•

Plantation Thinning – Alternative 2 applies plantation thinning to 648 unit acres (16 fewer than
Alternative 1) in which 570 acres outside of UTPs would be treated. Within the total thinning unit
acres, 328 acres (16 fewer than Alternative 1) with 289 treatment acres (14 fewer than Alternative 1)
apply to older plantations. Young plantation thinning is the same as Alternative 1.
Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Table 12 further breaks down the natural and plantation thinning by prescription elements.

Meadow Enhancement
Meadow Enhancement - Alternative 2 treats approximately 25 fewer acres than Alternative 1.

Adaptive Management Strategies
Alternative 2 includes the same adaptive management strategies as Alternative 1. However, individual
adaptive management actions would be reduced if they were to occur in the units where thinning was
eliminated.
Table 12 summarizes Alternative 2 vegetation restoration treatments. It displays information similarly to
Alternative 1. 33 The table also shows the change in Alternative 2 for each row when compared to Alternative

below:
•

Road Maintenance - The miles of roads to be maintained would remain the same as Alternative 1, but
the frequency and intensity of maintenance work would be reduced slightly to account for a slightly
less volume of material to be removed.

•

Temporary Roads - Only temporary roads needed to access landings will be constructed. Temporary
roads constructed to access landings are typically 100 feet to 200 feet and allow landing operations to
take place within a safe distance from the road. Unauthorized routes will be used as temporary roads
as feasible, as they are under Alternative 1. New temporary road construction totals approximately 1.6
miles; 1.3 mile less than Alternative 1

•

Landings – Alternative 2 would require an estimated 70 landings; 8 fewer than Alternative 1.

39

Within the constraints and guidelines detailed by the resource protection measures. There are unthinned patches that
may not be burned or would have no direct ignition, and other sites that will have fire excluded within this total acreage.

Alternative 3 - No Treatments of Natural Stands within Designated Critical
Habitat for the Northern Spotted Owl
Alternative 3 is responsive to the issue regarding the assertion that treatments within designated critical
habitat for the northern spotted owl violate the 2011 Revised Recovery Plan and the 2012 Final Critical
Habitat Rule. Under Alternative 3, no NSO critical habitat would be treated, with the exception of the
thinning and other mechanical treatments proposed in seven plantations (7, 12, 13, 14, 208, part of 15, and
part of 6). No units within critical habitat would be underburned under Alternative 3. In comparison to
Alternative 1, the plantations in critical habitat that are prescribed for machine piling and pile burning would
require additional fireline construction to provide a barrier between the pile burning areas and the surrounding
untreated natural stands. Alternative 3 treats 270 fewer acres with silvicultural harvest than Alternative 1. All
other project design criteria, and thinning and fuels treatments and road actions outside of critical habitat are
the same as under Alternative 1. Plantations in the CHU that are prescribed for machine piling and pile
burning would require additional fireline construction over Alternative 1 to provide a barrier between the pile
burning areas and the surrounding natural stands.

Forest and Meadow Restoration Treatments
Thinning
Alternative 3 thins approximately 1,886 acres of units in which approximately 1,590 acres are treated outside
of UTPs as follows:
•

Natural Stand Thinning – Alternative 3 applies natural stand thinning to 1,222 (304 fewer than
Alternative 1) unit acres in which 1,006 acres outside of the UTPs (267 fewer than Alternative 1) will
be treated. See the description of Natural Stand Thinning starting on pages 50 and B-31.

•

Plantation Thinning – Alternative 3 applies the same plantation thinning as Alternative 1.

Table 17 further breaks down the natural and plantation thinning by prescription elements.

eliminated in critical habitat. Table 17 displays information similarly to Alternative 1. 41 Additionally, changes

Part I of the table lists the unit acres, unthinned patch acres (within the units) and the remaining acres, which are
thinned or receive meadow enhancement conifer removal. Those acres within units receiving thinning or meadow
enhancement are listed as “harvest acres”. Thinning is divided into natural stands and plantations. Within each of these
categories, the table further groups treatments by prescription elements. Part II of the table summarized subtreatment
acres applied under natural stand thinning, plantation thinning, and meadow enhancement. These subtreatment acres are
the actual estimated acres of each subtreatment, not the unit or larger harvest acres unless noted.

Unit 152-1 is the exception because the primary prescription puts it in the “Natural Stand Thinning with Radial thin,
Group Selection, and Plant Groups” treatment but it also includes interplanting.

Acreage estimates for the subtreatments are the total accumulated when applied in smaller areas where the sitespecific condition that prompts the treatment is encountered. The exception to this is harvest acres were used to estimate
the biomass thinning and borax stump treatments.
44

These acres include aspen within the meadow enhancement prescription and all thinning prescriptions.

45

Since oaks are widely scattered across a number of natural stand thinning and plantation thinning units, oak release
treatment was not broken down by natural stand or plantation. See Appendix A page A-26 for a list of units known to
contain oak.

Fire Restoration and Fuels Reduction Treatments
Alternative 3 reduces fuels treatment acres from Alternative 1 by eliminating underburning treatments in the
NSO CHU. The other fuels treatments remain the same including machine piling and pile burning in units 6,
12, 13, and 14. Alternative 3 requires additional mechanical fireline construction to isolate these units from
the surrounding untreated natural stands for the purposes of pile burning. Roads would be used for control
line to prevent the pile burning prescribed fire from entering critical habitat, with the exception of constructed
mechanical fireline south of unit 230 and 6, at their boundary with unit 165, resulting in an overall 0.8-mile
increase in mechanical fireline from Alternative 1. Table 19 summarizes fuels restoration treatments under
Alternative 3 and how that differs from Alternative 1.

46

The extensive mortality area also covers smaller portions of several adjoining units. The planting acres in the adjoining
units is included within the “interplanting” row of the table.

Road Actions
Road action activities under Alternative 3 will be the same as Alternative 1 except for the differences noted
below:
•

Maintenance - The miles of roads to be maintained would be reduced slightly from Alternative 1 by
approximately 0.7 miles. The frequency and intensity of maintenance work would also decrease due
to 304 fewer acres of thinning than Alternative 1.

•

Temporary Roads - Approximately 1.7 miles of existing unauthorized routes within the dropped
treatment units would not be used as temporary roads but would still be decommissioned. The new
construction for temporary roads would drop from 2.9 miles to 1.5 miles. 4.7 miles of UA routes
would be used as temporary roads then decommissioned.

•

Landings – Alternative 3 would require 62 landings, 16 fewer than Alternative 1. Landings in critical
habitat would be reduced.

47

Within the constraints and guidelines detailed by the resource protection measures. There are unthinned patches that
may not be burned or would have no direct ignition, and other sites that will have fire excluded within this total acreage.

Hazard reduction as described in Alternative 1 remains the same.

Alternative 4- No Action
Alternative 4 is the no action alternative. The analysis of the no action alternative provides reviewers a
baseline to compare the magnitude of environmental effects of the action alternatives. Alternative 4 is the
continuation of the existing condition, current management and ongoing activities in the project area. Current
management and ongoing activities in the project area, as permitted under past, current or potential future
NEPA may include road maintenance, hazard tree felling, fuelwood collection, over-snow vehicle use
associated with the Pilgrim Creek Snowmobile Park, dispersed recreation (e.g., sightseeing, hunting), forest
products collection and other permitted special uses. Additional thinning in unit 401 under the Pilgrim
Vegetation Management Project is pending. This analysis includes modeling of stand growth and fire behavior
that is predicted if no new action is taken in the project area. Under no action, no treatments or road actions
would be implemented to accomplish the purpose and need and project resource objectives.

Comparison of Actions - Alternatives Considered in Detail
The tables below provide treatment summaries by alternative. The summaries often represent overlapping
treatments and are not necessarily additive in scale. 49 Appendix B provides detailed descriptions of the actions
and specific treatments by unit (Table Appendix B-2. Starting p. B-6) and road actions (Table Appendix B-5,
p. B-41). Variations in treatments were developed within the broader categories responsive to site specific
stand conditions as described in Appendix B. The alternative maps in 0 graphically display the vegetation,
fuels and road actions.
•

Vegetation Treatments – See Table 22 for thinning and meadow restoration and Table 23 for
reforestation actions.

•

Fuels Treatments – Table 24 (p. 79) lists fuels treatments by alternative.

49

All acres are estimated and in the case of subtreatments actual conditions during implementation may create a range of
acreage. Slight differences in treatment totals throughout the record may exist due to differing rounding methodologies
and subtotals may reflect a slight difference than the sum of the components shown in the summary table due to
rounding.

Forest and Meadow Restoration Treatments
Table 22 displays vegetation treatments including thinning, meadow restoration and adaptive management for
salvage. The table provides harvest acres, which are typically the unit acres minus UTPs, however some units
have smaller harvest areas due to unforested areas within the unit boundary from insect and disease activity or
from natural openings. Table 22 also notes planting within the vegetation subtreatments, and Table 23
provides more detailed information on planting and site preparation.

Resource Protection Measures Common to All Action Alternatives
Resource Protection Measures (RPMs) were developed for site specific conditions relative to the Proposed
Action and are common to action alternatives. Resource Protection Measures are intended to minimize or
eliminate potential environmental effects while achieving the desired condition. Development was guided by
Forest Plan direction as well as other applicable law, regulation and policy; project-specific objectives; and
resource concerns identified by the resource specialists. In addition to RPMs, practices and procedures that
may apply to the Elk Project but are not developed as site specific RPMs including compliance with
applicable law, regulation, policy and Forest Plan Standards and Guidelines (legal and policy framework), and
the standard operating procedures (SOPs) and Best Management Practices (BMPs) developed to meet the
legal and policy framework are included in Appendix D. The design criteria (generally limitations on the
Proposed Action) and design elements (aspects of the Proposed Action) most important to meeting the
Purpose and Need for Action and legal and regulatory framework are described in the Proposed Action
including detailed descriptions in Appendix B. Some listed items originate or respond to multiple
requirements or needs identified for site specific protections.

Cultural Resources
Also see Appendix D on page D-1 for common standard operating procedures for cultural resources.
1. National Register-eligible or unevaluated cultural resource sites (“historic properties”) will be
avoided except within the parameters listed below, which will preserve the National Register
integrity that may occur within these historic properties. Prior to project implementation, historic
properties will be delineated with coded flagging or other effective marking (USDA-FS & SHPO,
2013 pp. 1.1, E-2).
a. Prescribed fire will be excluded from historic properties within the project area using the
following methods:




Non soil-disturbing methods, hand-constructed fire line, and dozer-constructed fire line may
be used around the Ash Creek Mill site.
Non soil-disturbing methods and hand-constructed fire line may be used in the vicinity of
Coonrod Flat.
Non soil-disturbing methods such as fire retardant foam, water, and other wetting agents may
be utilized to protect all other historic properties (USDA-FS & SHPO, 2013 pp. 2.2, (b) A, D,
E, F (pg. E-5) E-2).

b. Fire retardant foam, water, other wetting agents may be utilized to protect at risk historic
properties (USDA-FS & SHPO, 2013 pp. 2.2, (b) A, D, E, F (pg. E-5) E-2).
c. If woody material is removed from historic properties, it will be hand-felled and cut to a size that
can be hand-carried outside the site boundary (USDA-FS & SHPO, 2013 pp. 2.2 (a), E-2) .
Mechanical equipment may be used to reach into the site for larger trees within the treatment unit.
No ground disturbance or an increase in fuel loading from project activities will occur within the
site boundaries. No woody material will be chipped or piled within site boundaries. 53
d. Roads within or adjacent to historic property boundaries may be maintained at their usual
maintenance level within the existing road prism. Activities that are not permitted within the
boundaries of historic properties include road reconstruction activities (unless there is no potential
for subsurface cultural deposits) (USDA-FS & SHPO, 2013 pp. 1.2, E-2; 2.1 (d)(f), E-44).
e. Other activities not permitted include: road widening, realigning, side casting or depositing of any
earthen or vegetative material, new drainage control work such as wing ditch construction,
culvert installation, and equipment staging. Roads that are decommissioned or closed within site
boundaries will be blocked with barriers that do not disturb subsurface deposits or lead to other
effects to sites. Erosion control features such as seeding and mulching may occur within historic
property boundaries where the integrity of the property is unlikely to be affected.
2. Areas of Native American importance will be protected.
a. No treatments will occur within 0.25 miles of Coonrod Flat during July and August when this
area is being utilized by Native Americans (36 CFR 800). Activities such as vegetation treatment,
burning, and maintenance or hauling on adjacent roads will not occur within Coonrod Flat, and
will not occur within ¼ mile during this time, thereby eliminating noise, dust, smoke, and other
disruptive effects. Skidding of felled trees in units 402 and 317 would be completed prior to July
1, and no operations will occur in unit 402 during the month of July.
b. Road closures proposed near areas of Native American importance will be completed using large
boulders, directional felling of trees, and other such barriers to maintain a natural setting.

53

Treatment units have also been designed where possible to exclude site boundaries.

Hydrology and Soils
Also see Appendix D on page D-1 for common standard operating procedures for soil and water resources.
3. Some existing landing piles will not be burned in Riparian Reserves in unit 346. Existing landing
piles selected for specific retention of either water quality or wildlife values will be identified and
designated and will not be burned as determined by the hydrologist or wildlife biologist.
4. Unit machine pile size will not exceed 10 feet long by 10 feet wide by 6 feet tall to protect soils from
destructive burning.
5. Mechanical fireline construction shall only remove litter and duff and avoid removing the upper
layers of the topsoil.

Riparian Reserves (RR), Including Slash Material, Burning Activities and Landings
Also see Appendix D Best Management Practices Starting on page D-4.
6. A minimum 20-foot equipment exclusion zone (EEZ) will be flagged along intermittent and
ephemeral stream channels as determined by the hydrologist and may be increased based on the
hydrologist’s or soil scientist’s site-specific evaluation. This EEZ may be larger, depending on
resource conditions and RR and wildlife objectives for the treatment unit. From the boundary of the
delineated EEZ, equipment may reach in to accomplish treatment objectives. The EEZs may be
entered, if needed, after post-harvest activities are complete, by heavy equipment, to restore
meadow, channel and floodplain functions to areas disturbed from past activities and as determined
by the hydrologist.
7. Minimize soil disturbance in RRs by requiring directional felling and minimizing turning of harvest
equipment. In the event that trees are accidentally felled into Ash Creek or its inner gorge, they will
be left in place.
8. No mechanical site preparation will take place within RRs.
9. There will be no crossing of Ash Creek with equipment during sale activities. Any required
temporary stream crossing locations on other intermittent/ephemeral streams will be designed and
constructed in accordance with the hydrologist’s expertise. If rocking is required to maintain channel
form and reduce compaction in stream crossing(s), the crossing will be rocked with andesite or
basalt and source material would be weed-free. Any material used in crossings will be removed postimplementation and either scattered over the ground, if native, or utilized after the project in road
closures.
10. Within the Elk Flat meadow restoration unit 402, harvest with heavy equipment will be completed
when there is at least 3 inches of frozen ground or in areas where work can be completed over dry
soils that will not result in soil displacement leading to potential significant adverse effects to
meadow, floodplain and hydrologic function.
11. Within RRs, embedded downed logs, stumps and riparian plants and root systems will be retained
during burning operations with minimal (up to 5%) damage. Large decadent willow scattered within
RRs will be allowed to lightly burn with up to 5% mortality. Piles may be burned within the Ash
Creek RR, but no machine piling will occur within the designated EEZ as described in RPM 6. Hand
piles may be constructed and burned 20 feet away from the inner gorge in the Ash Creek RR (Units
18, 106, 107, 113, 150, 154, 157, 163, 180, 346, 347, 402, 152-1, 152-2 and 346-U).
12. Excess slash material from operations or heavy mortality pockets within the Ash Creek RR beyond
that to be retained as prescribed in RPM 40 starting on page 88 may be piled and burned outside of
the EEZ or left in place and treated with underburning.

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

83

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

13. Existing landings will be utilized and no new landings will be constructed within the Ash Creek RR.
An earth scientist or hydrologist would assist the sale administrator in designating any new landing
locations in other units containing intermittent or ephemeral channel RRs.

Landings and Skid Trails
Also Appendix C for common standard operating procedures related to landings and skid trails starting on
page D-2.

14. Till/sub-soil landings and main skid trails within 200 feet of landings with equipment such as a
winged sub-soiler or other tilling device to a maximum depth of 18 inches so that the soil is lifted
vertically and fractured laterally to alleviate any detrimental compaction (Forest Plan pp. 4.25, O2) 54 following completion of management activities in units 162, 164, 166, and 206. Tillage/subsoiling would be completed outside of the tree drip line to minimize impacts to root systems.

Invasive Plant Species 55
Appendix C for common standard operating procedures related to invasive species starting on page D-2.
15. When seeding decommissioned temporary roads, unauthorized routes, landings and main skid trails,
use a native mix of pollinator-friendly forbs and grasses at a rate of 10 to 15 pounds per acre and
mulch with certified weed-free straw, or other approved fine slash to reduce seed predation, retain
moisture, reduce the potential for wind erosion and, if necessary, to reduce overland flow erosion
during rainfall events and snow melt.

Road Management
Also see Appendix C for common standard operating procedures related to road management starting on page
D-3.
16. Road construction and maintenance will be managed for consistency with LSR standards and
guidelines (Forest Plan, 1995 p. 4.39). If temporary roads are necessary to implement project
activities, they will be kept to a minimum, be routed through non-late-successional or low quality
late-successional habitat where possible.
17. If winter snow plowing occurs on FA19 or FA13 beyond the Pilgrim Snowmobile Park between
December 1 and April 15 single lane plowing would be utilized to minimize impacts to winter
recreation opportunities. The timing of this requirement may be adjusted through discussion with the
Recreation Officer on impacts (e.g., periods of low snowfall).

Plant Species of Special Concern
See Appendix C for common standard operating procedures related to sensitive and non-vascular plants on
page D-3. Implement the following pertaining to hardwoods.

54

Compaction is considered detrimental if soil porosity is not at least 90 percent of the total porosity found under
undisturbed or natural conditions. Porosity is evaluated between four and eight inches below the surface for soils with tree
and shrub potential, and between zero and four inches for soils with herbaceous potential (Forest Plan pp. O-1).

55

At the present time, there are no high priority weed populations within the project boundary. However, there is one
known population of a high priority weed along Pilgrim Creek Road near the snowmobile park.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

18. Minimize impacts to California black oak and other hardwoods during thinning and burning
operations as much as practicable. Units known to have oaks include 6, 14, 153, 155, 154, 165, 1681, 168-2, 170, 173, 178, 317 and 318.
19. When burning around aspen (units known to have aspen include 157, 175, 318 and 402): 56
a. Exclude prescribed fire in aspen stands that had conifer removal treatment that are actively
suckering until they are determined to be well established. (see aspen Monitoring starting on page
91 and adaptive management strategy in the proposed action for aspen where the characteristics
of an established aspen stand are described starting on page 51.)
b. When burning surrounding areas exclude fire within 75 feet from the outer edge of the
clump/stand (last sprout) to protect young aspen roots.
c. Point protection will be used to protect small (<0.5 acres) clones. Point protection may include
but is not limited to sprinklers, mechanical fire line, hand line, existing skid trails and roads, or
any other tool determined to be applicable. These tools can also be used on larger stands.
20. When burning within aspen:
a. If needed to control fire intensity, reduce combustible fuels in and around aspen to 5 to 15 tons
per acre by using mechanical or manual methods.
b. Remove young conifer and shrubs if needed, by manual or mechanical means prior to burning;
c. Minimize residency time; implement fast moving prescribed fire.
d. Burn only when soil is moist and surface fuels are dry.
e. Limit mortality of the largest aspen to no more than 5% .
f. Protect the base of live aspen overstory trees from scorch as much as practicable.

Survey and Manage Vascular and Non-Vascular Plants
21. Bryophytes - All known Ptilidium californicum (Pacific fuzzwort) sites will be protected by
designated unthinned patches where no thinning or mechanical equipment operation will occur as
described in the proposed action. Trees would be felled away from occupied sites to avoid physical
damage.
22. Broadcast burning should not occur within occupied Ptilidium californicum (Pacific Fuzzwort). The
occupied site(s) would be buffered to a sufficient distance (approximately 100 feet) such that radiant
heat and smoke will not cause mortality to individuals (Harpel, et al., 2006 pp. 14-15).

Silviculture and Fuels
Also see Appendix C for common standard operating procedures related to silviculture and fuels starting on
page D-3.
23. Within four hours of cutting, conifer stumps greater than 14 inches stump diameter will be treated
with a registered borate compound (such as Cellu-Treat® or Sporax®) to prevent spread of
Heterobasidion root disease. Aplication of the compound will follow all state and federal rules and
will not be applied during precipitation events.
24. Underburning treatments in natural stands would be planned and implemented to meet the prescribed
targets of duff and litter consumption while minimizing mortality of shrubs and trees (displayed in
Table 27 and Table 28) and retaining coarse woody material at levels that meet RPMs 11 40e, 41
and 42, (also see number 17 on page D-3).The target consumptions and maximum mortality levels
are determined as an average across the project area.

56

Unless an established research project pertaining to burning in aspen requires an alteration of methodology.

*If material that is 4 to 6.9 inches DBH is not commercially thinned due to market conditions at the time of
implementation and is instead treated with prescribed fire during the underburning operations with or without
other mechanical or hand treatments, the range of acceptable mortality is 30-50% to meet objectives since the
burning treatment would be utilized to complete the thinning of that size class.

25. Measures will be taken to reduce injury or mortality to large predominant trees during prescribed fire
operations. Potential methods may include but are not limited to:
a. multiple low severity burns to reduce fuels accumulations over time (also see 11 40e, 41 and 42,
(and SOP number 17 on page D-3).
b. burning in conditions of a moist duff layer (subject to limited operating periods in RPMs 31 , 34,
39 and 43), ensuring consumption of the upper layer of litter, while protecting the roots in the
lower duff areas,
c. ignition techniques, such as short head runs, designed to limit residence time at the base of large
trees,
d. pulling duff away from bole damage such as lighting scars and pitch seams that may cause fire to
burn longer or move up into the crown,
e. tree well burning to pre-burn the area immediately surrounding the tree during moist conditions
prior to stand under burning,
f. reducing large down fuels near the base of the tree to limit the heat and residence time for the tree
bole and fine roots, and
86

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

g. mixing duff and litter to encourage fine roots to grow down into the soil prior to underburning or
to bring moisture to the surface to discourage fire from reaching the boles.
26. Prescribed fire in plantations that are not thinned as part of project implementation will be managed
at each entry to minimize mortality to trees to no more than 15% and consumption of shrub, forb,
grass cover and CWD to no more than 10%. No snags will be directly ignited. Utilize firing
techniques or control lines as needed to retain this existing migratory bird habitat and deer forage
and cover, while returning low intensity fire to the landscape. Avoid prolonged duration of fire
within plantations to prevent damage to roots and root collars of trees less than 10 inches diameter at
soil level. Evaluate these protection measures prior to repeated burn entries for current conditions.
27. Prescribed fire in plantations that are being thinned as part of project implementation would be
managed at each entry to minimize mortality to trees to no more than 15% and consumption of
shrub, forb and grass cover to no more than 25 to 50%. Maintain CWD in accordance with RPMs
11, 40e, 41 and 42, (also see number 17 on page D-3).No snags would be directly ignited. The end
result should be a mosaic of burned and unburned shrub and understory vegetation pockets
throughout a treatment unit.
28. Apply prescribed fire only after remaining trees show signs of increased health and vigor. Fuels and
silviculture specialists will assess signs of readiness by evaluating thinning response (release)
indicated by increased increment of spring wood in the radial core or increased foliage or shoot
growth. Adequate response may occur as early as one full growing season following a thinning
treatment in a healthy stand under average precipitation years.
29. During underburning, maintain at least 30% of grass, forbs and shrubs. Evaluate these protection
measures prior to repeated burn entries for current conditions.
30. There will be no direct ignition in unthinned patches in units 123, 152-1, 154, 165, 169, 171, 172,
174, and 235 to reduce fire effects to sensitive and ethnobotanical species and wildlife habitat.

Wildlife
31. A limited operating period (LOP) that restricts ground disturbing activities, loud and continuous
noise and smoke-generating activities within a ¼-mile of known northern goshawk territories is
required between February 1 and August 15. The LOP will also be required if a new territory is
established within, or within ¼-mile of, any treatment unit during project implementation. In any
year of implementation, activities may occur during the LOP if surveys conducted after June 1
determine there are no breeding goshawks within the nest core. Currently, this LOP is required for
units 114, 155, 156, 182, 221, 224, 346 and 346-U. When burning in spring outside of the LOP area,
smoke should be managed so that light to moderate, dispersed smoke may be present within an area,
but dissipates or lifts within 24 hours. Ignition should be discontinued if heavy, concentrated smoke
begins to inundate the area.
32. No mechanical harvest operations, skidding or other ground disturbance (other than prescribed fire
and road actions) will occur within the 200-acre core of northern goshawk territory(ies). 57
33. Northern spotted owl (NSO) surveys, stand searches or spot checks will be conducted prior to and
throughout implementation, consistent with current survey protocol and as discussed and agreed to
with the FWS-FS Level 1 (line officers from both agencies) team on an annual basis.
34. A limited operating period (LOP) for habitat altering, smoke-generating and noise-generating
activities above ambient levels will be required within 0.25-mile of an active NSO nest, and within a
57

No cores currently exist within the project boundary that are subject to mechanical harvest, skidding or other ground
disturbance. This procedure will be followed if a core is established at any time prior to or during implementation.

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

0.25 mile of Nesting/Roosting habitat (units 150 and 168-2, and portions of units 152-1 and 154).
The LOP will remain in effect until surveys, stand searches and/or spot checks are completed during
a year of operations. The NSO LOP begins February 1st and will extend through April 15th, and/or
the completion of surveys, stand searches and/or spot checks if efforts are not completed by April
15th:
a. If no NSOs are detected, operations may commence upon notification from the biologist that
the surveys are negative.
b. If a single NSO is detected, operations may commence after July 9th.
c. If nesting NSOs are detected, the LOP will be remain in effect within 0.25 mile of the nest
through:
1. July 31st for activities that result in noise above ambient levels (e.g., road actions)
2. September 15th for habitat altering/smoke-generating activities (e.g., thinning, machine
piling/burning piles, prescribed fire)
Spot checks are intended to supplement the general project-level surveys and avoid the potential
direct take of spotted owls from project implementation. Based on the survey history for NSOs and
barred owls in the project area, if implementation is underway before February 1st, the spot
checks will occur concurrent with operations. If an NSO is detected during any survey efforts, all
ongoing operations that have a likelihood of direct harm to an NSO or creating above-ambient noise
shall be postponed. When burning in spring outside of the LOP area, smoke should be managed so
that light to moderate, dispersed smoke may be present within an area, but dissipates or lifts within 24
hours. Ignition should be discontinued if heavy, concentrated smoke begins to inundate the area.
35. For all listed LOPs, the wildlife biologist will work with the fuels shop on an annual basis when
developing, or modifying the project’s burn plan.
36. If a new NSO (non-nesting) or barred owl detection occurs prior to or during project
implementation, technical advice or re-initiation with the FWS may be required.
37. Where piling and burning is conducted within NSO and NGO (northern goshawk) foraging habitat,
leave two unburned slash piles per acre to provide small mammal habitat. Pile size can vary as safety
allows, but in general should not exceed 10 feet long by 10 feet wide by 6 feet tall. The project
wildlife biologist and fuels specialist will conduct a review of units after piling is completed to
determine which piles to retain, and if additional piles are needed. If needed, hand piles of smaller
material will be constructed (~1 to 2 additional piles per acre). Applicable units are: 151, 152-1, 154,
157, 158, 159, 160, 163, 164, 165, 166, 169, 174, 181, 201 and 235). While units 175, 204 and 206
do provide for a substantial prey base, notably for goshawk and fisher, it is not operationally feasible
to retain unburned piles in these units that are within the Extensive Mortality Area.
38. No more than 50 percent of the suitable habitat within an NSO core or home range, or a currently
known NGO territory will be burned during any given burn season, or if nesting or resident
NSO/NGO are present, during any 12-month period. In the event that a new NSO activity center or
NGO territory is established, this same design feature will apply to the Burn Plan (see RPM 35).
Applicable units are: 156, 182, 221, 224, 346 and 346-U; 150, 151, 152-1, 152-2, 153, 154, 161,
163, 165, 166, 167, 168-1, 168-2, 170, 171, 172, 173,174 and 178.
39. To minimize direct disturbance to female fishers during their most vulnerable period of denning and
kit rearing, an LOP for vegetation and fuels management activities will extend from March 1
through July 31 around known denning areas and within areas that support denning habitat.
Applicable areas include: units 150, 152-2, 153, 154, 156, 168-2, 182, 221 and delineated areas
along Ash Creek in units 152-1, 157 and 163.
40. Snag and down log retention outside of the meadow restoration units is based on the
recommendations for mixed conifer and white fir vegetation communities in Tables 3-1 to 3-3 of the
88

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

LSRA. These recommendations represent an average for a landscape or treatment area (i.e., 100
acres). Per the LSRA, numbers of snags and down logs can vary on any particular acre (LSRA p.
164).
a. Within thinning and fuels treatment units in LSR, retain, on average, 7 snags per acre ranging
from 15 to 20+ inches diameter with a preference for snags larger than 20 inches or the largest
size class available (LSRA p. 164). Plantation units may or may not contain this level of snags,
and thinning prescriptions were developed with snag objectives as part of the desired condition.
Live trees with decadent late-successional characteristics count towards snag retention
recruitment where snags are not available. While snag removal is not proposed as a treatment in
the majority of the project area, snags may be felled to reduce hazards to the public or during
operations, or to complete specific elements of the proposed action (e.g., group selections within
plantations, hazard reduction zones within 300 feet of specified private property boundaries and
150 feet of designated roads, site preparation for reforestation efforts).
b. Retain Douglas-fir, sugar pine and incense cedar snags larger than 20 inches diameter, safety
permitting.
c. Where safely feasible retain groups of snags in existing mortality pockets. Retained snag pockets
should be at least 150 feet from System roads and 300 feet from private property boundaries.
d. Within thinning and fuels treatment units in LSR and matrix outside of the meadow enhancement
unit 402, maintain and protect existing coarse woody debris from disturbance to the greatest
extent possible (Forest Plan pp. 4.38, 4.61).
e. In accordance with the LSRA, the desired condition is an average of 6 to 10 large down logs per
acre. Retained logs are to be in a variety of decay classes with a preference for 20-inch diameter
logs, or the largest size class available. Within pine dominated stands retain at least 6 logs per
acre, within fir dominated at least 8 logs per acre and within mixed conifer at least 10 logs per
acre. Within the hazard reduction zones, large down log retention would average 4 to 6 per acre.
On average, remaining tonnage will range from 5 tons per acre in size classes less than 3 inches
to 20 to 35 tons per acre for larger diameter logs, depending on location, and is in accordance
with the LSRA (LSRA p. 3.3), the Forest Plan, the Forest Plan habitat capability models and best
available science for maintaining and promoting habitat suitability for the NSO, NGO and fisher.
f. Where safely feasible, retain scattered or concentrations of natural fall and downed wood piles
and 10-20% of the existing shrubs and minor species important for NSO prey base (whitethorn,
bush chinquapin, Scouler’s willow) when conducting site preparation and planting to meet the
condition described above in e. Preference is to retain piles within the interior of the treatment
unit, and not in close proximity (within 50 feet) to main use roads and private property.
41. Within the forested portions of the meadow enhancement unit 402 maintain 15 inch or larger
diameter snags. Maintain an average of 5 tons of unburned coarse woody debris per acre with a
preference for at least 5 logs > 10 feet in length at the largest available diameter (Forest Plan pp.
4.38, 4.61). Maintain scattered conifers or small groups of conifers at a rate of 5 to 20 trees per acre
(LSRA p. 170).
42. To minimize the loss of nesting, roosting, foraging, resting, denning and prey base habitat
components (including mycorrhizal fungi), underburning would occur during conditions that do not
result in more than 10% full consumption of down logs in the 20 inch diameter and larger size class.
Conditions that limit consumption of 24 inch diameter and larger logs to 5% or less are preferable.
This applies to all units, though may not be operationally or safely feasible in units 163, 175, 204
and 206. This RPM is also intended to minimize the potential for loss of understory layering, large
snags and trees, and large down wood in nesting/roosting, resting/denning, and higher quality
foraging habitats for NSO, NGO and fisher for units 150, 152-1, 152-2, 154, 155, 156, 162, 165,
167, 168-2, 173, 182 and 221. Refer to RPM 11 for CWD burning objectives within Riparian
Reserves that are more restrictive. Also see RPMs 24-30 for additional protections during prescribed
burning.
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

89

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

43. To limit the potential for direct adverse effects to ground-nesting and riparian-obligate migratory
bird species within Elk Flat meadow and along the Ash Creek RR when underburning:
a. Burning from August 1 to February 1 is permitted, provided the NSO and NGO LOPs described
in RPMs 31 and 34 are not in place.
b. Avoid burning operations during the primary nesting season of April 15 to July 31 if the LOPs for
NGO or NSO are not in place.
c. When burning in spring, smoke should be managed so that light to moderate, dispersed smoke
may be present within an area or drainage, but dissipates or lifts within 24 hours.
d. Ignition should be discontinued if heavy, concentrated smoke begins to inundate the area.
e. Units this RPM applies to include: 150, 152-1, 152-2, 154, 157, 163, 171, 180, 218, 346, 347, 401
and 402.
44. RPMs specific to the gray wolf are as follows:
a. If a den site is detected within or near the project area during the project’s implementation
timeframes, a Limited Operating Period (LOP) that restricts noise- and smoke-generating
activities within one mile of the den will be implemented from April 1 through June 30.
b. While the provision for the den site LOP is expected to provide protections from any prolonged
or substantial project-related disturbance during the critical pup-rearing period at early
rendezvous site(s), a similar LOP for activities within one mile of active rendezvous sites from
April 1 through August 31 will be implemented. Further discussions and coordination with the
FWS may result in modified distances, or more flexible dates, for this specific resource protection
measure.
c. These LOPs will be implemented unless there are topographic features or terrain that clearly
separates the noise- or smoke-generating activities from the den or rendezvous site(s).
d. While there are no known den or rendezvous sites associated with the Shasta Pack within one
mile of the project area at this time, the LOPs specific to the gray wolf will be included in the
timber sale contract and would be put in place if denning wolves are detected. These measures
will also be included in the burn plan and any other implementation contracts or plans.

Visual Resources
45. The following resource protection measures are prescribed within a 150-foot visual corridor adjacent
to the Pilgrim Creek Road (Forest Road 42N13). This visual corridor would apply to units 16-115,
106, 107, 123, 125, 157, 159, 162, 176, 179, 180, 176, and 347.
a. Use existing landings and locate new landings out of view as seen from the roads where feasible.
b. Stump height will be 6 inches or less (if a landscape feature obstructs the view between the road
and the cut trees, stump height may be higher).
c. Cut or leave trees will be marked on the sides facing away from the roads. Prior to treatment,
further measures such as flagging of individual leave trees may be implemented to assure
operators can clearly identify leave trees.
d. The goal within the visual corridor is to have a clean look by removing the majority of the slash
and woody debris with the least amount of ground disturbance. This may be accomplished by:
lopping and scattering if there are not large amounts of residual slash, as generally occurs with
whole tree-yarding; hand piling and burning excess slash and scattering the burn pile residue that
is not fully consumed or machine piling the slash outside of the visual corridor.

Monitoring Common to All Action Alternatives
The following monitoring is proposed as applicable for pre, during, and post treatment.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Aspen
Long-term monitoring plots 58 will be set up prior to implementation to collect baseline data. Monitoring or
research may be accomplished by enlisting the help of research facilities who are interested in finding ways to
improve the outcomes for aspen restoration. This will be helpful in providing the forest with more information
which will lead to better results in restoration.
1. The sprouting stimulus results of conifer removal will be assessed. Conifer removal units will be
monitored after years one and three post-harvest to determine if conifer removal treatment
sufficiently improved or stimulated suckering. Thinning and meadow enhancement units with known
aspen include 157,175 and 402.
d. If suckering is not occurring after three years, other stimulus methods including underburning
or mechanical soil disturbance as described in the adaptive management for aspen restoration
of the proposed action will be introduced as appropriate. Assess the health of aspen prior to
implementation to determine which treatments are most appropriate for the site specific
situation.
e. If conifer removal treatment successfully stimulates suckering, monitoring will continue in
year five and then as needed until the aspen has met the initial establishment objectives.
2. Once the initial objectives are met, assess the clump or stand to determine if further actions as
described in the Proposed Action to meet the Purpose and Need are necessary.
3. Aspen in fuels-only (no timber harvest) units will be monitored after each burn to determine if
underburning is achieving the desired results. Under aspen restoration adaptive management, if
desired results are not being met, modifications may be required for future burns, or the use of
mechanical soil disturbance will be evaluated. Unit 318 is a known underburn unit with aspen.
4. If post-treatment monitoring shows detrimental browsing, determine if browsing is from livestock,
wildlife or both and fence appropriately as described in the Proposed Action. Continue to monitor
and remove fencing when appropriate.

Botany
5. Prior to treatment, monitoring plots will be established in units where fungi and plants of interest are
known to occur and examined post-treatment to assess project effects.

Cultural Resources
6. An archaeologist will be present when protection measures are initiated around prehistoric sites (if
initiated prior to burning) to ensure adequate distance from and protection of the sites. An
archaeologist and fuels project leader will visit the site prior to burning to review the site boundaries
and discuss protection measures, or an archaeologist will be present to monitor when nearby fuels
are ignited.
7. On-site actions determined necessary for fuels reduction around historic property site boundaries
will be monitored to ensure no damage occurs to historic properties.
8. An archaeologist will monitor the mechanical fire line constructed to determine whether new
cultural materials have been uncovered (after the mechanical fire line is constructed). Other
monitoring of historic properties will be conducted as needed.

58

Accepted monitoring methods will be used to set up these plots. They may consist of photo points as well as some
other plot method (as yet to be determined) for gathering data.

Fuels
9. Units will be monitored post-harvest by the fuels specialist, silviculturist and wildlife biologist as
necessary, to evaluate and determine the most appropriate fuels management practice in order to
avoid unnecessary disturbance to understory vegetation. Specifically, the need for machine piling
and burning prior to underburning will be evaluated in those units designated for possible machine
piling. Fuels post-harvest and post-piling monitoring would compare effectiveness, soils impacts,
and costs, with other nearby projects. Public participation in monitoring would be encouraged.
10. Validate project treatment and habitat objectives, incorporate project monitoring results and check
for changed circumstances prior to reentry for follow-up fuels work after the initial treatments.

Invasive Species
11. Surveys and treatments for noxious weeds will continue throughout all phases of project
implementation and beyond by at least 5 years to respond to delayed germination.

Road Management
12. Monitor and any identify draft site damage. Repairs as needed will be conducting during and post
implementation.

Reforestation
13. The Management Unit or project silviculturist would monitor replanted areas to verify that stocking
objectives are achieved within five years of planting. For areas where natural regeneration is
proposed, exams would also occur to assure that stands are restocked.

Silviculture and Wildlife
14. The project silviculturist and wildlife biologist will coordinate with the marking crew and inspect the
marking to ensure that the unit-specific prescriptions, marking guides and Project Design Features
are applied as described in order to maintain, improve or promote habitat structure and function.
15. Monitoring will be completed to assess effects of underburning-only treatments within suitable NSO
habitat, as described for Recovery Action 11 in the Revised Recovery Plan. The effects will be
evaluated periodically to see if the treatment is meeting the levels of acceptable mortality determined
by the IDT and FWS, or whether there is new information to be assessed prior to continued
implementation.
16. Stands will be surveyed/monitored for northern goshawk and NSO prior to and for the full extent of
project implementation utilizing a variety of survey methods. Similar monitoring may also be
performed for NGOs and NSOs after implementation to evaluate effects of the project on any
territories or home ranges that overlap the project area.
17. Carnivore monitoring, utilizing a variety of methods, will occur prior to, and to the extent
practicable, during and after project implementation. This monitoring work informs the SMMU
regarding fisher presence and use of the stands prior to, during and after treatment and contributes
information to Forest Plan Implementation Monitoring.
18. Point counts to assess migratory and resident bird species presence will be completed prior to, and to
the extent practicable, during and after project implementation.
19. Oak release treatments in NSO and fisher habitat will be monitored to assess if objectives for oaks
and foraging, resting and denning habitat are met. The effects will be evaluated periodically to see if
the treatment is meeting the objectives set determined by the IDT and FWS, or whether there is new
information to be assessed prior to continued implementation.

20. Camera stations will continue to be utilized to monitor for potential wolf use, including near or at
potential den or rendezvous habitats within the project area, within one mile of the project’s
activities and other portions of the wolf action area.
21. Wolves around den and rendezvous sites are fairly obvious, given the tracks, prey carcasses and
bones, scat, visual observation of a wolf or wolves. While these signs have not been observed in or
near the project area to date during activities or pre-decision planning and field work, surveys for
other wildlife and implementation monitoring are ongoing and will continue throughout and after
project implementation. Information from these surveys will be used to determine if LOPs are
needed, if the determinations made in the BA are still applicable or whether there is new information
to be considered prior to continued implementation.
22. Interagency coordination and close collaboration with FWS and CDFW is an essential conservation
measure. The Forest Service will continue to coordinate and communicate with FWS and CDFW on
their monitoring efforts. While there are no immediate plans to collar individuals in the Shasta Pack,
as coordination with Oregon and other agencies is needed (Kovacs, 2015) if individuals are collared
it may be feasible to better track their location and implement necessary conservation measures. If
the Forest Service observes wolves, dens or rendezvous sites, it will be reported to the CDFW and
the FWS 59 so that follow-up investigation(s) can occur.

Revegetation
23. Decommissioned unauthorized routes and temporary roads would be monitored for adequate
revegetation response for compliance with the National Forest Management Act.

Water Quality, BMPs and Soil Productivity
Timber sales that have the potential to affect water quality would be enrolled in the Timber Harvest Waiver
Program administered by the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB) under
Resolution No. R5-2014-0144 (CVRWQCB, 2014). In order to comply with the timber harvest waiver the
Forest Service would conduct implementation and effectiveness monitoring as described in monitoring
guidelines provided by the Central Valley Board. The monitoring program would accomplish the following
objectives.
g. Determine if Best Management Practices, mitigations, resource protection measures and management
measures have been properly put into place before the start of the winter period (November 15th
through April 1st).
h. Determine if significant pollution occurs as a result of timber harvest activities during the winter
period.
i. Determine if the management measures were effective in preventing significant pollution during the
winter period.
Monitoring of implementation activities would be accomplished by resource personnel including the
hydrologist and sale administrators. If problems are identified, the Forest Service would consult with the
CVRWQCB and take corrective actions (e.g., suspension of work, temporary closure, spot-rocking).

similar activities and respond
with similar recovery as
demonstrated by other areas

Alternative 1
(Modified Proposed Action)
There would be a short-term loss of soil productivity on
areas dedicated to landings (up to approximately 58
acres). Some of these needs are provided by existing
landings in the project area. Soil in treatment units in
action alternatives would meet Forest Plan soil quality
standards with implementation, and less than 15 percent
of any unit would be in a non-productive state. Soil
productivity would be restored in the previously
windrowed units, and improved by decommissioning
roads with residual soil compaction. Decommissioned
roads would return to forest or grassland.
There are no irreversible commitments of resources.
The following irreversible commitments of resources
occur:
The temporary loss of productive forest lands from
creation of landings on approximately 58 acres

Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study
Federal agencies are required by NEPA to rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable
alternatives and to briefly discuss the reasons for eliminating any alternatives that were not developed in
detail (40 CFR 1502.14). Alternatives to the Proposed Action may be suggested by the public or other
agencies or were considered by the interdisciplinary team during development of the proposed action.
Alternatives are eliminated from detailed consideration if they are: Illegal, fail to meet the purpose and need
for action, technologically infeasible, clearly unreasonable, duplicate actions within the existing range of
alternatives, the decision has already been made, would cause unreasonable environmental harm, cannot be
implemented, or are remote or speculative. The following alternatives were considered, but eliminated from
detailed study.

The Original Proposed Action as Scoped
The original Proposed Action that was scoped in February of 2013 (USDA-FS, 2013b) and published in the
Notice of Intent (USDA-FS, 2013) is similar to Alternative 1, the Modified Proposed Action. However
Alternative 1 includes refinements in the description of the Purpose and Need for Action and modifications of
the Proposed Action. Modifications and refinements were a result of public comment during the scoping
period, corrections, changed circumstances (primarily ongoing spread of mortality), and further analysis.
More information on why modifications to the original Proposed Action were made are included in the
introduction of Alternative 1 (see p. 38). Since considering both the original Proposed Action and Alternative
1 would be redundant, this alternative was dropped from detailed consideration.

Alternative 5: No Treatments in Elk Flat Meadow
Alternative 5 responds to Alternative 3 -No Treatments of Natural Stands within Designated Critical Habitat
for the Northern Spotted Owl is responsive to this issue and is considered in detail. As Recovery Plans are not
regulatory, they cannot be violated. However, as described earlier in this Chapter, Forest Plan standards and
guidelines direct that the Forest maintain or enhance habitat for threatened, endangered, and sensitive (TE&S)
species consistent with individual species recovery plans (p. 4.30).
Emphasizing the protection and enhancement of the forest vegetation conditions and elements that serve as
suitable habitat for late-successional dependent species (including the NSO) is integral to the Purpose and
Need for Action and Forest Plan management direction. The predicted effects on NSO, all suitable habitat,
dispersal habitat as it relates to connectivity, and designated critical habitat are analyzed for all alternatives
considered in detail to measure the achievement of the Purpose and Need. This information is summarized in
Chapter 2 (Table 29, p. 116) and in Chapter 3 in the Wildlife section.
The indicators specific to this issue are as follows:
a. acres of critical habitat, per primary constituent element, maintained/benefitted in NSO core areas,
home ranges and the project area,
b. acres of critical habitat, by primary constituent element, degraded, downgraded or removed through
treatments in NSO core areas, home ranges and the project area,
c. acres of suitable and dispersal habitat projected in 20 years within critical habitat, and
d. acres of capable habitat projected within 20 to 30 years within critical habitat.
These issue indicators are used to measure the scale of how the alternatives considered in detail meet the
management guidance, and the special management considerations for critical habitat subunit ECS-3, in the
2012 Final Critical Habitat Rule for the Northern Spotted Owl.

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Issue 4 – Mushroom Collection, described on page 45, regarding negative impacts from the meadow
enhancement treatment to edible mushroom growth and collection activities near and within Elk Flat.
Alternative 5 would eliminate the 518-acre meadow enhancement treatment in unit 402.

Discussion
Alternative 5 was eliminated from detailed study because it would not reasonably meet the purpose and need
for meadow restoration in Elk Flat. Encroaching conifer would not be removed, and the natural fire regime
that helps sustain the meadow habitat would not be returned.
Although Alternative 5 as a whole was eliminated from detailed consideration, aspects of it were adopted into
the Modified Proposed Action (Alternative 1), and protections for mushroom habitat would be implemented
through soil and coarse woody debris protections. Some species of edible mushrooms also benefit from soil
disturbance and fire. Alternative 1 preserves some forest vegetation in Elk Flat Meadow that would function
as mushroom refugia. The Modified Proposed Action includes the following layout design, resource
protection measures, standard operating procedures, and Best Management Practices to help protect
mushroom habitat:

118

•

UTP Placement – Mushroom habitat was considered in the placement of the UTPs in Elk Flat
meadow.

•

Forested and Large Tree Refugia - The design of Alternative 1 preserves refugia for mushrooms
within and around the Elk Flat meadow. The larger predominant trees within the interior of the
meadow typically have signs of decadence such as large limbs, forked or broken tops and cavities and
provide refugia. A basal area of approximately 60 square feet per acre of the largest diameter trees
would be retained where the meadow transitions into conifer stands along the edge. Plantations
bordering the meadow would receive a modified thinning prescription to transition between meadow
and forest, creating a ‘feathered’ effect of few trees within the meadow transitioning to an open forest
stand along the meadow’s edge. See the description of the Meadow Enhancement treatment on pages
53 and in Appendix A, page B-35, and the description of plantation thinning with meadow
enhancement on page B-28.

•

Soil and Organic Matter Protection - Alternative 1 protects soils and organic matter at Elk Flat in the
following ways:
a. RPM 10 on page 83 restricts heavy equipment operation in Elk Flat to frozen ground or in areas
where work on dry soils not result in significant adverse effects from soil displacement
b. RPM 11 on page 83 protects embedded coarse woody debris in the Riparian Reserves in Elk Flat
and elsewhere.
c. RPM 24 on page 85 describes litter and duff retention requirements during underburning.
d. RPM 25 on page 86 describes protections for large predominant trees during underburning.
e. RPM 41 on page 89 describes snags, down logs and clumps of trees to be retained in the Meadow
unit.
f. Required monitoring will provide information for before and-after-treatment effects for fungi (see
Monitoring item 5 on page 91). Information learned from monitoring is applied to ongoing and
future actions.
g. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Best Management Practices (BMPs) adhered to on
similar projects also protect soil quality, which in turn helps protect edible mushroom habitat. In
particular see Appendix C, SOP numbers 5, 6 and 7 on page D-2 for soil and duff protections and
Best Management Practice implementation. The list of the most pertinent BMPs is provided
starting on page D-4.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Effects to boleltus mushrooms is included in Chapter 3 in the effects analysis for the botanical resources for
the action alternatives. Additionally, No Action (Alternative 4) is considered in detail and shows the
difference between the action alternatives in effects pertaining to Elk Flat meadow and boletus mushroom.

Alternative 6: Limit Harvest to Trees Less than 10 Inches in Diameter
Suggested by a commenter, Alternative 6 responds to Issue 1 – Large Trees and Snags (see page 44).
Alternative 6 provides a 10-inch maximum DBH for thinning treatments. It is eliminated from detailed study
because modeling shows that while it would reduce fuel ladders in the short-term, it would not meet or
seriously diminish the project’s ability to meet major aspects of the purpose and need including: #1-Risk
Reduction in Early, Mid and Late-Successional Habitat and Increased Stand Resilience to Disturbance; #2
Accelerate Development of Late-Successional and Old-Growth Forest Characteristics and Promote LateSuccessional Habitat Connectivity; #3 Restore Meadow Habitat in Elk Flat; and compromise improving
vegetative conditions in Riparian Reserves in #5 (Payne, 2015a).

Discussion
Alternative 6 would not address overstocking nor would it sufficiently reduce existing standing and dead fuels
in the LSR, and the Riparian Reserves. Group selection and radial thinning treatments within plantations and
natural stands would not be implemented since effective implementation of these prescription elements could
not be achieved with a 10-inch diameter limit.
Trees within the natural stands and plantations range from less than 1-inch to 50 inches DBH with a very few
remnant predominant trees. Many trees in both stand types over 10 inches DBH that are competing with the
larger trees for site resources and some that are infected with black stain or annosus root disease. Because this
alternative would retain all trees over 10 inches DBH, competition would not be sufficiently alleviated in
treated stands and a large proportion of diseased trees would remain on the landscape. This alternative would
result in continued stress-induced mortality with fewer large diameter trees and snags developing and
persisting on the landscape over time. Suppressed conifer would continue to decline within stands at an
unnatural rate as late successional habitat develops. Competition would not be effectively reduced in early,
mid- and late-successional mixed conifer and pine dominated stands or plantations. Consequently, there
would be minimal improvement to individual tree growth acceleration and larger diameter snag recruitment,
indicating this alternative does not sufficiently develop a trend toward desired late-successional stand
characteristics. The release prescriptions for oak and aspen would only be partially implemented leaving
hardwoods overtopped and suppressed by conifers larger than 10 inches DBH.
The desired condition is derived from the Forest Plan, including the Late-Successional Reserve Assessment as
required by the Northwest Forest Plan. The project is designed to improve the viability of the Elk Flat LSR,
increase hardwood diversity, enhance meadow habitat and improve and maintain stream channel and Riparian
Reserve function consistent with the Aquatic Conservation Strategy objectives of the Northwest Forest Plan.
Effects to the LSR, Riparian Reserves and Critical Habitat will be analyzed for each alternative in the
resource specific effects analyses and as part of the analysis for compliance with vegetation diversity as
required by the Forest Plan. The Forest Plan integrated the requirements of the Northwest Forest Plan.
Compliance with the Forest Plan is covered in individual Chapter 3 resource sections and in section starting
on page 249.

Alternative 7: Eliminate the Use of Machine Piling within Treatment Units and
Substitute Hand Piling
Suggested by a commenter, Alternative 7 eliminates machine piling and substitutes hand piling. Alternative 7
responds to Issue 5 – Machine Piling regarding impacts to soil and watershed health from machine piling.
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

119

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Alternative 7 was not considered in detail because detrimental soil impacts from machine piling are not
supported by the local monitoring data and best available science for soil types within the project area.
Additionally elimination of machine piling would not meet the Purpose and Need for Action for “risk
reduction in early, mid and late-successional habitat and increased resilience to disturbance" on those acres
prescribed for machine piling.

Discussion
Alternative 1 utilizes machine piling as a pretreatment before underburning to increase consumption of excess
fuels over what underburning alone would accomplish, and to limit adverse effects to wildlife habitat during
the underburning (page 52). The units prescribed for machine piling have heavy concentrations of coarse
woody debris, typically more than 40 tons per acre. Eliminating machine piling within the units (landings
would still be piled) would not allow for safe and effective reductions of the larger sized material (>12 inches
in diameter) within various treatment stands on up to 1,461 acres plus the landings on the remaining thinning
units.
Soil surveys and past project monitoring completed within portions of the Elk Flat LSR Enhancement project
area, and on the McCloud Flats, demonstrates there are no significant negative effects from machine piling on
the soils resource. The design of the Proposed Action, resource protection measures, and standard operating
procedures and Best Management Practices would be implemented to reduce, if not eliminate, the potential
for adverse effects to soils, hydrologic and watershed function.
•

Treatment-generated and natural fuels in excess of desired retention levels would be piled with
mechanized equipment such as an excavator or tractor with a mounted brush rake or grapple designed
to minimize soil disturbance (see page B-36).

•

RPM 483on page 83 limits pile size to decrease potential for soil damage.

•

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Best Management Practices (BMPs) adhered to on similar
projects also protect soil quality. In particular see Appendix C, SOP numbers 5, 6 and 7 on page D-2
for soil and duff protections and Best Management Practice implementation. The list of the most
pertinent BMPs is provided starting on page D-4. Practice 5.6 is of particular importance in
decreasing the potential for soil compaction.

Effects to soils are analyzed in Chapter 3 under the action alternatives with respect to achieving the soil
quality standards and in comparison to the no action alternative.

Alternative 8: Limit Harvest to Trees Less Than 20 Inches in Diameter within
the Elk Flat Late-Successional Reserve
Suggested by a commenter, Alternative 8 responds to Issue 1 – Large Trees and Snags described on page 44.
Thinning of trees with a 20 inch or less DBH would be the only silvicultural treatment applied. While not as
restrictive as Alternative 6 in that it provides for a larger diameter limit that only applies to the LSR,
Alternative 8 is dropped from consideration in detail because it would not meet the Purpose and need for
Action in ways similar to those described for Alternative 6; stand heterogeneity would be reduced in all stands
in the LSR compared to the Proposed Action, two thirds of the stands would not reach desired density, and
hardwoods would continue to decline as a stand component.

Discussion
Modeling of Alternative 8 (Payne, 2015) predicts a 20 inch upper diameter limit would reduce stocking to
desirable levels in roughly one third of natural stands in the LSR. The higher basal area retention resulting
from a 20” upper diameter limit would not meet stand health objectives, result in decreased structural
120

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

heterogeneity, and leave stands at a higher risk for continued black stain spread and mortality. In most stands
basal area would be retained above 180 ft.2/ac, stand heterogeneity would be decreased by removing more
trees less than 20 inches DBH to approach desired basal areas. Radial thin treatment would be dropped where
release objectives could not be met and thinning would be less effective at promoting long-term health and
survival of predominant pine. In the remaining two thirds of the stands, all trees less than 20” DBH would be
removed and stand density would still be above a risk threshold for western pine beetle mortality.
The desired condition of structural heterogeneity for habitat would not be achieved when thinning to a 20”
upper diameter limit. Prescribed selection criteria that would retain multiple canopy layers, smaller understory
trees and a patchy understory would not be implementable. Few to no trees under 20 inches (excluding
unthinned patches) would be retained resulting in a simplified stand structure of essentially a single layer of
overstory trees. Isolation of healthy pine and increased sunlight to the forest floor would be hampered,
decreasing the ability to reduce black stain spread, in turn resulting in greater future losses of larger pine.
Hardwoods, which are mostly within the LSR stands, would remain overtopped and continue to decline as a
stand component. A substantially higher component of conifers would be left around oaks, leaving higher
levels of shade and competition. Oak release would be less effective and last for a shorter duration, leading to
earlier oak decline.

Alternative 9: No New Temporary Road Construction
Alternative 9 is responsive to the issue regarding road construction. It differs from Alternative 2 in that it also
includes no temporary road construction to access the landings (landing driveways). Alternative 9 was
dropped from detailed analysis in favor of consideration of Alternative 2 that is considered in detail, because
Alternative 9 would require more construction of new landings than Alternative 2 as discussed below.

Discussion
Alternative 2 considers in detail the effects relative to resources and meeting the Purpose and Need for Action
of no new temporary roads other than landing access driveways. Alternative 9, eliminating new temporary
roads entirely was first considered but dropped from detailed analysis. Under Alternative 9, there is a reduced
ability to meet the Visual Quality Objectives along the Pilgrim Creek Road. Landings would need to be
placed to minimize the visual impact of the landings and landing piles along these sensitive viewing corridors.
Without the use of temporary roads, the landings would be adjacent to the main roads creating a visual
impact. Under Alternative 9, approximately 7additional new landings over Alternative 2 may need to be
created where existing FTS roads or unauthorized routes do not access existing openings or landings.
The Modified Proposed Action incorporates measures to protect soils, forest health and wildlife from the
construction and use of temporary roads by:
•

Project Design – The Modified Proposed Action is designed to minimize disturbance from temporary
roads by:
a. Previously created skid trails unauthorized routes would serve as temporary roads rather than
constructing new temporary roads when possible to avoid new disturbance (see Appendix A page
B-44).
b. Sections of unauthorized routes used as haul routes would be improved for equipment access and
hauling as needed (to decrease resource damage), and
c. Existing unauthorized routes, new temporary roads, and landings would be decommissioned at
the completion of the project.

Resource Protection Measures would be implemented:
a. RPM 15 on page 84 – Specifies revegetation and mulching during temporary road

b. RPM 16 on page 84 – Requires road construction and maintenance (including temporary roads)

Effects to soils from temporary road construction, use and decommissioning are assessed in Chapter 3 on
soils, forest health and wildlife. Forest Transportation System roads are not considered within the soils
resource under the Forest Plan (pp. O-2) and are therefore not included in the soils resource effects.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental
Consequences
Introduction
This chapter describes aspects of the environment likely to be affected by the proposed action and
alternatives. The direct, indirect and cumulative environmental effects that would result from undertaking the
proposed action or alternatives are described. Effects are quantified where possible and qualitative discussions
are included. Together these descriptions form the scientific and analytical basis for the comparison of effects
displayed in chapter 2 (starting on page 94).
The planning record for the project includes project-specific information, including resource reports and
results of other field investigations. Individual reports, input and analysis from the record are summarized and
referenced in this chapter. Some reports are included in the appendices or are incorporated by reference. The
planning record is located at the Mount Shasta Ranger Station.

Approach to Cumulative Effects Analysis
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions were considered, in order to assess accumulated
impacts. According to the Council on Environmental Quality NEPA regulations, a “cumulative impact” is the
impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or
person undertakes such actions (40 CFR 1508.7).
Spatial and temporal boundaries are the two critical elements to consider when deciding which actions to
include in a cumulative effects analysis. Spatial and temporal boundaries set the limits for selecting those
actions that are most likely to contribute to a cumulative effect. The effects of those actions must overlap in
space and time for there to be potential cumulative effects (FSH 1909.15 (15.2)). Therefore the relevant
boundaries and projects assessed for cumulative effects vary by resource. Each resources’ cumulative effect
area can be different and possibly larger or smaller. Relevant cumulative effects are documented for the
resource in the project specialist reports and summarized in this chapter.
The cumulative effects analysis for each environmental component or resource area is guided by and
consistent with the Council on Environmental Quality letter “Guidance on the Consideration of Past Actions
in Cumulative Effects Analysis” of June 24, 2005. The current environmental conditions on the landscape
reflect the aggregate impact of all prior human actions and natural events that have affected the environment
and might contribute to cumulative effects and can be used as a proxy for the impacts of past actions (36 CFR
§ 220.4 (f)). The memo states, “agencies can conduct an adequate cumulative effects analysis by focusing on
the current aggregate effects of past actions without delving into the historical details of individual past
actions.” Cumulative effects are discussed here as changes in the existing condition due to present and future
activities, including the effects of the alternative being discussed unless otherwise noted.
For each resource area, direct and indirect effects of the proposed action were reviewed, in accordance with
the Forest Service Handbook, and relevant spatial and temporal boundaries for cumulative effects analysis
were determined. For the Elk project, the longest relevant temporal boundary in this review was 30 years. The
largest spatial boundary encompassed the 5th field watershed, Ash Creek, where the project is located. The
wildlife cumulative effects buffer, however, extended just beyond the Ash Creek 5th field watershed
boundary. As such, the largest combined boundary which is comprised of the Ash Creek 5th field watershed
combined with areas where wildlife cumulative effects buffer boundaries extend outside the watershed
boundary, was used (Elk Project general cumulative effects review area). Please refer to Refer to EIS

temporal boundaries either fell within the largest boundary or were unneeded.

Silviculture and Forest Health
A Vegetation Report (Payne, 2015b) was completed for this project and is incorporated by reference.
Information relevant to this decision is summarized here.

Introduction
Purpose and Need Applicable to Silviculture and Forest Health
Silviculture treatments for the Elk Flat Late Successional Reserve Enhancement Project are designed to help
achieve the following elements of the purpose and need: #1-Risk reduction in early, mid and late-successional
habitat and increased stand resilience to disturbance; #2-Accelerate development of late-successional and oldgrowth forest characteristics; #3-Restore meadow habitat in Elk Flat; and #4-Retain hardwoods as a stand
component at density levels commensurate with development of late-successional stands. Hydrologic function
restoration (Purpose and Need #5) is also partially related to silviculture and forest health through the health
of forest stands within Riparian Reserves, as described in the Hydrology Section (starting p. 193). The
existing and desired conditions relating to the Purpose and Needs are provided in Chapter 1.

Issues Applicable to Silviculture and Forest Health
Issue #1 applies to Silviculture and Forest Health. Concern was raised that large tree and snag removal and
group selection would negatively impact forest health and late-successional ecosystems in Late-Successional
Reserves, Riparian Reserves and Critical Habitat. Concern was raised that these treatments would prevent
rather than facilitate forest succession processes, and as such would not be consistent with the Northwest
Forest Plan. The Environmental Consequences section discusses silviculture treatment effects relative to the
above issues.

Methodology
Stand exam data was collected in spring of 2007 and 2010. Exam data, modeling using the Forest Vegetation
Simulation (FVS) program, multiple field observations, remote aerial imagery and Forest GIS data analysis
collectively were used to identify forest attributes including distribution of vegetation communities, forest
structure, composition and density, and mortality from insect and disease activity. FVS modeling was used to
analyze changes to stands over time under scenarios including: 1) implementing proposed thinning
treatments, 2) with the advent of wildfire, and 3) with no management actions occurring. Further descriptions
and discussion of the methodology can be found in the silviculture report (Payne, 2015b).
When discussing silviculture treatments and their effects, the effects are considered at the stand level. To
achieve purpose and need objectives often more than one type of treatment is applied in a stand – for instance
leaving unthinned patches, thinning to reduce density and thinning to release oak are distinct components of a
silvicultural prescription that collectively help meet objectives of improving stand resilience and developing
and retaining late successional forest characteristics. Typically, a forest stand is the smallest administrative
unit used to describe forest conditions and implement and monitor treatments and conditions over time.
Silviculture treatments for Alternatives 1 through 3 are described in Chapter 2with unit (stand) acres, timber
harvest acres and acres of subtreatments (such as radial thinning and oak release) summarized in Table 7,
Table 12, and Table 17, respectively. Table 22 summarizing the alternatives in Chapter 2 limits the display to
harvest acres due to space constraints in the table. For clarification, tables used to display effects in this
section are considering treatments at the stand level, or by delineated unit. For example, the effects of oak
release are displayed in terms of the stands treated where oak is known to occur.

Discussion of Indicators
Acres of Reduced Stand Densities and Acres of Risk Reduction of Insect and Disease Outbreak
Without disturbance, forest stands continually grow until die-back begins, largely from competition between
trees for resources (e.g., water, nutrients, and sunlight). With increasing high density and competition for
resources, tree growth slows, tree vigor declines and forest stands become increasingly at risk of large scale
disturbance from events including insect outbreaks and high intensity fire (Kolb, et al., 1998; Agee, et al.,
2005; Fettig, et al., 2007). Thinning reduces competition and frees up resources that support the vigor and
resilience of the residual forest stand. Stand resilience in this context includes the capacity to persist through
and re-organize after disturbance, adapt to shifting environmental conditions, and maintain basic ecosystem
structure and function over time (Churchill, 2013). Acres of reduced stand densities can be compared across
alternatives to gage their effectiveness at meeting Purpose and Need #1 Resilient stands in turn are better

positioned to persist over time, retaining and promoting the development of late-successional stand
characteristics (Key Issue #1).

Acres of Early and Mid-Successional Forest treated to retain and accelerate development of
Late-Successional Characteristics
Thinning young stands to delay or reduce inter-tree competition speeds the development of large diameter
trees as well as development of vertical diversity and species diversity (Garman, et al., 2003). Acres of
thinning that accelerate and promote development of late successional characteristics in early and midsuccessional plantations are compared across the alternatives to analyze effectiveness at achieving the purpose
and need.

Number of Trees Greater than 24 Inches Diameter Breast Height (DBH) Immediately PostTreatment and Projected in 20 Years Based on Comparative Modeling of the Alternatives.
Desired conditions of late-successional forest include having variability of vegetative characteristics reflective
of differences in site capability and the environment (elevation, slope, aspect, soils, etc.) across the landscape
(LSRA p. 162). Large overstory trees and snags are key attributes while not reflective of all desired
characteristics of late successional forest. Structural and species diversity, as well as stand resilience (i.e.
ability to maintain ecosystem structure and function over time) are also important attributes.

Number of Snags Greater than 20 Inches DBH Projected in 20 Years
Large trees per acre can be reasonably estimated using stand inventory data and aerial imagery. Recent and
ongoing bark beetle mortality makes snag estimations challenging. Snag levels have changed markedly from
one year to the next and are expected to continue changing as densities remain high and bark beetle activity
continues. Average trees per acre over 24 inches DBH and snags per acre over 20 inches are used in this
analysis for comparison across the alternatives to address issue #1 and analyze effectiveness at meeting the
purpose and need.

Development of stand heterogeneity and species diversity
Stand diversity is a key element of forest resiliency and of late successional habitat (Churchill, 2013; Lutz, et
al., 2013). In this context, diversity refers to stand level structural heterogeneity and species diversity. Stand
heterogeneity (i.e. a fine-scale mosaic pattern at the stand level) promotes forest resilience by breaking up fuel
continuity and continuity of conditions that support the spread of disease and epidemic insect outbreaks
(Churchill, 2013). It is important to consider stand diversity in the context of the naturally occurring
vegetation community or CWHR type 61) and a natural disturbance regime of frequent fire. Forest stand
structure has changed from open park-like stands dominated by large, fire-resistant trees to over-dense evenaged stands (Weaver, 1943; Convington & Moore, 1994; Moore, et al., 2004), that are more susceptible to
crown fire ( (Weatherspoon, et al., 1992; Skinner, et al., 1996), and contain trees that are less likely to survive
fire because of their smaller diameter, thinner bark and low hanging crowns (Fitzgerald, 2004).

Acres Promoting Growth and Resilience of Hardwoods
Acres of treatments that promote the survival and growth of hardwoods, promote the health and longevity of
large overstory pine, and increase species and structural diversity are compared across the alternatives to
analyze effectiveness at achieving the purpose and need and addressing resource concerns.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Conifer encroachment into Elk Flat is easily observed in comparative aerial imagery from the 1940s and
today. Acres of reduced conifer encroachment are compared across the alternatives to analyze effectiveness at
restoring early seral vegetation conditions.

Boundaries
To determine relevant past, present, and foreseeable future projects, spatial and temporal boundaries must be
defined (36 CFR § 220.4 (f)). For the effects analysis the direct and indirect effects of the Elk project relative
to Silviculture and forest health are conditions influencing stand structure and composition and stand density.

Spatial Bounding
Spatially, the conditions influencing stand structure, composition and stand density in the project affects forest
conditions within and immediately adjacent to the treated units. As such, the spatial context being considered
is the Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project boundary. This is because this represents area potentially influenced
by effects from proposed treatment activities.

Temporal Bounding
Temporally, effects of changes to stand structure, composition and density, including trees larger than 24
inches DBH and snags from project activities are expected to remain effective for about twenty years. Beyond
this time, increases in density from stand growth will begin to cancel the improved resilience and accelerated
development of late-successional characteristics associated with the silviculture treatments. Subsequent
prescribed fire entries will reduce accumulations of surface and small ladder fuels but not appreciably affect
forest structure, composition or density.
The baseline year used for this analysis is 2014 as the existing condition. The description of the existing
condition includes the accumulation of past activities, which have influenced vegetation. In the effects
discussion, “short-term” refers to effects over the twenty year period from the time the activity was
accomplished. Beyond twenty years, effects are considered “long-term.” The current environmental
conditions reflect the aggregate impact of all prior human actions and natural events that have affected the
environment and might contribute to cumulative effects, and are a proxy for the impacts of past actions.

Affected Environment
The purpose and need in chapter 1 fully describes existing vegetation conditions. Of note is the intertwined
relationship of natural fire exclusion, forest stand densification and subsequent insect and disease activity, and
impacts on the development and sustainability of desirable late-successional habitat. While approximately 91
percent of the project area is identified as having historically experienced high frequency (0 to 35 years) low
to mixed severity fire, there has been no recorded large scale fire in the project area for 100 years. The
preponderance of small- and medium-sized trees, which account for about 80 percent of all forested
vegetation, reflects a lack of differentiation that occurs under dense, stagnant growth conditions. The high
levels of pine mortality from bark beetle outbreaks further reflect unsustainably high forest stand density.
These conditions result when fire is excluded from an ecosystem that would otherwise be largely shaped by
natural frequent fire.

Environmental Consequences
Alternative 1- Modified Proposed Action
Direct and Indirect Effects – Alternative 1
Risk Reduction and Increased Stand Resilience
Stand Density Reduction
Under Alternative 1, plantations and natural stands totaling 2,190 unit acres (1,857 of which is actually
thinned after unthinned patches are subtracted) would be treated to reduce overstocking and promote
resilience of the residual trees. Thinning would remove excess trees that compete for resources; trees that are
generally smaller and serve as undesirable ladder and canopy fuels would be removed. Some larger
intermediate and codominant trees would be removed in order to leave adjacent overstory trees at desirable
density levels. All distinctly large predominant trees would be retained to the extent operationally feasible
(e.g. human safety considerations). Thinning would support the health and survival of overstory pine, while
tree selection would also retain a mix of species and tree sizes.
The measurement of stand density index (SDI) is used to describe existing stand density in relation to a
empirically determined biological maximum and indicate the degree of competition for resources (Shaw,
2006; Woodall, 2005). Full site occupancy occurs beginning at 60 percent of maximum SDI where density
induced mortality (self-thinning) begins to occur (Woodall, 2005). As stands reach and exceed 60 percent of
maximum SDI, individual tree growth slows and the risk of mortality increases as competition for resources
increases. Research in pure pine stands determined an SDI of 365 represented a pine-limiting threshold
beyond which high levels of bark beetle mortality typically occurred (Oliver, 1995). Subsequent research has
found that a limiting SDI for pine stands may be higher than determined by Oliver in 1995 but lower than
other researchers determined, and it can vary by site index (Zhang, et al., 2013). Recent widespread pine
mortality associated with western pine beetle outbreak bears evidence that stands have been exceeding their
density threshold in the Elk project area.
1. Thinning can reduce the number of underground root-root contacts through which the pathogens can
move from tree to tree.
2. Thinning can promote a mix of host and non-host species, reducing the overall effects of the
pathogens.
3. L. wageneri prefers cool, moist conditions. Thinning can allow the sun to penetrate through the
forest canopy, producing warmer soil conditions that are detrimental to the pathogen.
4. Thinning can reduce overall moisture stress on individual trees, allowing infected trees to better
withstand the loss of root function from the root diseases.
Modeling of pre, post and post-20 year stand densities were compared to a pine limiting SDI of 365. An SDI
of 230, or roughly 63 percent of the pine limiting SDI is considered the threshold or beginning of a “zone of
imminent bark beetle mortality” (Oliver, 1995). All of the natural stands proposed for thinning exceed the
density threshold, most by a large margin. Many of the stands remained near or just above the pine density
threshold after thinning. Most of the stands exceeded the pine density threshold twenty years after thinning
but densities were still considerably lower than present day densities. Other species present in the stands (for
example Douglas-fir and white fir) can persist at higher densities than pure even-aged pine stands.
Additionally, when there are more than one age class in a stand, SDI calculations may over-predict site
occupancy (Woodall, et al., 2003). Desired species and structural diversity and health of pine overstory were
considered collectively when analyzing stand density and thinning treatments.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Radial thinning around large predominant pine would be implemented in fourteen stands totaling 196 acres to
promote the health and survival of these scarce and desirable large older trees. Some large predominant pine
have recently died during the current pine beetle mortality outbreak, indicative that these trees are under stress
and at risk in current stand conditions. Radial thinning would reduce competition for resources and create
open stand conditions immediately adjacent to these predominant trees. Large older (160 years and more)
ponderosa pine have been found to increase diameter growth and vigor in response to thinning (Latham, et al.,
2002; Kolb, et al., 2007). Radial thin around large older pine frees up site resources that support the vigor of
the large trees and creates conditions more consistent with those found around large ponderosa pine under a
natural frequent fire regime.
Dense unthinned patches within the thinning stands would account for at least 10 percent of the stand areas.
Unthinned patches provide functional and structural elements including thermal and visual cover, dense small
trees, pockets of suppression and mortality, and undisturbed debris. Higher densities would also be retained
where patches or groups of notably large trees occur in order to retain existing desirable late successional
characteristics. Unthinned patches and high retention areas would remain at risk of density related and insect
and disease mortality. These areas however would be smaller and less contiguous than they currently are.
Adjacent thinning would provide growing space that would reduce competition along the edges of unthinned
patches and high retention areas. When treatments are considered collectively at the stand level the risk of
large scale disturbance is appreciably reduced and stand resiliency is increased. Treatments would create stand
conditions where mortality is more likely to occur in smaller isolated patches consistent with endemic (nonepisodic) conditions.
Dense stands totaling 335 acres would not be thinned under Alternative 1. Surface and small ladder fuels
would be treated in these stands by underburning but overall density will not be appreciably reduced. These
stands would remain susceptible to insect and disease attack and to density related mortality. These current
stand conditions are not expected to persist in the long term.

Insect and Disease Treatment and Risk Reduction
Thinning selection would favor removal of tress that show advanced symptoms of disease, dwarf mistletoe
infection or insect activity except when this criteria is superseded by other objectives, such as retaining all
predominant trees, retaining trees in unthinned patches and retaining trees that provide distinct wildlife habitat
(e.g. large broken limbs, cavities and other distinct features). By removing heavily infected trees as feasible,
as well as reducing density, thinning would reduce disease activity closer to endemic levels (Fiddler, et al.,
1989; Otrosina, et al., 2007).
Symptoms of black stain root disease (Leptographium wageneri) have been observed in several stands and is
likely present in adjacent stands showing elevated pine mortality. Thinning to lower densities in these areas
helps discourage spread of the disease by allowing sunlight to reach the forest floor, creating conditions less
favorable for the disease and by breaking up root-to-root contact between susceptible host trees (Otrosina, et
al., 2007; Snyder, 2012a). While the disease is short lived once a host tree dies, interplanting a mix including
non-host species in the larger mortality areas will help curtail future spread of black stain in these areas.
Patches of extensive mortality indicative of black stain disease are present in four plantations approximately
28 years old. These areas would be interplanted with a mix of species to both reduce further mortality from
black stain and promote development of future late successional forest.
Heterobasidion root disease (Heterobasidion annosum) has been observed in white fir to a more limited extent
in the project area. Unlike black stain disease in pine, heterobasidion can persist on site for decades after a
host tree has died, continuing to infect new trees through direct contact and spread of aerial spores. In areas of
pure or nearly pure white fir heterobasidion is expected to persist and mortality patches expand. Removal of
symptomatic trees in favor of interplanting non-host species, treating cut stumps with Sporax® and
underburning are designed to slow the spread of heterobasidion and develop more resilient stand conditions
(Schmitt, et al., 2000; Snyder, 2012a).
Insect and disease activity has been observed in stands that currently provide high quality nesting and roosting
habitat, and are not thinned. Underburning in these stands may improve insect and disease conditions to a
limited extent but will not reduce stand density or treat infection centers. Underburning can provide some
control of dwarf mistletoe, primarily dependent on the level of crown scorch. Low intensity underburning that
produces little to no crown scorch has little effect on controlling dwarf mistletoe (Conklin, et al., 2008).
Treatments that improve stand resiliency by reducing excessive density also reduce the risk of undesirable
insect and disease activity. Most of the stands thinned to reduce excess density have elevated insect and
disease activity and are reflected in the treatment acres below. Density reduction thinning that is preventative
(i.e. risk reduction) is included in Table 33 below.

Accelerated Development and Retention of Late-Successional Characteristics
Acres Treated to Retain Late-Successional Characteristics
Thinning to reduce elevated stand density in 1,385 acres of natural stands (refer to Table 31) will both retain
existing late successional characteristics where present and accelerate their development elsewhere. The
majority (over 78 percent) of these stands are defined as seral stage 4b which corresponds to a dense mid or
late successional condition as defined in the LSRA (LSRA pp. 22). Thinning predominantly smaller trees
provides resources for the resilience and accelerated growth of residual large overstory trees as well as creates
growing space for development of increased structural diversity (Latham and Tappiener 2002, Garman, 2003,
Kolb, 2007)

Acres of Early and Mid-Successional Treated to Accelerate Development
A total of 692 acres of plantations are treated under Alternative 1 to accelerate the development of late
successional characteristics and are displayed in Table 34 below. Thinning in dense early successional (seral
3b and 3c) stands will accelerate the development of large diameter trees by reducing competition as well as
speed development of vertical diversity and species diversity (Garman, et al., 2003). Thinning and
interplanting in open early successional (seral 3a) stands will accelerate the development of species and
structural diversity.

Number of Trees Greater than 24 Inches DBH
Large diameter overstory trees are largely retained, and the likeliness of their survival over time is improved,
by removing excess density, primarily in smaller size classes. Table 35 displays modeling estimates of

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

average trees per acre over 24 inches DBH in all seral stages for thinning units prior to treatment, immediately
after thinning and at 20 years post-thin.
Modeling projections show thinning would retain approximately 77 to 80 percent of trees over 24 inches
DBH in seral stage 4b and 4c stands immediately after thinning. By year 20, trees over 24 inches DBH
approximate 89 to 96 percent of current levels prior to treatment. While it is clear that thinning will reduce the
number of trees per acre over 24 inches DBH from current levels, it is important to consider the relevance of
this metric in the context of current stand densities and the risk they pose for large-scale disturbance. The
current widespread mortality of pine in the project area, including desirable large overstory trees considerably
over 24 inches DBH, underscores this risk.
Tree selection –what criteria selects trees for retention versus removal – is an important consideration when
discussing numbers and sizes of trees removed. For example, a 26 inches DBH white fir would be selected for
removal if it is growing under a 40 inches ponderosa pine being radially released, but would be selected for
retention where it is a healthy dominant overstory tree. Modeling was conducted to try and mimic tree
selection criteria that would leave some trees in the smaller size classes, thin heaviest in the suppressed and
intermediate sized trees, and thin some codominant trees where needed to reduce density and promote
adjacent larger trees.
While some trees over 24 inches DBH are removed by thinning, average stand overstory diameter increases
by approximately 4 inches immediately after thinning (see Table 36 below). Thinning that result in an
immediate post-thin increase of average overstory diameter indicates a “thinning from below” where tree
removal focuses on smaller size classes. When comparing action alternatives including Alternative 1 to the
No Action Alternative, modeling indicates that unthinned stands would have notably higher levels of trees
greater than 24 inches DBH at year 20 than thinned stands. However, modeling results do not reflect
extensive and ongoing density related mortality that has been directly observed in the field. This is further
discussed under the No Action alternative.

Number of Snags Greater than 20 Inches DBH
As discussed throughout this document, tree mortality and subsequent snag levels have increased dramatically
within the project area over the last several years. Inventory data and modeling forest stands through time
provide tools for effects comparison between alternatives, but may not accurately reflect changing snag levels
– both because of recent increases in mortality, and because snag densities tend to be patchy and highly
variable across the project area. Table 37 shows modeled estimated snags per acre over 20 inches DBH before
and after thinning and at 20 years.
Snag levels are expected to decrease after thinning treatments in order to provide for human safety during
operations. Snags would be retained where they are not an operational safety risk and in unthinned patches.
Snags would remain at levels consistent with LSRA guidelines for mixed conifer forest after thinning. Open
mid-successional (seral stage 4a) stands have a projected marked decline in snags at year 20 under all
Alternatives. These are open stands with fewer trees over 20 inches DBH and current elevated snag levels. As
existing snags fall, there are low numbers of trees over 20 inches that can recruit into snags and open stand
conditions that do not lend to density-induced mortality. Model projections may underestimate numbers of
snags at year 20 in light that ongoing mortality from pine beetle will likely persist until beetle populations
decline and tree vigor improves. Approximately half of present day snags are projected to fall from natural
decay by year 20.
Under Alternative 1, snags would continue to develop from disease and insect activity but at more endemic
levels. Higher levels of mortality would continue to be likely in dense stands where thinning is not undertaken
to retain existing late successional habitat.

Vegetation Diversity
Development of Stand Level Heterogeneity
Thinning and reforestation treatments are designed to increase stand level heterogeneity as well as reduce
density, in the case of thinning. Stand heterogeneity is increased by thinning to a varying range of density and
promoting the health and survival of trees or conditions that are sparse such as large pine overstory trees or
hardwoods. Unthinned patches retain a dense structural component while fuel continuity is broken up and
excess density is treated in adjacent thinning areas. Creating and reforesting group selections in plantations
and areas of homogenous white fir, and interplanting mortality areas increases stand level species diversity
and structural diversity. Table 38 displays acres of treatments that increase vegetation diversity.

62

The thinning modeling is limited in that it does not reflect the unique tree selection and current snag retention that are in
the marking guidelines and likely underestimates snags. See further discussion of modeling limitations on snags under the
No Action Alternative.

Meadow Enhancement
Left unchecked, conifer encroachment changes the structure and function of meadows and can result in the
loss of a distinct and valuable habitat (Halpern, et al., 2010). While a number of factors may influence conifer
encroachment, fire exclusion appears to play a major role in some instances (Coop, et al., 2007). As discussed
in Chapter 1 and the Fire and Fuels section of this chapter, the project area has significantly departed from a
natural frequent fire regime. Under Alternatives 1 and 3, thinning and underburning would remove conifer
encroachment and reintroduce fire into the meadow ecosystem. These treatments would encourage the growth
of perennial and annual herbaceous plants and grasses. Scattered large pine as well as unthinned patches
would be retained within the meadow to provide a mix of habitat for other species including mushrooms.
Effects of thinning for meadow enhancement are further discussed in the Botany and Hydrology sections of
this chapter. Approximately 379 acres of conifer encroachment would be thinned under Alternatives 1 and 3.

Sporax® Application
Sporax® (Na2B4O710H2O, Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) is used as a registered pesticide (fungicide) for
forestry to prevent the spread of Heterobasidion root disease (Wilbur-Ellis, N.D. ). Treatment of conifer
stumps 14 inches or greater in diameter (outside bark) is recommended (USDA-FS, 2013a p. 11). Sporax®
(or a similar commercial formulation) will be applied to freshly cut stump surfaces at a rate of approximately
one pound per 50 square feet of stump surface. Based on an estimate of square feet of basal area removal and
local experience with Sporax® application in stands with similar prescriptions, it is estimated that about 1
pound of Sporax® per acre would be applied to treated stands. Under Alternative 1 Sporax® would be applied
on approximately 2,040 acres of thinning.
An assessment on human health and ecological risks associated with applying borax for stump treatment was
completed by the Forest Service in 2006 (USDA-FS, 2006). The report concludes the use of Sporax® in the
control of Heterobasidion root disease does not present a significant risk to humans or wildlife species under
most conditions of normal use, even under the highest application rate. Given the highly focused application
method for Sporax®, application of granular product to cut tree stump surfaces, exposures considered for both
the human health and environmental risk assessments are limited to those which are expected to result in
significant exposure. The most significant risk of toxicity in both humans and wildlife species results from the
direct consumption of Sporax® applied to tree stumps. For terrestrial species, risk associated with the
application of Sporax® to tree stumps, appear to be very low. For aquatic animals and plants, hazard quotients
(HQ) marginally exceed the level of concern for amphibians for the worst-case accidental spill of 25 pounds
of Sporax® into a small pond (HQ, 1.3) and for the sensitive species of microorganisms for all accidental spill
scenarios (HQs ranging from about 1 to 4).

Climate Change
The climate in California is predicted to become much warmer in the next three decades with little change in
annual precipitation rates (CCCC, 2006). Under some predictive scenarios, changes in climate may occur that
exceed the capacity of existing forest tree populations to adjust physiologically and developmentally
(Anderson, 2008).
Being relatively long-lived, trees retained or planted as part of this project will likely compose much of the
forests in the project area over the next century. Long-term adaptation to climate changes requires healthy and
productive forests in the short term. Declined vigor stemming from environmental stresses of climate change
may make stands more susceptible to large-scale insect and disease attacks and more frequent or severe fires.
Existing species or genotypes may be poorly adapted to future climate conditions during all or various parts
of their life cycles; resulting in altered trajectories of forest growth, development, and productivity.
Cumulative effects to forest vegetation from climate change in the project area may result in decreased tree
vigor and productivity as well as increase disturbances from insects, disease, and fire. Proposed treatments
that reduce stand density levels may increase the resilience of the stands to climate change (Anderson, 2008).

Compliance with Law, Regulation and Policy
Alternative 1 meets Forest Plan direction, watershed analyses desired conditions and regional direction
regarding silviculture and timber harvesting as summarized in the Vegetation report, across the project area.

Cumulative Effects – Alternative 1
Some past actions and natural events may overlap in time and space with the proposed action. However, past
actions are not being considered individually. The current environmental conditions reflect the aggregate
impact of all prior human actions and natural events that have affected the environment and might contribute
to cumulative effects and are a proxy for the impacts of past actions.

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Under the Pilgrim Vegetation Management project, thinning of mostly small diameter trees less than 14 inch
DBH is planned for approximately 147 acres in stand 401, south of Elk Flat. Historic photos showed this
stand to contain open meadow areas contiguous with Elk Flat mixed with stringers and dense pockets of trees,
primarily larger diameter pine. This treatment will support the Elk LSR meadow enhancement treatments by
removing conifer encroachment. Small tree removal will create stand conditions that more closely reflect
those of a dry pine forest under frequent natural fire.
Firewood cutting of downed wood is allowed within the LSR to a limited extent and felling and collecting of
firewood is allowed on the 490 acres of matrix lands within the project area. This activity could potentially
remove a minor portion of dead fuels but would have no appreciable affect to the forest stand conditions and
resource indicators discussed in this section.
The felling of snags for hazard tree abatement would remove a component of snags in the project area as
described in Chapter 2 (see hazard reduction, p. 56). Snags would be retained elsewhere in the project area
including in thinning units, unthinned patches within treatment units and in unthinned stands. ollectively, the
treatments and untreated stands would leave a mosaic of snag distributions and snag densities consistent with
desired conditions described in the LSRA (p.164).

Alternative 2- No New Temporary Road Construction Other Than Those Required
for Landing Access
Direct and Indirect Effects – Alternative 2
Risk Reduction and Increased Stand Resilience
Stand Density Reduction and Resilience
Under Alternative 2, plantations and natural stands totaling 1,846 acres would be thinned to reduce
overstocking and promote resilience of the residual trees. This is a decrease of 166 acres from Alternative 1
and reflective of a decrease in road access to conduct thinning. Effects from thinning are those described
under Alternative 1.
Radial thinning around large predominant pine would be implemented in fourteen thinning stands totaling 191
acres. This is a decrease of five acres compared with Alternative 1 and reflects stands left unthinned due to
limited access.
As described in Alternative 1, approximately 12 percent of thinned stands would remain in unthinned patches
at stocking levels that pose a risk for density related and insect and disease mortality as described under
Alternative 1.
Dense stands totaling 400 acres would not be thinned under Alternative 2. This leaves 65 acres of dense
stands not thinned, compared to Alternative 1. Surface small ladder fuels would be treated in these stands by
underburning but overall density will not be appreciably reduced. These stands would remain susceptible to
insect and disease attack and to density related mortality. Presently, 335 acres of these unthinned stands
provide quality nesting and roosting habitat in their current condition however, these conditions are not
expected to persist in the long term.

Insect and Disease Treatment and Risk Reduction
Alternative 2 thinning acres in stands with elevated insect and disease activity are the same as Alternative 1.
As discussed under Alternative 1, treatments that improve stand resiliency also reduce the risk of undesirable
insect and disease activity. Table 41 displays stand acres treated with active insect and disease mortality, and
acres treated to reduce the risk of undesirable insect and disease mortality.
A total of 401 acres of stands are not treated and remain at density levels that are at risk of undesirable insect
and disease mortality under Alternative 2. This is an increase of 166 untreated acres compared to Alternative
1. Underburning in these dense unthinned stands may improve insect and disease conditions to a limited
extent but will not appreciably reduce stand density. Underburning can provide some control of dwarf
mistletoe, primarily dependent on the level of crown scorch. Low intensity underburning that produces little
to no crown scorch has little effect on controlling dwarf mistletoe (Conklin, et al., 2008).

Accelerated Development and Retention of Late-Successional Characteristics
Acres Treated to Retain Late-Successional Characteristics
Thinning to reduce elevated stand density in 1,335 acres of natural stands under Alternative 2 (refer to Table
40) will both retain existing late successional characteristics where present and accelerate their development
elsewhere. This is a decrease of 50 acres compared to Alternative 1.

Acres of Early and Mid-Successional Treated to Accelerate Development
A total of 676 acres of plantations are treated under Alternative 2 to accelerate the development of late
successional characteristics (see Table 42). Thinning in dense early successional (seral 3b and 3c) stands will
accelerate the development of large diameter trees by reducing competition as well as speed development of
vertical diversity and species diversity (Garman et al, 2003). Thinning and interplanting in open early
successional (seral 3a) stands will accelerate the development of species and structural diversity.
A total of 400 acres of dense mid and late successional natural stands and plantations are not treated and
would not meet this objective under Alternative 2 (see acres of “Underburn Only” in tables Table 40 and
Table 42).

Number of Trees Greater than 24 Inches DBH and Snags Greater than 20 Inches DBH
On a per acre basis, the retention of late successional characteristics (i.e. trees per acre greater than 24 inches
DBH, stand average overstory tree diameter and snags greater than 20 inches) in mid and late-successional
stands are the same across all Action Alternatives, including Alternative 2 (see Table 35 to Table 37). Effects
are the same as described under Alternative 1 except thinning in mid and late successional stands (both
plantations and natural stands) is reduced by a total of 58 acres compared to Alternative 1

Vegetation Diversity
Development of Stand Level Heterogeneity
The effects of developing stand level heterogeneity are the same as described in Alternative 1. Treatments will
increase heterogeneity on a total of 2,152 acres of plantations and natural stands Under Alternative 2 (see
Table 43).
Under Alternative 2, there are 66 fewer acres treated towards this objective compared to Alternative 1. Most
of the stands left unthinned are natural stand thinning, however this also includes four acres of group
selections in plantations, and five acres of radial thinning in plantations and natural stands. Group selections
and radial thin are conducted concurrently with thinning and collectively increase stand heterogeneity. Where
thinning treatments are not undertaken, stands would remain dense and growth rates slow until disturbance or
instances of tree mortality occur to free up site resources. While stands remain in a dense overstocked
condition, little species or structural diversification occurs as site resources are fully captured by existing
vegetation.

Hardwood Species Release
Effects of thinning on hardwood species release are the same as described in Alternative 1. Treatments
totaling 555 acres would promote the survival and growth of hardwoods under Alternative 2 (see Table 44).
This is a decrease of 38 acres in stands of natural thinning compared to Alternative 1. A total of 76 acres
would not meet the objective for oak release and 5 acres would not meet the objective for aspen release under
Alternative 2.
Where left untreated, shade intolerant hardwoods would continue to decline due to overtopping and crowding
by conifers. Over time, barring disturbance that removes competing conifers, individual oak and aspen will
die out as they receive insufficient sunlight and site resources. Current mortality in overstory pine is providing
release of hardwoods including aspen to a limited extent. While this is providing sunlight and growing space

fire can burn with sufficient intensity and residence time to kill off and prevent sprouting in oak and aspen.

*Meadow Enhancement treatment also releases aspen

Meadow Enhancement
The effects of thinning conifer encroachment in Elk Flat would be the same as discussed for Alternative 1
however there would be 25 less acres of conifer encroachment thinning under Alternative 2. Underburning
would likely remove a minor portion of smaller understory trees in the unthinned areas but larger trees would
persist and serve as a seed source for further conifer encroachment. Much of the conifer encroachment would
be largely treated under Alternative 2 however retained forested patches (including the unthinned patches
under all action alternatives) provide both the seed source and ecotone (i.e. “edge effect”) that can encourage
a relative rapid expansion of conifer encroachment when other environmental factors are favorable (Halpern
et al, 2010). Under Alternative 2 the purpose and need of meadow enhancement would be met to an
incrementally lesser degree, with the consideration that retained forest patches can have a broader impact than
a simple accounting of forested acres.

Other resource effects
Sporax® Application
Effects of Sporax® application are those described under Alternative 1. Sporax® would be applied to cut
stumps 14 inches in diameter and greater on approximately 1,958 harvest acres under Alternative 2.

Direct and Indirect Effects – Alternative 3
Risk Reduction and Increased Stand Resilience
Stand Density Reduction and Resilience
Under Alternative 3, plantations and natural stands totaling 1,698 acres would be thinned to reduce
overstocking and promote stand resilience (see Table 45). Effects from thinning are those described under
Alternative 1.
Dense stands totaling 639 acres are not thinned under Alternative 3. Radial thin treatments decrease by 26
acres compared to Alternative 1, these radial thin treatments fall within stands left unthinned under this
alternative. Under Alternative 3, more contiguous dense forest conditions would be retained than in
Alternatives 1 and 2. Conditions would remain conducive to insect and disease outbreaks and spread from
these larger contiguous areas.
As in all Action Alternatives, approximately 12 percent of treated stands would be retained as unthinned
patches dispersed throughout the stands. Higher densities would also be retained where groups of notably
large trees occur in order to retain existing desirable late successional characteristics. Dense unthinned
patches and high retention areas within the thinned stands would remain at a higher risk of density related
mortality but their dispersed less contiguous distribution would be more reflective of endemic conditions.

Insect and Disease Treatment and Risk Reduction
Insect and disease conditions are the same as described in Alternative 1. As discussed under Alternative 1,
treatments that improve stand resiliency also reduce the risk of undesirable insect and disease activity
(Fiddler, et al., 1989). Table 46 displays stand acres treated with active insect and disease mortality, and acres
treated to reduce the risk of undesirable insect and disease mortality.
There is a decrease of 157 acres of treatments in stands with active insect and disease mortality compared to
Alternative 1. Thinning that provides risk reduction for insect and disease mortality is decreased by 168 acres
compared to Alternative 1. Underburning in these dense unthinned stands may improve insect and disease
conditions to a limited extent but will not appreciably reduce stand density. Underburning can provide some
control of dwarf mistletoe, primarily dependent on the level of crown scorch. Low intensity underburning that
produces little to no crown scorch has little effect on controlling dwarf mistletoe (Conklin, et al., 2008).

Accelerated Development and Retention of Late-Successional Characteristics
Acres of Early and Mid-Successional Treated to Accelerate Development
Natural stands totaling 1,081 acres are thinned under Alternative 3 to both retain and accelerate development
of late successional characteristics (see Table 45). The majority (approximately 79 percent) of these stands are
defined as seral stage 4b which corresponds to a dense mid or late successional condition as defined in the
LSRA (pp. 22).
Within thinning units, snags would continue to develop from disease and insect activity but at more endemic
levels. Higher levels of mortality would continue to be likely in dense stands where thinning is not undertaken
to retain existing late successional habitat. Growth of large overstory trees would remain suppressed in
untreated dense stands.
Plantations treated to accelerate the development of late successional characteristics under Alternative 3 are
the same as Alternative 1 (see Table 34) Thinning in dense early successional (seral 3b and 3c) stands will
accelerate the development of large diameter trees by reducing competition as well as speed development of
vertical diversity and species diversity (Garman, et al., 2003). Thinning and interplanting in open early
successional (seral 3a) stands will accelerate the development of species and structural diversity.
A total of 638 acres of dense mid and late successional natural stands and plantations are left unthinned, and
would not meet the objective under Alternative 3 (see Table 45).

Number of Trees Greater than 24 Inches DBH and Snags Greater than 20 Inches DBH
On a per acre basis, the retention of late successional characteristics (i.e. trees per acre greater than 24 inches

Cumulative Effects – Alternative 3
Cumulative effects for Alternative 3 would be the same as those described for Alternative 1.

Alternative 4 - No Action
Under No Action, the proposed management activities would not be implemented. No direct, indirect, or
cumulative effects are expected. Although there would be no actions undertaken with this alternative, ongoing
trends would continue. Chapter 1 describes the existing condition and trends in Purpose and Need #1 and #2.
Under the No Action Alternative, stands would remain at high mortality risk and large tree growth would be
slow due to inter-tree competition for site resources. While stand modeling is useful for comparing trends
across Alternatives and through time, it is important to understand modeling limitations when interpreting
results. For instance, under the No Action Alternative, modeling suggests there would be an increase in the
average number of trees over 24” DBH and snags over 20” by year 20, compared to the Action Alternatives.
Modeling results do not account for the insect and disease activity and mortality patterns that have recently
occurred and are ongoing. As noted elsewhere in this document, a complex of bark beetles and root disease,
further exacerbated by several years of drought, have caused elevated mortality above endemic levels
144

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

throughout much of the project area. There is a loss of large diameter trees not accounted for in the No Action
modeling results. The model results reflect a more typical pattern of density related mortality where smaller
trees die off from competition. The No Action modeling results do not reflect the observed pine mortality and
widely held research findings of a pine mortality threshold (Oliver, 1995; Otrosina, et al., 2007; Egan, et al.,
2010; Snyder, 2012).
In natural stands, ponderosa pine is primarily a component of large overstory trees (30” DBH and greater)
growing with a dense shade tolerant understory and mid-story, primarily of white fir and incense cedar. As
most of the mortality is occurring within the pine, including large trees, it is likely that the number of large
trees and average stand diameter would decrease over time under the No Action alternative, contrary to
modeling results. This would be due to the loss of large overstory pine and persistence of smaller white fir and
incense cedar.
With current mortality trends, future stands under the No Action alternative would be characterized by a dense
layer of smaller shade tolerant trees with fewer large diameter trees and areas of high concentrations of fuels
conducive to high intensity fire.
The increased risk of further stand loss from heavy fuel accumulation, slow growth of large trees due to high
stand densities, and continued loss of large overstory pine from insects and disease under the No Action
alternative do not meet the purpose and need of promoting stand resilience, and retaining and accelerating the
development of late successional characteristics.
Since there are no direct or indirect effects with No Action, Alternative 4 would result in no cumulative
effects.

Silviculture treatments under Action Alternatives 1 through 3 are designed to address issues of stand health
and densification that have developed largely from decades of natural fire exclusion, while promoting a
mosaic of stand conditions that support the development and retention of late successional forest
characteristics. The differences in the Action Alternatives are in the number of acres treated. Along with a
direct comparison of treated acres, it is important to consider the influence of the spatial arrangement of
treatments and forest conditions as well. For example, large contiguous areas of susceptible hosts for insects
or pathogen are more likely to support epidemic outbreaks as compared to forests where there are a mosaic of
conditions including gaps or openings.
Table 53 below displays a direct comparison of treated acres between the alternatives as well as a summary
and comparison of effects.

Compliance with Law, Regulation and Policy (includes Forest Plan under NFMA)
All silvicultural treatments in the action alternatives follow Forest Plan direction, are consistent with
watershed analyses recommendations and comply with regional direction regarding silviculture and timber
harvesting as summarized in the Vegetation report, across the project area. Appendix H provides the NFMA
compliance consistency and other vegetation-related consistency. Specifically refer to discussions starting on
pages I-12 (NFMA), I-17 (LSR), and I-26 (Vegetation Diversity).

Fire and Fuels
A Fire and Fuels Specialist Report (McRae, 2015) was completed for this project and is incorporated by
reference. Information relevant to this decision is summarized here.

Introduction
Purpose and Need Applicable to Fire and Fuels
Purpose and Need for Action #1-Risk Reduction in Early, Mid and Late-Successional Habitat and Increased
Stand Resilience to Disturbance is applicable to fire and fuels. The existing and desired conditions relating to
fuels are provided in Chapter 1, starting on page 23. The departure between the existing condition and desired
conditions for fire regime, fuel loading and fire behavior contribute to the identification of the Purpose and
Need for Action. Secondary purposes, applicable to fire and fuels include #3-Restore Meadow Habitat in Elk
Flat described in Chapter 1 starting on page 29.

Issues Applicable to Fire and Fuels
Issue #5, Machine Piling, described on page 46, indirectly applies to fire and fuels since machine piling is
proposed for fuels reduction. The acres of machine piling by alternative is the issue indicator; however, the
issue and indicator relate to effects to soils. Effects to fuel loading from machine piling is addressed here.

Methodology
Stand exam data was collected in spring of 2007, including Brown’s method (Brown, et al., 1982) fuels
sampling. Modeling assumptions, limits and other specifics can be found in the silviculture report (Payne,
2015b). In fall 2011 additional data using the photo series (Maxwell, et al., 1979) was collected to assess
ongoing mortality observed in the project area.
Stand exam data was processed through the FVS, Fire and Fuels Extension (FFE), to derive pre- and posttreatment fuel loading, and vegetation characteristics that influence fire behavior (canopy base height and
crown bulk density), the results of which were used in the effects analysis. FVS/FFE models fire spread
through the stands before and after treatment where other fire models such as Flam Map, Behave, and FSPro
do not.
Weather parameters from 23 years of observations at the Ash Creek Remote Automated Weather Station
(RAWS) were used for modeling. The date range for weather observations used was July 1 – October 1,
which represents when the most severe fire behavior conditions are likely to occur. Ninety-seventh percentile
weather conditions were utilized to evaluate alternatives against the most extreme fire behavior.

Indicators and Measures
Criteria were developed to evaluate how well each alternative meets the project Purpose and Need and
follows policy and direction as follows:

Indicators of Purpose and Need #1
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

149

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

•

Fuel Loading - Acres of reduced ladder and overstory fuels, and surface fuels that meet Forest Plan
standards (average of 5 tons per acre in Matrix and average between 5 and 35 tons per acre in LSR)
within the constraints of the resource protection measures that require higher levels in specific areas.

•

Fuel Models – Fuel models present within the project area. Fuel models 2 and 9 (with limited surface
fuel loading) are desired.

•

Potential Fire Behavior - Fire behavior characteristics expressed as a measure of expected flame
length on a 97th percentile fire weather day. Table 54 summarizes fire behavior by flame length
category. The desired flame length is 0-4 feet for fireline safety and the use of mostly handline during
wildfire conditions.
Table 54. Fire Behavior
Flame Length (feet)

Interpretations

0-4

Fires can generally be attacked at the head or flanks by persons using hand
tools.
Handline should hold the fire

4-8

Fires are too intense for direct attack on the head of the fire by persons using
hand tools.
Handline cannot be relied on to hold fire.
Equipment such as dozers, engines, and retardant aircraft can be effective.

8-11

Fires may present serious control problems – torching out, crowning, and
spotting.
Control efforts at the head of the fire will probably be ineffective.

11+

Crowning, spotting, and major runs are common.
Control efforts at the head of the fire are ineffective.

Source: (NWCG, 2006 p. Appdx. B)

•

Fire type anticipated under extreme fire conditions. The desired fire type is surface fire with limited
torching and no running crown fire.

In addition to measuring how well the desired condition pertaining to the Purpose and Need for Action for fire
restoration and fuels reduction, the ability to manage a fire, firefighter safety, impacts to private property, and
WUI objectives can all be estimated utilizing these evaluation criteria.

Boundaries
To determine relevant past, present, and foreseeable future projects, spatial and temporal boundaries must be
defined (CFR § 220.4 (f)). For the effects analysis the direct and indirect effects of the Elk project relative to
fire and fuels are conditions influencing fuel loading and ladder and crown fuel characteristics. Direct and
indirect effects from the Elk project that influence these conditions are changes to surface fuel accumulations,
small tree and brush growth or density, overstory tree density, tree crown heights, and tree mortality (and
resultant deadfall).

Spatial Bounding
Spatially, direct and indirect effects of changes to fuel loading, ladder and crown fuel characteristics from
project activities are within and nearby the treated units. As such, the spatial context being considered is the
Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project boundary. This boundary represents the area potentially influenced by
effects from proposed treatment activities.

Temporal Bounding
150

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Temporally, direct and indirect effects of changes to fuel loading, ladder and crown fuel characteristics from
project activities are expected to remain effective for about ten about years. Multiple prescribed fire entries
would be used to restore the historical fire return interval and maintain the stands throughout time. The burn
entries would be timed to ensure effectiveness of treatments was not lost. The cumulative effects analysis
timeline of 30 years would encompass 3 burn entries, which coincides with the proposal for 2 to 3
incremental underburns, repeated every 5 to 10 years. As such, the temporal context is 30 years into the
future.
The baseline year used for this analysis is 2014 as the existing condition. The description of the existing
condition includes the accumulation of past activities, which have influenced vegetation. In the effects
discussion, “short-term” refers to effects over the 10-year period from the time the activity was accomplished.
Beyond 10 years effects are considered “long-term.” The current environmental conditions reflect the
aggregate impact of all prior human actions and natural events that have affected the environment and might
contribute to cumulative effects and are a proxy for the impacts of past actions.63

Affected Environment
The purpose and need in Chapter 1 wholly describes the fire and fuels affected environment beginning on
page 23. Approximately 1,490 acres of natural stands and approximately 675 acres of older plantations are
susceptible to high severity fire effects due to suppression and exclusion of naturally-occurring fire, which has
led to dense accumulations of live and dead fuels that have combined with fuels from the recent bark beetlecaused mortality.
In summary:
•

Fire Regime - The entire project area has departed from the natural fire regime; most of the project
area (91%) historically experienced a high frequency (0-35 years) low to mixed severity fire return
interval. Currently, it is unlikely fire could play its natural role (short interval, low to moderate
intensity fire regime) in the project area.

•

Fuel Loading - Current surface fuel loadings in portions of the project area range from 5 to 60 tons
per acre. Where there are high levels of existing and ongoing mortality, it is expected to increase to 35
to 100 plus tons per acre when these dead and dying trees fall over the next 3-5 years. Approximately
10 percent of the Elk Flat LSR is currently comprised of large pockets (up to 80 acres) of standing
dead trees that present a current and future threat due to increasing fuel loads and safety
considerations. Estimated acres of machine piling needed based on fuel loading is approximately 944
acres. The maximum acreage, pending deadfall, approximates 1,461 acres.

•

Fuel Models - Fuel models present within the project area include the following:
FM 10– Fuel model 10 can be characterized by dense late-successional conifer stands with heavy
amounts of dead and down woody fuels. The understory is densely populated with intermediate
size conifers. A wildfire carried by these fuels would be intense enough to cause crowning,
spotting and rapid rates of spread. Large stand replacing fires can be expected.
FM 9 – Fuel model 9 is characterized by closed canopy conifer stands with densely stocked pole
size trees in the understory. Typically, these stands contain pockets of dead and down woody
fuels. These fuels create high fire intensities during surface fires that can easily spread through
the understory to the crowns of the dominant conifers.

63

This approach is consistent with CFR § 220.4 (f) and the Council on Environmental Quality June 24, 2005
memorandum regarding analysis of past actions.

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

151

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

FM 2– Fuel model 2 is characterized by poorer timbered stands and young plantations with grass
and brush. Surface fires can spread easily with pockets of fuels generating high heat intensities.

Environmental Consequences
Alternative 1- Modified Proposed Action
Direct and Indirect Effects – Alternative 1
Reducing surface and ladder fuels and crown density in the project area would directly change the fuel profile
and fire behavior. Activity fuels (slash generated from harvest and thinning activities), along with natural fuels
such as standing excess snags, dead and down woody debris and shrubs, would be treated through a variety of
methods including: removal, piling and burning and underburning. This, when combined with the raising of
the canopy base heights (by reducing ladder fuels and reducing stand density through thinning and prescribed
burning) will reduce the ability of surface fires to transition into the tree crowns.
Fire modeling results show a decrease in anticipated fire behavior under 97th percentile weather conditions
following treatment. Flame lengths would be less than 4 feet, allowing for ground forces to manage the fire.
The likelihood of passive crown fire would be reduced. Models indicate surface fire would be most probable.
Stand mortality is expected to be less than 10 percent under a wildfire scenario in the most extreme weather
conditions, following the initial treatment (thinning, slash treatment, underburn). Pockets of mortality
resulting in excessive fuel loading would be treated allowing for reduced fire intensity and improved safety
for firefighters.
Fuel loading would be managed with repeated fire entries. Fuel models 2 and 9 would be present in the
project area. Fuels model proportions would shift to less than 15 percent fuel model 10 (unthinned patches).
Fule et al. (2012), (2001) and Prichard et al. (2010) indicate the most appropriate fuel treatment strategy is
thinning (removal of ladder fuels and decreased crown density) followed by prescribed fire and other
appropriate slash treatments. These treatments provide the best protection from undesirable impacts from fire
during extreme conditions. Both Fule et al. papers emphasize the importance of continued prescribed fire
treatments to maintain the achieved condition.
The underburn only treatment areas (including leave islands) will benefit from increased nutrient cycling and
reduced surface fuel loading. These areas will still have interlocking canopy and ladder fuels. This will be the
area most susceptible to torching, crown fire initiation, and increased mortality during a wildfire. The
repeated burn treatments would create some pockets, through thinning with fire. The distribution of these
areas through the project area would provide for a mosaic pattern across the landscape. In the event of a
wildfire, any crown fire should be short duration and drop back to the surface when it reaches an area that has
received mechanical and burn treatment.
Proposed activities include the repeated prescribed fire entries to mimic the historic fire regime. Following the
initial entry, fire managers would have more (and safer) options for managing fire in the project area.
Opportunities will exist for fire moving across the landscape to meet multiple resource objectives. This may
be utilized in place of second or third entry prescribed fire treatments. Re-introducing fire back into a fire
adapted ecosystem through prescribed fire treatments and wildfire with desirable effects, moves the project
area towards restoration of ecological processes as directed by current fire policy. Stand composition and
structure would be maintained through fire, as occurred under the historic fire regime.
The combination of an initial mechanical treatment in most stands, followed by repeated fire entries, would
move the project area toward a condition class 1. This is defined as fire regimes within the natural historic
range. The risk of losing key ecosystem components is low. Vegetation attributes are intact and functioning
within the natural range.
152

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Unthinned patches would be retained in up to 15 percent of the project area. Some of these patches would be
underburned, while others would not. The effects in the unburned patches will be similar to what is described
in the no action alternative, for un-burned patches; while the burned patches will result in effects similar to the
burn only treatment described above. Since these pockets are scattered throughout the project area, overall
project objectives will be met. A fire response and corresponding management actions may be influenced by
where the fire starts (in a treated vs. untreated portion of the project area). Resulting fire effects will also vary
depending on where the fire is located.

Effects relative to Purpose and Need for Action
Alternative 1 provides for the most area treated in the most strategic areas such as adjacent to private property.
This alternative treats the landscape within the project area providing for the greatest area of restored forest.
The maximized treatment would provide for the most manageable wildfire behavior following the treatments.
This alternative also maximizes safety for fire managers implementing prescribed fire treatments and
management of wildfire.
By reducing surface and ladder fuels and crown density in the project area, thereby changing the fuel profile
and fire behavior, Alternative 1 would reduce the risk of loss of early, mid and late-successional habitat.
Treated stands would be more resilient, having the capacity to better withstand and survive disturbances such
as wildfire, especially under changing conditions such as climate change.
Underburning would reintroduce fire processes in elk flat and help restore meadow habitat.

Compliance with law, regulation and policy
Alternative 1 meets Forest Plan direction, watershed analyses desired conditions, regional direction regarding
ecological restoration, and national fire management policy that was summarized in the Fire/Fuels report,
across the project area.

Cumulative Effects – Alternative 1
In elk flat, Pilgrim Vegetation Management Project treatments would be completed 64 to meet the objectives of
returning the area to a pine savannah by substantially reducing stand density in order to restore the more open
conditions that existed historically and more mimic historical fire regimes. 65 When combined with treatments
in Alternative 1, overall fire behavior will be improved. It will break up the continuity of fuels, helping to
reduce fire behavior in the event of a wildfire. This will also create a healthier stand, reducing the chances of
mortality in the residual trees. Less mortality results in less surface fuel accumulation in the future.

Alternative 2- No New Temporary Road Construction Other Than Those Required
for Landing Access
Direct and Indirect Effects – Alternative 2
Fire behavior would not be completely modified on 98 acres under alternative 2. Passive crown fire and flame
lengths greater than four feet are anticipated during extreme summer conditions on a portion of the un-thinned
acres. Prescribed burning is planned on these 98 acres, but there would not be any mechanical vegetation
removal. Underburning would reduce surface fuels and potentially thin some of the canopy. Repeated fire
64

Thinning 4”-14” dbh encroaching conifers on approximately 147 acres down to 80 square feet of basal area per acre

65

The area was partially thinned but retains too many trees to meet the objectives of 80 square feet of basal area per
acre. As such, trees would be thinned down to 80 square feet of basal area per acre.

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

153

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

entries would continue to move these stands toward the desired condition. It would take several fire entries to
reach the desired state.
Dropping these units totaling 98 acres from thinning of which 58 acres were to be piled, results in anticipated
effects slightly better than those discussed in the no action alternative. As described in the Alternative 1
description, a combination of overstory and understory treatment is the best approach for modifying fire
behavior during extreme conditions. While no thinning or machine piling would be undertaken on the acres
eliminated due to no temporary road construction, underburning would still be applied resulting in a slight
improvement over no action, but less effective than in Alternative 1. Some of the areas dropped for thinning
in this alternative are adjacent to private property, which increases risk of wildfire crossing in either direction
between the LSR and adjoining private lands.
Resulting fuel models would be 2, 9 and 10. The 98 acres that shift to underburn-only would remain a fuel
model 10, but may move to a fuel model 13 over time. As mortality occurs and the fuels fall to the ground,
fire behavior would likely be high intensity. Active flaming is sustained for long periods and a wide variety of
firebrands can be generated under the fuel model 13 due to the large amounts of surface fuel accumulation.
This contributes to spotting problems as weather conditions become more severe (NWCG, 2006).
This alternative moves the project area toward the historical fire regime and makes the area safer for fire
managers. Fire policy and national direction would be met under this alternative and fire managers would
have more options for future treatments. Repeated fire entries are achieved under this alternative. The primary
difference from Alternative 1 is the 98 acres that would not have overstory thinning completed, a portion of
which is adjacent to private property. The impacts in the unthinned patches are the same as Alternative 1.

Effects relative to Purpose and Need for Action
Alternative 2 moves the project area toward desired conditions but provides treatments on fewer acres.
Objectives would be met on the acres being treated. However, Alternatives 2 leaves 98 acres treated through
underburning only. Underburning will return the ecological process to the ecosystem, but safety will not be
modified. Fire behavior within these areas would be consistent with the no action alternative. Crown fire will
still carry through these areas not treated with thinning. Ladder fuels will remain, allowing fire to get into the
canopy if a fire were to start in the unthinned pockets. By reducing surface and ladder fuels, as well as crown
density, in the project area (thereby changing the fuel profile and fire behavior), Alternative 2 would help
reduce the risk of loss of early, mid and late-successional habitat in the project area in thinned areas. Like
Alternative 1, stands that are thinned and burned would be more resilient.

Compliance with law, regulation and policy
Alternative 2 meets Forest Plan direction, watershed analyses desired conditions, regional direction regarding
ecological restoration, and national fire management policy that was summarized in the Fire/Fuels report,
across the project area.

Cumulative Effects – Alternative 2
In elk flat, Pilgrim Vegetation Management Project treatments would be completed 66 to meet the objectives of
returning the area to a pine savannah by substantially reducing stand density in order to restore the more open
conditions that existed historically and more mimic historical fire regimes. 67 When combined with treatments
66

Thinning 4”-14” dbh encroaching conifers on approximately 147 acres down to 80 square feet of basal area per acre
with underburning on 25 acres of those acres.
67

The area was partially thinned but retains too many trees to meet the objectives of 80 square feet of basal area per
acre. As such, trees would be thinned down to 80 square feet of basal area per acre.

154

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

in Alternative 2, overall fire behavior will be improved on the acres being treated. It will break up the
continuity of fuels, helping to reduce fire behavior in the event of a wildfire. This will also create a healthier
stand, reducing the chances of mortality in the residual trees. Less mortality results in less surface fuel
accumulation in the future.

Alternative 3 - No Treatments of Natural Stands within Designated Critical Habitat
for the Northern Spotted Owl
Direct and Indirect Effects – Alternative 3
Fire behavior will not be modified across approximately 268 acres compared to Alternative 1. Fire will not be
returned to the landscape on 716 acres and surface fuel loading will not be sufficiently reduced on 96 acres,
compared to alternative 1. These areas removed from treatment, in comparison to the proposed action, would
see effects as described under the no action alternative. During the summer fire season, it is possible the area
could experience passive crown fire since it would not be treated with this alternative. Flame lengths are
likely to exceed 4 feet, requiring equipment to be utilized to manage a wildfire. The area not being treated
under this alternative is located next to private property and a portion is within the Wildland Urban Interface.
Fuel models 2, 9, 10 and eventually 13 will be present in the project area. Fuel model 13 results in fire being
carried by a continuous layer of slash. Large quantities of material greater than 3 inches is present. Fires
spread quickly through fine fuels and intensity builds up as the large fuels start burning. Active flaming is
sustained for long periods and a wide variety of firebrands can be generated. These contribute to spotting
problems as the weather conditions become more severe. Total fuel loading may exceed 300 tons, but the less
than 3 inch fuel is generally only 10 percent of the fuel load. (NWCG, 2006).
The area excluded from treatment would not meet the desired future condition. It does not meet the
requirements outlined in the Forest Plan, or current fire policy. The recommendations outlined in the
watershed analyses will not be implemented in this area. This area would also not be treated according to the
best available science for fire and fuels management.
The direct and indirect effects to the remaining portion of the project area are the same as described under
Alternative 1. The portion of the project area proposed for treatments with this alternative would meet current
fire policy, Forest Plan direction and watershed analyses recommendations.

Effects relative to Purpose and Need for Action
Alternative 3 moves the project area toward desired conditions but provides treatments on fewer acres.
Objectives would be on the acres being treated. However, Alternatives 3 leaves areas un-treated on more
acreage than Alternatives 1 or 2, resulting in effects constant with no action. Fire behavior, safety and
ecological process are not modified on a portion of the project area.
By reducing surface and ladder fuels, as well as crown density, in the project area (thereby changing the fuel
profile and fire behavior), Alternative 3 would help reduce the risk of loss of early, mid and late-successional
habitat in the project area in treated areas. Like Alternative 1, where treated, stands would be more resilient.

Compliance with law, regulation and policy
Alternative 3 meets Forest Plan direction, watershed analyses desired conditions, regional direction regarding
ecological restoration, and national fire management policy that was summarized in the Fire/Fuels report,
across the treated areas.

Cumulative Effects – Alternative 3

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

In elk flat, Pilgrim Vegetation Management Project treatments would be completed 68 to meet the objectives of
returning the area to a pine savannah by substantially reducing stand density in order to restore the more open
conditions that existed historically and more mimic historical fire regimes. 69 When combined with treatments
in Alternative 3, overall fire behavior will be improved, in the areas treated. It will break up the continuity of
fuels, helping to reduce fire behavior in the event of a wildfire. This will also create a healthier stand,
reducing the chances of mortality in the residual trees. Less mortality results in less surface fuel accumulation
in the future.

Alternative 4 - No Action
Under No Action, the proposed management activities would not be implemented. No direct, indirect, or
cumulative effects are expected. Although there would be no actions undertaken with this alternative, ongoing
trends would continue.
Surface, ladder and crown fuels would continue to accumulate in the absence of fire or treatment. With no
modification of forest structure and fuels, fire behavior under normal, summer conditions would be as
described in the current conditions, threatening resources within the project area and potentially private
property. The mortality in the pine may continue to spread. The standing dead that currently exist in the
project area will fall in the next five to ten years adding to the current surface fuel loading. Wildfire
management options in these areas with standing dead would be limited. Fire management will not put people
at risk in these areas. The fire would be allowed to burn until it left the mortality pockets allowing firefighters
to safely engage. This will add to fire size and under extreme conditions, could create fire control issues.
Once the trees have fallen, surface fuel loadings are estimated to exceed 100 tons / acre in the mortality
pockets. These areas would be characterized as a fuel model 13. Appendix B of the Fireline Handbook
(NWCG, 2006) describes fire activity in a fuel model 13 as “fire is generally carried by a continuous layer of
slash. Large quantities of greater than 3 inches material are present. Fires spread quickly through the fine fuels
and intensity builds up as the large fuels start burning. Active flaming is sustained for long periods and a wide
variety of firebrands can be generated.” A wildfire in these pockets with high fuel loading will be high
intensity. This may require firefighters to back off to an area where intensity will be less. Equipment would
have a difficult time working in these areas. As a result, the creation of control lines with dozers is not a likely
tactic.
In the natural stands, where mortality is not yet occurring, fire behavior is going to remain an issue under the
no action alternative. Some areas in the project are expected to experience passive crown fire and flame
lengths greater than 4 feet. This will not allow ground forces to directly attack the flanks or head of a fire.
Equipment or aircraft will be needed to manage a fire under these conditions. Modeling indicated up to 40
percent mortality from a wildfire in the natural stands under 97th percentile weather conditions. With these
conditions, fire managers are limited to the tactics that could be utilized and would be effective. This has the
potential to impact our neighbors, as a fire that starts on the forest, within the project area, could move onto
private lands.
In the absence of management actions, no progress would be made towards initiating the restoration of
ecological processes that include the natural fire regimes, high frequency (0 to 35 years) low to mixed
severity fire return intervals. The no action alternative does not follow the national fire policy direction, the

The area was partially thinned but retains too many trees to meet the objectives of 80 square feet of basal area per
acre. As such, trees would be thinned down to 80 square feet of basal area per acre.

Forest Plan, Watershed Analysis or LSRA. It would not contribute to the desired condition, purpose and need,
or respond to policy aimed at reducing hazardous fuels to modify current fire behavior that would increase
fire management operations. The ability of firefighters to safely and effectively suppress a wildland fire would
become more difficult as fire behavior characteristics intensify. Opportunities to return fire back into the
ecosystem will be limited.

Cumulative Effects
Alternative 4 does not alter the fuels profile nor minimizes fire behavior. There would be no additional direct
effects in regard to reducing forest fuels or modifying fire behavior. There would be no cumulative effects.
Ongoing trends would continue.
Elk flat treatments from the Pilgrim Vegetation Management Project would improve overall fire behavior and
fire regime processes on those treated acres (147 acres) within the project area boundary.

Summary and Conclusions
All action alternatives provide some level of reduced surface fuel loading, ladder and crown fuel
characteristics as well as breaking up fuel continuity over the project area. Table 55 provides a summary of
fuels effects by indicator and alternative.

Alternative 1 provides for the most area treated and in the most strategic areas such as adjacent to private
property. This alternative treats the landscape within the project area, providing for the greatest area of
restored forest. The maximized treatment will provide for the most manageable wildfire behavior following
the treatments. This alternative also maximizes safety for fire managers implementing prescribed fire
treatments and managing wildfire. Alternative 1 meets the Land and Resource Management Plan direction,
Watershed Analyses desired conditions, regional direction regarding ecological restoration and national fire
management policy across the project area.
Alternatives 2 and 3 move the project area toward desired conditions. These alternatives do provide
treatments across limited acres in the project area. They meet objectives on the acres being treated. However,
both alternatives leave areas un-treated, resulting in effects constant with no action. Fire behavior, safety and
ecological process are not modified on a portion of the project area.
The no action alternative does not provide for firefighter safety, modify fire behavior, respond to national fire
direction, or meet the Land and Resource Management Plan direction.

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Wildlife
A draft wildlife Biological Assessment (BA) that assess the predicted effects to listed species under the
preferred alternative (Jordan, 2015) and draft Biological Evaluation (BE) for sensitive wildlife species
(Jordan, 2015c) was completed for this project and are incorporated by reference. Information relevant to this
decision is summarized here.

Introduction
Purpose and Need Applicable to Wildlife 70
#1-Risk reduction and increased stand resilience; #2-Accelerating development of late-successional and oldgrowth forest characteristics; and #4-Retaining hardwoods as a stand component are all relative to wildlife.
#5-Restoration of hydrologic function and #6- Managing the National Forest transportation system and
decommissioning unauthorized routes are also related from the standpoint of protecting and enhancing latesuccessional and connectivity habitat in Riparian Reserves, and reducing route density in the LSR. The
existing and desired conditions relating to these Purpose and Needs is fully described in Chapter 1.

Issues Applicable to Wildlife
Issue #1-Large tree and snag removal and group selection logging directly harms late-successional
ecosystems in Late-Successional Reserves, Riparian Reserves and Critical Habitat; and Issue #3- Treatments
within designated critical habitat for the northern spotted owl violate the 2011 Revised Recovery Plan and the
2012 Final Critical Habitat Rule for the Northern Spotted Owl (NSO). The Environmental Consequences
section discusses the effects of various thinning, and other treatments designed to improve NSO, fisher and
northern goshawk habitat resilience, function and diversity (group selection in plantations, black oak release)
and fuels treatment relative to the purpose and need. How these treatments are expected to influence
designated critical habitat for the northern spotted owl (NSO) is addressed (Key Issue #3). Issues not carried
forward in this section include a portion of #2 and #3; there are no permanent roads proposed for construction,
but the effects of Alternative 2 (no new temporary road construction) on wildlife will be compared. Also
recovery plans are not regulatory (USDI-FWS, 2011 pp. I-3 to I-4) and therefore, cannot be violated. The
Forest has prepared a consistency assessment for the project and the Recovery Plan.

Methodology
Throughout project design and analysis, the best available scientific and commercial data applicable to the
project area was utilized. This includes direct observations in and near the analysis areas and the most recent
and appropriate scientific research or species information. Data sources include but are not limited to the
Revised Recovery Plan for the Northern Spotted Owl (NSO) and Final Rule for NSO Critical Habitat; and
information from the State of California, FWS and research literature as it applies to the gray wolf. For
proposed listed and sensitive species, the FWS’ species profile and Forest-level monitoring and research was
utilized for the fisher; and local, regional and national research and literature was used for the northern
goshawk, fringed myotis and pallid and Townsend’s big-eared bats, Shasta hesperian and the western bumble
bee. This information, combined with field reviews and stand modeling described below, was used to design
the project treatments, locations and resource protection measures, and to determine the likely effects on
federally and proposed listed species, Forest Service sensitive species and for other wildlife compliance topics
(see Appendix H – Compliance and Consistency).
A species list was obtained December 22, 2015 from the Yreka Fish and Wildlife Service field office through
IPaC 71 at https://ecos.fws.gov/ipac/gettingStarted/index. Based on review of the list, species assessed in detail

in the BA include the threatened northern spotted owl (NSO) and endangered gray wolf. The Consultation
section in the BA fully describes the streamlined consultation process to date with the FWS and the
development and modification of treatment prescriptions and project design features and is included as
Appendix E. The draft BA is available in the online project record.
Field reviews and ground trothing was done from August 2009 through May 2013. These reviews were used
to establish a spatial layer and acreage of habitat type and quality for the listed NSO and Forest Service
sensitive species, and to determine where mechanical treatments should be excluded and fireline may be
needed to protect higher habitat quality or areas of documented species use (territories, denning habitat).
Reviews were completed in the project area and on surrounding private and NFS lands, with additional field
and vegetation analysis work completed in fall 2015 to assess the existing condition for the listed gray wolf.
Field reviews were supplemented by the draft NSO Habitat EVEG model for SMMU (NSO action area and
fisher analysis area), the Forest’s existing vegetation layer from the Remote Sensing Lab (USDA-FS, 2007a)
(NSO and gray wolf action areas), aerial photo interpretation (2012 and 2014 NAIP), and NSO habitat maps
provided by private landowners. SMMU NSO and goshawk survey records (1989-2009) and the 2014 and
2015 carnivore surveys for the Management Unit (USDA-FS 2014, 2015) were reviewed; and species data
from the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) and Forest’s Natural Resources Information
System (NRIS) was queried (2013-2015). Protocol surveys and activity center stand search data for NSO
(1990-present), northern goshawk surveys (1985-present) and forest carnivore surveys (2002/2003, 2014present) have also informed the project design and analysis.
Project area common stand exams (CSE) (USDA-FS, 2007) and FACTS data for plantations was used to
supplement the field reviews for habitat type and quality. Fuel loading data was assessed in 2007 using
Browns Transects, and again in 2011 using ocular estimation and photo series methods (Maxwell, et al.,
1979). Predicted future stand attributes were modeled from the CSE and fuels data, using the Forest
Vegetation Simulator (FVS) Inland California and Southern Cascades variant (Keyser, 2008, 2013). The FVS
Fire & Fuels Extension (FVS-FFE; (Reinhardt, et al., 2003) was used to model pre- and post-treatment fuel
loading, vegetation characteristics that influence fire behavior (canopy base height and crown bulk density)
and flame lengths. These methods are fully described in the Silviculture and Forest Health and Fire and Fuels
section. The FVS-FFE modeling assumptions, limitations and applicability to the indicators and information
regarding the Action and No Action alternatives considered in detail are also described in the silviculture
report (Payne, 2015b) and the Fire and Fuels resource report (McRae, 2015).

Wildlife Specific Assumptions
•

Acres and stand conditions are approximate and in some cases, existing conditions (basal area,
canopy closure, tree size classes) are averaged across a combination of similar stands.

•

Minor differences in acreage effects may exist between this analysis and other documents or
appendices due to rounding and/or differences in resource analysis areas and methodologies
employed for assessing impacts. These differences do not invalidate this analysis or conclusions.

•

New landing sizes are approximated to range between 0.5 - 0.75 acre, with the maximum acreage
assessed to account for the maximum potential effect. Depending on unit acreage, alternative, and
layout, units smaller than 30 acres may require their own landing. Existing landings and natural
openings would be used as feasible to reduce new disturbance, and in accordance with RPMs, though
final landing location is approved during sale administration.

Temporary road widths would not exceed 14 feet.

Under all proposed activities, trees, snags, or logs that are a safety hazard to the public or operations

Incomplete and Unavailable Information
For stands not included in the 2007 CSE and Browns Transects, similar stand data was utilized to extrapolate
what the effects may be from treatment and No Action. Extrapolation was applied based on field
reconnaissance to compare stand conditions, stand history and aerial photo comparisons. There are some
assumptions and limitations in the analysis regarding the effects of thinning and fuels treatments under both
No Action and Action scenarios (see the Silviculture and Forest Health section for a full description of
assumptions). In summary, while the 2007 CSE data and FVS-FFE modeling program work in concert, the
data is just under nine years old. The subsequent field reviews in 2010-2014, and additional sampling of fuel
loading in 2011, further informs the analysis. However, the age of the CSE data and the rapidly changing
conditions and increased mortality, notably in the ponderosa pine component, between 2009 and 2012 is such
that the conclusions presented in the modeling results reflect trends, and not absolute numbers. This is
particularly relevant for the indicator of snags larger than 20 inches in diameter.
Additionally, specifics on species, size classes and associated tons per acre of down wood are not available.
The existing condition for down wood was estimated based on the collected data in Browns Transects and
subsequent field reviews.
The modeled results of the No Action and Action alternatives considered in detail for fire effects (flame
lengths, rates of spread, severity) is also not available to be spatially displayed, though the Fire and Fuels
section discusses these effects in general terms. The wildlife analysis uses these general terms, and the output
results from individual stand modeling in FVS-FFE, to describe the expected fire behavior in certain stands
and extrapolating that to similar stands. While the Map 6 data set in the BA displays predicted fire behavior
under No Action, based on the 2007 CSE and Browns Transect data, this mapping effort has not been updated
to reflect the changed/changing stand conditions and higher levels (40-100+ tons per acre) of fuel loading in
the eastern and southeastern portions of the project area. It also does not account for the increase in mortality
pockets in young and old plantations, or the increase in mortality pockets in the mixed conifer-pine natural
stands in other portions of the project area.

Indicators and Measures
When considering effects on wildlife, the primary factors of change and impact include those factors that
either influence habitat suitability, use or species behavior. Predicted direct, indirect and cumulative effects
(as defined under the ESA for NSO, as well as NEPA cumulative effects) are evaluated using a combination
of qualitative and quantitative indicators. These indicators help determine the degree (magnitude, duration and
intensity) to which treatments may affect individuals and their habitat components; including predicted
changes in an individual species’ response to a disturbance or habitat manipulation, or changes in habitat
function at various spatial scales.
Integral to the indicator effects analysis is how specific prescription elements, project design, and resource
protection measures (RPMs) reduce the potential for direct, indirect or cumulative effects (including shortterm adverse or long-term beneficial effects). This analysis is based on research, local and regional
monitoring and other applicable best available science. These indicators are also used to compare how
alternatives meet the purpose and need and the key issues.
Issue indicators applicable to wildlife are listed in Table 56 as they relate to achievement of the purpose and
need, and key issues. See Table 29 PART II in Chapter 2 for the comparison of Key Issue #3 and the same
table PART III for the comparison of general habitat indicators for late-successional associated species. There
are no purpose and need or key issue indicators relative to the gray wolf or sensitive species (other than

northern goshawk and fisher). Therefore, an analysis for these species is not included here. For the general
analysis of project effects on these other species, refer to the BA and wildlife BE, available in the online
project record. For Key Issue #3, the listed indicators in Table 56 are used to measure the scale of how the
alternatives considered in detail meet the management guidance, and the special management considerations
described for critical habitat subunit ECS-3 in the 2012 Final Critical Habitat Rule for the Northern Spotted
Owl (USDI-FWS, 2012).

Boundaries
To determine relevant past, present, and foreseeable future projects, spatial and temporal boundaries must be
defined (CFR § 220.4 (f)). Wildlife use and distribution in and across an area is primarily influenced by
availability of suitable habitat and connectivity within and between habitat elements. Use is influenced by
site-specific factors such as structure or physical features (e.g., tree/shrub species, size class, canopy closure;
CWD and snags; decadence and cavities; water; caves; forage base) as well as by landscape considerations
such as proximity to other suitable habitat or the need for isolation or seclusion. A multi-scale analysis that
assesses site-specific conditions within stands proposed for treatment, and on the larger landscape in terms of
proximity to and availability of other suitable habitat, is generally considered.

Spatial Bounding
For the direct and indirect effects of the project relative to NSO, northern goshawk and fisher, these
conditions influence these species: disturbance to breeding, feeding and sheltering behaviors and habitats; tree
and shrub species composition and juxtaposition on the landscape; stand structure (layering, canopy cover,
decadence); down wood and recruitment; existing snags and large snag recruitment; prey base; and
connectivity. For all action alternatives, direct and indirect effects are evaluated at the treatment unit and
project area scale as this this reflects the physical footprint where activities would occur, and therefore,
potential direct effects (e.g., mechanical thinning/fuels treatments, hand thinning, prescribed fire, road
management and noise-generating activities).
Other biologically meaningful scales are utilized as described in Table 56 above, including NSO core and
home range, known northern goshawk territories, and at the stand level for the fisher, resting or denning
structure or known denning areas (based on field surveys). Effects analyses can also occur across multiple
analysis units that frequently overlap and are relevant to conservation concerns for species, including larger
conservation units such as critical habitat or LSR designation. Spatial bounding for cumulative effects is
generally unique to each species considered and for cumulative effects to occur, the effects of the actions must
overlap in space and time for there to be potential cumulative effects; determined by how long, and how far
reaching an action’s direct and indirect effects are felt on a given resource area. While there may be an
overlap in two or more projects’ cumulative effects spatial (or temporal bounds), where there are no direct or
indirect effects that overlap in time and space, there are no cumulative effects.
The ESA defines the spatial boundary for analysis as the action area, which includes all areas likely to be
affected directly or indirectly by the proposed Federal action and not merely the immediate area involved in
the action (50 CFR §402.02). The action area is generally larger than the project area, but only encompasses
162

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

the geographic extent of environmental changes (i.e., the physical, chemical and biotic effects) that may result
directly and indirectly from an action, and elicit a response in an individual (USDI-FWS 2015). For the NSO,
a 1.3-mile buffer on Alternative 1 72 silviculture, fuels treatments and road actions defines the spatial bounds
of the action area. This bounding is an appropriate scale, as it is equivalent to the radius of the estimated
median annual NSO home range size in northern California, based on radio-telemetry data (Thomas et al.
1990, (USDI-FWS, 2011). It allows for an analysis of any other adjacent or overlapping territories/home
ranges and potential effects to connectivity, thereby framing the context and significance of potential impacts
to those other areas. It is also the accepted range by the FWS for NSO effects analysis, and it includes
managed private timberlands that may influence NSO habitat use in and outside the project area. The NSO
critical habitat analysis area is simply the portion of the action area that overlaps critical habitat.
For the northern goshawk, spatial bounding also consists of all areas within 1.3 miles of the Alternative 1
silviculture, fuels treatments and road actions. This area is appropriate as it is equivalent to the radius of a
typical NGO home range in this region, although territory size is generally at 200-250 acres, and home ranges
can include multiple territories for an individual pair (Woodbridge and Hargis 2006). It allows for analysis of
any adjacent known territories of other pairs, framing the context and significance of potential impacts to
those other areas or individuals. It also includes managed private timberlands that may influence NGO habitat
use in and outside the project area and it is large enough to assess potential effects to connectivity.
For the fisher, since there are no telemetry studies in this part of the fisher’s range to base an average female
home range size upon, a habitat-based approach was agreed to with the FWS (Jordan, 2015) (Jordan, 2015c).
The spatial bounding encompasses the entire project area, and extends north, up to the ~6,500-foot elevation
range. It then extends northwest and northeast to the extent of available reproductive habitat, based on stand
conditions, age class, species composition and cover. This approach is biologically meaningful for this
species, is likely adequate to support approximately three female home ranges and like the NSO and northern
goshawk, includes managed private timberlands that may influence fisher habitat use in and outside the
project area and is large enough to assess potential effects to connectivity. The “fine-scale” spatial analysis
area for effects to fisher consist of treatment unit, stand level and resting/denning structure (see Table 56).

Temporal Bounding
Temporal bounding consists of both short- and long-term timeframes. Short-term consists of when treatments
occur and vegetation begins to respond, usually within one season to 10 years of treatment implementation.
Long-term effects extend for approximately 20 or more years after treatment and correspond to the modeled
changes and effectiveness of thinning and fuel treatments described in this EIS and respective analyses. Direct
effects are defined by the period that actions would be occurring in/near treatment units, reproductive areas,
and habitat (short term). Indirect effects occur over both the short and long term.
It is estimated to take 5 to 10 years for initial thinning, fuels treatments, reforestation activities and road
actions to be completed. Fuels treatments are expected to occur within approximately one season to 10 years
after thinning/harvest treatments, given that some pile burning could occur a few years after the last units are
harvested. Three prescribed fire entries are proposed and are estimated to take up to 30 years to implement.
Temporal bounding for cumulative effects under the ESA 73 consists of the period when all proposed
treatments and activities are expected to be completed, and when any effects from foreseeable future State or
72

This alternative affects the most acres, and therefore accounts for all treatment activities that could occur.

section 7 analyses and should not be confused with the broader use of this term [cumulative effects] in the National
Environmental Policy Act or other environmental laws (March 1998 ESA Consultation Handbook, p. xiii).

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

private actions can be reasonably predicted and felt on the landscape in combination with the project’s effects.
For NEPA cumulative effects, the effects of past, ongoing and reasonably foreseeable future projects on
Federal, State or private lands is assessed.
The baseline year used for this analysis and the existing condition is 2014. The description of the existing
condition in Chapter 1 for the project area, and the Affected Environment section below for the three species
includes the accumulation of past activities, which have influenced vegetation and species use. The current
environmental conditions reflect the aggregate impact of all prior human actions and natural events that have
resulted in the current environmental conditions, and might contribute to cumulative effects and are a proxy
for the impacts of past actions. 74
Based on the modeled and expected treatment effectiveness and that past projects maintained a higher tree
density, allowing for canopy recovery in 15 to 20 years (Fleming 2012), it is reasonable to establish temporal
bounding by a 20 to 30 year window of recovery. This timeframe is adequate to encompass several NSO,
northern goshawk and fisher breeding attempts, and potential disturbances to those attempts, notably since
NSO and northern goshawk do not attempt to breed every year and the number of years varies between each
attempt (Forsman, et al., 1984); USDA-FS 1989-2015 NGO records). It also includes the period that project
actions and effects would be occur, and potentially overlap with other private, state, or federal activities and
those effects. A comprehensive review of past, ongoing and reasonably foreseeable future actions on private
and NFS lands within the NSO, northern goshawk and fisher spatial and temporal bounding was completed
and, and is included in the project record (Jordan, 2015c; Jordan, 2015b).

Affected Environment
As described in Chapter 1, the risk of losing late-successional stand conditions, NSO and other latesuccessional species habitat and critical habitat in the project area is the direct result of an elevated epidemic
natural ecological process; the presence of blackstain and Heterobasidion root disease combined with pine
and white fir overstocking, prolonged drought conditions and bark beetle attacks in pine. These conditions
have resulted in increased fuel loading (100+ tons in some portions, but average 60 tons per acre) in a
significant portion of the project area. Other contributors to the existing condition include past management
actions, fire suppression and a lack of a low-intensity natural fire return interval. Most plantation and natural
stands identified for mechanical thinning and other restoration and diversity treatments are either uniformly
dense in the mid and understory (i.e. pine, white fir and cedar regeneration) or lack horizontal and vertical
diversity (stands are pole-medium trees with stagnated growth and no under or midstory). In the ponderosa
pine-dominated stands, the overall stand is at risk due to general overstocking, root disease, beetles or a
combination of these factors. The natural stands and older plantations typically have scattered predominant
legacy trees that range from 42-80”+ inches diameter dbh. The 20-40+ year old plantations are predominantly
ponderosa pine, containing densely spaced trees with interlocking crowns that limit growth potential and put
surrounding stands at risk.
NSO, fisher and northern goshawk (NGO) habitat, particularly NSO nesting/roosting and high quality
foraging, fisher resting/denning, and NGO nesting habitat are typically equated with late-successional and
old-growth forest conditions. Foraging and dispersal habitats provide source habitat for prey base, protection
from avian and carnivorous (bobcat) predators and contribute to connectivity. Connectivity as defined in the
NWFP is a measure of the extent to which the landscape pattern of the late-successional and old-growth
ecosystem provides for biological and ecological flows that sustain late-successional and old-growth
associated animal and plant species. It does not necessarily mean late-successional and old-growth areas have
74

This approach is consistent with CFR § 220.4 (f) and the Council on Environmental Quality June 24, 2005
memorandum regarding analysis of past actions.

164

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

to be physically joined in space, as many late-successional associated species can move across areas not in
late-successional ecosystem conditions. In dry forest landscapes, retaining structural legacies (large trees that
tend to be fire tolerant, snags and down wood created through stand development or disturbance events) is
important to maintaining habitat and connectivity. These structural legacies serve valuable functions,
including reproductive structure, cooler microclimates, prey and forage base, or help maintain or improve
connectivity (Franklin, et al., 2007). Restoring ecosystem function that provides increased resiliency will
necessitate maintaining and restoring these biological legacies that typically persist through disturbance
events and can help influence stand recovery process in a post-disturbance landscape (Franklin, et al., 2000)
The NSO action area is approximately 15,960 acres in size; consisting of NFS lands (8,303 acres; 52%) and
private lands (7,657 acres; 48%). Elevation ranges from 3,000 to 5,200 feet. There is one NSO activity center
(AC) and associated core and home range in the action area, designated ST-215.
Based on survey and stand search data, the ST-215 AC has not been occupied by a pair or a single territorial
NSO since 1990, when the last nesting attempt failed. In 2003, a single subadult female NSO was detected
during a nighttime calling survey; and in 2011, a probable NSO feather was found in the core during a stand
search (Farber, 2013). In both cases, an aural or visual detection of NSO did not occur during follow-up
surveys. Annual stand searches (2-3) have been completed in the core since 2007, with 3-visit protocol
surveys of the action area completed from 2003-2005 and 2007-2011. Starting in 2012, and continuing
through 2014, six nighttime calling visits were completed; with a modified 3-visit spot check completed in
2015 (in accordance with the January 2012 NSO Survey Protocol and its guidance for annual survey
coordination with the FWS and landowners (USDI-FWS 20. 12). An adult male barred owl was detected in
the project area in 2004, and a pair was detected intermittently during the 2012-2014 nighttime calling
surveys. Barred owls were not detected during the daytime stand searches and neither the Forest Service or
private land surveys located the nesting area. In fall 2014, the barred owl pair was removed (Feamster, et al.,
2014)During the 2015 surveys and stand searches, there were no NSO or barred owl detections. The BA
describes the 1989-present survey history.
Approximately 458 acres (92%) of the ST-215 core is on NFS lands in the project area, with the remaining 42
acres on private lands to the north, owned by Olympic Resource Management (previously Hancock). 75
Conversely, approximately 1409 acres (41%) of the home range is on NFS lands, with the remaining 59% on
private lands to the north and west (owned by Sierra Pacific Industries).
Habitat types for NSO in the action area include suitable (nesting, roosting and foraging, including high
quality foraging), dispersal, capable and non-habitat. The BA fully describes habitat types, habitat quality,
quantity and connectivity of NSO habitat in the action area and project area. Habitat in the action area was
identified and quantified using a combination of sources (see Methodology above). Habitat suitability on NFS
lands and private lands in the action area are primarily non-functional, followed by a combination of
dispersal, foraging and pockets of nesting/roosting.
The project area encompasses the 3,074-acre Elk Flat LSR (RC-360) and approximately 445 acres of matrix
lands in Commercial Wood Products emphasis. The break in land allocation bisects the Elk Flat meadow and
the meadow and matrix lands are primarily non-functional habitat for NSO, though unit 177 provides some
foraging habitat. Approximately 36% of the project area provides suitable habitat (nesting, roosting,
foraging); 9% is dispersal; and another 9% is considered capable of transitioning to dispersal and suitable
with treatment. The remaining 46% of the project area is not capable of supporting NSO habitat as they
generally avoid forest stands with overstories dominated by ponderosa pine and relative probability of use
declines within increasing basal area of ponderosa pine (USDI-FWS, 2011; Irwin, et al., 2007; Irwin, et al.,
75

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

2012). The non-functional NSO habitat includes areas proposed for salvage adaptive management, hazard
reduction treatments and the extensive mortality area, though these areas do support prey.
Habitat quality and suitability in the project and treatment area was evaluated closely, particularly in the 60120 year-old natural stands proposed for mechanical thinning and other restoration treatments, or
underburning-only. Suitable habitat in the project area is variable and quality and function are wholly
dependent on the unique, local stand attributes. This includes but is not limited to basal area ranges, tree
species composition and canopy closure – where there is a mix of incense cedar, sugar and ponderosa pine,
Douglas fir, black oak, and white fir ranging from 180-260+ basal area, layering and canopy closure of 70+
percent, stands type out as high quality foraging or nesting/roosting. Where basal areas are lower, or natural
stands are primarily composed of ponderosa pine and white fir, with canopy closure of 40-70%, stands
typically type out as moderate or lower quality foraging or dispersal, though this is also dependent on canopy
closure and presence of other stand attributes that may support foraging NSOs. Where natural stands are
predominantly composed of ponderosa pine, they are considered non-functional NSO habitat (Thomas, 1990;
Thomas, et al., 1990; USDI-FWS, 2011; Irwin, et al., 2007; Irwin, et al., 2012; Zabel, et al., 1992; USDIFWS, 2009).
Other factors that determine habitat type and quality in the project area are average diameter class, species,
layering or density of mid and understory trees - is stand development stagnate, or is the understory too dense
for owls to fly through? How many trees (and species composition) per acre >26” dbh and 20-24” dbh with
cavities, broken tops, or large limbs? Are there large (>20”diameter) snags with cavities? Is there abundant
large down wood in combination with under, mid and overstory tree species and canopy cover that support
foraging and dispersing NSOs, including perching sites for hunting, thermoregulation sites for roosting and
overstory protection from avian predators? Are there openings, edges, hardwood and shrub species or earlier
seral stands that support dusky-footed woodrat or other NSO prey? Abiotic factors contributing to habitat
suitability in the project area include elevation, slope position and distance to water. There are 240 acres of
Riparian Reserves that overlay LSR and matrix, and the Riparian Reserves along Ash Creek in the LSR
primarily function as nesting/roosting, high quality foraging or foraging habitat. Also as elevation increases in
the project area, stand suitability increases. Another key factor influencing use of foraging habitat, and
subsequent evaluation of effects of treating such habitat, is its proximity and connectivity to nesting/roosting
habitat. It is well-documented that during the breeding season, foraging decreases with increasing distance
from the nest stand, and therefore stands greater than one mile from suitable nesting/roosting habitat have a
low probability of use by foraging NSOs (Bart, 1995; Bingham, et al., 1997; USDI-FWS, 2009; USDI-FWS,
2011).
Based on the preceding general conditions, ground-truthing and 2007 CSE data, the nesting/roosting habitat
currently exists in the northern portion of the project area, within one large block, and pockets along Ash
Creek to the southeast. In the western, northern and central portions of the project area, there are stands and
patches of low, moderate and high quality foraging habitat (foraging habitat trending toward nesting/roosting
conditions) interspersed with early and mid-seral plantations (10-40+ years old). The older, dense, monotypic
ponderosa pine plantations are considered capable of transitioning to dispersal or suitable foraging habitat
with treatment. These stands are primarily in the core and home range on NFS lands, with few stands of
foraging and dispersal in the eastern portion.
The NSO action area contains approximately 797 acres of designated critical habitat within Unit 8, Subunit 3
(East Cascades South [ECS-3]) (USDI-FWS, 2012). 720 acres are in the project area, all in the western
portion of the Elk Flat LSR. The remaining 77 acres are located approximately four miles east of the project
area critical habitat, along the base of Black Fox Mountain. Critical habitat is not designated on surrounding
private lands or within the project area’s ponderosa pine-dominated stands or meadow at Elk Flat. The draft
BA in the online project record contains numerous maps displaying habitat, critical habitat, project treatments
and other modeling results. Table 57 below displays the amount of habitat types and critical habitat
designation at the NSO action area, Elk Flat LSR, treatment area, project area, and core/home range scales.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

The NGO analysis area is the same spatial area as the NSO action area. There are two NGO territories in the
analysis area, ST-205 Elk Flat (in the LSR) and ST-259 Cramer (northeast of project area on Matrix lands).
Based on annual surveys and territory checks, ST-205 has been active since 1985, though not reproducing
every year (USDA-FS 1989-2015 NGO survey records). This territory is located in the south-central portion
of the project area and is excluded from mechanical treatment.
Northern goshawks nest in dense, mid-mature and-late successional conifer forests and typically forage in
these and mid-successional stands. For purposes of this analysis, suitable NGO habitat is considered the same
as NSO NRF habitat, and also includes more variable NSO dispersal habitat in the project area, depending on
stand conditions, presence of small natural and man-made openings and forest edges. Approximately 39% of
the project area is suitable habitat for the NGO and 9% is capable of providing suitable habitat over time. The
remaining 52% is non-suitable for NGO due to small tree size or lack of cover, but the extensive mortality
area and other areas of large-scale pine mortality do provide a prey base for NGO and other species.
The fisher analysis area is 10,112 acres, comprised of NFS and private industrial timberlands. There are
approximately 649 acres of resting/denning habitat and 4,725 acres of foraging habitat with the remaining
considered non-functional due to clearcuts or other meadow openings that lack cover. For the purposes of this
analysis, NSO nesting/roosting and high quality foraging is considered a proxy for fisher denning and resting
habitat due to presence of large trees, denser canopy closure and structural complexity (USDI-FWS,
2014).While canopy closure may be less dense than that found in NSO N/R habitat, NSO foraging habitat is
also a proxy for suitable fisher foraging habitat given the presence of large trees, variability in the under and
midstory and proximity to higher quality stands. As described above, the majority of matrix lands in the
project area are not considered suitable habitat for NSO, but some portions of the forested stands along the
eastern boundary of the project may provide foraging or resting habitat for NSO, NGO or fisher. See Table 58
for the acres of habitat in the analysis area and project area for both NGO and fisher.
Female home ranges for fisher in the analysis area are unknown, though based on field observations and
camera survey detections, there is at least one, if not two, in the project area (USDA-FS 2014-2015). Within
the detection and denning habitat areas, no mechanical treatments are proposed and direct ignition during
prescribed fire would not be used in these areas. These areas are concentrate in the NSO nesting/roosting
habitat and areas along Ash Creek where there are large trees and snags that provide den sites, abundant down
wood and 60% or more canopy closure.
In the NSO action area and NGO/fisher analysis areas, private lands are intermixed with NFS lands. The
harvest practices on industrial timberlands directly west and north of the project area have significantly
reduced the amount and recruitment of important key habitat features used by late-successional associated
species, including large diameter snags and down wood. Even-aged management, sanitation, and selection
harvest has been moderately extensive on the private lands, resulting in a landscape dominated by early-or
mid seral stands with significantly fewer structural features associated with northern spotted owl, goshawk
and fisher use. Connectivity to the north is provided in small patches of foraging, or nesting/roosting habitat,
to federal lands within the Mt. Shasta LSR area (refer to the BA in the online project record for maps).

and the Resource Protection Measures (measures taken during implementation that also minimize the

potential for direct or indirect effects) are described in Chapter 2. Resource protection measures specific to the
NSO, northern goshawk and fisher include limited operating periods for habitat altering and noise and smokegenerating activities and limiting the use of direct ignition in high quality habitat areas. The project design
and RPMs were developed through the interdisciplinary process and discussed during the Streamlined
Consultation Process with the FWS (Appendix E).

Direct Effects to Individuals
Direct effects to individuals are not expected, as there are no mechanical treatments proposed in the ST-215
core, the ST-205 northern goshawk territory, suspected or known fisher denning areas, NSO nesting/roosting
habitat or high quality habitats that may be used as reproductive sites. RPMs in Chapter 2 (31, 32, 33, 34, and
39) describe the limited operating periods (LOPs) and other measures that will be implemented to minimize
or eliminate direct effects to breeding individuals during critical periods. These RPMs explain the start times
for LOPs and the criteria that must be met to lift them. Surveys, activity center searches and spot checks per
the 2012 NSO survey protocol will be continued prior to, and throughout project implementation. Carnivore
monitoring and NGO surveys will also be implemented (see the Monitoring Common to All Action
Alternatives section for wildlife and silviculture at the end of the RPMs in Chapter 2).
Adult and sub-adult NSOs and goshawks, and adult fishers are mobile and able to move away from
disturbances (noise from heavy equipment use; falling of trees; smoke from pile burning or underburning;
noise from road actions and hauling of logs and/or chips). These stressors have a higher likelihood of
affecting adults, juveniles and kits during the breeding season however, when adults are closely associated
with a core, territory or multiple natal and maternal den sites. Juvenile NSOs and NGOs are not yet able to fly,
and fisher kits are not mobile enough to travel with their mothers until about 4 months of age (Aubry and
Raley 2006). Adults expend high amounts of energy defending their territories during the critical breeding
periods (typically extending from February 1 through 1) the end of July for fisher; 2) mid-August for NGO;
and 3) mid-September for nesting NSOs. The LOPs and other measures developed in coordination with the
FWS, and the IDT, are expected to minimize, if not eliminate, the likelihood that project activities will have
direct effects on single and/or breeding NSOs, goshawks, fisher or their young. The project also includes
provisions for limiting activities in the event of any new discoveries. Smoke from pile burning and
underburning may cause foraging or dispersing individuals to move away from smoky areas in the short-term,
though this potential effect would be of short duration, several days or less in any single location.
All action alternatives include applying a registered borate compound to stumps ≥14 inches diameter within 4
hours of cutting to reduce or inhibit the spread of Heterobasidion root disease (annosus). The solid Sporax®
or liquid Cellu-Treat or possibly other brands or formulations may be used. Based on the analysis of where the
compound may need to be applied (stands with expected stumps >14”), approximately 1,040 acres may
receive treatment under Alternative 1. If Sporax® is used, it would be applied at a rate of approximately one
pound/acre under. Application of any compound will follow all state and federal rules as they apply to
pesticides and will not be applied during precipitation events. The potential toxicity of Sporax® and boron to
mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates and fungi is discussed in several
publications (EPA, 1993) (USDA-FS, 2006). Based on this research, Sporax® application to cut stumps is not
expected to have adverse effects on wildlife or surrounding plants, invertebrates or microorganisms (USDAFS 2006). At high concentrations, it is toxic to plants and measurements of soil, plants and litter at distances
up to five meters from stumps at various times post-application do not indicate treatment-related increases in
boron content. While the potential exists for an NSO, goshawk or fisher to consume contaminated prey or
water, risks to avian and terrestrial species are low with most acute and chronic risk quotients well below
levels of concern (USDA-FS, 2006). Considering that: 1) it is unlikely for an NSO, goshawk, fisher (or other
wild animal/livestock) to ingest Sporax® from treated stumps; 2) none of the hazard quotients exceed levels
of concern for contaminated water (even at application rates 10 times those proposed); and 3) the 2006 risk
assessment indicates boric acid is practically non-toxic to avian and mammalian species, direct effects to
wildlife are not expected.

While the current, primary source of NSO habitat loss is high-severity uncharacteristic wildfire (USDI-FWS
2011, Davis et al. 2015), competition from barred owls is a significant, if not the primary current cause, of
NSO population decline (Dugger et al. 2015). Due to similar dietary and habitat preferences, the barred owl is
competitor and known predator (USDI-FWS 2011). 76 While details on habitat interactions are not well
understood, barred owls have a broader diet, may reduce NSO detectability and may occupy former NSO
activity centers (Irwin et al. 2010, USDI-FWS 2011; Wiens 2012). Their range completely overlaps with the
NSOs range (Gutiérrez et al. 1995) and they can negatively affect NSO site occupancy, reproduction and
survival (Livesey et al. 2007). Similar effects may occur on any NSO from barred owls utilizing the action
area, regardless of project implementation.
NSO populations continue to decline in all parts of their range, even with maintenance and restoration of
suitable habitat (USDI-FWS 2011, Dugger et al. 2015). 77 The recent December 2015 meta-analysis, based on
the 11 demographic study areas established (or used) for NSO monitoring under the NWFP, indicates a range
wide average 3.8% annual decline rate of the population. The analysis concludes that the results from 1985
through 2013 indicate competition with barred owls may be the primary cause of NSO population decline
across their range. It also concludes that nesting and roosting habitat loss, and climatic patterns, were related
to survival, occupancy, recruitment, and fecundity. The author’s findings provide support for previous
recommendations to preserve as much high-quality habitat in late-successional forest as possible across the
range of the subspecies (Forsman et al. 2011, Dugger et al. 2011). The analysis also cautions that “barred owl
densities may now be high enough across the NSOs range that, despite continued management and
conservation of suitable NSO habitat on federal lands (Davis et al. 2011, 2015), the long-term prognosis for
NSO persistence may be in question without additional management intervention.” Finally, it notes that
barred owl removal may be able to slow or reverse population declines on at least a localized scale, as was
observed in the GDR study area (Dugger et al. 2015). The recovery objectives listed in the Recovery Plan for
dry forests include maintaining sufficient NSO habitat in the short-term to allow NSOs to persist in the face of
threats from barred owl expansion and habitat loss from wildfires. Appendix B of the Recovery Plan contains
numerous references regarding known barred owl competitive interactions with NSOs, and is hereby
incorporated by reference.
At this time, direct effects to NSO from competitive interactions with barred owls are not expected to occur as
a result of the project. Contributing to this determination is the fact that the ST-215 activity center has been
unoccupied by NSO since 1990, however with the removal of the barred owl pair in fall 2014, a potential
exists for the AC to be used by dispersing or territorial NSOs in the future. Barred owls have been observed
on the SMMU since 1997 and in the project area, an adult male was detected once in 2004. A barred owl pair
then occupied portions of the project area from 2010-2014, and was removed in fall 2014. This does not mean
barred owls are not within, or could not re-occupy, the action area or project area. Survey results from the
action area on NFS lands and private lands have not detected any other barred owl(s) to date (USDA-FS
1989-2015 NSO survey records).
It is recognized that when barred owls and NSOs do co-occur, a reduction in habitat availability and quality
may exacerbate interactions between the two species. Dugger and others (2011) suggest that in environments
where the two species compete directly for resources, maintaining larger amounts of older forest

76

Confirmed predation of spotted owls by barred owls is known from one direct observation and predation is not
considered a significant issue. Note that competition is considered a significant threat per the Revised Recovery Plan for
the Northern Spotted Owl.

One exception was the treatment area within the GDR, where NSO populations started increasing after barred owl
removals were initiated in 2009.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

(nesting/roosting habitat) may help NSOs to persist in the short term. This recommendation was supported
again in the 2015 meta-analysis described above.
The project is designed in accordance with recommendations from the Recovery Plan for Recovery Action 10
and 32, through consultation with the FWS (USDI-FWS 2011, Dugger et al. 2011). There are no mechanical
treatments proposed in nesting/roosting habitat, or high quality foraging habitats in the project area and
reintroducing low-intensity prescribed fire in these areas is not expected to degrade, downgrade or remove
habitat function, but benefit it over time and would not exacerbate any competitive interactions between NSO
and barred owl. As described above and in the Chapter 2 RPMs, NSO surveys, spot checks and stand searches
will be conducted in accordance with the 2012 protocol, or modification of the protocol, as agreed to by the
US-FWS/STNF Level 1 team. These survey efforts will continue prior to and during implementation in and
adjacent to the ST-215 core and home range, and habitats likely to contain NSO. The pre, during and postimplementation surveys will be used to evaluate for any NSO individual or pair occupancy or barred owl
presence. While the Recovery Plan concedes there are still substantial information gaps regarding ecological
interactions between NSOs and barred owls (p. III-62), the effects of forest management their interactions is
not fully understood at this time (Courtney et al. 2004). Ongoing and future monitoring may provide further
understanding and no further conclusions are made in regards to barred owl effects on NSOs for the project.

Effects relative to Purpose and Need for Action
Effects of the proposed treatments are detailed in the BA and wildlife BE in the online project record. Effects
as they relate to the purpose and need for action are summarized below.
As described in the Silviculture and Forest Health section of Chapter 3, and indicator comparison tables in
Chapter 2 (Table 29), Alternative 1 best meets the purpose and need for action for reducing the continued risk
of losing early, mid and late-successional habitat, increasing stand resilience, and accelerating development of
late-successional habitat in the Elk Flat LSR. For the wildlife indicators, meeting the need is measured by the
amount of capable, foraging, nesting/roosting, resting/denning habitat benefitted, maintained in its current
condition, degraded, downgraded or removed. Predicted effects to habitat are based on a comparison of pretreatment stand and habitat conditions, the modeled immediate and 20-year post treatment stand conditions,
and the project design and marking guides that maintain important habitat elements. Conclusions regarding
post-treatment habitat function are supported by published descriptions of forest structure associated with
NSO, northern goshawk and fisher habitat in dry forest types and local monitoring data.
Terms used to categorize the degree of predicted change in habitat function and quantify of affected habitat
include:
•

Maintain/Beneficial: Indicates changes in habitat may be neutral or beneficial to habitat function even
though habitat elements may be modified.

•

Degrade: Signifies when treatments have a negative influence on habitat quality due to removal or
reduction of habitat elements but not to the degree where the existing or pre-treatment habitat
function is changed.

•

Downgrade: Signifies when treatments reduce habitat elements to the degree that habitat will not
function in the capacity that existed pre-treatment, but activities will not remove habitat entirely (i.e.,
downgrade from nesting/roosting to foraging, or foraging to dispersal).

•

Remove: Pertains to treatments that reduce habitat elements to the degree that habitat will no longer
function as suitable for a species.

Given the range of habitat variability in and between the natural stands described in Chapter 1 and the wildlife
Affected Environment section, the pre-and post-treatment FVS-FFE stand modeling and measurements in
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

suitable habitat may indicate higher or lower values of basal area or canopy closure, but these projections are
based on averages. While helpful at providing data on general stand conditions, the model represents averages
and trends and does not account for the high degree of expected post-treatment variability in suitable habitat,
including tightly grouped clumps of large and small trees, the unthinned patches and high quality habitats
excluded from thinning and existing large snags. Treatments will be variable at the fine stand scale and
landscape scale. They will not remove important structural components such as predominant legacy trees,
dominant trees with old-growth characteristics such as large boles, decadent branching, cavities and flattened
tops, large snags or large down wood, unless necessary for operational safety.
Table 29 in Chapter 2 summarizes the predicted effects by action alternative to each species’ habitat type.
Rationale for the treatment effects to suitable habitat is summarized below. Connected actions of hazard
reduction will not occur in suitable habitats for these three species, so are not discussed here. They are
discussed in the respective resource reports for wildlife in the online project record.
Effects to High Quality Habitat
NSO nesting/roosting, high quality foraging and fisher resting/denning habitats will be benefitted through the
reintroduction of low-intensity prescribed fire. Surface and small ladder fuels would be reduced in these
stands, but overall density or habitat quality and function would not be appreciably reduced. Low-intensity
prescribed fire is predicted to reintroduce a lacking disturbance element and would be carefully applied and
monitored. Table 27 in Chapter 2 fully describes the limits of acceptable mortality for tree size classes 4”
diameter and larger, shrubs and understory. RPMs 24, 25, 38, 42 describe limiting the amount of burning in the
ST-215 core/home range and the measures taken to reduce injury or mortality to predominant trees and other
habitat elements (snags, large down wood). Low- intensity prescribed fire in nesting/roosting, resting/denning
and high quality foraging habitats is expected to result in beneficial effects of increased understory vegetation
diversity and structure and increases in prey base while reducing surface fuel loading (Anthony, 1997). The
burning effects would be monitored closely to see if changes in burning prescriptions or seasonal timing are
needed.
Effects to Foraging Habitat
Foraging habitat would be degraded or downgraded, though will not significantly impact how NSOs,
goshawk or fisher utilize the landscape for foraging. Foraging habitat for NSO and northern goshawk will
either be degraded by variable density thinning, or downgraded through variable density thinning combined
with radial release of black oak and predominant legacy pine. Foraging habitat for fisher would only be
degraded, as the treatments that downgrade NSO and goshawk habitat result in a reduction in some habitat
elements for fisher but do not change the stand quality such that fisher could not forage in them posttreatment. This is due to the fisher’s wider range of foraging habitat characteristics (USDI-FWS 2014).
The Recovery Plan for NSO discusses silvicultural practices that promote forest resilience that can be applied
to various forest types. Short-term decisions to increase a forest ecosystem’s ability to adapt to climate-driven
drought stresses may include vegetation management around older individual trees to reduce competition for
moisture. Longer-term strategies may include promoting heterogeneity among and within forest stands. In
many areas, fire could be encouraged to perform its ecological role of introducing and maintaining landscape
diversity, though it may be desirable to manage fire severity or return intervals through vegetation
management at various temporal and landscape scales (pp. III-21). As variable-density thinning is a
silvicultural technique intended to promote biological diversity and structural heterogeneity characteristic of
old-growth forests, it induces fine-scale variation in homogeneous second-growth forest canopies (Carey, et
al., 1995; Muir, et al., 2002). It consists of thinning a forest stand at different intensities in patches at a scale
of approximately 0.1 to 0.5 ha to mimic the scale of patchiness found in old growth and late-successional
forests and create a mosaic of overstory and midstory tree densities (Carey, et al., 1999).
In the dry forest landscapes that support NSO habitat, increasing resiliency of a stand or landscape also
includes reducing conditions that contribute to stand vulnerability. This includes reducing stand density and

surface and ladder fuels, especially in areas likely to experience fire. Many recent studies in mixed conifer
forests have found the effectiveness of thinning or fuels treatments designed to modify or change fire
behavior or suppression efforts is highest when tree thinning is combined with prescribed fire (Agee and
Skinner 2005, Lehmkuhl et al. 2007, 2015, Prichard et al. 2010). Some of these authors acknowledge the
potential for direct and indirect effects on resources while recognizing difficulty in balancing what may be
opposing management objectives. Others debate methodologies that evaluate the actual risk to forests in the
dry forest regions from high intensity, uncharacteristic wildfires (Spies et al. 2009, Odion et al. 2014).
Efforts that enhance forest resilience to wildfire at the stand level often focus on a set of management
objectives for fuels, including reducing woody surface fuels, ladder fuels, and crown densities, and retaining
large trees of fire resistant species. Reducing woody surface fuels helps reduce the potential for surface fire
intensity (heat release), flame lengths and fire severity (Lehmkuhl et al. 2015). Reducing ladder fuels can also
disrupt vertical continuity of fuels and reduce the probability of surface fire transitioning to crown fire.
Retaining large trees of fire-resistant species in seeks to maintain stand structural and compositional stability
by keeping existing trees that are most likely to persist through future fires and retaining seed sources that
facilitate regeneration of fire-resistant species.
The variable density thinning, combined with follow-up prescribed fire and other surface fuel treatments meet
the recommendations in the Recovery Plan for restoring dry forest ecosystems. These treatments would
degrade foraging habitat function on 697 acres for NSO, 893 acres for northern goshawk and 990 acres for
fisher. These treatments represent approximately 62 percent of the available foraging habitat for these species
in the project area.
Where foraging habitat is degraded, it will continue to provide foraging opportunities post-treatment. This
determination is based on the post-treatment condition of basal areas ranging from 125-200+ sqft/acre (when
combined with the roost and rest clump retention and unthinned patches), 40-60 percent or more canopy
cover, a patchy mosaic of burned and unburned areas, including unburned piles where fuels are piled, and mid
and understory layering. The group selection and small gap creation in white fir (2 to <0.25-acre openings in
homogenous white fir) would result in increased vertical and horizontal heterogeneity from a younger age
class and species diversity. These conditions are well within the range of foraging habitat conditions
frequently used by NSO (Irwin et al. 2007, 2012). Additionally, the retained species diversity, residual large
trees, snags and down wood would contribute to habitat functioning as foraging post-treatment.
The unthinned patches and larger stand areas set aside for no treatment would continue to provide functional
and structural elements including thermal and visual cover, dense small trees, pockets of suppression and
mortality, and undisturbed debris. Higher stand densities would be retained where patches or groups of
notably large trees occur in order to retain existing desirable late successional characteristics, and provide
roosting or resting sites. While the unthinned patches and high basal area retention areas would remain at risk
from density-related and insect and disease mortality, these areas would be smaller and less contiguous than
the current conditions.
The temporary change in the quality but not function of foraging habitat would last for approximately 5 to 20
years, depending on treatment location and type. Degraded foraging habitat would continue to function at pretreatment habitat levels as primary habitat elements of at least 40 percent canopy cover, abundant down logs
and large snags, multi-layering, vertical and horizontal structure are maintained in the post-treatment
condition. Other important habitat elements such as roosting structure, thermal refugia, shrubs and openings
for dusky-footed wood rat and other prey base would also be retained in the post-treatment condition. The
variable density thinning treatments are designed to maintain important habitat elements and benefit foraging
structure, composition, and variability over the short- and long-term. Degraded habitat generally returns to
pre-treatment quality levels over a 20-year timeframe as the remaining trees grow larger and canopy levels
reach and exceed 60+ percent, and the mid- and understory continues to develop. These time estimates bar

any events such as another epidemic insect or disease outbreak, or uncharacteristic stand replacing fire that
can reset the seral stage in a stand, or part of a stand.
27 acres of black oak release and 71 acres of radial thinning to protect and enhance predominant legacy pine
in NSO and goshawk foraging habitat will downgrade habitat to dispersal function as canopy closure and
cover would be below the 40 percent and the average basal area would range from 60-120 sqft/acre, on
average. The effects of this treatment are expected to last for 10 to 30 years as follow-up underburning will
incrementally reduce remaining under- and mid-story trees, and some down wood and snags, over the 30-year
time period for the three prescribed fire entries. While there will be patches of dense roosting/resting sites,
oaks that are not released, large and small trees, and snags and down wood in the post-treatment condition,
these conditions do not provide enough residual habitat to consider the 27-acre area as ‘foraging’ habitat for
NSO or NGO post-treatment.
The radial thinning around legacy predominant pine would downgrade foraging habitat function on 71 acres
to dispersal (based on the prescription of releasing up to two legacy trees per acre, as available). As this
treatment generally removes all smaller diameter trees within a 50-foot radius of the bole, except for other
predominant legacy trees of any species or large diameter snags, numerous 0.25-0.30 acre size gaps will be
spread across the treatment area where little to no understory or midstory vegetation remains. The effects of
this treatment are expected to last for 20 to 30 years and while the radial release treatment will also provide
residual foraging opportunities, the habitat condition in these patches will be considered dispersal in
combination with the other thinning and underburning treatments.
These combined treatments represent 7 to 9 percent of the foraging habitat available in the project area for
NSO and NGO respectively, and are not expected to result in a significant negative effect to individuals or
overall habitat function. This determination is based on the: 1) small scale of habitat affected, 2) position of
the treatment within the outer portion of the ST-215 home range and being outside the ST-205 territory, and 3)
the long-term benefit of increased stand and prey species diversity. However, it is considered a short- and
long-term adverse effect to critical habitat elements of foraging (PCE3-discussed further below).
There will be no removal of suitable habitat function for NSO, northern goshawk or fisher.
Effects to Capable Habitat
The current dense and uniform stand conditions in older ponderosa pine plantations limit use by most wildlife
species and the stand variability created by thinning would facilitate access for foraging (fisher, goshawk).
Group selections would introduce a more diverse species and age class, particularly along plantation edges
adjacent to higher quality habitat. Long-term benefits would be realized through the increased species and
structural complexity, improved resilience to mixed severity fire, and eventual long-term development of
multi-aged, multi-species stands. The other treatments that improve capable habitat, such as young plantation
thinning and low-intensity fire, combined with older plantation treatments would occur on 329 acres for NSO,
and 608 acres for northern goshawk and fisher.
Prescribed Underburning
Three prescribed fire entries are proposed over an approximate 30-year timeframe following completion of
mechanical thinning activities. This treatment is intended to reintroduce a more frequent, natural fire regime
and to consume natural and activity-generated fuels or reduce small-diameter surface and ladder fuels.
Underburns are intended to mimic low-intensity wildfires, and burn prescriptions will be written and applied
to minimize consumption of soil cover including duff, litter and coarse woody debris in accordance with
RPMs and Tables 21 and 22. Prescribed fire typically burns in a patchy mosaic, coincident with the
distribution of the fuelbed, leaving burned and unburned areas. Small diameter-understory trees are typically
killed and occasional flare-ups can occur and kill overstory trees.

Conclusions as they relate to the Purpose and Need
Based on the predicted effects of thinning and the stand modeling for tree size classes immediately postthinning and 20 years-post (see the Silviculture and Forest Health section), the treatments under Alternative 1
facilitate the most acreage toward increased resilience and larger tree size classes, with a corresponding
reduced risk of habitat loss and increased connectivity for late-successional associated species. In summary,
1,743 acres of habitat for NSO would be improved over the 20-year modeling period, representing 57 percent
of the LSR; 1921 acres of northern goshawk habitat would be improved, representing 62 percent of the LSR;
and 2018 acres would be improved for fisher, representing 66% of the LSR. Fire behavior modeling indicates
that indirect effects of combined thinning and subsequent fuels treatment would reduce the potential for
passive crown fire and promote surface fire (see the Fires and Fuels section).
In relation to the northern spotted owl, the project is consistent with six of the eight Recovery Plan’s dry
forest restoration principles:
•

Conserving older stands that contain conditions to support NSO occupancy or high-value NSO
habitat as described in Recovery Actions 10 and 32 (USFWS 2011 pp. III–43, III–67). On Federal
lands this recommendation applies to all land-use allocations;

•

Emphasizing vegetation management treatments outside NSO territories or highly suitable habitat;

•

Designing and implementing restoration treatments at the landscape level;

•

Retaining and restoring key structural components, including large and old trees, large snags, and
downed logs;

•

Retaining and restoring heterogeneity within and among stands (USFWS 2011 pp. III-34 to III-35).

Treatments that meet the above principles are expected to result in a variety of effects on NSO habitat in the
short and long term. The proposed use of low-intensity fire in high quality habitat is expected to have an
immediate beneficial effect. No mechanical treatments would occur in high value or highly suitable habitat.
The proposed actions will not reduce nesting, roosting or foraging habitat in a home range with a reproductive
pair. Treatment types and locations have been prioritized within the unoccupied ST-215 core and home range,
based on existing habitat levels, occupancy (or lack thereof), the current habitat levels that are <40% in the
home range (currently at 37%) recommended values and the ability to effect meaningful structural change in a
<30 year timeframe.
The current ST-215 core and home range likely functions, or would function better over the short-and longterm, for a dispersing subadult or juvenile NSO. However, over the long-term, the current ‘configuration’ of
habitat types and overall suitability in the home range and core is not expected to support a reproductive pair,
primarily due to 60% of the home range being within private industrial timberland production and 32% of the
core in plantations. As NSO home ranges are typically analyzed at the circular scale, this analysis may be
misleading in some cases. Over time, the project area could function to support a reproductive NSO pair as
more dispersal and capable habitat transitions to suitable habitat. It is still likely that over the short and long
term (20-30 years) that this area will primarily function as a temporary location for dispersing individuals
moving from their natal sits to occupy other territories.
Project-wide, the variable density thinning treatments will maintain a range of basal areas ranging from 125200+ sqft/acre (when combined with the roost and rest clump retention and unthinned patches), 40-60 percent
or more canopy cover, a patchy mosaic of burned and unburned areas, including unburned piles where fuels
are piled, and mid and understory layering. The group selection and small gap creation in white fir (2-acre to
<0.25-acre openings in homogenous white fir) would result in increased vertical and horizontal heterogeneity
from a younger age class and species diversity. These conditions are well within the range of foraging habitat
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

175

conditions frequently used by NSO (Irwin et al. 2007, 2012). Additionally, the retained species diversity,
residual large trees, snags and down wood would contribute to habitat functioning as foraging post-treatment
– providing prey base habitat and thermoregulation sites.
The treatments are considered consistent with the ecological forestry principles discussed in the Recovery
Plan and 2012 Final Critical Habitat Rule where long-term NSO recovery will benefit, even if short-term
impacts may occur (Franklin et al. 2006). The treatments are proposed to improve the resiliency of the
landscape in light of the threats to NSO habitat from the existing risk conditions in the project area that have
been exacerbated by prolonged drought. The treatments are intended to promote spatial heterogeneity within
patches, restore underrepresented species (oak, aspen, Douglas fir) and structural diversity. While some of
these management actions may degrade habitat in in the short-term, they are considered beneficial in the longterm as they would reduce future losses of ecosystem structure or result in a higher resilience to future
disturbance events (USDI-FWS 2011 p. III-14).

Effects relative to key issues
The effects of the variable density thinning and other restoration treatments designed to reduce the risk of
losing, and accelerate development of, late successional habitat summarized above relative to the purpose and
need are addressed here, in terms of their expected influence on designated critical habitat for the NSO. There
are 720 acres of critical habitat in the Elk Flat LSR and project area within Unit 8, Subunit 3 (East Cascades
South [ECS-3]). All critical habitat in the project area is within the ST-215 home range.
Special management considerations or protection are required in this subunit to address threats to the essential
physical or biological features from current and past timber harvest, losses due to wildfire and the effects on
vegetation from fire exclusion, and competition with barred owls. The function of this subunit is to provide
demographic support in this area of sparsely distributed high-quality habitat and Federal land, and to provide
for population connectivity between subunits to the north and south. The FWS determined that all of the
unoccupied (and likely occupied) areas in this subunit are essential for the conservation of the species to meet
the recovery criterion in the Recovery Plan that calls for continued maintenance and recruitment of NSO
habitat (USDI-FWS, 2011 p. ix). The increase and enhancement of NSO habitat in this subunit is especially
important for providing essential connectivity between currently occupied areas to support successful
dispersal of NSOs, and may also help to buffer northern spotted owls from competition with the barred owl
(USDI-FWS, 2012 p. 71931).
The Final Rule describes that in the drier, more fire-prone regions of the NSOs range, habitat conditions will
likely be more dynamic and active management may be required to reduce the risk to the essential physical or
biological features from fire, insects, disease, and climate change, as well as to promote regeneration
following disturbance. While the FWS recommends conservation of high quality and occupied NSO habitat, it
asserts that long-term recovery could benefit from forest management where the basic goals are to restore or
maintain ecological processes and resilience (p. 71908). Management actions should be considered to balance
short-term adverse effects with long-term beneficial effects.
Suggestions regarding active forest management within critical habitat include:
1. Focusing active management in younger forest and lower quality owl habitat, or where ecological
conditions are most departed from the natural or desired range of variability;
2. In dry forests, following the NWFP guidelines and focusing on lands in or outside reserves most ‘‘atrisk’’ of experiencing uncharacteristic disturbance, and where the landscape management goal is to
restore more natural or resilient forest ecosystems;
3. Avoiding or minimize activities in active NSO territories (or high-quality habitat in these territories);

176

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

4. Ensuring transparency of process, so the public can see what is being done, where it is done, what the
goal of the action is, and how well the action leads to the desired goal; and
5. Practicing active adaptive forest management by incorporating new information and learning into
future actions to make them more effective, focusing on how these actions affect NSOs and their prey
(pp. 71882-71883).
To ensure the treatments proposed in critical habitat are consistent with recommendations for management
described in the Final Rule, several field reviews were conducted with the FWS and Forest Service personnel
to the majority of natural stands designated as critical habitat, and some of the older plantation units in critical
habitat (see Appendix E that describes the consultation to date). The specific treatments in unit 153 (oak
release, radial thinning of pine, small gap creation), and other units proposed for thinning and prescribed fire
were reviewed by both agencies and deemed consistent with management objectives within the East Cascades
Province (p. 71907).
Effects to Critical Habitat
For the NSO, the Primary Constituent Elements (PCEs) of Critical Habitat are the specific characteristics that
make areas suitable for nesting, roosting, foraging and dispersal habitat. PCEs are defined as:
1. Forest types that may be in early-, mid- or late-seral stages and that support the northern spotted owl
across its geographical range (PCE 1);*
2. Nesting/roosting habitat (PCE 2);
3. Foraging habitat (PCE 3); and
4. Dispersal habitat (PCE 4).
*PCE 1 must occur with PCE 2, 3 or 4.
Under Alternative 1, approximately 624 acres of designated critical habitat would be treated (87% of the total
in the project area). There would be short- and long-term adverse effects to elements of PCE3 from variable
density thinning, radial thinning around predominant legacy pine and black oak release. While these adverse
effects would occur, this alternative meets the Final Rule’s recommendations for active forest management on
the most acres in the project. The ST-215 core/home range is not considered active, and as described in the
Conclusions section above, treatment locations in the core and home range were prioritized in accordance
with recommendations for Recovery Action 10. In addition, the project does not mechanically treat any high
quality NSO habitat, in accordance with recommendations for Recovery Action 32 of the Recovery Plan.
At the project (and ST-215 home range) scale, 164 acres of capable habitat (PCE1) would be moved toward
stand conditions that support dispersal (PCE4) over the short-term (~10 years) and foraging (PCE3) over the
longer term (20-30 years). The thinning and group selection treatments in 40+ year old plantations would
affect 23% of the designated critical habitat in the home range and 100% percent of the core.
All of PCE2 (nesting/roosting habitat;120 acres) would be benefitted and maintained through low-intensity
prescribed fire, which would reduce surface and ladder fuel loading and contribute toward understory
diversity, as summarized above. Prescribed fire in critical habitat may affect individual trees and could modify
canopy cover through creation of gaps. However, due to the low-intensity burn objectives developed
specifically with the FWS and the IDT fuels specialists (see Table 21 and Appendix E), this treatment is not
expected to appreciably reduce the function of nesting/roosting, or high quality foraging, habitat at the stand
or sub-unit level. This treatment represents 17% of the critical habitat in the project area (ST-215 home

177

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

range). About of 55 acres of PCE3 would also be benefitted and maintained through low-intensity prescribed
fire (the higher quality foraging habitat). This treatment represents 23% of the PCE3 in the core and 17% of
the PCE3 in the home range.
In PCE3 (foraging), 46 acres would be downgraded to PCE4 (dispersal) for an estimated 10-30 years. This
treatment would not occur in the core, but in the outer portion of the home range, distant from
nesting/roosting and higher quality habitat areas (southwestern portion of unit 153). This short-and long-term
reduction in PCE3 habitat quality and stand elements would occur on 14% of the PCE3 in the home range,
and 6% of the overall critical habitat in the project area. Short- and long-term adverse effects to PCE3
elements are expected from the oak release (27 acres) and radial thinning around predominant legacy pine (19
acres) in this unit. There would be a short-term adverse effect to elements comprising PCE3 regardless of
resource protection measures as the combined treatments of variable density thinning with radial thinning and
oak release would remove large and small trees that comprise PCE3 over a 10 to 30 year timeframe. With the
follow up prescribed fire in these areas, regeneration and snags/down logs may also be consumed.
Also in PCE3, about 224 acres in the home range would be degraded (114 acres in the core) through variable
density thinning treatments and follow-up underburning. Refer to the discussion above in the Purpose and
Need effects section that describes degraded foraging habitat. While individual habitat elements will be
reduced or variously affected, the reduction is not at a scale that would significantly reduce their value in
critical habitat or the overall ability of the foraging habitat PCE to function and foraging habitat functionality
post-treatment will be retained. However, there will still be some short-term and minor adverse effects to
elements of critical habitat PCE3 because treatments would result in reductions in canopy closure, basal area
and habitat layering (vertical and horizontal structure); impacts to snags and coarse wood, shrubs and forest
floor vegetation from fuels treatments in 68% percent of PCE3 in the project area.
Effects to PCE4 (dispersal) include improvement of one acre in older plantation thinning treatment, and
modification on 14 acres of natural stand within the home range, outside the core. The modification would
primarily occur from thinning a ponderosa pine-white fir dominated stand where the thinning treatment would
reduce the average basal area to 100-125 sqft/ac to attempt maintaining and promoting the residual pine in
this stand. Given the variable stand conditions in the stand (unit 169) and reductions in current canopy cover,
which have been and continue to be decreased by mortality in the pine, it is not certain if the stand would
continue to wholly function as dispersal habitat post-treatment. Given current stand conditions, the average
canopy cover post-treatment is expected to range from 30-50%. This treatment would affect 93% of the PCE4
in the home range and 2% of the overall critical habitat in the project area.
Based on the growth modeling, the amount of PCE2/PCE3 (suitable) projected in the project area critical
habitat, over a 20-year period, is 456 acres. This is an increase over the current levels of suitable by only 6
acres and represents 63% of the total critical habitat being in “suitable” condition. This is due in part to
habitat elements being maintained and benefitted through low-intensity prescribed fire; variable thinning
treatments that maintain habitat function and increase individual tree vigor, growth and stand resilience over
time; and an estimated recovery of the 27 acres of downgraded habitat in oak release toward improved
suitable foraging/PCE3 conditions. While there would not be a significant change in the amount of suitable
habitat over the 20-year timeframe, trees would be larger and more resilient and there would be an increase in
vertical and horizontal heterogeneity in the stands (refer to the Silviculture and Forest Health section for a
discussion of accelerated diameter growth 20 years after treatment).
There would be an increase of approximately 173 acres of PCE4 (dispersal) in the project area over this same
time span from the older plantation thinning treatments, residual dispersal habitat in areas where pine was
radially thinned, and from capable stands that were burned transitioning toward stands that support dispersing
NSOs. This is an increase over the current levels of dispersal habitat in the home range by 158 acres, and
represents 24% of the total critical habitat being in conditions that support NSO dispersal. These treatments in
PCE4 are also not expected to significantly or appreciably reduce the function of dispersal habitat or habitat
178

connectivity at the NSO action area, project area or ST-215 home range/core scales, or significantly affect the
ability of NSO to disperse across the landscape. Conversely, they are an improvement over the long term from
the existing condition.
As described in the 2012 Final Critical Habitat Rule, some management activities may have short-term
adverse effects and long-term beneficial effects on physical or biological features of critical habitat. The
Revised Recovery Plan recommends land managers actively manage portions of both moist and dry forests to
improve stand conditions and forest resiliency, which should benefit the long-term recovery of the northern
spotted owl (p. III–11). While a variable thinning treatment in a in single-story, uniform forest stand is
intended to promote development of multistory structure, it may also result in short-term adverse impacts to
the habitat’s current capability to support owl dispersal and foraging, but have long-term beneficial effects of
creating higher quality habitat that could better support territorial pairs. These types of activities would have
less impact in areas where foraging and dispersal habitat is not limiting, and ideally could be conducted in a
manner that minimizes the short-term negative impacts.
Some structural components of critical habitat PCE3 will be reduced, but when assessed at the stand scale,
effects are not expected to change the actual function of NSO habitat, with the exception of the oak release and
radial thinning of pine. The stands providing foraging habitat will continue to provide foraging opportunities
for NSOs should they occupy or disperse through the home range. The treatments will also facilitate a higher
likelihood of use by NSO through increases in stand heterogeneity, larger trees over time and the reduction in
density of small trees.
Over the 20-30 year timeframe, thinning and fuel reduction treatments are expected to enhance the function
of the project area critical habitat by improving long-term quality of roosting, foraging and dispersal
habitat. Fire effects modeling indicates that thinning and subsequent fuels treatment will generally reduce
the potential for crown fire or maintain a surface fire and significantly reduce predicted stand mortality in
the event of a fire start. While thinned stands will be less dense, average tree diameters would increase and
the basal area ranges and other habitat conditions (canopy closure, down logs, understory, large snags)
would be retained well within the range of use by foraging NSOs (Irwin et al. 2007, 2012, 2015).
The project will not remove PCEs of critical habitat or result in a measurable change in the ECS-3
subunit’s ability to provide the functions for which it was designated. PCE 1 would be transitioned toward
PCE4 and PCE3 by thinning and group selection treatments; PCE 2 would be benefitted through lowintensity prescribed fire; and effects to PCE 3 and PCE 4 are described above. The Alternative 1treatments
will affect less than one percent of the East Cascades South (ECS-3) Critical Habitat Subunit and the
project actions do not significantly reduce the value of these primary constituent elements of critical
habitat. While there will some short-term minor adverse effects on 224 acres of PCE3, and a longer-term
adverse effect on 46 acres of PCE3, the proposed treatments result in a greater assurance of long-term
maintenance of suitable and dispersal habitat. They contribute positively to the overall function of the
ECS-3 subunit, which is to provide demographic support in an area of sparsely distributed high-quality
habitat and Federal land, and provide for population connectivity between subunits to the north and south.

Other resource effects

Compliance with Law, Regulation and Policy
The Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project is in compliance with the Forest Plan standards and guidelines and
management direction from the Forest Plan and NWFP and is consistent with objectives, recommendations
and activity design criteria from the LSRA. Because some standards and guidelines between these documents
differ, in all cases the more restrictive standard and guideline and/or the one most beneficial to TE&S wildlife

species will be implemented. Chapter 2 includes the resource protection measures developed by the
Interdisciplinary Team to reduce or eliminate impacts to listed, proposed, and sensitive species and their
important breeding, feeding and sheltering habitats. The predicted effects for all action alternatives are based
on the implementation of these RPMs.
The project is consistent with all other relevant laws, regulations, policies and plans as they relate to wildlife,
including the Endangered Species Act of 1973 as amended, Forest Service Manual 2670.12 and 2672.422672.43and the National Forest Management Act requirements to provide for a diversity of animal
communities (16 USC 1604((g)(3)(B); also see 36 CFR 219.10(b).
Effects to Threatened, Endangered, Proposed and Forest Service sensitive species are analyzed in the wildlife
BA and BE. Consultation is ongoing with the FWS with respect to effects to listed northern spotted owl and
gray wolf. As described in the BA, the project is considered to be consistent with the Revised Recovery Plan
for the Northern Spotted Owl (USDI-FWS 2011), including recovery actions 10 and 32 that are most
applicable at the project planning and implementation scale. This meets the intent of Forest Plan standard and
guideline 25.h to “maintain and/or enhance habitat for TE&S species consistent with individual species
recovery plans” (Forest Plan p. 4-30).
The variable treatments in each land allocation would maintain or enhance habitat for threatened, endangered
and sensitive species consistent with individual species recovery plans (p. 4-30); would manage habitat for
sensitive plants and animals in a manner that prevents the species from becoming a candidate for threatened
and endangered status (p. 4-5); and would continue to provide connecting travel corridors for wildlife,
particularly late-successional dependent species (p. 4-14).
The project is consistent with management direction in the Forest Plan to protect each known northern
goshawk nest site during planning and implementation and using limited operating periods adjacent to active
nest sites until young have fledged (Forest Plan pp. 3-27, 4-30 and 4-44). The project is consistent with the
goals and direction in the Forest Plan for fisher (Forest Plan p. 3-27). This direction is primarily fulfilled
through the Forest’s LSR and Riparian Reserve management direction and systems. Riparian areas provide
important habitat for fisher because of the close proximity of water and structural diversity of the vegetation.
Wilderness, roadless areas and wild and scenic rivers also contribute to habitat availability and maintaining
species’ viability.

Cumulative Effects – Alternative 1
A review of ongoing and reasonably foreseeable future activities on federal and private lands in the NSO
action area (and other wildlife cumulative effects analysis areas) was completed and is incorporated by
reference (Jordan 2015b). There are no state-managed lands in the NSO action area. While there may be an
overlap in two or more projects’ cumulative effects spatial or temporal bounds, where there are no direct or
indirect effects that overlap in time and space on the resource considered (e.g., reproductive sites, suitable
habitat), there are no cumulative effects.
Cumulative effects in the NSO, northern goshawk and fisher analysis areas are considered as the changes
to the existing condition caused by ongoing or reasonably foreseeable future activities when added to the
effects of the Elk LSR project actions. Currently, within the larger fisher analysis area that also addresses
NSO and northern goshawk, there are no future foreseeable federal actions. There are at least three timber
harvest plans in progress or submitted for approval on adjacent private lands. Other ongoing actions on
NFS and private lands that can influence vegetation, create potential noise disturbance and influence
wildlife behavior and habitat include, but are not limited to: fuelwood collection, dispersed recreation,
implementation of Motorized Travel Management, Oversnow Vehicle Use associated with the Pilgrim
Creek snowmobile park, and routine road and recreational site maintenance (including hazard tree felling).
In addition, fire suppression activities, grazing on the Bartle Allotment and noxious weed monitoring are

also ongoing. Project work authorized under previously completed NEPA includes the Pilgrim Vegetation
Management project, road closures approved under previously completed NEPA, and Timber Stand
Improvement work. Remaining activities under the Pilgrim project are limited to manual or mechanical
release of reforested areas and small diameter (<14”) ponderosa pine tree thinning and these areas do not
support suitable or dispersal habitat for the NSO, fisher or northern goshawk. Similarly, other TSI work
does not include habitat for these species. Road closures do not typically affect habitat, but can result in
beneficial effects to individuals from reduced human access and disturbance. Grazing is not predicted to
negatively or significantly affect NSO, fisher or northern goshawk habitat if surface vegetation that
mammalian or avian prey may use is not excessively removed. The other activities on NFS lands do not
measurably or meaningfully influence wildlife breeding, feeding or sheltering behaviors and are not
predicted to result in any detectable or meaningfully measurable effects to individuals. Therefore,
cumulative effects from those activities are considered insignificant in combination with the project’s
effects.
Activities on private land include commercial thinning, salvage, clearcutting and other forest stand
treatments. Timber harvest plans (THPs) are subject to the California Forest Practice Rules (Sections 919.9
and 939.9) which create a process, that when implemented correctly by the State, avoids unauthorized
‘take’ of NSOs unless authorized by a federal Habitat Conservation Plan. The THP planning and review
process incorporates survey results into THPs, comparing results with the State’s CNDDB NSO database
and ensuring adequate amounts of habitat are retained around NSO activity centers. While the FWS does
not review individual THPs in many cases, it has provided Technical Assistance when requested by
CALFIRE or the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. 78 Extensive hauling on roads and routes
through the project area and in the analysis areas (to complete THPs) occurs near or through suitable
habitat for NSO, northern goshawk and fisher. This is considered part of the ambient environment.
Individuals (goshawk, fisher) occupying the project area, or larger analysis areas, are likely habituated to
this noise and the disturbance associated with roads or harvest activities and may completely avoid these
sources of disturbance. The project will cumulatively contributed to ongoing and predicted future road use,
noise and other habitat disturbance by private land management in ~22% of the NSO and northern
goshawk analysis area, and ~35%of the fisher analysis area during implementation. As noted above,
individuals occupying the project area, or larger analysis areas, are likely habituated to haul noise in
general and the disturbance associated with roads or harvest activities and may completely avoid these
sources of disturbance. These impacts, should they occur, are not predicted to result in any significant
cumulative effects to breeding individuals, provided the Project’s LOPs for noise-generating and habitat
altering activities during the critical breeding period. The LOPs prescribed during the critical breeding
period for the Elk LSR project would reduce, if not eliminate, the potential for direct, indirect or
cumulative effects from project noise or habitat disturbance in combination with that from private
activities (e.g. log haul on cost share roads).
None of the ongoing or submitted THPs are in designated critical habitat for the NSO, as critical habitat is
not designated on private lands. Private lands in the analysis area currently contribute little toward
maintaining the viability of the ST-215 NSO home range, or toward contiguous blocks of suitable goshawk
or fisher habitat. The Elk LSR project will not remove or downgrade NSO habitat in the ST-215 core, or
significantly downgrade suitable habitat in the home range. It will not degrade, downgrade or remove any
78

Private timber harvest plans are reviewed under section 9 of the ESA for the possibilities of prohibited take and private
take of threatened NSO is prohibited under California State law and prosecutable under both Federal and State law. The
California Forest Practice Rules also contain requirements for NSO habitat retention.

suitable habitat from known northern goshawk territories, or fisher denning or resting habitat. Given that
private lands in the analysis area contribute little to no habitat viability, the combined effects of the Elk
LSR project and the ongoing and reasonably foreseeable intensive management of private lands will not
result in effects that would be greater than the Elk LSR project alone. While future management actions on
private lands may occur during the 20 to 30 year timeframe established for the Elk project, reasonable
effects cannot be evaluated in the absence of a proposed THP that provides spatial and treatment data to
assess potential effects to habitat and NSO, goshawk or fisher. While it is reasonable to base potential
future actions on private lands on past actions and effects, the cumulative effects analysis under the ESA
and the NEPA is completed based on the best available current information at the time of the analysis.
Modifications to suitable habitat from Alternative 1 are not expected to result in significant changes to
stand structure or potential use by NSOs, northern goshawk or fisher. The effects to habitat from
Alternative 1 represent about 34 percent of the suitable, and eight percent of the dispersal habitat in the
NSO action area. Effects to suitable habitat will not occur in a currently occupied NSO core area, and
nesting/roosting, and high quality foraging habitats will be benefitted through prescribed fire. The majority
of the foraging habitat proposed for treatment is considered low to moderate value due to limited moisture,
species composition, stagnated growth or dense understory and midstory conditions, or a lack of structural
diversity. No suitable or dispersal habitat will be removed and the structural diversity of thinned stands is
expected to be enhanced post-treatment. These effects, in combination with the ongoing actions on Federal
lands are not expected to remove NSO, northern goshawk or fisher habitat and therefore will not result in
significant cumulative adverse effects to NSO in the action area. The project effects are not expected to
significantly affect breeding, feeding or sheltering behaviors, or create barriers to dispersal; they are
expected to retain and enhance habitat quality through the reintroduction of natural ecological processes.

Alternative 2- No New Temporary Road Construction Other Than Those Required
for Landing Access
Direct and Indirect Effects – Alternative 2
Direct effects to NSO, northern goshawk and fisher are the same as described for Alternative 1and the
described surveys, LOPs and all other RPMs would still apply. Sporax® application would occur on
approximately 82 fewer acres under this alternative when compared to Alternative 1, due to reduced
mechanical thinning treatments.
Compared to Alternative 1, this alternative foregoes mechanical thinning in four natural stands and one older
plantation due to not constructing temporary roads. 22 fewer acres of suitable foraging habitat for NSO and
northern goshawk, 27 acres of foraging habitat for fisher, 6 acres of dispersal habitat for NSO, and 9 acres of
capable habitat for the NSO, goshawk and fisher would not be mechanically thinned. These changes do not
occur in critical habitat, or the ST-215 core or home range. While tree size classes would not increase as
quickly and these small stands would remain at higher risk of loss, low-intensity prescribed fire would still be
utilized on all acres and is expected to benefit these areas by reducing surface and ladder fuels.

Effects relative to Purpose and Need for Action
Compared to Alternative 1, the reduced acreage of increased tree resilience and size classes from reduced
thinning in small segments of these four natural stands and one older plantation are considered negligible in
terms of meeting late-successional habitat needs for the NSO, northern goshawk and fisher. These stands
would receive the same benefits from low-intensity prescribed fire as described for Alternative 1.
Compared to Alternative 1, this alternative transitions a similar amount of the habitat in the LSR toward
increased resilience and larger tree size classes. In NSO habitat, approximately 13 fewer acres would be
182

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

improved over 20 years from a combination of thinning and low-intensity fire; resulting in 56% of the LSR
benefiting from this alternative for this species (compared to 57% under Alternative 1). In northern goshawk
habitat, approximately three fewer acres would be improved and for fisher, eight fewer acres would be
improved. Alternative 2 results in the same amount of LSR benefit as Alternative 1 for the northern goshawk
(62%) and for fisher, 65% of the LSR habitat would be improved (compared to 66% under Alternative 1).
These differences are considered negligible to meeting the purpose and need.

Effects relative to key issues
The effects relative to key issues are the same as described for Alternative 1 as no temporary roads are
proposed in critical habitat.

Other resource effects
There are no other resource effects.

Compliance with Law, Regulation and Policy
As described for Alternative 1.

Cumulative Effects – Alternative 2
As the differences in habitat benefit are so slight, the beneficial cumulative effects are considered the same as
that described for Alternative 1, though slightly less beneficial for all species with only the return of lowintensity prescribed fire.

Alternative 3 - No Treatments of Natural Stands within Designated Critical Habitat
for the Northern Spotted Owl
Direct and Indirect Effects – Alternative 3
Direct effects to NSO, northern goshawk and fisher are the same as described for Alternative 1and the
described surveys, LOPs and all other RPMs would still apply. Sporax® application would occur on
approximately 270 fewer acres of natural stands under this alternative when compared to Alternative 1, due to
eliminating mechanical thinning treatments in natural stands of designated critical habitat.
Compared to Alternative 1, this alternative foregoes the reintroduction of prescribed fire on 390 acres of
suitable NSO habitat (nesting/roosting and high quality foraging), maintaining these acres in their current
condition. There would be no increase in habitat diversity or risk reduction benefits from the reintroduction of
low-intensity prescribed fire in these stands. This also results in reduced beneficial effects to fisher and
northern goshawk habitat, though stands would remain in the current condition, at risk from the ongoing
trends though likely functional for nesting/roosting, resting/denning or foraging at least in the short-term.
Mechanical thinning in 270 acres of suitable NSO, goshawk and fisher foraging habitat would not occur.
Black oak would not be released on the planned 27 acres, and the 19 acres of radial thinning of legacy pine
would not occur. Foraging habitat would not be degraded or downgraded, but as with the higher quality
habitats above, would remain in its current condition and at risk to loss from the current trends. Black oaks
would continue to be overtopped in this portion of the project area, and over time, reduced and potentially lost
as a stand component. There would be no direct or indirect benefits to fisher denning, resting, or prey base
habitat over time, though fisher (and other species) would be expected to still use this stand for foraging.

Effects relative to Purpose and Need for Action
Compared to Alternative 1, this alternative transitions the least amount of acreage toward increased resilience
and larger tree size classes in the LSR, with a corresponding increase in the potential for continued habitat
loss and reduced connectivity. In NSO habitat, approximately 1,346 acres would be improved over 20 years
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

183

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

through thinning and low-intensity fire, resulting in benefits within 44% of the LSR for this species
(compared to 57% under Alternative 1). In northern goshawk habitat, approximately 1,471 acres would be
improved over 20 years through thinning and low-intensity fire, resulting in benefits within 48% of the LSR
(compared to 62% under Alternative 1). In fisher habitat, approximately 1,568 acres would be improved over
20 years through thinning and low-intensity fire, resulting in benefits within 51% of the LSR (compared to
66% under Alternative 1).

Effects relative to key issues
Compared to Alternative 1, this alternative meets the active management recommendations described in the
2012 Final Critical Habitat Rule on 472 fewer acres. Mechanical thinning treatments would not occur in
natural stands of critical habitat, and prescribed fire would not be utilized anywhere in critical habitat. 224
acres of natural stands designated as PCE3 will not be degraded. While the function of unthinned PCE3
habitat will remain as foraging, it will also remain at risk to loss from overstocking and competition for light,
water and nutrients and insect attacks with some stands remaining stagnant in the understory (e.g., dense
white fir with little to no diversity in portions will remain until gaps from mortality are likely created. Both
PCE2 and PCE3 would be maintained in its current condition, at risk of loss from the ongoing trends though
likely functional for nesting/roosting, resting/denning or foraging at least in the short-term.
Oak release on 27 acres and radial thinning on 19 acres in PCE3 would not occur. Because habitat would not
be downgraded on these 46 acres, short- and long-term adverse effects to PCE3 would not occur. Conversely,
long-term benefits from increased foraging habitat diversity and prey base would also not occur. Lowintensity prescribed fire would not be initiated in critical habitat. Compared to Alternative 1, 12 fewer acres of
PCE1 (capable habitat in younger plantations) would be benefited and transitioned toward dispersal
conditions, due to eliminating the use of low-intensity prescribed fire in those stands.

Other resource effects
There are no other resource effects.

Compliance with Law, Regulation and Policy
As described for Alternative 1.

Cumulative Effects – Alternative 3
Cumulative effects of Alternative 3 are similar to those described for Alternative 1 with the exception of
critical habitat treatments. There will be no effect to nesting/roosting habitat (PCE2) under this alternative or
to 325 acres of foraging (PCE3) under this alternative. Cumulative effects to suitable NSO habitat represent
about 22 percent of the suitable in the NSO action area.

Alternative 4 - No Action
Under No Action, the proposed management activities would not be implemented. No direct, indirect, or
cumulative effects are expected. While actions would not be undertaken with this alternative, the ongoing
trends described in Chapter 1 would continue.
While there would not be project effects, the existing trends of declining forest health and increased risk of
habitat loss described in Chapter 1 will continue until such time that natural events reset the seral stage,
similar to what is occurring at present, or other management is approved and implemented. Any change in
conditions would occur as the natural progression of vegetation and fuels change over time (see the
Silviculture and Forest Health and Fire and Fuels sections for more detail).
Under no action, stands would continue to exceed recommended stocking levels, resulting in a continued loss
of diameter growth and reduced resistance to insects and disease in ponderosa and sugar pine. The ability of
184

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

trees to maintain vigor and survive during future drought conditions, especially drought sensitive species such
as white fir, would decrease. Sugar and ponderosa pine would continue to decline within the mixed-conifer
stands as they progress towards a higher density of shade tolerant species [white fir and cedar] in the absence
of management activity.
Habitat conditions for NSO, northern goshawk and fisher are not expected to significantly change under
Alternative 4 in the short term. The existing conditions in stands proposed for treatment are likely to sustain
these species and their and prey over the short term. Increases in habitat suitability (i.e. development of larger
trees, understory composition, heterogeneity and larger snags/logs) is expected to take longer than what is
modeled under the action alternatives, and would result in fewer assurances of sustaining higher quality
habitat for a longer time. While stand modeling is used to compare trends across Alternatives and through
time, it is important to understand the modeling limitations when interpreting results. With continuation of the
current mortality trends, future stands would be characterized by a dense layer of smaller shade tolerant trees
with fewer large diameter trees and areas of high concentrations of fuels conducive to high intensity fire. The
increased risk of further stand loss from large, heavy fuel accumulation, slow growth of large trees due to high
stand densities, and continued loss of large overstory pine from insects and disease do not meet the purpose
and need of reducing risk, promoting stand resilience, or accelerating development of late-successional habitat
characteristics in the Elk Flat LSR.
Dense stands will continue to remain at risk to loss from stocking pressure, drought, disease, insects or
wildfire effects. Changes in stand structure are expected to result largely from individual tree mortality
associated with inter-tree competition, blowdown or bark beetle activity. The amount and type of mortality
would vary by stand type and species, with increased mortality expected to continue in all size classes of
ponderosa pine. Because there will be no reduction in stand densities, the risk of insect-related mortality
would also increase, contributing to fuel loading.
The fuels modeling shows surface, ladder and crown fuels would continue to accumulate in the absence of
fire or mechanical treatment. With no modification of forest stand structure and fuels, fire behavior under
normal, summer weather (90th percentile) conditions would be as described in Chapter 1 for the existing
conditions. The standing dead trees will fall over the five to ten years, adding to the current surface fuel
loading. Once the trees have fallen, surface fuel load is estimated to exceed 100 tons/acre, and are
characterized as a fuel model 13 where “fire is generally carried by a continuous layer of slash. Large
quantities of greater than 3 inches material are present. Fires spread quickly through the fine fuels and
intensity builds up as the large fuels start burning. A wildfire in the mortality pockets with high fuel loading
will be of high intensity. In the natural stands where mortality is not as extensive as in the ponderosa pinedominated stands, some areas are expected to experience passive crown fire and flame lengths >4 feet.
FVS-FFE modeling of the No Action alternative indicates up to 40 percent mortality from a wildfire in the
natural stands under 97th percentile weather conditions.
While research indicates spotted owls continue to occupy and may reproduce in burned areas, depending on
burn severity (Bond et al. 2002, 2009; Lee et al. 2012, Clark et al. 2011, 2013), these findings are strongly
influenced by small sample sizes and the extent and spatial pattern of fire effects particular to each area
studied. While it has been shown that California spotted owls show an apparent preference for foraging in
burned areas of all severities (Bond et al. 2009) the author attributed the majority of these results to the
likelihood that post-burn use by owls is associated with an ‘increased abundance or accessibility of prey.’ The
Bond study also notes that while California spotted owls foraged in all burn severity areas (potentially
preferring high-severity burn areas) they avoided high and moderate severity areas for roosting, and
presumably nesting.
The NWFP’s 20-year monitoring report summary for the ‘Status and Trend of Late-successional and Oldgrowth Forests’ states that some portions of the NWFP area have been setback by decades from achieving
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

185

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

those outcomes [expectations for older forest abundance, diversity, and connectivity] particularly resulting
from large wildfires in the fire-prone portions of the NWFP area” (Davis et al. 2015). The 20-year monitoring
report for the ‘Status and Trend of Northern Spotted Owl Habitat’ also states: “large wildfires continue to be
the leading cause for loss of NSO habitats on federal lands. Most of these fire-related losses have occurred
within the network of large reserves that were designed for the protection and restoration of habitat for longterm northern spotted owl conservation” (Davis et al. 2015). The summary report further notes that the loss
rates in fire prone portions of the NSOs range exceeded the expected 2.5% rate for the 20-year period at rates
of 3.9 to 7.4% per decade, including the California Cascades area. Most large wildfires and resulting habitat
losses have occurred in the federally reserved land use allocations [including LSRs] designed for NSO
conservation (Davis et al. 2015). Climate change is also expected to expand the area of fire-prone landscapes
and an increased frequency of large wildfires this century has already been observed.
Under no action, 50 percent of the project area will have the potential for flame lengths greater than 4 feet and
passive crown fire. Though burn severity, extent and post-fire conditions would vary widely and be dependent
on several factors, snags and CWD would likely be consumed and the existing structure and density of
understory vegetation and ground fuels would allow for easy transition of fire from the ground into the forest
canopy; making crown fire more likely and direct suppression less effective. As a result, the potential for high
severity wildfire impacts to occur and a long-term loss of NSO habitat are increased under this alternative
with no progress made toward initiating the restoration of ecological processes that promote a natural, low
intensity, frequent fire regime.
Cumulative Effects
As there are no direct or indirect effects under this alternative, there are no cumulative effects.

Introduction
This section analyzes effects to federally listed Endangered, Threatened, Proposed or Candidate, or Forest
Service Pacific Southwest Regional Forester Sensitive Plant Species 79 (TES species) and other botanical
resources pertaining to the Purpose and Need for Action and Key Issues. A Biological Assessment and
Evaluation for Botanical Species Report was completed and is incorporated by reference and information
important to the decision is summarized here (Posey, 2015a). Boletus species and unique habitats were
analyzed in the Compliance Report for Botanical Resources (Posey, 2015). Both reports are incorporated by
reference. Information most relevant to the decision is summarized here.

Purpose and Need Applicable to Botanical Resources
The restoration of Elk Flat meadow is in part restoration of a unique botanical habitat and effectiveness of the
Alternatives at meeting the Purpose and Need for Action #3-Restore Meadow Habitat in Elk Flat, and #4Retain Hardwoods as a Stand Component at Density Levels Commensurate with Developing LateSuccessional Stands are relevant to botanical resources. The Purpose and Need for Action is not applicable to
TES plants.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

No key issues were identified related to TES botanical species or unique botanical resources. Issue #4,
mushroom collection in Elk Flat relates to special forest products; specifically the retention of Boletus habitat.
Effects to the health and growth of Boletus mushrooms in Elk Flat are considered here.

Methodology
An official list of Threatened, Endangered and Candidate species was requested from the FWS website 80 on
January 5, 2016 for the Elk project area plus a 3.0-mile buffer. This document is included as Appendix 1 of
the Botanical BA (Posey, 2015a). 81 Four species were listed; however, none have the potential to occur in the
project area. In accordance with the ESA and regulatory guidance, only those organisms and critical habitat
listed on the official species list are considered, and only those species under the regulatory jurisdiction of the
FWS.
Sensitive species habitat was evaluated through review of the GIS layers for known sites of sensitive plants
for the Shasta-McCloud Management Unit of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, district files; the National
Resource Information Systems (NRIS) data base, Soil Survey of Shasta-Trinity National Forest Area
California; CalFlora; and the Consortium of California Herbaria and California Natural Diversity Data Base. 82
All habitats in the project area were floristically surveyed; each plant encountered was identified to the degree
necessary to determine if it was a species of concern. 83 The sensitive species identified in the assessment
process as potentially occurring in the project area were specifically targeted in the surveys.

Results of Surveys
No sensitive plants were known to occur in the project area prior to surveys and no new populations were
found during surveys.

Indicators and Measures
TES Species
An indicator of effects to TES botanical species would be the presence of individuals or populations and the
numbers of individuals or populations impacted by activities.

Boletus Habitat at Elk Flat
The indicator of effects for Boletus habitat in Elk Flat meadow is the number of acres of conifer removal
within unit 402. For the purposes of this indicator, it is assumed that all conifer cover on Elk Flat is boletus
habitat, although it is not known how much actually supports Boletus.

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Acres of meadow restoration treatment provide the indicator and measure for restoration of the dry meadow
ecosystem at Elk Flat. (Hydrologic function also influence meadow restoration and is included in the
hydrology section starting on page 193.)

Hardwoods
Acres of oak release treatment and acres of aspen restoration indicate the effects related to hardwoods.

Riparian Habitat
Riparian habitat is also a unique habitat, but is covered in the hydrology section starting on page 193.

Boundaries
In accordance with CFR § 220.4 (f), spatial and temporal boundaries set the limits for selecting those actions
that are most likely to contribute to a cumulative effect. The effects of those actions must overlap in space and
time for there to be potential cumulative effects. This is determined by how long, and how far reaching, direct
and indirect effects of a project are felt on a given resource area.

Spatial Bounding and Temporal Bounding
Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive Plants
The project area is the boundary for TES plants as that is the area where direct effects have potential to occur
should individuals or populations be located. Any potential impacts to TES botanical species would be direct
and occur during project implementation.

Unique Habitats
Unit 402 is the boundary for dry meadow habitat at Elk Flat. Any potential impacts to meadow habitat would
be direct and occur during project implementation. The boundary for unique habitats of hardwoods is the
project boundary, as that is the area where direct effects have potential to occur. Effects of release and
restoration treatments are expected to last approximately 20 years as conifer ingrowth will begin to encroach
again.

Boletus Habitat
The spatial boundary for Boletus habitat is those parts of Elk Flat with conifers; approximately 412 acres. The
remaining areas of Elk Flat without adequate conifer cover, open areas and areas with widely scattered trees,
are not habitat for ectomycorrhizal fungi such as Boletus species. Boletus species form mycorrhizal
associations with many conifer species, hardwoods and other plants. In Elk Flat, associated conifer species
include ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and white fir. Hardwoods include black oak. Boletes, commonly
found throughout the Cascade Range (Desjardin, et al., 2015) including the McCloud Flats, are collected by
both personal and commercial collecting permits. The Elk project area is a favorite collection area due to the
amount of mushrooms present and its close proximity to the towns of McCloud and Mt. Shasta.
How long these effects will last after treatment depends on the treatment. The more aggressive the thinning
and/or burning treatment the fewer mushrooms come back until that area is again providing habitat elements
necessary for ectomycorrhizal fungi such as Boletus (Smith, et al., 2005). From the research, we can assume
meadow restoration treatments using tree harvesting through mechanical methods that would create a
pine/grassland savannah would result in a permanent loss of habitat conditions that support boletus species.
Boletus habitat in unthinned patches would be underburned in a mosaic fashion leaving areas of Boletus
refugia to recolonize the area. Depending on burn intensity, season of burning and the number of live trees
killed by the burning, recovery could take anywhere from three to 20 years.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Affected Environment
Chapter 1 describes the general vegetative conditions in the project area including the existing condition of
the unique botanical habitat of Elk Flat meadow and hardwood status in the project area.

Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive Plants
The only TES plant with potential to occur in the project area is Cypripedium montanum, or Mountain lady’s
slipper, which is a Region 5 Forest Service sensitive species. Mountain lady’s slipper inhabits moist areas and
dry slopes in mixed evergreen or coniferous forest between 760 and 7200 feet. There are no known
occurrences in the project area.

Unique Habits
Dry Meadow
Dry meadow habitat includes unit 402 at Elk Flat at approximately 518 acres. The existing condition and
affected environment of Elk Flat are described in more detail in Chapter 1 (starting on p. 29) Vegetation
consists of sparse perennial forbs and perennial grasses and more densely covered areas by perennial bunch
grasses with fewer perennial forbs. More developed soils support stands of older conifers. Conifer
encroachment, as evidenced by the presence of very young conifer species is occurring throughout the
meadow.

Hardwoods
Aspen
Aspen stands are important to species diversity both plant and animal. Aspen are an early successional species
and shade intolerant. They need ample sunshine to grow and reproduce. Aspen habitat has declined at a rapid
rate due to past management such as fire suppression, timber harvest and management practices that favored
conifers, livestock grazing and site conversions. During the early days when timber was being harvested by
the McCloud Lumber Company and the early days of the Forest Service, aspen was considered a nuisance
species and many stands across the flats were converted to pine trees. Livestock grazing was very intense
until the mid-1940s and stands over-browsed. Livestock grazing declined greatly after WWII. Cattle still
browse aspen as do deer and elk especially in late summer and fall when protein levels are higher in aspen
than they are in grasses and forbs.
A few aspen stands throughout the McCloud Flats have been released from competing conifers in past
projects with great results but many more are still in need of release. The Elk Salvage (2005-2005) and Elk
Flat LSR Fuels Reduction (2007) Projects released small amounts of aspen within the boundary for this
Project.
Aspen is known to occur in several units in small amounts totaling approximately 25 acres (24 of which are
proposed for release treatment). The largest contiguous aspen stand is approximately 10 acres in unit 175.

Oak
Black oak is very important in terms of contributing to and maintaining species diversity, especially for latesuccessional wildlife species of concern such as the sensitive fisher and listed northern spotted owl (NSO).
Oak habitats offer diverse resources to wildlife such as thermoregulation sites (shade in the summer, shelter in
the winter), perching and resting sites, roost sites, nesting and denning cavities and food items for prey.
Acorns are an obvious food source that is plentiful and rich in calories. Acorns are very important for
maintaining the prey base for fisher, Pacific marten, NSOs and northern goshawks. Oak catkins, twig, leaves,
buds, sap, and galls are also eaten. Acorns are also an important food source for deer and bear during the fall
months because of the high fat and protein content.
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

189

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

An estimated 30 acres of black oak occur scattered throughout the project area. Negative impacts to Black
Oak from past activities are the same as for aspen. Encroachment and overtopping by surrounding conifers
has decreased growth and the expansion of mixed conifer oak habitat. Most oaks are at the sapling stage and
occur along roads in small openings. Portions of Unit 153 and 178 are an exception in that they have many
adult oaks scattered throughout portions of the stands. Unit 153 has quite a few smaller and larger oaks
(diameter classes range from 4 to 16 inches).

Boletus Habitat at Elk Flat
There are at least four species of edible Boletes known to occur on the Shasta-Trinity, the Klamath and the
Modoc National Forests. These include the king bolete (Boletus edulis var. grandedulis), spring king bolete
(B. rex-veris), queen bolete (B. regineus) and the butter bolete (B. aff. regius). 84. They grow in soils under
conifers and with oaks and other hardwoods. Only the spring king bolete is not known to occur with
hardwoods. It grows in small clusters or groups buried in sandy soils under pines (ponderosa and lodgepole)
and red fir. They fruit in the spring above 3,280 feet elevation in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range. All
four boletus species are described as common.
Generally, any conifer area having trees over 30 years old and providing enough cover to maintain a cooler
soil temperature could be habitat. Out of the 518 acres in unit 402, 379 acres will be harvested leaving
approximately 60 square feet of basal area per acre or less. The unthinned patches provide approximately 33
acres of conifer with the remaining 106 acres in existing un-encroached dry meadow that does not provide
boletus habitat. It is not known how much of the 412 acres are of conifer currently provide habitat for Boletus
species, but most if not all has the potential to eventually provide it in the absence of disturbance to reset the
area to meadow habitat. Some specific areas identified by local boletus collectors as being good habitat were
incorporated into the unthinned patches.

Environmental Consequences
Direct, Indirect Effects, and Cumulative - Alternatives 1, 2, 3
TES Plant Species
No sensitive plant species are known to occur within the project boundary. Standard operating procedures are
in place to protect newly discovered populations (see Appendix C # 16, p. D-3). There would be no direct or
indirect effects on TES botanical species and therefore no cumulative effects.

Determination of Effects to Threatened and Endangered Species
Adequate biological assessment/evaluation has been completed to determine the effects of this project on the
plant species listed as threatened, endangered or proposed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and sensitive
by the USDA Forest Service Region 5. Based on the information summarized above, the project botanist has
determined that implementation of the Elk Project will not negatively affect any plant species listed by FWS
or Region 5 or their viability.

The butter boletes of California represent a complex of species closely related to the European Boletus appendiculatus
and B. regius but are most likely undescribed species and in need of taxonomic clarification (Desjardin, et al., 2015 pp.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

When combined with the hydrologic restorations, Alternatives 1 and 3 fully implement the meadow
restoration treatments of meadow enhancement (conifer removal) and underburning. Alternative 2 drops the
conifer removal on 25 acres, but does provide the underburning. All three action alternatives provide meadow
restoration with Alternative 2 not meeting the Purpose and Need for Action to the same extent Alternatives 1
and 3 do. Beneficial effects are expected to be maintained by the periodic underburning with the early seral
stage maintained for at least 30 years.

Hardwoods
Aspen
Effects of all action alternatives are the same for aspen because the changed acres in Alternatives 2 and 3 do
not affect aspen stands. Most living conifers will be removed within 150 feet of tree and/or sprouts and
conifers will not be replanted in the area. Aspen will be monitored to determine how project activities
including burning may affect aspen. Photo points as well as some type of vegetation monitoring plan will be
put into place prior to the start of any activities to have baseline information so the effects of logging activities
and underburning can be determined over time. Browsing by livestock and wildlife will also be monitored to
determine if fencing is needed. Aspen stand will be mapped annually as part of the monitoring to see if it is
expanding each year. All three action alternatives are expected to benefit aspen and meet the Purpose and
Need for Action. Monitoring and implementation of the adaptive management strategy for aspen restoration if
needed (see p. B-34) will assure restoration, for beneficial direct, indirect and cumulative effects in the project
area.

Oak
Thinning around oaks will reduce competition from conifers for sunlight, nutrients and water. As described
and illustrated on page B-26, oak release removes conifers from within 30 feet of the dripline of healthy black
oak that will benefit from a release, and increasing the removal out to 60 feet of the dripline within the
southern aspects. Conifer adding desirable habitat contributions would be retained as described in Appendix
A. The retained trees contribute to the late-successional habitat within the Elk Flat LSR, and are important
roosting and foraging resources for northern spotted owl and their prey, as well as potential future nesting
areas (large cavities or brooms that develop). Planting acorns in openings may also increase black oak over
time. It is expected that after the oak release work is completed, the portions of stands 153 and 178, and others
with oak release, will be a mixed conifer/oak stand.
All three action alternatives provide beneficial direct (release), indirect (underburning to help maintain oak in
the stands), and cumulative effects, but vary in the degree of benefit. Alternative 1 would release
approximately 30 acres of black oak occur scattered throughout the project area. Repeated underburning
would help retain oak in in the stands for the next 20 to 30 years. Alternative 2 reduced thinning, and thus oak
release where oak are encountered, by approximately 98 acres. However the majority of areas dropped do not
provide substantial oak, and Alternative 2 results in very similar effects as Alternative 1. Alternative 3 drops
units from thinning that provide greater percentages of oaks than is common throughout the project, resulting
in approximately 9 acres of oak release. This will create a disproportionately lower response under Alternative
3 than the other two action alternatives and retaining oak as a stand component will not be achieved.

Boletus Habitat at Elk Flat
Boletus spp. are ectomycorrhizal mushrooms meaning they form symbiotic associations with the fine root
systems of plants, growing out into the soil matrix. These mushrooms are sensitive to activities that disrupt or
destroy these fine root systems. They are also sensitive to changes in soil temperature from overstory removal
and loss of associated species. According to research on the Willamette National Forest, the more aggressive
the thinning the longer it takes mushroom habitat to rebound (Pilz, et al., 1999).

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

191

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

The unthinned patches providing current Boletus habitat would not be mechanically disturbed. Underburning
may have a negative effect on most ectomycorrhizal mushroom species because it reduces the duff and
organic layers which is where most of the mycorrhizae occur. The potential negative effects from
underburning would be reduced through the retention of ground cover (duff and or fine woody debris less
than 3 inches) across at least 50 percent of all activity areas to maintain soil productivity (see SOP 5 on p. D1). Underburning would be implemented to create a mosaic pattern where burn intensities will range from
areas not burned at all to areas burned low and at moderate intensely (p. 52, B-35). Burning in a mosaic
pattern would retain areas of duff and down woody debris, preserving some habitat and reducing impact on
the remaining habitat. Monitoring will occur once burning has been completed (p. 91).
It isn’t known how much of the 379 acres currently supports Boletus habitat or how much of it outside the
UTPs would be eliminated; however, it is likely all 379 acres have the potential to eventually provided boletus
habitat in the absence of disturbance needed to maintain the meadow habitat. Therefore, current or future
Boletus habitat in Elk Flat meadow would be reduced by approximately 379 acres through maintenance of the
meadow ecosystem with return of more natural disturbance regimes. The 33 acres of UTPs would continue to
provide boletus habitat.
Treatments in Elk Flat are the same under Alternatives 1 and 3. Alternative 2 would treat 25 fewer acres than
Alternatives 1 and 3. The effects on Boletus and their habitat in Elk Flat would be much the same for all
action alternatives, with the possibility that Alternative 2 decreases the effects to boletus on the 25 acres
dropped from the meadow enhancement treatment (but would still include underburning). If any areas are
severely burned, mushrooms will likely be lost until favorable soil and duff conditions return to pre-burning
conditions. Negative effects to habitat may last 20 years or longer. Habitat in Unit 402 outside of the UTPS
would be substantially decreased or eliminated by the removal of thermal cover and associated species and
ground disturbance. These areas will become habitat for grasses and forbs to restore the unique botanical
habitat and maintained by repeated underburning activities.

Alternative 4 - No Action
Under No Action, the proposed management activities would not be implemented. No direct, indirect, or
cumulative effects are expected. Current trends would continue. The unique habitats of dry meadow and
hardwoods would continue to decline. Boletus habitat in Elk Flat would not be affected, however, natural
disturbances such as fire or a mudflow event may alter habitat.

Summary and Conclusions
Surveys have identified no TES botanical species in the project area. Adequate procedures are in place to
protect TES botanical species if newly discovered prior to or during implementation. There would be no
direct, indirect, or cumulative effects to TES botanical species with any alternative considered in detail, and a
determination has been made there would be no effect to botanical TES species.

Effects Relative to Purpose and Need for Action
All three action alternatives meet the Purpose and Need for action pertaining to dry meadow habitat at Elk
Flat. Alternative 2 does not meet it as well as Alternatives 1 and 3 by providing 25 fewer acres of meadow
enhancement treatment.
All three action alternatives meet the Purpose and Need for action for retaining hardwoods. There is no
difference between the alternatives for aspen. Alternative 3 meets the Purpose and Need for Action on less
than 1/3 of the available areas for oak when compared to Alternatives 1 and 2.

Effects Relative to Key Issues

192

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

All three action alternatives reduce boletus habitat at Elk Flat in favor of the unique habitat of dry meadow.
All three action alternatives retain some boletus habitat at Elk Flat in the unthinned patches, although it may
be reduced in value for 20 years through underburning. Alternative 2 removes conifer on 25 fewer acres. If
those acres correspond to current or developing boletus habitat, it may have a slightly reduced negative effect
when compared to Alternatives 1 and 3.
While the key issue is limited to the habitat at Elk Flat, it is worth noting that boletus are common species
throughout the forested portions of the west. Elsewhere in the project area the design criteria to protect
northern spotted owl (NSO) and goshawk habitat will also retain habitat for many fungi species including
Boletus by retaining tree and shrub species, down woody debris, snags and overstory cover. Using the RPMs
in place for survey and manage fungi and the Best Management Practices discussed in the project soil report
will also help retain and improve fungi habitat by retaining 30% to 50% of the duff layer and down woody
debris.

Compliance with Law, Regulation and Policy
The Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project is in compliance with the Forest Plan (4.14,4.16), and other relevant
laws, regulations, policies and plans including the Endangered Species Act of 1973 as amended, USDA Dept.
Regulation 9500-4, Forest Service Manual 2670.12, 2670.22, 2670.32, 2671.1 and 2672.42.-2672.43.
TES species were analyzed in the BA/BE for this project. None were found during surveys and none were
known to occur prior to surveys. No plant species including fungi species will be affected by the Elk project
to the extent that they will need to be listed as a TES species at any time in the future.
The Forest Plan (p.4.81) directs the management of non-timbered areas of Elk Flat primarily for early seral
stage species. NFMA directs us to manage for diversity of ecosystems across the landscape to provide a
variety of habitats for numerous species of wildlife, plants and fish. Early seral stages such as grasslands and
forb/grasslands are not well represented on the Shasta side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Most are
being affected by conifer or shrub encroachment.

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Water quality must remain within the range that maintains the biological, physical, and chemical integrity of
the system and benefits survival, growth, reproduction, and migration of individuals composing aquatic and
riparian communities. Attaining ACS objective #4 approximates water quality, because the processes that
maintain water quality must be within their natural range of variability to be in a properly functioning
condition. Turbidity and temperature are water quality parameters that describe current conditions and further
characterize the natural range of variability.

Turbidity
Changes in turbidity can indicate the amount of suspended sediment in water introduced by disturbance and
this can affect water quality. Discerning background from introduced suspended sediment input is difficult but
by comparing runoff during a range of storm events, upstream and downstream of road crossings, turbidity
can be used to estimate sources of suspended sediment. Turbidity measures the amount of light passing
through water and indicates the presence of suspended particles, which interrupt the passage of light,
sometimes recognized as cloudiness in water, as well as relatively clear water when fine particles cannot be
actually recognized or seen.

Water Temperature
Water temperature variability reflects a variety of inputs such as ground water, runoff, amount of shade or
sunlight near or well above the water surface in overstory canopy, as well as air temperature in adjacent stands
or whole drainages.

Riparian Area Processes and Functions
Riparian Vegetation
Plant communities in riparian areas and wetlands must be maintained as indicated by ACS Objective #8 to
provide adequate summer and winter thermal regulation, nutrient filtering, appropriate rates of surface
erosion, bank erosion, and channel migration and to supply amounts and distributions of coarse woody debris
sufficient to sustain physical complexity and stability.

Floodplain and Meadow Processes and Functions
Floodplain Inundation
Floodplain inundation indicates stream processes and floodplain interactions are maintained over a natural
range of variability of runoff timing and duration. Attaining ACS Objective #7 indicates that channels are
actively flooding onto the floodplain, spreading flow and releasing energy without excessive erosion or
deposition.

Water Table Elevation and Storage
Increases in water table elevation and storage should result in extended flow duration as exhibited by
comparing flow duration in the channel, as compared to before and after storms, with flow duration response
after treatment. An increase in flow duration would indicate that infiltration and groundwater discharge is
increasing water table elevation and water storage and indicate that ACS Objective #7 is being maintained.
Other evidence that ACS Objective #7 is maintained or improved would be active flooding on the floodplain,
meadow saturation and the growth of upland sedges. Increased flooding, infiltration and sediment detention
should result in the development of floodplain elevations consistent with existing meadow contours and
establishment of meadow vegetation in areas adjacent to streams in Elk Flat meadow.

Riparian Habitat Connectivity

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

195

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Riparian Corridor – Habitat Conditions in Naturally Appearing Riparian Corridors
Riparian Habitat Connectivity would increase with riparian vegetation extending along the channel and
outward away from the channel with linkages from the aquatic to the terrestrial resources. Maintaining or
improving Aquatic Conservation Objective #9 would be demonstrated by increased riparian habitat
connectivity over the current condition.

Key Issue - Watershed Health
Watershed Health can indicate whether natural processes and functions are in equilibrium where background
sediment transport and erosion rates fall within a range of natural variability resilient to temporary natural
disturbance, such as dispersing erosive energy and detaining sediment during flooding.

Sediment Transport and Erosion Rate
Watershed drainage area receives precipitation and transports it as runoff according to the erosive and
depositional processes functioning within the watershed. Where sediment transport and erosion rates fall
outside their range of natural variability, these processes do not function as contributing towards Watershed
Health and can be identified by excessive erosion on the landscape or sediment transport from landscapte to
streams. However, due to the naturally high background sediment transport rate in this watershed changes to
sediment transport are masked, and direct measurements to detect changes are not measurable at a project
scale or when evaluated on a watershed scale. Floodplain function and the presence of riparian vegetation is
assumed to reduce both sediment transport and erosion rate along streams and in the watershed and indicate
that active erosion and sediment transport in response to temporary natural disturbance falls within a range of
natural variability. In addition because channel forms adjust through time to a range of runoff conditions,
where erosive energy is dispersed while maintaining a stable channel form in relation to the ability to flood on
the floodplain these channels are considered to erode and transport sediment within a range of natural
variability resilient to temporary natural disturbance. Channels out of adjustment have altered forms such as
entrenchment. The presence of entrenched channels that cannot flood are assumed to have high rates of
sediment transport and erosion.

Ground Disturbance at the Sub-Drainage Scale
Monitoring results of past activities within the Sub-Drainages that intersect the project area are used to
characterize the resilience to ground disturbance by activity and recovery potential (George, 2015). An
increase in ground disturbance beyond the resilience of the soil to retain its structure, infiltration rate and
capacity to recover from disturbance may increase erosion, sediment transport, peak flow and a loss of
infiltration from compaction depending on soil characteristics ( (Rust, et al., 2015). Current recovery by the
Sub-Drainages from past ground-disturbance is used to describe the resilience of the Sub-Drainages to ground
disturbance and provide an estimate of the expected response to Sub-Drainage characteristics from future
ground-disturbing activities. In addition, local observations of ground disturbing activities during monitoring
on public land and similar activities identified on non-public land are assigned a coefficient based on a given
ground disturbance activity and acres reported to compare existing condition and future condition for each
Sub-Drainage (for a complete description see narrative below and (George, 2015).

Equivalent Road Acre at the Watershed Scale
The Ash Creek Watershed boundary identified from the Forest watershed GIS layer is used to analyze effects
from the project at a large watershed scale. A TOC was developed for 5th field Watersheds during the forest
planning process and is the only scale used for comparison between existing and proposed activities.
Equivalent Road Acre (ERA) is used as a surrogate for changes in runoff and any effects to peak flow
discharge due to ground disturbance, (George, 2015).

196

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

ERA is a measure that compares the disturbance of a given area to that same area of a native road surface
(Haskins, 1983).This method is used to evaluate effects from all activities that may cause disturbance known
to occur in the watershed (George, 2015)
To determine relevant past, present, and foreseeable future projects, spatial and temporal boundaries must be
defined (CFR § 220.4 (f)). For the effects analysis the direct and indirect effects of the Elk project relative to
hydrology are conditions influencing runoff and sedimentation.

Spatial Bounding
Spatially, the conditions influencing runoff and sedimentation. (e.g. road construction and machine piling) in
the project affect sedimentation in channels. As such, the spatial context is the project, sub-drainage and
watershed scales:
1. Project Scale - As defined by the project boundary.
2. Sub-drainage Scale –As defined by 2nd to 3rd order watersheds that intersect the project boundary
(Forest Plan, 1995). The 8th field hydrologic unit code (HUC) Sub-Drainages are used as a proxy for
the 2nd to 3rd order watersheds as they are the smallest watershed-scale mapping unit available.
3. The Watershed Scale - The hydrology cumulative effects analysis area is the Ash Creek 5th field
HUC watershed (Watershed). The TOC for the Ash Creek watershed encompassing the Elk Flat
LSR project boundary is used to compare with the existing condition and the proposed action for
cumulative effects analysis (Forest Plan).
These scales represent the area potentially influenced by effects from proposed treatment activities.

Temporal Bounding
The temporal context ranges with the type of activities from onset of the activity to a lifespan of decreasing
disturbance with time, up to 30 years into the future; 30 years is approximately how long the most ground
disturbing treatments would take to recover, decreasing in ERA and effects to runoff and sedimentation with
time. Forest Transportation System Roads are considered permanent features and would therefore not recover.
In this analysis, the description of the existing condition includes the accumulation of past activities, which
have influenced vegetation. In the effects discussion, “short-term” refers to effects over the 10-year period
from the time the activity was accomplished. Beyond 10 years, effects are considered “long-term.” The
current environmental conditions reflect the aggregate impact of all prior human actions and natural events
that have affected the environment and might contribute to cumulative effects and are a proxy for the impacts
of past actions. 85

Affected Environment
Streamflow and Channel Condition
Banks are more susceptible to erosion in the project area in contrast to banks upstream where abundant
riparian vegetation and in-stream bedload structure is functioning. Intermittent channels carry snowmelt or
rainfall runoff with either intermittent duration, or as intermittent surface flow migrating across the landscape
at a frequency controlled by flow volume and timing. Ephemeral channels refer to those channels that flow in
response to rainfall events (going dry during protracted rainless periods when percolation depletes all flow
(Linsley, 1982). All channels within the project area have intermittent streamflow and some are occasionally
85

This approach is consistent with CFR § 220.4 (f) and the Council on Environmental Quality June 24, 2005
memorandum regarding analysis of past actions.

ephemeral. Along Ash Creek, channel condition varies from properly functioning condition where channels
are able to flood in unconfined reaches, to where reaches are confined and flooding remains within the
channel. Swamp Creek is not in a functioning condition. Ash Creek and Swamp Creek are intermittent
channels that may flow during 100 year recurrence interval runoff events to the McCloud River, although
downstream of the project area the channels are mostly dry during most years.

Water Quality
Water in the Ash Creek Watershed contains a naturally occurring high suspended sediment load from
upstream glacial outwash, mudflows, volcanic ash, and other sediment sources recruited from stream bank
erosion and flood events; these are responsible for the range of natural variability for a naturally high
sediment load in streams in this watershed. Road surface runoff observed entering streams during larger
rainfall and snowmelt events, adding fines to suspended sediment and streamflow, and comprise the sediment
entering the stream outside the range of natural variability. Water temperature and turbidity has been
measured at discrete locations in the Watershed during periods of base flow as well as before, during and after
storm events give some indication of the existing condition and range of variability.

Turbidity
Turbidity was measured during and after storm events, as well as during periods when equipment was
working in the channel, for culvert replacement or stream restoration. Turbidity measurements indicate the
presence of suspended sediment is greatest during storm events and declines sharply to background levels
soon afterwards. Turbidity increases and decreases rapidly with the onset and termination of disturbance in
the channel such as from storms, culvert replacement or stream restoration. Due to the ashy volcanic soils and
naturally high background sediment load in this area, this response characterizes the natural range of
variability of turbidity as it responds to a range of events, some large, episodic, and random. Soils are
moderately high to highly resilient to disturbance (See Soils Report Appendix B.) In general, turbidity
increases during periods of equipment activity and storms shows a recovery time to pre-disturbance as being
very short-lived, the water typically clears from equipment-work within a few hours or from storm events in a
few days in streams in the Ash Creek Watershed.

Water Temperature
Water temperature varies consistently with the seasons, warmer in the summer, cooler in the winter, but has
considerable fluctuation in daily temperatures during the summer months. Near stream, water-surface shading
from riparian vegetation, known to have the greatest effect on reducing and moderating water temperatures in
comparison to over-story shading, is absent along Ash Creek. Over-story shading from conifer is the dominant
shade source and also functions to shade-out riparian plants that would normally occur along the banks.

Riparian Area Processes and Functions
Riparian Vegetation
Sunlight is often limited within riparian areas where past harvest has occurred and natural regeneration of
conifer species develops dense stands in the project area. Sunlight reaches through the conifer forest in only a
few places between the uppermost reach of the project area and the crossing of Forest Road 19 upstream of
the project area in the watershed. These few sunny sites contain the greatest riparian plant numbers and
diversity with willow and alder forming dense pockets on large mid-stream gravel bars, and the channel has a
lower width/depth ratio and much higher degree of sinuosity than the other channel reaches. Here, deeper
water allows higher soil moisture and favorable conditions for riparian plant species.
The project area lies within the Bartle Grazing Allotment. The meadows and riparian areas attract livestock
and receive livestock use. Trailing is evident along both sides of Ash Creek. Livestock congregate along Ash
198

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Creek near the junction of U41N96A and U41N97A where the area is trampled and bare of vegetation from
livestock use. Cattle use patterns are managed through the grazing permit.

Floodplain and Meadow Processes and Functions
Floodplains and meadows are very limited within this watershed. They are characterized by finer sediment
deposited by floods, glacial loess and ash deposits.

Floodplain Inundation
Floodplain inundation occurs in reaches where the channels are not entrenched and streams can reach the
floodplain and overflow during large storms. Manmade features, such as old landings and unauthorized
routes, restrict flooding and concentrate energy on floodplains and meadows. (George, 2015). Past activity
obliterated some intermittent and ephemeral channels, diverted flow and interrupted riparian and floodplain
function. Along Ash Creek, these remnant features impede and confine flooding. Natural floodplain contours
are altered and eroded by old landing activities and modify hydrologic processes associated with stream and
floodplain interaction, such as retention of flood flow, groundwater storage and riparian plant community
establishment.

Water Table Elevation and Storage
Water table elevation and storage supports intermittent stream flow for both Ash Creek and Swamp Creek, but
manmade features reduce infiltration on the floodplain and meadows and increase runoff conditions that limit
ground water storage and flow duration. Areas without channel incision have likely retained most of their
original water table elevation and storage character within the meadow.

Riparian Habitat Connectivity
A 150-foot Riparian Reserve (RR) on each side of intermittent, non-fish-bearing Ash Creek and Swamp Creek
is established (per Forest Plan guidance utilizing a RR width established by a site potential tree height of 150
feet) (Forest Plan, 1995). All other intermittent channels in the project treatment units are have a 100 foot
buffer as they are characteristically inactive, responding only to 100 year flood events, but are recognized as
important connective features needing protection. During high flows the contribution of nutrients, woody
debris and sediment are assumed to be redistributed within the watershed as recognized as important functions
of intermittent systems by Reid (Reid, 1994). High flows allow plant communities to expand in the
downstream direction as seed and live plant material from upstream populations are redistributed
downstream. Instream structure in Ash Creek consequently supports aquatic habitat limited to macroinvertebrates. Swamp Creek does not contain aquatic organisms due to its very short and infrequent flow
duration. Channels without woody material lack structure to the bedform and often exhibit incision. Incision
creates entrenched channels that cannot reach the floodplain to disperse floodwater, sediment and erosive
energy. Aquatic organisms occur only in Ash Creek and are limited to macro-invertebrates. Terrestrial
organisms supplied by the abundant riparian vegetation upstream of the project, and the limited riparian
vegetation in the project area, are assumed to be a main food source to macro-invertebrates. Woody debris
embedded in the channel also functions as important habitat for aquatic invertebrates.

Key Issue - Watershed Health
The Ash Creek Watershed lies within an area that exhibits a low occurrence of surface erosion and mass
wasting with peak streamflow relatively low per unit area (Haskins, 1983). Topography varies dramatically in
this watershed; slopes are steep along the highest elevations near the summit of Mount Shasta and
surrounding volcanic outcrops, becoming intermediate to gentle around the alluvial fans where the Project is
located. The volcanic soils, low gradient drainages lack of landslide potential and low peak flows indicate the
Ash Creek Watershed has low sensitivity to disturbance (Haskins, 1983).

Sediment Transport and Erosion Rates
Ground disturbance from past silvicultural activities such as road-building, disking in plantations, windrow
construction, site preparation for planting, is evident throughout the project area but monitoring results
indicate little active erosion and sediment transport. In addition to forest system roads, unauthorized roads not
designed or maintained for use add to road surface runoff. Many of these roads are hydrologically connected,
capturing surface runoff that would otherwise infiltrate water into the ground, picking up fine sediment and
eroding the surface. Elevated road prisms may control flow by intercepting or damming upslope runoff while
low road prisms may pond water. All channels and ditches may activate during large events and flood road
areas. Road damage from runoff events and poor drainage can be seen on some unauthorized roads. With
inadequate road crossings and road alignment across fans, upstream of the project area, this has led to channel
realignment and shortening, concentration of flow down roads capturing runoff and developing channels.
Road culverts are designed to pass a 100-year recurrence interval size runoff event.

The Sub-Drainage Scale
This 15,900 acre area is composed of Sub-Drainages that intersect the project boundary. This represents the
acres from ongoing and past activities within the last 30 years within each Sub-Drainages. (George, 2015).
The current condition of the Sub-Drainages at monitoring sites indicates little erosion, sediment transport or
impediments to infiltration. Slopes are very low in activity areas and vegetation recovery is evident within
several seasons (George, 2015).

Equivalent Road Acre (ERA) at the Watershed Scale
From near the peak of Mount Shasta at 14,179 feet to about 4000 feet in elevation south of the McCloud
River, encompassing over 10,000 feet of elevation change this watershed has a 113,867 acre drainage area
where climate, topography and past and current management influence surface runoff and ground water.
Watershed and Sub-Drainage boundaries were identified from the Forest watershed GIS layer. A TOC was
developed for the Ash Creek Watershed during the forest planning process and is only used for comparison
between the existing and proposed activities at this scale.
The Ash Creek Watershed has been analyzed in the forest plan for sensitivity to disturbance and assigned a
TOC of 18%, indicating a watershed with low sensitivity to disturbance (Forest Plan, 1995). Using the most
readily available data for this watershed scale, the existing Ash Creek Watershed ERA is 8.3%, moderately
lower than the TOC of 18 % (USDA , 2009; USDA-FS, 2014c).

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Past activities in the Ash Creek Watershed include a range of activities on private and federal lands such as
timber harvest (hazardous fuels reductions, green tree retention, salvage and thinning), road and landing
construction, grazing and fuels. Road and stream interaction magnify runoff effects where several roads are in
close proximity to one another resulting in a deleterious effect to water quality as the greater road runoff has
more energy and picks up more sediment that is then delivered to the stream. Ash Creek interacts with road
runoff inputs during moderate events such as at the intersection of the Military Pass road (FR 41N19X) with
FR 41N09. Access along roads that intercept these channels may be disrupted and result in flood debris
accumulating on roads. Such conditions could occur almost anywhere in the project area but especially in the
following units and their associated roads: 171, 170, 150, 153, 154, 18, 155, 156-U, 346, 346-U, 224, 14, 218,
157, 347, 180, 107, 157, 162, 179, 401, 402, 110, 317 and 318.

Environmental Consequences
Alternative 1- Modified Proposed Action
Direct and Indirect Effects – Alternative 1
Water Quality
Turbidity
Water quality will benefit under this alternative from the elimination of a number of road interactions with
channels that currently divert or capture runoff, decommissioning of roads in Riparian Reserves that will
reduce sources of road water and sediment to channels and closing of roads that will be completed to
standards. Little to no sediment transported into Ash Creek, or other intermittent channels, is expected from
proposed activities, as ground disturbance will primarily occur on nearly flat slopes with a 20-foot buffer
equipment exclusion zone from the edge of the inner gorge of all channels. However, due to the
characteristically high natural background sediment load, changes in turbidity from these beneficial actions
will not be measurable.
All activities follow BMPs and additional RPM’s designed to avoid water quality impacts and additional
RPMs to ensure that water quality will remain falling within the range of natural variability for the area.
Decommissioning, and at some locations, recontouring, user-created roads in Elk Flat and old landings in
floodplains along Ash Creek will prevent future stream capture by roads.

Temperature
Riparian vegetative cover along the stream should increase by harvesting dense conifer and creating openings
for sunlight needed for growth. Although riparian growth along the channel will increase stream surface
shading, an overall negligible effect on water temperatures is expected due to the small scale of the treatment
area relative to the size of the watershed upstream that carries the most influence to stream temperature.

Riparian Area Processes and Functions
Riparian Vegetation
Long-term stand health is expected to increase throughout the project area as the benefits from
implementation are realized. Thinning forest stands in Riparian Reserves will have a short-term minor
disturbance. Thinning will favor both forest and riparian vegetation as the change from shaded to open forest
and openings will promote riparian growth with the increase in available sunlight. Thinning will also have a
noticeable, but temporary effect on ground temperatures, until understory vegetation grows in. With the
removal of over-story vegetation, the soil will be heated by direct solar exposure, but this effect will change to
less solar exposure as the understory vegetation recovers.
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

201

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

The rate of woody debris input will change from the undesirable current state of whole tree failure, causing
bank erosion and debris dams, to incremental input of woody debris as riparian vegetation stabilizes banks
and forest stands increase in health and vigor.
Indirect effects expected in the riparian areas include a proliferation in riparian vegetation sprouting, a
moderate increase in bank strength from riparian vegetation rooting, development of instream structure, such
as point bars, an increase in sediment detention and bank construction and increased floodplain interaction
with the channel. Collecting native seed, growing seed for out-planting and planting after disturbance from
ground-disturbing activity will also serve multiple benefits: promoting riparian plant community
development, stream bank strength, floodplain function wildlife habitat and appearance of a natural corridor.
Because the area is in an active cattle allotment and livestock graze within the project area and Riparian
Reserves, riparian plant community improvement will be influenced by livestock grazing as managed by the
grazing permit.
Long-term beneficial effects from an increase in floodplain interaction with streams, riparian vegetation and
improved bank strength to the plant communities, summer and winter thermal regulation within the riparian
reserve, nutrient filtering from properly functioning floodplains.

Floodplain and Meadow Processes and Functions
Floodplain Inundation
As natural contours are restored at old landings and meadows, near-stream flooding will resume and flood
energy will be dissipated on floodplains and meadow areas. Reconnection of floodplain to channels will
improve timing, variability and duration of floodplain inundation, water table elevation and storage.

Water Table Elevation and Storage
Removing manmade features and restoring natural contours will increase infiltration and
contributions to groundwater, raise water table elevation and increase water storage. Riparian
Habitat Connectivity
Recontouring old landings in riparian areas along Ash Creek will promote floodplain function and the
interaction of the channel to carry and distribute nutrients, woody debris and sediment allowing plant
communities to expand laterally and across the floodplain.

Key Issue - Watershed Health
Sediment Transport and Erosion Rates
Thinning and underburning that increase sunlight will favor the growth of riparian vegetation and sediment
detention during flooding, and will reduce sediment transport and erosion rates leading to improved
watershed health over the long term. Although these are incremental benefits, the increase in floodplain
function allows sediment to be detained and erosive energy to dissipate and will optimize conditions for
sediment detention processes. Increased riparian vegetation will increase stream bank stability leading to
decreased sediment and erosion rates over time in the project area adding to watershed health. At a watershed
scale, little measurable change to sediment transport rate from this project will result due to improvements to
road drainage and reduced road mileage.

The Sub-Drainage Scale
The existing ERA for seven Sub-Drainages that intersect the project area varies from 5% to 27% ground
disturbance (George, 2015). Results from the ERA analysis at the Sub-Drainage scale shows a general
increase in disturbance for six of the seven Sub-Drainages from the project, one Sub-Drainage drops to 0%
202

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

while the other Sub-Drainages increase up to nearly 40%. Due to the monitoring results that indicate that a
27% ERA remains resilient to disturbance in this area, additional activities at other locations from the project,
but within these resilient Sub-Drainages are expected to continue to be resilient to disturbance and respond
with similar recovery as the other activity areas. The low slopes and past evidence of little erosion, sediment
transport or impediments to infiltration from previous activities are used to determine that new activities,
some designed to improve ground surface conditions and return areas to properly functioning conditions, that
soil and vegetation will recover within several seasons (George, 2015).

Equivalent Road Area on a Watershed Scale
Existing Condition ERA for the watershed is 8.3%, Alternative 1 increases ERA by 0.7%, additional future
planned activities modeled for the watershed on public and non-public lands raises ERA by 1.3% totaling
10.3% ERA for the Ash Creek Watershed.

Effects relative to Purpose and Need for Action
Alternative 1 meets the project purpose and need by restoring riparian vegetation and floodplains in the
Riparian Reserves, and treating stands to improve resilience to disturbance. Timber harvest, vegetation
treatment, prescribed burning and floodplain restoration are proposed to attain the ACS objectives (Forest
Plan pp. 4.54, 4.56). Alternative 1 is expected to increase stand health, vigor and resilience to disturbance by
treating forest stand density through responsive harvest prescriptions and by reducing fuels. A modest
increase in acres of riparian plant communities is expected along Ash Creek, especially where vegetation
treatments will open the dense canopy to sunlight and improve conditions for riparian growth. As sites vary
along the stream and within the Riparian Reserve, other forest restoration activities will benefit stand densities
for shade and thermal regulation on stream terraces. Units with greater volume removed will require more
harvest equipment, skidding and heavy equipment use, although skidding patterns and distances to landings
are designed to minimize equipment use. Likewise, more landings will result in more ground disturbance. The
proposed stand thinning within the Ash Creek Riparian Reserve will serve multiple purposes: creating
openings, increasing sunlight, favoring diversity, health and vigor of riparian vegetation and regulating the
incremental input of woody debris to enhance instream aquatic bedform structure.

Effects relative to key issues
Effects to Watershed Health from activities to resource indicators listed in Table 59 are mostly short-term
disturbance to water-holding properties from site-specific treatments with little if any effects outside of the
treated units or project area as measured by the amount of equivalent road acre at the project, sub-drainage
and watershed scales.
Overall, minor direct effects such as slight displacement of surface soils, and minimal ground disturbance, are
expected to occur. No deleterious effects to resource indicators are expected from harvest activities. All acres
in Alternative 1 could receive under-burning as described in Chapter 2. Underburning will produce a mosaic
of fuel consumption on a relatively flat topography with little opportunity to influence stream runoff.
Underburning is allowed within all Riparian Reserves with the restriction that only 5% of embedded large
woody debris may experience burning over the project area. Evidence of prescribed fire and a mosaic of ash
and charring of wood and organic debris are expected.

Cumulative Effects – Alternative 1
In some areas, effects from past activities continue to this day, interrupting and relocating surface and
subsurface runoff, stream flow and floodplain interaction during large storm events. Incremental positive
watershed effects from treatment will:
•

increase floodplain and meadow function, infiltration and channel stability;

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

203

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

•

increase sunlight to understory vegetation;

•

reduce unauthorized route runoff and sedimentation to channels;

•

reduce the risk and increase resilience to disturbance from of high intensity fire and associated runoff
and sedimentation to channels;

•

return fire to the role of maintaining natural openings in Riparian Reserves and Elk Flat.

Effects vary by the number of entries; more entries will result in potentially more ground-disturbance than
fewer entries, such as harvest followed by machine piling and burning. Equipment thinning, machine piling
and burning are considered potentially high ground-disturbing activities from multiple entries of heavy
equipment followed by fuel treatments. Activities using tractors will result in initial low ground disturbance
from mechanical harvest and moderate ground disturbance from additional machine piling. However,
implementing BMPs and project resource protection measures will prevent water quality impacts and
maintain soil and watershed resources. Short-term disturbance to water-holding properties from site specific
treatment is expected, with little or no effects outside of the treated units or project area. An overall
improvement to watershed function from increased vegetative species diversity and vigor and improved
resilience to natural disturbance is expected to follow from this temporary disturbance.
Activities such as road maintenance and fuel treatments will improve watershed functions and processes over
that of roads and drainages in poor condition and high risk of stand replacing fires.
The Ash Creek Watershed has a TOC value of 18% ERA. The Existing Condition ERA for the watershed
(8.3%) is 46% of the TOC, Alternative 1 ERA (0.7%) is an additional 0.04% of the TOC, other future planned
activities modeled for the watershed ERA (1.3 %) is 0.07% of TOC; the existing and future activities on
public and non-public lands would be approximately 46.7% of TOC for the Ash Creek Watershed.

Alternative 2- No New Temporary Road Construction Other Than Those Required
for Landing Access
Alternative 2 is the same as Alternative 1 except that it does not meet the purpose and need of the project as
well as Alternative 1 by having slightly less benefits for some indicators: Water Quality, Water Table
Elevation, Channel Bank Stability, Floodplain Restoration, Woody Debris and Riparian Corridor Habitat
Conditions. Access to thinning units is necessary to meet ACS objectives and optimize stand objectives in all
areas; this reduction in proposed thinning does not meet the stand health objectives as well as Alternative 1
would.

Direct and Indirect Effects – Alternative 2
Access to some stands will be limited under Alternative 2. With no temporary road construction, some
portions of some units will not be treated and fewer landings would be needed. Less thinning and associated
ground disturbance may appear to be less of an effect; however, Alternative 2 ultimately does not address the
stand health issues that arise from not treating the stands and meeting the objectives identified in the project
purpose and need.
Riparian Reserve benefits are reduced under this alternative compared to Alternative 1 because the existing
access to Units 110 and 114 is insufficient, and would limit reaching 3.3 acres of Riparian Reserve treatment
areas. Similarly, there is insufficient access to 4.3 acres in Units 346 and 347, where recontouring old landings
in riparian areas to promote floodplain function and riparian habitat connectivity is proposed. Less treatment
within Riparian Reserves reduces benefits from increased exposure to sunlight, riparian growth, bank
stability, stand health and woody debris recruitment; Riparian Reserve stand objectives would not be
addressed without the use of a temporary road for these few acres.
204

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Effects relative to key issues
Without temporary roads, access to some units will lower the total road disturbance, and will slightly increase
ground disturbance over the unit area from increased skidding distance. However, because of the small unit
area, the net outcome would be no measurable effect to any resource indicators at the Watershed scale.

Cumulative Effects – Alternative 2
There would be no measureable cumulative effect from reducing 1 mile of road construction to the
measurement indicators from this alternative; therefore, this alternative would have approximately the same
cumulative effects as Alternative 1. The ERA remains the same as Alternative 1.

Alternative 3 - No Treatments of Natural Stands within Designated Critical Habitat
for the Northern Spotted Owl
Alternative 3 reduces the disturbed ground by 716 acres; 86 however, it also does not meet the purpose and
need for maintaining stand vigor and building resilience to disturbance through time as well as Alternative 1
in the LSR (see Chap. 3, Silviculture and Forest Health).

Direct and Indirect Effects – Alternative 3
No measurable direct or indirect effects are expected to resource indicators. Alternative 3 would reduce
approximately 31 acres of prescribed fire within the Ash Creek Riparian Reserve (in Units 150 and 171.)
Other Riparian Reserves (approximately 5 acres in Units 214 and 216) would also not receive prescribed fire.

Cumulative Effects – Alternative 3
Reducing the acreage of disturbed ground with Alternative 3 would result in no measureable difference in
measurement indicators; therefore, this alternative would have approximately the same cumulative effects as
Alternative 1.

Alternative 4 - No Action
With Alternative 4, the no action alternative, the proposed management activities would not be implemented.
No direct, indirect, or cumulative effects are expected. Although there would be no actions undertaken with
this alternative, ongoing trends would continue.
No action is expected to continue a trend towards high stand mortality and densities, even-aged stands,
excessive fuels and associated risk of uncharacteristic fire. Therefore, Alternative 4 does not meet and
prevents attainment of ACS objectives as restoration activity and unauthorized road decommissioning will not
occur.

Cumulative Effects
Since there are no direct or indirect effects with Alternative 4, there would be no cumulative effects. However,
current trends would continue. Any of these outcomes would be detrimental to meeting watershed and
Riparian Reserve objectives from the loss of hydrologic processes and functions at all scales. Alternative 4
would continue the lack of floodplain function from old landings within floodplains, unauthorized roads and
poor sunlight conditions for riparian plant growth.

Summary and Conclusions
86

This reduction is for underburning. Other ground-disturbing activities are reduced by lower amounts
depending on the activity, as described in the Chapter 2 summary tables for Alternative 3.

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

205

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

No impacts to aquatic systems would occur with any of the action alternatives.
Although Alternatives 2 and 3 do not optimize Riparian Reserve objectives, they still meet and do not prevent
attainment of ACS objectives. All alternatives except Alternative 4 meet and do not prevent attainment of
ACS objectives.

Watershed Scale
The Existing Condition ERA for the Ash Creek Watershed is at moderate risk for exceeding threshold (8.3%
of 18% ERA); Alternative 1, and other planned activities throughout the watershed on public and non-public
land would add 2% ERA resulting in a slight addition to the moderate risk of exceeding TOC (10.3 % out of
18%) TOC (George, 2015 p. Appdx. B).

Project Scale
A modest increase in acres of riparian plant communities is expected from all action alternatives.

Effects relative to Purpose and Need for Action
All action alternatives would meet Purpose and Need #5- Increase Streamflow, Raise Water Table Elevation
and Improve Water Quality and Vegetation Conditions within Riparian Reserves Associated with Elk Flat,
Ash and Swamp Creeks and Their Tributaries.
Alternative 2 does not meet the purpose and need of the project as well as Alternative 1 because although the
presumed benefit from less road runoff is expected, it is a slight reduction. There would be slightly less
benefit to the water table elevation, streamflow and vegetation as floodplain restoration of old landings would
not occur, however, no measurable difference in floodplain inundation or water table elevation would be
detected due to this small difference in lack of floodplain restoration. A slight reduction in the benefits to
natural flooding and riparian habitat connectivity would also result, as some riparian treatments would not
occur. The effects from reduction in temporary road would not be noticeable at the watershed scale.
There is little difference in effects from Alternative 3 compared to Alternative 1. However, Alternative 3
would limit the extent of prescribed burning as well as other treatments designed to improve vegetation
conditions; reduced acres of prescribed fire within the Riparian Reserve LSR acres would reduce the benefit
of removing excess fuel and lowering the risk of wildfire designed to promote resilient riparian vegetation
conditions.
All action alternatives would meet Purpose and Need #3-Restore Meadow Habitat in Elk Flat as it applies to
hydrologic function, to the same extent.

Effects relative to key issues
Machine piling for Alternative 1 would add 0.04% to the ERA existing condition, Alternative 2 and 3 ERA
results are the same 0.04% shows no difference at a watershed scale. Effects on watershed health from
machine piling under Alternative 1 compared to Alternative 2 or 3 are not detectable at a watershed scale.

Compliance with Law, Regulation and Policy (includes Forest Plan under NFMA)
All action alternatives (1, 2 and 3) meet and do not prevent attainment of the ACS objectives at the watershed
and project scales. The degree to which the action alternatives meet all 9 ACS objectives varies with how
well: a) Overstocked stands and fuels are reduced over the project area; b) How well treatment within riparian
reserves improves openings for sunlight for riparian vegetation; and c) How well floodplain processes and
functions are restored. See Appendix H (p. I-13) for a complete discussion of the project effects relative to
ACS objectives.
Analyzing for effects at the 2nd and 3rd watershed scales (using Sub-Drainages as a proxy for analysis) found
that all ground disturbance due to any of the action alternatives resulted in slightly ground disturbing effects.

Recovery would be at rates that would maintain properly functioning condition of the Sub-Drainage, and
there would be no excessive cumulative impacts on stream channel condition and water quality, rather stream
channel condition and water quality should improve above the existing condition.

Soils
A Soils Specialist Report (Rust, et al., 2015) was completed for this project and is incorporated by reference.
Information relevant to this decision is summarized here.

Introduction
Purpose and Need Applicable to Soils
Soils are the basic resource that support or directly influence most, if not all, other resources. This support is
through soil productivity (Forest Plan p. 3.75). As such, maintaining soil productivity would indirectly
support purpose and need statements #1 to #4. Purpose and Need #2, “Accelerate Development of LateSuccessional and Old Forest Characteristics”, particularly calls out an existing condition/desired condition
departure for soils in the windrowed plantations (see Existing Condition section starting p. 28). The loss of
soil productivity between the windrows directly affects site productivity and sustainability resulting in
retarded stand development.

Issues Applicable to Soils
Issues #2 and #5 apply to effects on soils (see pp. 44, 46).
•

Issue #2 – expresses the concern that road construction directly harms forest health and wildlife and
results in long-term impacts to soil health and productivity, pertains to the soils resource. This issue
applies to the Temporary roads that will be constructed to access landings, since no new FTS roads
are proposed to be constructed for the project.

•

Issue #5 – expresses the concern that machine piling has disproportionately harmful impacts on
watershed and soil resources.

The Environmental Consequences section discusses temporary road construction and machine piling effects
relative to the soils resource.

Methodology
Soils in the Elk project area were analyzed using several methods. Soils were reviewed using soil survey data,
data in GIS, and field reconnaissance along with monitoring information and best available science regarding
soils. Most of the units have been field reviewed by the soil scientist to verify mapping, identify areas where
soil productivity may be affected by proposed actions, and examine current disturbance on site. The effects of
each alternative on the soil resource have been assessed using the Region 5 Soil Quality Standards and the
Forest Plan. Soil quality analysis standards provide threshold values that indicate when changes in soil
properties and soil conditions would result in significant change or impairment of the productivity potential,
hydrologic function, or buffering capacity of the soil. Management activities have potential to cause various
types and degrees of disturbance. Soil disturbance is categorized into compaction, displacement, puddling,
churning, severe burning, and erosion.
Initial field surveys were conducted by a soil scientist in July 2009. Subsequently ,the National Soil
Disturbance Monitoring Protocol (NSDMP) (Page-Dumroese, et al., 2009) level one analysis (visual soil
disturbance indicators) and a level two analysis (validation sampling) using transects to measure erosion,

208

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

disturbance, compaction, displacement, and cover (Rust, 2011) were conducted. More information on
NSDMP can be found in the soil specialist report.

Assumptions
The soils analysis assumes the following:
•

Nonproductive Area - System roads, borrow pits, and utility corridors are a permanent commitment
of resources and are not counted as detrimental soil disturbance as they are not part of the productive
land base (Forest Plan pp. O-2).

•

Expected New Disturbance Levels from Silvicultural Treatments - Anticipated new disturbance
from ground based yarding, averages about 9% of an activity area; however, not all new disturbance
exceeds thresholds for detrimental soil disturbances. The current level of detrimental disturbance is
9% for the project area. Appendix C of the Soils Specialist Report and Rust (2013a) describes further
details on disturbance. Newer equipment, effective BMP’s and site specific resource protection
measures would be utilized.New disturbance would generally overlap old disturbance adding only
one to three percent cumulative detrimental soil compaction. Disturbance from tractor harvesting in
winter conditions would be less due to logging on snow or frozen ground. Monitoring following
winter harvest on the Shasta Trinity National Forest (Rust, 2013) showed a one to two percent
decrease in porosity over pre-harvest levels of two to four percent. Mastication of biomass material
accounts for an additional one percent.

•

Expected New Detrimental Levels from Fuels Treatments - Detrimental soil disturbances from
fuel treatments are estimated at an additional one percent for underburning; two percent for
mechanical slash piling and burning, negligible for hand piling for each unit (Rust, 2013b).

•

Erosion Potential - Erosion is predicted to remain low in all units and in all alternatives due to soils
that are deep to very deep, well drained and gentle slopes. The steepest slopes in the project area were
used in the erosion modeling.

•

Soil Recovery Rates - The effect of management on soil recovery is dependent on soil type, climate,
moisture, cover and time. By using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) typical recovery rates
can be developed that show for erosion, soils with 50 to 70% cover; recovery is in 3 to 5 years versus.
15 to 30 years for full soil function recovery (litter, duff, and topsoil disturbance recovery) see Table
62.

Soil Productivity
Soil productivity is described on page 4.25 and Appendix O of the Forest Plan. Surface organic matter and
soil porosity are used as the indicators of soil productivity most likely to be influenced by the project.

Surface Organic Matter
•

Litter and Duff –Litter and duff are the organic layers on top of mineral soil consisting of fallen
vegetative matter in various stages of decomposition. Litter includes woody material up to 3 inches in
diameter. The presence of living vegetation that could contribute significant annual litter fall to
compensate for conditions when immediate post disturbance litter and duff coverage is too thin or less
than 50 percent is counted in this assessment. Litter and duff are not measured in areas incapable of
producing the required litter and duff.

•

Large Woody Material – Residue left after advanced brown-rot decay is a brown, crumbly mass
composed largely of lignin, an important component in western forests. Since brown rot typically
affects only heart wood, large trees allowed to die and decompose naturally in the woods serve as an
important lignin source. Soil wood possesses one key characteristic that makes it important: the
ability to hold water. This high water-holding capacity provides: 1) Plant-available water, especially
during the driest months; 2) Excellent underground habitat for all types of soil biological activity, and;
3) Appropriate conditions that cause a hub of mycorrhizae fungi activity. Wood decay fungi
(mycorrhizae) contributes to: 1) Breaking down plant residues and recycling carbon to the soil or the
atmosphere; 2) Releasing mineral nutrients from plant residues and making the nutrients available to
living organisms, and; 3) Producing the physical character of the soil matrix. This decay by
mycorrhizae helps promote soil water infiltration rates, soil water-holding capacity, cation exchange
capacity, nutrient availability, nitrogen fixing activity, and other beneficial processes.
When in forested areas (in this project Elk Flat meadow would not be a forested area), desired large
woody material (also referred to as coarse woody debris) consists of logs in contact with soil. The
desired logs are at least 20 inches in diameter and at least 10 feet long in various stages of
decomposition.

Compaction – Soil Porosity
Soil porosity refers to the amount and character of void space within the soil. In a “typical” soil,
approximately 50 percent of the soil volume is void space. Pore space is lost primarily through mechanical
compaction. Three fundamental processes are negatively impacted by compromised soil pore space; gas
exchange, soil water infiltration rates, and water holding capacity. Soil oxygen is fundamental to all soil
biologic activity. Roots, soil fauna, and fungi all respire, using oxygen while releasing carbon dioxide. When
gas exchange is compromised, biologic activity is also compromised. Maintaining appropriate soil biologic
activity is important when considering long-term forest vitality. Severely compacted soils do not allow
appropriate water infiltration, leading to overland flow and associated erosion, sediment delivery, spring
flooding, and low summer flows.
The Forest Plan standard calls for at least 90% of the total porosity found under undisturbed or natural
conditions. Porosity is evaluated between 4 and 8 inches below the surface for soils with tress and shrub
potential, and between 0 and 4 inches for soils with herbaceous potential (Forest Plan, Appendix O).

Eorosion and Displacement –
•

Erosion Hazard Rating - The Erosion Hazard Rating (EHR) was developed to assess the potential
risk of a given soil to erode. The EHR system is designed to assess the relative risk of accelerated
sheet and rill erosion. This rating system is based on soil texture, depth, infiltration, rock fragments,
surface cover, slope, and climate. Erosion is generally low for the project area due to coarse soil
textures and gentle slopes. Appendix A of the Soils Specialist Report describes further details on EHR
calculations.

•

Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) Rating - The WEPP soil erosion model was developed
by an interagency group of scientists including the USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS),
Natural Resources Conservation Service, Forest Service, the Dept. of Interior’s Bureau of Land
Management and US Geological Survey. Scientists from these agencies throughout the United States
have been working since 1985 to develop this erosion prediction model to replace the Universal Soil
Loss Equation (USLE) for various land management activities (timber harvesting, roads, grazing, fuel
reduction, prescribed fire and wildfire).

Soil Resiliency
Soil resiliency is a soil’s ability to resist or recover a healthy state in response to destabilizing influences. The
index rating calculations looked at erosion, compaction, displacement, degradation by fire, puddling/churning,
and whole tree removal susceptibility. Appendix B of the Soils Specialist Report describes further details on
soil resiliency. For the Elk Project, litter and duff removal and recover is the major diving factor of the index
and how quickly the soils will recover.

Key Issue Indicators
Soil Quality Standards
Soil quality standard measure detrimental disturbance the acres pre and post project that would meet the SQS
as described in Appendix O of the Forest Plan for soil productivity, soil hydrologic function, soil moisture
regime and soil environmental health assess the projects impacts on soil health. Of these parameters, soil
productivity measured through the indicators listed above, is the primary measure that has potential for
effects. Natural processes such as climate, amount of rainfall, soil texture, geomorphology and time, influence
soil hydrologic function and soil moisture regime. Acres meeting soil quality standards pre and post project
will assess project effects on soil health.

Machine Piling and Temporary Road Construction
The acres and effects of machine piling and the pre and post piling effect on meeting soil quality standards,
and a discussion of temporary road use and construction, will also indicate project effects relating to the key
issues.

Boundaries
To determine relevant past, present, and foreseeable future projects, spatial and temporal boundaries must be
defined (CFR § 220.4 (f)). Spatial and temporal boundaries set the limits for selecting the actions most likely
to contribute to cumulative effects (FSH 1909.15, 15.2). The direct and indirect effects of the Elk project
relative to soil productivity including erosion (surface cover), and resiliency and conditions influencing
compaction [porosity], surface organic matter (litter and duff and large woody debris) (Forest Plan p. 4.25)

Spatial Bounding
Spatially, the conditions influencing soil productivity, resiliency and erosion in the project are potentially
ground disturbing or soil modifying activities, such as mechanical tree cutting, skidding and piling, and
prescribed burning.

Temporal Bounding
The temporal context being considered is activities 2-15 years into the future in non-windrowed areas and 230 years into the future for windrowed areas; 2-30 years is approximately how long proposed treatments
would affect soil erosion, compaction, organic matter, LWD, and resiliency as discussed in the assumptions
section).

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

The baseline year used for this analysis is the year 2015 as the existing condition. In this analysis, the
description of the existing condition includes the accumulation of past activities, which have influenced
vegetation. In the effects discussion, “short-term” refers to effects over the five year period from the time the
activity was accomplished. Beyond five, effects are considered “long-term.” The current environmental
conditions reflect the aggregate impact of all prior human actions and natural events that have affected the
environment, might contribute to cumulative effects, and are a proxy for the impacts of past actions. 87

Affected Environment
Existing Condition
The Elk Project is located in the Southern Cascades Ecological Section (M261Dg) of northern California.
This section is dominated by Pliocene volcanic basalt flows buried by Quaternary alluvium. Mass wasting and
fluvial erosion are the main geomorphic processes. This area is typified by nearly level glacial outwash
terraces and lava flows. Surface water exists within the project area in Ash Creek and Swamp Creek, which
flow intermittently throughout the year.
Soils within the project area have predominately formed in volcanic outwash terraces on timbered toe-slopes.
Soils formed in volcanic outwash are generally deep to very deep (40 to 60 inches) sandy loams to loamy
sands. Figure 17 shows the treatment units overlaid on general soil map units for the Elk Project indicating
most treatment units are located on Shasta and Germany soils, which are well drained loamy sands and sandy
loams. Germany family soils are deep volcanic sandy loam soil. Shasta family soils are a very deep volcanic
loamy sand soil.

87

This approach is consistent with CFR § 220.4 (f) and the Council on Environmental Quality June 24, 2005
memorandum regarding analysis of past actions.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Litter and Duff
Even where cover is naturally patchy, such as in woodland and shrub vegetation types, soil cover standards
are met (well exceeding 50%). Average observed depth of litter is and duff is 6 centimeters with total organics
ranging from 1 to 13 centimeters. The thinner litter and duff layers are located in the Elk Flat , this is likely
due to the area having high natural disturbance from the geomorphology (i.e. debris flow, flooding, fire etc.).
This area is predominately grasses and at this time is not capable of producing 50% litter and duff coverage,
due to this although the units have 45% and 20% coverage of litter and duff, they still fall within standards.
Most locations within the project area have a canopy cover of perennial, live vegetation, which serves as a
relatively continuous source of replenishment for soil organic matter.
Germany and Shasta soils have good soil fertility due to their depth and available water-holding capacities. In
general, most timber soils have low fertility and most nutrients are recycled from decomposing roots and
surface duff that gets incorporated into the soil. Since most roots are in the upper one to two feet of soil, it is
very important to protect topsoil from displacement and erosion.
Legacy monitoring (TEAMS 2009) indicate units 6, 12, 13, 14, 16, 110, and 208 (all plantations) have high
levels of soil displacement and low LWD counts due to relict windrowing practices of converting brush fields
to timber plantations. Additionally these plantations have truncated topsoil A horizons due to windrowing.
Soil displacement windrowing monitoring (Rust, 2012)compared windrowed trees to inter-bay trees to see if
surface duff and partial topsoil scalping from windrowing has affected soil productivity. In all cases when
topsoil was scalped from windrowing, the windrow trees benefited (more nutrients, moisture, and space) from
the topsoil and the inter-bay trees, suffered. These conditions occur on units 6 and 14. The loss of these
processes, due to windrowing has direct effect on site productivity and sustainability.

Large Woody Material
The soil wood in the Elk Project area is generally adequate, but was generally more common in units without
prior disturbance. Currently, LWD greater than 20 inches in diameter is sparse in plantations but for the rest of
the project levels are adequate (Rust, et al., 2015 p. Appdx. C).

Compaction-Soil Porosity
Skid trails are the longest lasting detrimental disturbance, where many machines travel over the same route
and compact the soil. Available water holding capacity is compromised as well by compaction since less
water infiltrates to be held for plant growth on many soil types. Decreases in soil porosity from machine
traffic may have some positive effect in that increasing the bulk density of these coarse textured soils (which
results in increased water holding capacity), may provide water for plant growth longer into the growing
season and promote increased tree growth (Gomez, et al., 2002). This has been observed in silvicultural site
productivity surveys on McCloud Flats that shows no net decreases in site indexes for sandy soil in areas that
were compacted (Flemming, 2010).
For the Elk Project, 51 percent is undisturbed (SD0), 34 percent is disturbed (SD1), and 15 percent is highly
disturbed (SD2 & 3) as topsoil displaced or in skid-trails. Legacy porosity levels for disturbed areas, is 4
percent decrease in porosity and for skid-trails is six percent decrease in porosity. Units 162, 164, 166 and
206, are over soil quality standard thresholds at or greater than 15 percent of the area, which require measures
to alleviate compaction in those areas. 88With resource protection measures that are planned with the
alternatives operations will not be adding to legacy levels, in some cases soil productivity will be increased.

88

The Forest Plan allows 20% in uneven-aged systems (Forest Plan p. 4.25j); however, 15% is used here as a
conservative approach.

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Data from monitoring of soil compaction in projects on the McCloud Flats 2001 to 2013 shows on average
across all soil types, current mechanical harvesting operations decrease porosity on skid-trails only by one to
three percent from pre-harvest levels due to better equipment, effective BMPs, use of existing skid-trails, and
site specific mitigations (Rust, 2013a). Total disturbance increased on an average of 12 to 15 percent using
new harvest methods but this disturbance was not detrimental. New harvest equipment is lighter on the
ground and has a bigger footprint. For volcanic soils on average, there is a three percent increase in
detrimental compaction on skid-trails between pre- and post- harvest with a nine percent larger “footprint”.

Erosion and Displacement - Soil Erosion Hazard Rating
Table 64 summarizes the current composite EHR by soil type. Bare soil refers to soil without cover, current
refers to current conditions before treatment, and treatment refers to soil cover after treatment. Soil cover is
canopy (tree, forbes, grass), litter, duff, and rocks greater ¾ inches.

Moderate ratings mean that accelerated erosion is likely to occur in most years and water quality impacts may occur, resource
protection may be applied in certain cases. High to very high EHR ratings mean that accelerated erosion is likely to occur in most years
and that erosion control measures should be evaluated.

Soil Resiliency
Table 65 summarizes the composite soil resiliency rating derived from Appendix B of the soil report.
Germany soils have a high resiliency rating which means the soil can withstand many destabilizing impacts
without decreasing its inherent productivity. Shasta soils have a moderate resiliency rating, which means
some of its soil properties are more sensitive to destabilizing impacts, and treatments need to consider these
factors with creation of soil protection measures to protect these soils from those impacts. The RPMS (see p.
83) and SOPs and BMPs (see pp. D-1, D-4) include soil resources protection for the project.

Key Issue Indicator
Soil Quality Standards
Currently, 3,336 acres in the project area (about 95%) meet SQS. Estimated acres of machine piling needed
based on fuel loading is approximately 944 acres. The maximum acreage, pending deadfall, approximates
1,461 acres. Of the acres to be machine piled 703 currently meet SQS. The acres that meet standards are
throughout the machine-piling units; however, units 162, 164, 166, and 206 have pre-existing skid trails are
increasing compaction and do not meet SQS on those compacted areas.

Unauthorized Routes
The existing condition relative to non FTS roads, or unauthorized routes, is described in detail in the
Transportation section (starting on p. 225). Unauthorized routes are areas of disturbed soil from past vehicle
use (and possibly current illegal motorized access).

Environmental Consequences
Alternative 1- Modified Proposed Action
Direct and Indirect Effects – Alternative 1
Surface Organic Matter
Surface organic matter may be influenced by the project. Biomass may be thinned through mastication.
Depending on the market conditions at the time of implementation, biomass material may be treated with a
combination of mechanical treatments (mastication), hand thinning or prescribed fire during the underburning
operations. Masticated biomass chipped material would remain on site. Chipped material on the ground can
decompose more rapidly. As decomposition increases, organic matter and nutrients are added more quickly to
the soil. Soil temperature can increase from canopy reduction but soil moisture increases from the soil cover
so decomposition rates will increase. With some soil incorporation of the masticated chips, decomposition
will be accelerated along with the release of carbon dioxide. Important soils nutrients will be released faster
(N, P, Ca, Mg, S etc.) and made for plant uptake and for increased microbial activity (Powers, 1983). Burning
after mastication will further reduce fuels on the ground. There will be a short term N increase and nutrient
release. Some wood may turn into char, which would increase water holding capacity. There will also be
needle cast from surrounding trees to provide cover for the soil where fire does burn current litter and duff.
Prescribing burning in Elk Flat will burn off the dead vegetation, invasive encroaching conifers, and releases
nutrients to the soil that are integral to plant growth which renews old decedent perennial grasses with
negligible detrimental soil impacts. Meadow grasses are unaffected along with the soil by these low intensity
fires as observed from the recent prescribed fire in Mud Creek Meadows in November 2013.
Underburning reduces surface slash and thins understory vegetation while releasing short-term nutrients for
tree growth. Prescribed fires burn at low intensity and create a mosaic burn that is beneficial to soil fertility so
long as they leave greater than 50% duff and fine litter. Moderate to high intensity underburns can destroy
litter, duff, and intermediate trees reducing cover to less than 50%. When, underburning in large.
Recent prescribed fire effectiveness monitoring (Rust, 2013c) was conducted on Shasta Lake Northwood’s
Community Protection Zone (CPZ) for prescribed fires of 2010, 2012, and 2013. Fuel treatments consisted of
pile burning and broadcast burning in transition conifer/brush from the forest boundary along Packers Bay to
O’Brien Mountain private homesteads. Northwood’s CPZ prescribed fires overall effect on the soil was
minimal and after 1 year vegetative recovery was excellent compared to fall burned areas. Fall burned sites
consumed most soil cover and duff, had loss of soil organic matter, and topsoil exposure was evident. Spring

burned sites had excellent cover, high levels of soil organic matter, and little loss of topsoil. In areas that
burned low to moderately-low (prescribed fires in the spring), soils had excellent cover, intact topsoil, good
organic matter, abundant seed source, adequate duff, and good structure showing how spring prescribed fire
treatments reduce fuel loading and soil burning. This is due to soil being moist below the duff layer protecting
critical soil organic matter and surface duff vs. fall burn when soil moisture conditions were dry (in spite of
duff being moist).
Severely burned soils can reduce soil fertility and decreased biologic activity. Loss of organic matter through
displacement decreases natural resiliency to disturbance, reduces nutrient cycling and availability, and all
benefits associated with aggregation (tilth, porosity, bulk density, root penetration, etc.). Prescribed fire can
increase available nitrogen for one to two years following fire (Choromanska, et al., 2002). Burning slash
piles can create extremely high temperatures in concentrated areas, leading to volatilization of nitrogen, and
loss of phosphorus and potassium (DeBano, 1991). If litter layers and organic matter are kept intact
throughout the stand, nutrient losses are minimized from burning slash. Limitations on pile size in the
machine piling units (see RPM 4 on p. 83) and low to moderate intensity prescribed fire resulting in a mosaic
of burn intensities as prescribed (also see RPMS 19, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30), will minimize nutrient losses.
Over all, with the protection measures in place and based on local observation for similar projects, surface
organic matter will be preserved adequately to meet or exceed forest plan standards by maintaining a post
implementation percent cover of litter and duff of approximately 60% and CWD of 5 to 35 tons per acre
Forest Plan standards depending on the location. See also RPMs 11, 24, 26, 27, 40, 41, and 42 and SOPS 5
and 17 in Appendix C.

Compaction-Soil Porosity
Thinning will cause some soil disturbance of displacement, compaction, and rutting but levels of detrimental
soil disturbance are generally low. Levels are moderate: less than 15% detrimental soil disturbance, 4 to 8%
decrease in soil porosity, and a 14 to 17% increase in areal disturbance, not exceeding soil quality standard
thresholds for erosion, compaction, churning, or displacement. For the adjacent Mudflow Project of 2012-3
soil disturbance was 42% undisturbed, 41% was light disturbance, and 17% was skid-trails with lightly
disturbed areas having an average of 2.6% decrease in soil porosity (a 1 to 2 percent decrease in porosity over
pre-harvest levels of 2 to 4 percent)and skid- trails having a 5.4% decrease in soil porosity. Given the above
data it shows mechanical timber harvesting moderately compacts sandy soils (3 to 5% decrease in porosity)
with a bigger footprint of soil disturbance (7 to 10% increase).
Research shows that moderate levels of compaction (less porosity) can be beneficial in sandy loam soils like
McCloud Flats (Gomez, et al., 2002). They found that sandy loam soils have large macro-pores were
compressed with moderate levels of compaction, available water holding capacity increased favoring tree
growth.
Thinning around legacy trees where all vegetation will be 50 foot radial removed causing a slight increase in
soil disturbance but still well below SQS thresholds. Similar impacts can be expected for aspen and oak
release treatments. Compaction can decrease water infiltration rates, leading to increased overland flow and
associated erosion causing sediment delivery to streams. Severe compaction decreases gas exchange, which in
turn degrades sub-surface biological activity and above-ground forest vitality.
With the for-mentioned information, units 162, 164, 166, and 206 have detrimental disturbance levels above
10 percent mostly in existing landings and skid trails. These units with loamy soils (Germany) are more easily
rutted and compacted especially during wet weather. The risk of exceeding standards are minimized by
reusing existing skid trails, only operating during dry weather or frozen soil conditions, minimizing the sizes
of landings, and rehabilitating sections of skid trails and landings. Mechanical harvesting operations only
increase compaction by two to four percent due to better operations, equipment, and soil resource protection
measures as shown by the Shasta-Trinity Monitoring. With the decompaction of units currently above
218

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

threshold, and the protection measures in place (SOPs for wet weather and following BMPs for soil
protection) the entire project area is expected to meet the soil porosity standard of at least 90% of the natural
porosity for the soil over at least 85% of the treatment unit.
(Soil effects specific to machine piling and temporary roads are discussed below in Effects Relative to Key
Issues.)

Soil Erosion and Displacement
Units 6, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 110, and 208 are ponderosa pine plantations with vary degrees of windrowing or
furrowing. Windrows will be redistributed in units 6 and 14 to increase soil productivity. Areas where
windrow spacing was less 60 feet (6, 12, 13, 14, 16, 110, and 208) tree height were less affected and DBH of
trees showed little difference between interbay versus windrow trees.
Windrow respreading method has been used in several locations on the Shasta Trinity National Forest and the
nearby Black Mountain Experimental Forest near the Elk Vegetation Management Project Area and has been
found to be effective in restoring soil productivity.
Slopes in within the Elk project are gently sloping and with proposed treatments the likelihood of erosion
occurring due to slopes are very low. The EHR post-implementation remains low. The WEPP model predicts
soil losses of approximately 0.23 tons/acre. A No Action proposed treatment predicts a soil loss of
approximately 0.12 tons/acre.

Soil Resiliency
Harvest and fuel operations that remove excessive biomass and site organic matter can affect nutrient cycling
(see Table 65. Soil Resiliency Index Rating). Nutrients are lost during harvesting by removing the stored
nutrients in trees, and additional nutrients are lost if the litter layer, duff, and woody debris is removed.
Whole-tree harvesting, as compared to conventional sawlog or thinning operations, extracts large amounts of
biomass and nutrients, especially nutrient-rich foliage, from the site (see Table 65. Soil Resiliency Index
Rating). The exact amount of nutrients lost from a particular site varies with forest types and particular site
conditions (Grier, et al., 1989). The amount of nutrients present in the trees also varies with stand age and
development of the humus layer (Grier, et al., 1989).
Data suggest that nutrient losses from whole-tree harvesting are greater when compared to conventional
sawlog harvesting for all nutrients. Calcium losses are particularly large for whole-tree harvesting due to the
high concentrations of calcium present in the wood fiber of twigs, branches, and boles (Adams, 1998) (Mann,
et al., 1988). There is a general agreement of researchers that multiple bole only harvests would not deplete
the soil of nutrients; however, multiple whole tree or biomass harvests have the potential to remove nutrients
at a rate that has a high probability of leading to soil productivity decline within a few tree rotations (Wells, et
al., 1979). The reduction in site nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and calcium combined with short rotations
(50-60 years) has a high probability of resulting in a measurable decline in site productivity (Miller, et al.,
1989). Using longer rotations (such as 100 to 150 years) and less site biomass removed, such as thinning
biomass prescriptions, the negative effects would be less.” Biomass thin “would remove approximately 2.9%
of the sites nitrogen compared to 8.8% removed from a total biomass harvest (Miller, et al., 1989).
Indirect effects of soil nutrient loss on timber include reduced growth, yield, increased susceptibility to
pathogens, such as root disease (Garrison, et al., 1998) (Garrison-Johnston, 2003)and insect infestation
(Garrison-Johnston, 2003) (Garrison-Johnston, et al., 2004). Precipitation (Stark, 1979) and weathering of
rocks would continue to make additional nutrients available on site, along with annual needle, leaf, and twig
fall, forbs, and shrub mortality would continue to recycle nutrients as well in most units.
Since the majority of treatments are thinning, nutrient recruitment by litter-fall would mitigate most nutrient
losses.

Effects relative to key issues
Soil Quality Standards
As noted above, operating when soils are dry or within the wet weather operations guidelines (see p. D-1),
along with keeping piles free of soil and operating on residual slash will minimize impacts. As described
above individually for organic matter, compaction, erosion and displacement, and resiliency, soil quality
standards would be met on the entire project area. The units that are current over thresholds for SQS will have
resource protection measures that will be followed in the Resource Protection Measure. In units currently over
thresholds for porosity, skid trails 200 feet out from landings would be subsoiled; porosity should increase,
improving soil productivity with progress towards meeting SQS (see RPM 14, p. 84). These resource
protection measures will at a minimum sustain legacy levels and alleviate pre-existing conditions.

Machine Piling
Machine-piling slash in units when soils are dry (or frozen), following the wet weather operations guide
(Appendix C SOPs), would not likely increase soil compaction in the meadow enhancement unit, but there is
a risk of displacement. Machine piling may increase compaction to the extent described above under
Compaction. Planned slash retention (5 to 35 tons/acre) would be in addition to duff and smaller surface
organics that would remain in the unit.
Machine piling earned a reputation as a harmful practice on soils in the past, from the era where machine
piling almost exclusively referred to site preparation for planting after a clearcut, and often occurring on
moderately steep slopes. 89 Impacts from tractor piling can be high if done improperly; it is estimated to add 2
percent detrimental soil disturbance as displacement to the activity units (Young, 2009). However, slash piling
as practiced in the past no longer occurs on National Forest lands since the mid-1990s. Mechanical operations
are limited to slopes less than 35%. Much smaller tractors equipped with a brush rake on the blade are used,
which result is little to no topsoil displacement or compaction that would be of any detrimental degree. 90 Piles
are to be “clean” (without soil), which helps them burn properly. Tractor piling often takes place in thinned
stands, so there is much less slash generated when compared to regenerated stands. Combined with whole tree
yarding, the overall results are much less slash material being moved into piles, and much less equipment
traffic on the soils compared to past practices.
Forest monitoring found machine pile and burning overall effects on the soil were minimal due to clean piles
that lacked displaced soil (Rust, 2013b). Fall burning consumed most of the slash, and had minimal loss of
soil organic matter and topsoil. Soil heating was 2 to 4 inches deep had high levels of soil organic matter,
roots, low to moderate levels of compaction. The areal extent of tractor piling is limited to slash
concentrations in much if not most of the areas that include machine piling. Some soil displacement may
occur associated with equipment operations but this should be limited in extent due to flat topography and the
spatially patchy distribution of activity generated slash. Slash (LWD) and litter/duff remaining on site will
provide for soil cover, erosion control, and provides a source of nutrient supply over time. If done properly,
machine piling is expected to meet soil quality standards.

89

Heavy slash accumulations were “straight-bladed” into piles, often also piling large amounts of topsoil into the piles
(sometimes purposely, to reduce re-growth of sprouting species as competition for planted trees). This practice was
eventually widely recognized as harmful to soil productivity, and one of a few practices that directly led to topsoil
displacement standards incorporated in national and regional soil management direction from 1991 to 1995.

90

The Forest has a long track record of working directly with equipment operators to achieve minimal soil displacement or
other soil impacts historically associated with this practice.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Temporary Road and Landing Actions
All developed roads (residence access, recreation, and vegetation management) built in the past have a lasting
effect on soil productivity due to compaction and displacement however, FTS roads are not part of the soil
resource.
Decommissioning approximately 6.4 miles of existing routes after use as temporary roads would improve
previously impacted road beds. Although rehabilitation through decompaction and/or recontouring cannot
restore the roadbed to natural conditions, rehabilitation efforts initiate a long-term recovery process.
Anticipated results would include improvements in hydrologic function.
The estimated construction and use of 2.9 miles of new temporary roads and landings will have a short-term
impact to the soil resource. The creation of the temporary roads and landing will slow infiltration rates and
could slow water flow patterns.
Proposed road maintenance of 17.9 miles includes culvert installation, blading, and brushing; with improved
drainage and decreases erosion from water channeling down the road surface. For detailed information on
roads, please see the transportation section (starting p. 225. While roads are not part of the soil resource, in the
short-term, road reconstruction may have a slight impact to soils, with increased sedimentation, displacement
of soil, or decreases infiltration. However, in the long-term road reconstruction will improve drainage,
decrease soil erosion, and improve water flow.

project underburning could have cumulative effects on soil productivity. Some nutrient recruitment by litterfall would address nutrient losses. Detrimental soil disturbances from underburning is estimated to add an
additional one percent (Rust, 2013c), which will still be within the soil quality standards, therefore the
cumulative effect will not result in detrimental soil disturbance.
The active Bartle allotment overlaps with the Elk Project. Impacts of grazing to soil are limited to areas where
the animals bed, lounge, trail, or access water. These areas are generally small in areal extent. Impacts include
compaction, removal of groundcover, and displacement. Grazing will continue in the foreseeable future on
these allotments. Generally, these small compacted areas are limited to the grassland portions of the project.

Alternative 2 – No New Temporary Road Construction Other Than Required for
Landing Access
Direct and Indirect Effects – Alternative 2
Under Alternative 2, there will be no temporary roads (other than to access landings) and therefore, slightly
less thinning activities (103 fewer unit acres) implemented to accomplish project goals in comparison to
Alternative 1. There would be a slight decrease in acreage of disturbance versus alternative 1 due to less
temporary roads (1.3 fewer miles) and landings (8 fewer landings of which none are new landings) and a
slight decrease in thinning of natural stands and plantations, and approximately 58 fewer acres of potential
machine piling.
No new adverse effects above Alternative 1 would likely result from this action Soil productivity and
hydrologic function would be maintained by incorporating soil protection measures.
Under this alternative, soil cover standards would likely continue to be met along with coarse woody debris
levels. As a result, EHR would likely remain low and soil nutrient cycles would be maintained. The predicted
WEPP would be 0.20 tons/acre
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Effects relative to key issues
This alternative would machine pile and burn an estimated 900 acres, and tree mortality pending, up to about
1,384 acres. New temporary road construction would drop from 2.9 miles in Alternative 1 to 1.6 miles in
Alternative 3. Effects would be similar to Alternative 1, except on fewer acres.

Cumulative Effects – Alternative 2
Cumulative effects will be similar to Alternative 1 and because of the lack of adverse effects; the forest is
likely to continue meeting the Forest Plan soil quality standards. By meeting soil quality standards, it is
expected that desired conditions pertaining to the soil resource would be achieved.

Alternative 3 - No Treatments of Natural Stands within Designated Critical Habitat
for the Northern Spotted Owl
Direct and Indirect Effects – Alternative 3
Under Alternative 3, there will be no treatment in Critical Habitat for NSO (with the exception of the
thinning/other mechanical treatments in plantation units 7, 12, 13, 14, 208, part of 15, and part of 6).
Therefore, there will be fewer acres of silvicultural treatment (270 fewer acres) implemented to accomplish
project goals. There would be a decrease in acreage of disturbance in comparison to alternative 1 due to
decrease in thinning of natural stands and fewer landings.
No new adverse effects above Alternative 1 would likely result from this action. Soil productivity and
hydrologic function would be maintained by incorporating soil protection measures.
Under this alternative, soil cover standards would likely continue to be met along with coarse woody debris
levels. As a result, erosion hazards would remain low and soil nutrient cycles would be maintained.

Effects relative to key issues
This alternative would machine pile and burn an estimated 879 acres, and tree mortality pending, up to about
1,363 acres. New temporary road construction would decrease from 2.9 miles in Alternative 1 to 1.5 miles in
Alternative 3. Effects would be similar to Alternative 1, except on fewer acres (and fewer acres than
Alternative 2).

Cumulative Effects – Alternative 3
The treatment for unit 401 is the same as Alternative 1. Because of the lack of adverse effects, the forest is
likely to continue meeting the Forest Plan soil quality standards. By meeting the soil quality standards, it is
expected that desired conditions pertaining to the soil resource would be achieved.

Alternative 4 - No Action
Under No Action, the proposed management activities would not be implemented. No direct, indirect, or
cumulative effects are expected. Although there would be no actions undertaken with this alternative, ongoing
trends would continue.
Under the no-action alternative, no silvicultural or fuel reduction treatments would be implemented. There
would be no new disturbance resulting from forest management activities, and existing disturbance would
persist. No new addition of detrimental compaction would occur and old skid trails would continue to recover
at natural rates. Freeze-thaw processes, weathering, and soil biota would work slowly to break up compaction
over time and vegetation would continue to re-establish on the existing infrastructure of trails. No new
adverse effects would likely result from this action but in some locations, productivity potential in the short
term may not be as high under this alternative as compared to the action alternatives because historic
222

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

disturbance would not be alleviated. Hydrologic function, such as soil drainage, would be maintained at
existing rates.
Under the no-action alternative, the forest canopy would not be altered and organic material covering the soil
would not be disturbed by management. Soil cover standards would likely continue to be met and the
litter/duff layer would likely continue to thicken and increase in continuity. Coarse woody debris levels would
also likely continue to increase. As a result, erosion hazards would likely remain low and soil nutrient cycles
would be maintained.
The probability of a high-severity fire within the project area during a given timeframe is unpredictable.
However, when a fire breaks out, the chances for high-severity fire effects on soils can be much higher in
untreated areas with excessively heavy fuel loads compared to those that have been treated, including postharvest logging slash (Certini, 2005), (Cram, et al., 2006), (Gorman, 2003), (Keane, et al., 2002).
A high-intensity wildfire would increase the potential for impacts to soils and soil productivity in severely
burned areas, especially since the risk of soil erosion increases proportionally with fire intensity (Megahan,
1990). Other effects would include the potential loss of organics, loss of nutrients, and reduced water
infiltration (Wells et al. 1979). Fires that create very high soil surface temperatures, particularly when soil
moisture content is low, almost completely destroy soil microbial populations, woody debris, and the
protective duff and litter layer over mineral soil (Hungerford, et al., 1991; Neary, et al., 2005). Nutrients
stored in the organic layer (such as potassium and nitrogen) can also be lost or reduced through volatilization
and as fly ash (DeBano, 1991; Amaranthus, et al., 1989).

Cumulative Effects
Since there are no direct or indirect effects with No Action Alternative 4 would result in no cumulative
effects. Because of the lack of adverse effects, the forest is likely to continue meeting, or making progress
toward Forest Plan soil quality standards. Not treating the project area could result in unknown effects on soil
productivity in the event of a wildfire.

Summary and Conclusions
Table 66 displays the differences among the alternatives in relation to soil productivity. Alternative 3 would
have the least impacts on soils followed by alternatives 1 and 2. All action alternatives will meet soil quality
standards in the Forest Plan.

Windrow Respreading

Surface Organic Matter
Retention of soil cover (litter and duff) is higher with Alternatives 2 and 3 over Alternative 1 due to less
harvesting, or no underburning in the case of some units under Alternative 3. With less harvest for
Alternatives 2 and 3, less soil displacement would occur.
Overall, the intensity of harvesting and fuel reduction activities for most units will minimize any adverse
effects on soil cover or nutrient cycling. Some units will be near soil quality standard thresholds and will
require the use of the resource protections to keep them below thresholds. The use of existing skid trails and
landings minimizes areal effects in addition to these previously disturbed acres. As a result, cover and organic
matter standards would be met. Soil protection standard operating procedures and RPMs and natural
processes will also address current shortfalls in coarse woody debris in some plantations through development
of increased large woody debris recruitment into the future through accelerated development.

Compaction-Soil Porosity
Reusing old skid trails, logging on dry soils or frozen soils in the meadow enhancement treatment unit, or
elsewhere in compliance with the wet weather operations guide in remaining units, will serve the project goals
of avoiding new detrimental disturbance and adverse cumulative effects. Decommissioning would focus on
major skid trails and landings, especially in units with high amounts of old harvest routes that have resulted in
relatively high levels of compaction. Less-traveled trails would be excluded since they are not expected to
have detrimental levels of compaction. Where compaction is above porosity standards, sub-soiling will
effectively relieve most of the compaction. Recommended sub-soiling would be 18 inches deep and only
occur on high traffic skid trails and on landings in units that are over soil quality standard thresholds. Where
skid trails would be sub-soiled there should be an adequate overstory that would encourage trees to seed in
post-harvest. Where only low to moderate compaction exists, leaving soils intact is more desirable. The net
effect is that the proposed management alternatives will not introduce any meaningful degree of new
compaction such that soil productivity would not be significantly reduced under any action alternative.

Soil Erosion and Displacement
Erosion modeling (WEPP and EHR methods) for all alternatives show low levels of erosion due to flat
landscapes and more than adequate soil cover remaining after treatment. Current levels of soil disturbance for
the Elk project on the average across all units is 15% (topsoil displacement or skid-trails) with 6% decrease in
soil porosity (less than 10% detrimental compaction threshold). Anticipated increase in soil disturbance due to
mechanical thinning is 10% with an additional 3% decrease in soil porosity.

224

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Alternative 4 (no treatment) would keep erosion low with, no new compaction or soil disturbance, but canopy
cover levels would increase to unhealthy levels that pose fire risks and increased outbreaks of diseases and
insects. In the event of a high intensity wildfire under these conditions, soils would be more likely to be
severely impacted than under the action alternatives.

Soil Resiliency
This area has a high level of productivity and recovery potential if soils are left intact. Soil resiliency index
(Table 65 and (Rust, et al., 2015 p. App. B)) shows that Germany soils have a high resiliency index where
Shasta soils have a moderately high resiliency index. These ratings show Elk project soils have the ability to
resist degradation from disturbance. The indications are that the sites have a very high growth potential based
on the field observations. The site potential, together with other soil indicators being met, leads to the
conclusion that the sites have a very high resiliency to soil disturbance, and it is not expected that soil
productivity would be adversely affected in the long-term.

Machine Piling
Anticipated increase in soil disturbance by mastication or underburning will be 1% and 2% and for machine
pile and burning 2% to 3% (Rust, et al., 2015 p. App. C). Units that are over soil quality standard thresholds
will be mitigated by subsoiling, windrow respreading, or woody debris retention. Alternative 3 has less
thinning units (270 acres), less machine piling, less underburning, and less mastication versus Alternative 1.
Alternative 2 also has slightly less thinning units, less machine piling, and less mastication than Alternative 1.

Effects relative to Purpose and Need for Action
By implementing the soil resource protection measures in chapter 2, and following standard operating
procedures described in Appendix C, all action alternatives in the Elk the project will meet or exceed the
Forest Plan soil quality standards, maintaining soil productivity in support of healthy forests. In particular, soil
productivity will be restored in the previously windrowed units that would be respreads, accelerating
development of late-successional characteristics to help meet Purpose and Need #2 in those units.
Unauthorized routes (6.4 miles) will be decommissioned allowing soil decompaction and return to a natural
condition.

Compliance with law, regulation and policy
There will be less than 15 percent of any unit in a non-productive state, adequate cover shall minimize
erosion, added slash and maintenance of the duff layer shall maintain soil biological process, soil fertility, and
ultimately soil productivity. Impacts to soil productivity will stay below thresholds and will therefore meet
provisions in the National Forest Management Act. Soil and slope will not be irreversibly damaged.

Transportation
Introduction
A transportation report (Bonivert, 2015) and a project travel analysis process (TAP) (Bonivert, 2015a) were
completed for this project and are incorporated by reference. Portions of the road analysis process completed
for the Pilgrim project overlap the Elk project area and that document is incorporated as well (Huhtala, 2005).
Information relevant to this decision is summarized here.
In addition to effects on the FTS, this analysis incorporates transportation-related features that are not part of
the FTS including the use of unauthorized routes as temporary roads and newly constructed temporary roads
and landings. Chapter 1 introduces the existing and desired condition relating to transportation. Appendix A,
starting on page B-39, describes site specific road actions including actions pertaining to the unauthorized
routes and newly constructed temporary roads. Table Appendix B-5 provides road actions by alternative and
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

225

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

road number and Table Appendix B-6 provides estimated temporary road needs by treatment unit. Chapter 2
provides summaries by Alternative (see Table 10, Table 15, and Table 20 for Alternatives 1, 2, and 3) and in
comparison form (see Table 25, p. 80).

Purpose and Need Applicable to Transportation
Purpose and Need #6, National Forest Transportation System (FTS) Management and Decommissioning of
Unauthorized Routes pertains to transportation. A need exists to increase FTS efficiency and provide access to
a dispersed recreation area in Elk Flat. The Transportation Analysis Process (TAP) completed for the project
recommends an approximately 0.10 miles of existing unauthorized route that is currently utilized as public
access to a dispersed recreation area in Elk Flat should be added to the FTS as an open level 2 road to provide
legal motorized access (Bonivert, 2015a). A need exists to remove several unauthorized routes in the project
area from the landscape for restoration to a more natural condition.

Issues Applicable to Transportation
Issue #2, expressing the concern that road construction directly harms forest health and wildlife and results in
long-term impacts to soil health and productivity, pertains to transportation. This issue applies to the
Temporary roads that will be constructed to access landings, since no new FTS roads are proposed to be
constructed for the project.

Methodology
Effects to the transportation system are determined by the existing conditions, the occurrence of past travel
management activities, the proposed actions and transportation specific assumptions. Effects to individual
roads, the transportation system in the project area and to a limited extent the Forest transportation system are
considered. Effects to individual roadways can vary depending on the maintenance level, site conditions,
traffic volumes, weather and extraordinary events. Field verification is conducted to review the effects of
comparable recent and past travel management activities to the activities of the proposed action.

Transportation Specific Assumptions
1. The roads used for the project will be maintained with the project. Road maintenance consists of
grading, resurfacing, culvert cleaning, hazard tree removal, snow plowing, clearing roadside brush
and slide removal.
2. Traffic volumes in the assessment area will largely remain the same, increase or decrease slightly to
meet resource demands.
3. Roads scheduled for maintenance level 1 will be closed to vehicular traffic.
4. State law regulating motor vehicle drivers sets the standard of care for the safety of themselves and
other users of the FTS.
5. Roads not shown on the Forest Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) are closed to vehicular access
regardless of field conditions.

Information Sources
The information used for this analysis was collected from 36 CFR 212, 36 CFR 220, FSM 7700, the Forest
Plan, site reconnaissance, relevant roads analyses, and consultation with other resource specialists. All
distance figures are approximate values based on the Forest Transportation atlas and INFRA database and are
limited to the accuracy of those sources, which includes measurements from GIS, GPS, field instruments and
aerial photography. Mileages have been updated throughout the planning process as better information has
been made available and may change slightly with additional field verification and project implementation.

Incomplete and Unavailable Information
Road maintenance beyond project implementation is dependent on Forest funding and may not occur every
year, however it is assumed that it will be conducted to a level and interval that a minimum will allow the
continued use of roads designated to be open. Unauthorized route use, the occurrence of cross country travel
and the purposes of these activities can only be speculated considering the evidence of a motorized vehicle
and known uses of areas, based on season and specialist experience. Landing locations and temporary road
alignments are determined by the implementation contractor with approval by the Forest Service, the
approximate locations used for analysis were determined by the location of past landing locations, specialist
consultation and specialist experience.

Discussion of Indicators and Measures
Public Safety - Road Conditions
Miles of Maintained Road and Miles of Reconstructed Road
Road maintenance, reconstruction and closures may improve road user conditions and safety in the project
area. Reconstruction will improve roads to current design and safety standards. Road maintenance will ensure
roads stay in appropriately safe conditions. Closure is part of the maintenance regime for ML-1 roads. Closed
roads are not maintained at a level suitable for safe motor vehicle travel. Open roads increase accessibility for
emergency response and may decrease response times.

Miles of Unauthorized Routes
Unauthorized routes are existing roads on the forest that are not open to vehicular traffic or managed as part
of the FTS. Prohibition of motorized travel of unauthorized routes and cross-country travel has been
established by Federal Regulation under the Forest’s Motorized Travel Management (MTM) Record of
Decision (ROD) (USDA-FS, 2010a).Unauthorized routes are not designated for vehicle travel on the MVUM
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

227

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

but may appear to be an open road. Without a barrier, these routes can be used unintentionally by uninformed
drivers. Unauthorized routes added to the system will be improved and/or maintained to FTS standards
designed to address safety concerns. Decommissioning unauthorized routes protects other resources and
prevents vehicles from leaving designated open roads and improves user conditions and safety in the project
area.

General Accessibility - Changes to Open FTS Road Density
Changes to the FTS may increase or decrease the amount of NFS land readily accessible by motorized
vehicle. Road access facilitates all activities on the forest to some degree, including roaded recreation, OHV
use, dispersed camping, hiking, hunting, and fuel wood collection. These activities may be enhanced or
reduced depending on the changes to the open road density.
Open road density only includes FTS roads that are open to vehicle use as designated on the Forest Motor
Vehicle Use Map (MVUM). There is no standard threshold for acceptable road density on the Forest, but a
road density of two to four miles per square mile is generally considered acceptable, with a preference for
lower road densities in LSR.

FTS Efficiency – Changes to FTS
Changes to the FTS may increase or decrease the amount of NFS land readily accessible for management
activities on the Forest. Road additions may increase management capabilities and maintenance costs.

Total FTS Road Density Changes (miles per square mile)
Total road density is a general measure of open and closed roads in the project area that are available for
future management activities. Future management activities may be more or less feasible depending upon
road access.

Changes to Road Maintenance Levels
Maintenance levels can indicate an approximate average cost of maintenance per mile in order to determine if
future management costs may be higher or lower with changes to the FTS. Roads closures are typically
included in a project for resource protection, cost-efficiency and to reduce open road density. Closed roads are
considered to be in intermittent service, with lower annual maintenance costs, to be made available for
resource management as needed and closed again. Public The Travel Management regulations at 36 CFR
212.54 provide for revision of designations as needed to meet changing conditions, including the potential to
add new routes.

FTS Efficiency – Temporary Road Construction, Landings and Skid Trails
The use of temporary roads facilitates management access in place of permanent system roads where off road
management access methods, such as log skidding, are limited. Temporary roads provide access to landings
and allow the landings to be farther from the FTS road to meet .25-mile log skidding limitations. Landings are
better suited away from the FTS roads and allow roads to remain open to the public during implementation.
Skidding logs farther than .25 miles can create a skid trail that is more damaging than a temporary road and
the farther a landing is from a FTS road, the more beneficial it is to have a temporary road. When comparing
the effects of skidding logs along the ground to conveying logs on a rubber tired log truck along a temporary
road, the use of a temporary road is preferred and required to meet Best Management Practices (listed starting
on p. D-4). Another consideration is that one log truck can carry the equivalent of several skidding trips,
reducing trips required for removal.

Key Issue Indicators

228

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Key Issue #2 indicator “b” is addressed above in total road density, and “c” is addressed in unauthorized
routes decommissioned.

Miles of New Temporary Road Construction
Temporary roads connect harvest areas and FTS roads to landings. Unauthorized routes are utilized when
available and can be used to protect resources. Key Issue #2 indicator “a” - miles of new temporary road
construction, compares alternatives in response to the Key Issue expressing concern for road construction.
(The project does not propose new FTS road construction).

Boundaries
To determine relevant past, present, and foreseeable future projects, spatial and temporal boundaries must be
defined (CFR § 220.4 (f)). For the effects analysis the direct and indirect effects of the Elk project relative to
transportation are conditions influencing road conditions and management designation.

Spatial Bounding
Spatially, the conditions influencing roads and management designation (e.g. user accessibility, drainage
functionality, road density) in the project affects the transportation system. As such, the spatial context being
considered is the project boundary. This is because this represents the approximate area potentially influenced
by effects from the proposed road actions and treatment activities.

Temporal Bounding
The temporal context being considered is activities five years into the future; five years is approximately how
long it is expected that the project activities and related traffic would affect road conditions and how long
proposed project related treatments would affect temporary road use.
The baseline year used for this analysis is 2014 for the existing condition. In this analysis, the description of
the existing condition includes the accumulation of past activities, which have influenced road conditions and
unauthorized routes. The current environmental conditions reflect the aggregate impact of all prior human
actions and natural events that have affected the environment and might contribute to cumulative effects and
are a proxy for the impacts of past actions. 91 Cumulative effects are discussed as changes in the existing
condition due to present and future activities, including the effects of the alternative being discussed.

Affected Environment
Existing Condition
The project area has a long history of timber management, including the site of a historic mill. Evidence of
past management activities include FTS Roads and unauthorized routes. Unauthorized routes are existing
roads on the forest that are not open to vehicular traffic or managed as part of the FTS. The existing FTS
provides access to old landing locations, plantations and adjacent private inholdings.
The FTS roads include approximately 4 miles of arterial roads and 11 miles of local roads that that receive
regular traffic and use. The FTS was developed over time to meet a variety of needs in the area including
timber management, fuel treatment, access to private inholdings, fire control, utility management, special uses
management, special forest products collection and recreation. Approximately eight miles of road in the
project area are under cost share agreements. The Pilgrim Creek Road (FA13) and the Military Pass Road

Public Safety - Road Conditions
Miles of Maintained Road
Road conditions in the project area are generally good with some isolated deteriorating areas and naturally
blocked segments. Past road maintenance activities in the project area have included project specific
maintenance activities, utility access, and commercial use maintenance. Higher road maintenance levels
(maintenance level-3 and -4) are in better condition, and require less annual maintenance, attributable to a
more durable road surfacing, such as asphalt or rock. Maintenance Level-2 roads can vary widely in condition
and surfacing and are intended only for high clearance vehicles. Typically, open FTS roads can be considered
to be in useable condition and safe for the intended use by a prudent driver. Roads that pass through the
Extensive Mortality Areas are considered unsafe to drive through although fallen trees on the roadway are
likely to discourage most users.

Miles of Unauthorized Routes
There are approximately 6.5 miles of unauthorized routes in the project area. Most of these routes appear to
have been created for management access at some point in the past or user created. Most of the unauthorized
routes are near a suitable condition for project use as a temporary road.

General Accessibility – Open FTS Road Density
The project area contains approximately 15 miles of open FTS roads with an approximate open road density
of 2.72 miles per square mile.

FTS Efficiency - Total FTS Road Density
The project area contains approximately 18.64 total miles of FTS roads with an approximate total road
density of 3.39 miles per square mile.

FTS Road Maintenance Levels
Refer to the table below for current miles of roads by maintenance level.

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Temporary roads, Landings and Skid Trails
Existing unauthorized routes may be used as temporary roads. Landings are not a part of the FTS, but are
features needed to transfer harvested materials for hauling. Currently the project area has approximately 67
landing locations evident from past activities. Some of these would be available for use under the action
alternatives; however, not all would be considered useable due to resource concerns or location. Size of
landings varies typically between ¼ and ¾ acres. Skid trails are not part of the FTS but where a landing
location is reused it is likely past skid trail locations may be discernable and reused.

Key Issue Indicators
Key Issue #2 indicator “b” is addressed in total road density in FTS efficiency above. Indicator “c” is
addressed in Public Safety UA routes above.

Environmental Consequences
Alternative 1- Modified Proposed Action
Direct Effects
Public Safety - Road Conditions
Miles of Maintained Road and Miles of Reconstructed Road
Project generated road maintenance will improve road conditions and roads used for the project should be in
optimal condition for their intended maintenance level. With approximately 18 miles of roads maintained over
the life of the project and 0.27 miles of reconstruction road conditions would be improved compared to the
existing condition.

Miles of Unauthorized Routes
Unauthorized routes, while previously closed via the MVUM only, would now be signed and/or physically
blocked, providing an engineered solution to prevent unauthorized and unintentional access. Additionally,
field conditions would more accurately reflect the MVUM, increasing MVUM reliability for navigation.
Miles of inventoried UA routes in the project area would drop from 6.5 to 0.

General Accessibility - Changes to Open FTS Road Density
Open road density in the project area will increase slightly, from 2.72 to 2.74 miles per square mile, with the
addition of 0.10 miles of road to the FTS within the Matrix allocation. A slight increase in road density
reflects an increase in general accessibility. Open road density in the LSR would remain the same.
Maintenance Level-1 roads needed for the project are currently closed. All 2.86 miles of currently closed ML1 roads would be opened for the project, and then closed again at completion resulting in no additional closed
FTS roads.

FTS Efficiency – Changes to FTS
Total FTS Road Density Changes (miles per square mimle)
Total road density would increase, from 3.39 miles per square mile to 3.41 miles per square mile, due to the
addition of 0.10 miles of road to the FTS in the matrix allocation. The density in LSR would remain the same.

Changes to Road Maintenance Levels
Maintenance Level 2 road mileage will increase from 10.63 to 10.73 miles in the project area. The change is
from the addition of the 0.10-mile segment at Elk Flat in the matrix allocation. No other FTS roads change

maintenance level. Cost efficiency will generally remain the same or increase insignificantly given the short
distance of the road addition.

Temporary Roads,Landings and Skid Trails
Alternative 1 requires an estimated 2.9 miles of new temporary road construction. Temporary roads would be
decommissioned at the close of the project and would not affect the FTS. As displayed in Table 10,
Alternative 1 makes use of approximately 38 existing landings and requires construction of approximately 40
new landings. Landings for the Elk project would be up to approximately ¾-acre each. All landings would be
decommissioned at the end of the project and do not affect the FTS.

Key Issue Indicators
Key Issue #2 indicator “a” is addressed in Temporary roads, landings and skid trails in FTS efficiency above.
Indicator “b” is addressed in total road density in FTS efficiency above Indicator “c” is addressed in Public
Safety UA routes above.

Indirect Effects
Public Safety - Road Conditions
Road conditions can change frequently with each season, especially when considering native surfaced roads.
Any open roads can generally be considered to be in useable condition and safe for the intended use. Roads
maintained for the project will be in good condition and can be considered to provide better conditions for
safe use compared to a road that has not been recently maintained. Overall, road user risk will decrease with
improved road conditions. Beyond road conditions, state law regulating motor vehicle drivers sets the
standard of care for the safety of themselves and other users of the FTS.

Miles of Unauthorized Routes
With approximately 6.4 miles of unauthorized routes blocked and decommissioned, unmanaged access will be
prevented over a large portion of the project area.

General Accessibility - Changes to Open FTS Road Density
The addition of .10 miles of road will increase access slightly. This may allow a slight increase of other
activities, such as recreational use and dispersed camping; however, this road was already used regularly as an
unauthorized route for these recreation activities.

FTS Efficiency – Changes to FTS
Total FTS Road Density Changes (miles per square mimle)
The slight increase in total road density has the same indirect effects as the changes in open road density since
the 0.10 mile increase is in a maintenance level 2 road.

Changes to Road Maintenance Levels
Annual maintenance costs will generally remain the same given the short distance of the road addition in
maintenance level 2.

Temporary Roads, Landings and Skid Trails
The new temporary road construction is unlikely to cause an indirect effect because they would be
decommissioned and blocked at the close of the project. Landings and skid trails would have no indirect
effect on the transportation system and are not part of the FTS.

addressed in Public Safety UA routes above.

Cumulative Effects – Alternative 1
Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Activities Relevant to Cumulative Effects Analysis
The Project cumulative effects worksheet was developed by ID Team inputs. Those projects relevant to
transportation were included in the cumulative effects analysis.
The direct and indirect effects of the proposed action when combined with past, present and reasonably
foreseeable activities will result in a more effective and better maintained transportation system throughout
the entire project boundary.
Road maintenance from past project activities and cost share maintenance has resulted in many miles of roads
that are currently in good condition. Ongoing and/or future activities that may influence transportation include
road maintenance, hazard tree abatement, road closures and other actions associated with previously approved
projects. Recently conducted transportation management actions in the project area include the
implementation of 3.12 miles of road closures from the Pilgrim Vegetation and Fuels management Project,
reducing open road density to the current condition. Approximately .22 miles of NFS roads were
decommissioned in the project area from the Pilgrim Vegetation and Fuels management Project. Recreational
use and transportation needs for the area may remain the same or increase slightly with population growth and
economic conditions. Resource management use of the transportation system can be expected to continue.
The Military Pass Road and Pilgrim Creek Road will remain an important arterial route to the Forest, the
public and the timber industry.
There are no other actions currently occurring or planned within the analysis area that contribute to or
appreciably contribute to the transportation system in the project area.
The direct and indirect effects of the proposed action when combined with past, present and reasonable
foreseeable activities will not significantly impact the Forest Transportation System.

Alternative 2- No New Temporary Road Construction Other Than Those Required
for Landing Access
Direct, Indirect, and Cumulative Effects
Direct and Indirect effects under Alternative 2 would be the same as Alternative 1 except for those effects of
new temporary road construction and decommissioning, and landing construction. Alternative 2 would
decrease new temporary road construction by 1.3 miles for a total of 1.6 miles of new temporary road, to
serve as landing access from the FTS road system. Temporary roads mileages are reduced in units 402, 152-1,
154, 18 and 163where the units were reduced. 6.4 miles of existing unauthorized routes would still be used as
temporary roads and decommissioned at the close of the project. Nine fewer landings would be needed (eight
fewer existing and one fewer new landing) than in Alternative 1. The effects would be the same but over this
correspondingly smaller footprint. Cumulative effects would be the same as Alternative 1.

Alternative 3 - No Treatments of Natural Stands within Designated Critical Habitat
for the Northern Spotted Owl
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects
Direct and indirect effects under Alternative 3 would be the same as Alternative 1 except for those effects of
new temporary road construction and decommissioning, landing construction, and 0.5 fewer miles of FTS
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

233

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

road maintenance. Alternative 3 would decrease new temporary road construction by 1.4 miles for a total of
1.5 miles of new temporary road, to serve as landing access from the FTS road system. All of the decrease is
in unit 402, meadow enhancement, because the units in NSO Critical Habitat, that drop out of this alternative,
are accessed by existing Unauthorized Route in Alternative 1, not new temporary roads. One mile of existing
unauthorized routes would still be used as temporary roads and decommissioned at the close of the project.
Sixteen fewer landings would be needed (9 fewer existing and 7 fewer new landings) than in Alternative 1.
The effects would be the same but over this correspondingly smaller footprint. Cumulative effects would be
the same as Alternative 1 except the 0.5 fewer miles would decrease beneficial cumulative effects very
slightly.

Alternative 4 - No Action
Under No Action, the proposed management activities would not be implemented. No direct, indirect, or
cumulative effects are expected. Although there would be no actions undertaken with this alternative, ongoing
trends would continue. The 44 landings currently in the project area would not be actively decommissioned.
Current management and ongoing activities, as permitted under NEPA may include road maintenance, hazard
tree felling, wood-cutting, and over-snow vehicle use associated with the Pilgrim Creek Snowmobile Park,
dispersed recreation (e.g., sightseeing, hunting), forest products collection and other permitted special uses.
No treatments or road actions would be implemented to accomplish the purpose and need and project resource
objectives. Road maintenance would likely only occur as funding allowed or as needed by cost share partners.

Summary and Conclusions
Table 69 summarizes the effects by alternative and resource and key issue indicator. All action alternatives
will include beneficial road management actions to meet purpose and need #6 and will not significantly
impact the Forest Transportation System. All action alternatives contribute to improved road conditions.
Alternative 1 involves the most new temporary road construction (2.9 miles compared to Alternatives 2 and 3,
at 1.6 and 1.5 miles).

Effects relative to Purpose and Need for Action
Under all action alternatives, the addition of the .10 mile road to access a dispersed recreation site near Elk
Flat will provide motorized access for recreational use. The decommissioning of over 6 miles of unauthorized
routes in the project area will inhibit unauthorized cross county travel and allow restoration to a more natural
condition. All action alternatives meet Purpose and Need #6. No Action would leave the dispersed recreation
site at Elk Flat without authorized access and leave 6.4 miles of unauthorized routes physically open.

Effects relative to key issues
Key Issue #2 indicators relative to transportation show the following by alternative:
a. Miles of new temporary road construction –
Alternative 1 has the most at 2.9 miles, followed by Alternatives 2 and 3 at 1.6 and 1.5 miles. The
additional 0.2 miles in Alternative 1 is all located in unit 402, meadow enhancement. Unit 402 is
partially in LSR and partially in Matrix.
b. Total open road density post-implementation in comparison to No Action – Increases slightly in all
alternatives due to addition of 0.1 miles in matrix area.
c. Miles of existing route decommissioning – All action alternatives decommission 6.4 miles.
No new NFS roads are proposed to be constructed for the project. Temporary roads will be decommissioned
and will have no effect on the FTS. Decommissioning will discourage unauthorized vehicular access, and the
temporary roads would revegetate. Alternative 1 would have 0.2 additional miles of new temporary road
construction and decommissioning over the other action alternatives; a difference that is limited to unit 402.

Other resource effects
All three action alternatives use existing and new landings. Alternative 1 uses the most, followed by
Alternative 3, then Alternative 2. All landings in each action alternative would be decommissioned. The no
action alternative would leave 44 existing landings.

Compliance with law, regulation and policy (includes Forest Plan under NFMA)
The transportation report provides a summary of the legal framework pertaining to transportation. The project
complies with all requirements and meets Forest plans forest-wide goal #8 to manage the Forests
Transportation system and goal #9 to provide and maintain administrative facilities (p.4.4)using applicable
standards and guidelines in the Forest plan (p.4.16).

Cultural Resources
A Cultural Resources Report (Schmidt, 2015) was completed for this project and is incorporated by reference.
Information relevant to this decision is summarized here.

Introduction
The purpose of the cultural resources analysis is to identify historic properties potentially affected by the
proposed project, assess the effects of the project, and seek ways to avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse
effects. For the purpose of this analysis, the term “historic properties” includes historic properties as defined
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

235

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

in 36CFR§800.16(l) as well as areas of Native American significance that may not otherwise meet the
definition for “historic properties.” Archaeological sites that are not eligible to the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) are not included as “historic properties.”

Purpose and Need Applicable to Cultural Resources
There are no Purpose and Needs identified specific to Cultural Resources.

Issues Applicable to Cultural Resources
There are no Key Issues relative to cultural resources.

Methodology
Identification of cultural resources was completed through background research, field survey, and Tribal
consultation. The effects of the project on cultural resources was determined through site visits,
Determinations of Eligibility, Tribal consultation, communication with other interested individuals and
groups, consultation with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), and the development of site-specific
resource protection measures designed to avoid adverse effects on historic properties. This analysis
summarizes the results.
Prior to the field survey, records and references were reviewed to determine the extent and quality of previous
archaeological surveys in the vicinity and the locations of known archaeological sites and other cultural
resources within or adjacent to the project boundary. Lidar imagery, historic maps, and other documentation
were reviewed to ensure cultural resources were sufficiently identified. Field survey was then conducted to
locate additional cultural resources that may not have been previously identified.
Once the cultural resources were identified, each site was visited to update the documentation, assess the
current condition, and determine the resource protection measures necessary for each site. All cultural
resources were visited to ensure documentation is updated and to complete Determinations of Eligibility to
further refine the list of historic properties that are eligible to or unevaluated for the NRHP.

Indicators and Measures
The following indicators were used to assess effects to historic properties:
1. Is the proposed project the type of activity that could affect historic properties, if such properties
were present?
2. Does this project have the potential to cause adverse effects on historic properties?
3. Can adverse direct or indirect effects to historic properties be avoided or minimized through
Resource Protection Measures?
4. Provided the Resource Protection Measures are implemented, will this project result in “no historic
properties affected;” “no adverse effect;” or an “adverse effect” to historic properties?

Boundaries
To determine relevant past, present, and foreseeable future projects, spatial and temporal boundaries must be
defined (CFR § 220.4 (f)). This is determined by how long, and how far reaching direct and indirect effects of
a project are felt on a given resource area.

Spatial Bounding
The cultural resources “Area of Potential Effects” (APE) is the geographic area within which the project may
directly or indirectly cause alterations in the character or use of historic properties, if any such properties
236

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

exist. The cultural resources APE for the Elk Flat LSR Enhancement project encompasses the locations of
project activities including mechanical cutting and hand thinning units, landings, roads identified for
maintenance, improvements, decommissioning, and closure, prescribed underburning and machine pile
burning locations, hazard tree abatement areas, areas of traditional or ceremonial use by Native Americans,
and other areas of Native American significance or concern. Historic properties adjacent to the project
boundary are included in the APE when they could potentially be affected by nearby project activities –
including effects from noise, smoke, dust, and setting changes.

Temporal Bounding
The temporal context being considered is the duration of project activities, which is projected to occur
until2021 for initial activities and every 5 to 10 years for two additional entries of underburning.
The baseline year used for the existing condition of this analysis is 2015. In this analysis, the description of
the existing condition includes the accumulation of past activities that may have affected historic properties,
The current environmental conditions reflect the aggregate impact of all prior human actions and natural
events that have affected the environment and might contribute to cumulative effects and are a proxy for the
impacts of past actions. 92

Field Results
No previously unrecorded sites were located during the field survey. One historic site is being evaluated for
eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and all six of the historic McCloud River
Lumber Company (MRLC) railroad grades are being assessed to determine whether they contribute to the
integrity of the historic MRLC district. Resource protection measures are designed in consultation with, and
during communication with Tribes and the SHPO to ensure that adverse effects to historic properties will be
avoided.

Tribal Coordination
In accordance with 36 CFR § 800.3(f) and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, Native
American consultation was conducted. A formal consultation letter was mailed to the Redding Rancheria on
2/22/2013. The Redding Rancheria did not respond. A formal consultation letter was mailed to the Pit River
Tribe on 2/22/2013. Additional consultation occurred with the Pit River Tribe at quarterly council meetings,
field trips, and other meetings with individual practitioners and cultural representatives (4/26/2005,
8/12/2009, 8/4/2010, 7/20/2012, 8/28/2012, 11/30/2011, 3/30/2012, 11/7/2012, 2/6/2013, 8/1/2013,
6/20/2014, 11/16/2015, 12/10/2015). A draft cultural resources report and effects analysis was sent to the Pit
River Tribe for consideration on12/3/2015. No response has been received. A scoping letter was mailed to the
Winnemem Wintu Tribe on 2/22/2013. Additional meetings took place with Winnemem cultural
representatives in the field and through email communication (7/26/2012, 9/13/2012, 3/20/2013, 4/19/2013,
4/4/2014, 4/8/2014). A draft cultural resources report and effects analysis was sent to the Winnemem Wintu
for consideration on 3/4/2014 and again on 6/4/2015. No response has been received.

Affected Environment
Historic Properties
There are two documented historic archaeological sites within the APE. One site is an historic saw mill
related to early railroad logging that is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and is
thus considered an historic property. One site might have been an early trapper’s cabin, but the cabin is
92

This approach is consistent with CFR § 220.4 (f) and the Council on Environmental Quality June 24, 2005
memorandum regarding analysis of past actions.

reduced to a decomposing pile of boards and the entire site has deteriorated to a point that the time of
construction, use, and function cannot be determined. This site is recommended ineligible to the NRHP and,
once concurrence is received, will therefore not be considered an historic property.
In addition to the above sites, there is an historic road (the original Military Pass Road, which does not
overlay the current road of the same name) extending through the APE that is eligible for the NRHP and thus
is considered an historic property. The APE also encompasses remnants of five historic railroad logging
grades utilized by the McCloud River Lumber Company (MRLC) that date to 1899-1905. The MRLC railroad
logging system is eligible to the NRHP, however, these railroad spurs are recommended as non-contributing
features because they don’t retain the physical evidence necessary to supplement the historic record during the
period of significance (1896 to 1930). There is no remaining physical evidence of the other two MRLC
railroad logging grades that historically extended through the APE. Non-contributing railroad features are not
considered historic properties.
There are two prehistoric lithic reduction sites in the APE. These have not been evaluated for the NRHP and
thus will be treated as historic properties.

Environmental Consequences
Alternatives-Alternatives 1, 2, and 3
Direct and Indirect Effects
An adverse direct or indirect effect would occur if the proposed project activities altered any of the
characteristics of an historic property that would qualify it for inclusion in the NRHP in a way that would
diminish the integrity of the property’s location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or
association (36 CFR § 800.5(a)(1)). Adverse effects to historic properties are outlined in 36 CFR § 800.5 and
include physical destruction of the property, alteration that is inconsistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s
Standard (36 CFR § 68), relocation of the property, changes in the character of the property’s use or physical
features, the introduction of visual, atmospheric, or audible elements that diminish the integrity of the
property’s significant historic features, neglect resulting in deterioration, or the transfer, lease, or sale out of
Federal ownership without adequate protections.
The proposed project consists of the types of treatment activities that have the potential to affect historic
properties unless there are resource protection measures in place. Specifically, physical damage or
destruction, changes in a property’s use or physical features, and visual, atmospheric, or audible intrusions
might result from activities associated with mechanical thinning, reforestation, underburning, and/or the
proposed road work. Design features consist of avoiding historic properties during treatment activities with
the exception of possibly removing fuels by hand from the edges of site boundaries. Resource Protection
Measures have been developed to provide site-specific protection from the range of proposed treatment
activities. Due to the design features and Resource Protection Measures, there will be no adverse direct or
indirect effects to historic properties.

Cumulative Effects Alternatives 1, 2, and 3
Although there may be other projects that spatially and temporally overlap the Area of Potential Effect for the
Elk Flat LSR Enhancement project, the lack of adverse direct and indirect effects means that there are also no
adverse cumulative effects to archaeological historic properties or areas of Native American cultural
importance.

Compliance with Law, Regulation and Policy
The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and Executive Order 11593 of May 15, 1971 require
stewardship, maintenance and preservation of cultural properties for future generations. The American Indian
238

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Religious Freedom Act of 1978 and Executive Order 13007 of May 24, 1996 require agencies to
accommodate access to and ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites by Indian religious practitioners and to
avoid adversely affecting the physical integrity of sacred sites. In consideration of the management and
protection measures identified for cultural resources located within the project APE, this project will have no
adverse effect on historic properties and will be in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act
(and 36 CFR Part 800), Executive Order 11593, The American Indian Religious Freedom Act, and Executive
Order 13007.

Forest Plan
As outlined in the Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, the identification, management and
protection of archaeological, historical, and religious sites is addressed in Forest Standards and Guidelines
and in Heritage Resource Management allocations (Prescription XI) where needed. This project complies
with the Forest Plan. Cultural resources were inventoried and evaluated, resource protection measures were
developed and adverse effects will be avoided during implementation.

36 CFR Part 800
As addressed in 36 CFR § 800.8, the Section 106 requirements of this project are being fulfilled in
coordination with the NEPA process.

Region 5 Programmatic Agreement
Resource Protection Measures were developed using Appendix E of the Programmatic Agreement Among the
U.S.D.A. Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region (Region 5), California State Historic Preservation Officer,
Nevada State Historic Preservation Officer, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation Regarding the
Processes for Compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act for Management of
Historic properties by the National Forests of the Pacific Southwest Region (R5 PA).

Alternative 4 - No Action
Direct and Indirect Effects
Under the No Action alternative, the proposed project activities would not be implemented. No direct or
indirect effects to cultural resources would be expected. Although there would be no actions undertaken with
this alternative, ongoing trends would continue.

Cumulative Effects
Since there are no direct or indirect effects expected with the No Action alternative, there would also be no
cumulative effects. Trends described under no action for Silviculture and Forest Health and Fire and Fuels
would continue.

Summary and Conclusions
Although the proposed project is comprised of the types of activities that have the potential to directly or
indirectly affect historic properties, the effects will be avoided through project design and the specific
resource protection measures described in Chapter 2 (“RPMs Common to All Action Alternatives”) and
Appendix C (“Standard Operating Procedures and Best Management Practices”). Provided these measures are
implemented, the project will result in no direct or indirect adverse effects to historic properties. (See RPMs
1and RPMs 2, and SOP numbers 3 and 4 pp.D-1-D-1).

Introduction
This section provides an assessment of the economic implications of the Elk project. An analysis of the
existing conditions provides a baseline for comparing the effects of the action alternatives. The Affected
Environment section presents the demographic, social and economic variables that describe the current state
of the economic and social environment. This is followed by the environmental consequences section which
estimates the actual impacts to local economic and social conditions.

Purpose and Need Applicable to Socio-Economics
The purpose and need statement that is related in part to socio-economics is the need to manage the Forest
Transportation System. Changes to the Forest Transportation System affect public access to Forest lands.

Methodology
Economic Effects Methodology
According to Forest Service Manual (FSM) 1970.62, the analysis should implement “techniques to develop
the most efficient combination of activities for each decision unit within each alternative.” Given the
information provided, financial efficiency measures are calculated in this analysis to provide a means of
comparing the economic feasibility across alternatives. The alternatives are analyzed and compared using the
Quicksilver program to estimate the Benefit-Cost ratios and the Present Net Values (PNVs). Quicksilver is a
financial analysis tool developed by the USDA Forest Service to generate measures of financial efficiency. A
5-year planning horizon is used in this analysis; activities would begin in fiscal year 2017 and end in fiscal
year 2021.

Economic Impact Analysis
Economic impact analysis looks at the effects of the project alternatives on employment and income in the
study area. The relative size of the local economy plays an important role in the assessment of impacts on jobs
and income. Broader and more diverse economies in larger communities are likely to be more resilient to
changes in jobs and income than smaller, more rural communities. For example, a change of 10 jobs in the
city of Redding (Shasta County, population ~91,000) would likely have very little impact on the overall health
of the local economy. However, that same change in jobs could have a much larger impact on the small town
of McCloud (Siskiyou County, population ~1,100).
Implementing a project can result in economic stimulus to a region, by changing the total level of jobs and
income in the area (logging companies, sawmills, biomass generation plants), increased demand for related
products and services, and indirectly affecting the spending habits from individual households due to
increased income.

Social Effects Methodology
Social Impact Analysis
The social impact analysis looks at the effects of the project action alternatives on public activities on the
Forest. The availability of the Forest for activities such as recreation, collecting forest products primarily for
personal use, foraging for food resources, and socializing is important to the local community for maintaining
residents’ lifestyles and honoring historic uses. The social impact analysis also looks at labor and employment
opportunities generated by the action alternatives.

Indicators and Measures
The indicators used for comparing the economic effects of the action alternatives are:

240

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Present Net Value - Present Net Value (PNV) is the standard criterion for deciding whether a project is
economically justifiable (OMB Circular A-94). PNV is a way of comparing all monetarily valued costs and
benefits. It is calculated by subtracting the discounted sum of total costs from the discounted sum of total
benefits. Benefits and costs occurring in the future are discounted back to represent their current value. A
Federally prescribed discount rate of 4% is used in this analysis (FSM 1971.21). A positive PNV means that
the discounted sum of benefits is greater than the discounted sum of costs, and vice versa. Due to the
uncertainty of future inflation, the inflation rate is left at zero for the analysis (OMB Circular A-4).
Benefit/Cost Ratio - The relationship between benefits and costs is further assessed with the benefit-cost
ratios. Benefit-cost ratio is the discounted sum of benefits divided by the discounted sum of costs. A ratio
greater than one suggests that the benefits associated with the project are greater than the costs. Benefit-cost
ratios do not allow an assessment of the aggregate value of benefits associated with a project alternative. The
alternative with the highest benefit-cost ratio has the highest value of benefits compared to the associated
costs, but does not necessarily have the greatest value of benefits at the aggregate level. Benefit-cost ratios are
often utilized in situations when a budget constraint is present (i.e. choose the alternative with the highest
ratio up to a certain level of total costs). PNV provides a better measure of the overall level of benefits and
costs since it reports the difference between benefits and costs at the aggregate level.
The indicator used for social effects is:
Access and Safety - Changes in Public Access and Relative Safety of the Access influences community use of
the forest. Changes are assessed in miles of legal public access in the project area, along with specific
locations accessed, and changes to current hazards along those access routes.

Boundaries
Spatial Bounding
The spatial area for analyzing the economic effects of the Elk project is the area encompassed by Siskiyou
and Shasta Counties. Other than contributing to jobs and income in processing facilities that may receive
materials from this project, the economic effects of the Elk project would be felt primarily in southern
Siskiyou and northern Shasta Counties. The social effects of community use are limited to the project area.

Temporal Bounding
The temporal bounding for analysis is the 5-year implementation period, because it is during this period that
the project would be affecting the local economy by providing jobs and income. Other present and reasonably
foreseeable natural resource extraction and restoration projects in southern Siskiyou/northern Shasta Counties
during this period will also provide jobs and income, and contribute to the local economy.

Affected Environment
Fundamental components of the economic and social environment for this analysis are population,
demographics, jobs and income, and local community uses of the Forest. Understanding the conditions and
trends of such variables allows for a more complete assessment of the social and economic dynamic as it
pertains to National Forest use. Population, age and racial distributions of Siskiyou County are important
socio-economic indicators for determining possible uses of forest resources by local residents.
This section highlights demographic trends in the analysis area. Population levels influence the use of natural
resources, while rate of growth indicates whether there may be the potential for increased pressures on those
resources in the future. Age distributions provide insights into the economic dynamic of the study area in
terms of assessing the proportion of individuals in the working age group versus retirees and minors who
typically have different use patterns on forests and utilize local services in different ways. Similarly, the racial
composition of the study area may affect the cultural and heritage uses of public lands, as well as having
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

241

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

implications for the Environmental Justice section below. Employment and income statistics describe the
economic conditions of the analysis area, as well as aid in the identification of important sectors of the
economy. The Elk project would likely affect various sectors in different ways. For example, increases in
recreational use would affect businesses in the recreation and tourism sector differently than businesses in the
logging sector.

Population and Demographics
Population is an important consideration in managing forest resources. In particular, population structure
(size, composition, density, etc.) and population dynamics (how the structure changes over time) are
“essential to describing the effects and consequences of forest management and planning on a social
environment” (Seesholtz, et al., 2004). This section highlights population trends in the analysis area. Growth
rates help predict what the population levels may be in the future. These numbers help to indicate whether
there is the potential for increased pressures for uses and recreational opportunities on the project area.
Population increases may lead to conflicts over forest uses, recreation activities, and values; these are
conflicts that Forest Service managers have to contend with and attempt to balance when making resource
management decisions.
The County has maintained a relatively stable population in recent years. The most noticeable change was
negative growth between 2008 and 2010. Several factors can lead to a decrease in population, however most
out-migrations occur due to a change in employment conditions.
Forest management may also influence population growth. Forests offer a wide range of recreational and
subsistence opportunities. Access to those opportunities could be a deciding factor in where people choose to
live. In addition, the production aspects of forest resources could draw labor to the area, and thus influence
local populations.
People moving to an area due to an increase in the demand for labor is referred to as job-led growth, and has
been common in areas where recent technological advancements have created more jobs than local
unemployment rates can support. This has not been the case in Siskiyou County in recent years.
Likewise, natural amenities have attracted people to live near forest boundaries in order to have easy access
for recreational purposes. Such changes in population are referred to as amenity lead growth, and have been
common in communities located near National Forest System lands. In prior years, the study area experienced
amenity led growth in the form of retirees relocating from more metropolitan areas, and people searching for
smaller communities in which to raise their families. However, that trend appears to have subsided due to
national economic conditions. When conditions improve, it is likely that Siskiyou County will once again
experience new population growth.
Age distributions also influence use of National Forests. Different age groups are likely to participate in
different natural resource based activities. The median age in each county is higher than the median age of the
state. This suggests that residents of the study area are older than residents in more metropolitan areas of
California. This could be due to a possible lack of adequate higher educational and job opportunities in the
area to draw a younger demographic.
Likewise, there may also be a greater influence from retirees. The economic structure of the communities
must evolve to meet the demands of its residents. In areas with a large retiree influence, this may mean
enhancing service based industries. However, given the current economic environment, it is unlikely that
major changes to infrastructure and services will occur near the project area.
The vast majority of local residents are Caucasian (white, 87.1%). As a whole, California is much more
ethnically diverse than Siskiyou County. California’s population is 59.8% Caucasian. Nearly 36% of
California’s population comes from a Hispanic origin, whereas in Siskiyou County it is only 7.6%. In general,
242

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

the Native American population has a much higher presence in the county than in the state as a whole; it is the
second most populous race in Siskiyou County at 3.9%.

Employment and Income
Employment and income statistics are important indicators of economic health. In recent years, the study area
has mirrored the national trend in higher unemployment following the 2008 financial crisis. Table 70 reports
the percent change in employment levels from the previous year over the period 2002 to 2010.

It is particularly important to consider the impact to employment in remote areas where jobs supported by the
affected resources may consist of a large portion of total employment. Such areas may not be as resilient to a
certain loss in jobs as a more metropolitan area. For example, a loss of 100 jobs in a certain sector in Siskiyou
County is likely to have a more devastating effect on the local economy than the same loss of jobs in a more
populated and economically diverse county, where the local economy is likely to be better positioned to
absorb the loss in employment in one sector with job opportunities in other sectors.
Retail trade, health and social services, and government support the largest percentage of jobs in Siskiyou
County. As the population continues to evolve there will likely be a transition in economic base. For example,
as the population ages and if more retirees move into the area, there will likely be an expansion in health and
social services. Overall natural resource based industries are not a major contributor to employment.
Agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting account for 6.6% of total jobs in Siskiyou County. However retail,
accommodation, food service and entertainment/recreation sectors total 23%. Retail, accommodation, food
service and entertainment/recreation are assumed to include National Forest related recreation and tourism at
least in part.
Another important indicator of economic health is the unemployment rate. Siskiyou County has consistently
maintained an unemployment rate near or greater than the state average in recent years. In the period 2002
through 2012, Siskiyou County has had a high presence of unemployment, consistently experiencing rates
above 8% since 2002. As jobs are created in a region, labor comes from two primary sources: local
unemployment and in-migration of households. With the higher unemployment rates in the analysis area, it is
likely that any new demands for labor would be supplied from the local labor market; assuming that qualified
individuals reside there. Thus, any additional jobs created by the Elk project would likely not affect household
migration patterns, and may serve to reduce unemployment rates.
Household income is another indicator of economic health. Income available to local residents directly
impacts their ability to purchase goods and services, including those related to activities taking place on
National Forests. Per capita personal income is $26,874 in Siskiyou County. Labor income remains the
primary source of income. Half of the total income in Siskiyou County is generated by transfer payments and
investments. Siskiyou County also has a high poverty rate, and it is likely that a high proportion of income is
derived from public assistance sources.

Local Community Use of the Forest
The Elk project area is approximately nine miles from the community of McCloud. Public comments and
anecdotal evidence indicate that local residents have a relationship with the National Forest that includes
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

243

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

recreational activities (dispersed camping, hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking, Off Highway Vehicle
(OHV and OSV) riding), use of forest products such as edible mushrooms (including boletes, morels and
chanterelles), edible plants (including strawberries, currents and gooseberries), game hunting, and fuelwood
gathering. The Bartle range cattle allotment overlays the project with about 10% of the allotment area within
the project area. The local Native American community also has a special relationship with certain areas
within and near the project area. Native American use of the project area is discussed in the Environmental
Justice section.
The existing Forest Transportation System roads and provide access to adjacent private inholdings,
recreational activities, and forest products. The project area contains approximately 19 miles of open Forest
Transportation System roads, including approximately 4 miles of arterial roads and 15 miles of local roads
that receive regular traffic and use. The Pilgrim Creek Snowmobile Park is just outside the project area on the
Pilgrim Creek Road, and groomed snowmobile trails pass through the project area. The area also contains
numerous unauthorized (user-created, not part of the Forest Transportation System) routes. While the routes
may be physically accessible by motor vehicle, they are not included on the motor vehicle use map and
therefor illegal for motorized use. Currently legal access to a dispersed recreation site on the edge of Elk Flat
is not provided on the MVUM, despite a long term use unauthorized route extending 1/10th of a mile to the
site. Additionally, many of the areas accessed by the transportation system are experiencing high levels of
mortality, creating higher than typical risk from falling snags. The roads most affected are mapped in the
Hazard Reduction treatment areas on the Alternative 1 map. The extensive mortality area in the vicinity of
206 has experienced extremely high mortality with corresponding increased hazard.

The action alternatives would involve a combination of commercial thinning and ecosystem restoration to
meet the purpose and need of the project. These activities would impact economic conditions in a variety of
ways. Direct and indirect effects on the economic environment are addressed through a quantitative
assessment of the financial and industrial components of the alternative. Financial efficiency and economic
impact analyses provide the basis for estimating the PNV of monetizable benefits and costs, and levels of jobs
and income contributed to the local economy.
The PNVs and benefit-cost ratios of the action alternatives are listed in Table 72. When discounted back to
today’s dollars, the monetary costs of the project for all the action alternatives are much greater than the
monetary benefits. Of the 3 action alternatives, Alternative 2 has the highest PNV, at -$1,956,841. Alternative
3 has the lowest PNV at -$2,057,097. Benefit/cost ratios are all less than one (0.71 to 0.75), confirming that
the monetary costs associated with the project are greater than the monetary benefits.
Table 72 displays the Present Net Value and the benefit/Cost ratios of the action alternatives.

Note that the PNVs and benefit/cost ratios only take into account benefits from the commercial timber harvest
element of the project. They do not take into account funding to accomplish the project that may come from
sources other than commercial timber harvest.
Only monetary benefits and costs are accounted for in the financial efficiency analysis. Values that are not
included are those that cannot be accurately measured through currency. Estimating the value of benefits and
costs not accounted for in the market place is outside the scope of this analysis. But these non-market benefits
may include improved ecosystem health, increase in wildlife, and reduced threat of wildfire, etc.; and the
costs may include reduced recreational values and scenic quality. Thus, the financial measures reported in this
document should be considered along with any other social and ecological impacts resulting from the
management activities.

Social Effects to Local Communities/Forest Use, Employment
Employment
In addition to the financial implications of these alternatives, management activities would require human
labor to be completed. This would affect the level of jobs and income in the study area. Jobs and income
would be generated directly from the industries performing the tasks, as well as indirectly from the interindustry purchasing habits and household expenditure patterns of the directly affected industries and
employees. All of the action alternatives would introduce new employment and income to the study area that
would not occur under the no-action alternative.

Forest Use
Decommissioning will reduce the number of miles unauthorized routes physically available for vehicular use
in the project area, and will reduce vehicular access to some areas used for recreational activities, forest
products/food collection, and hunting. However, it should be noted that the routes being decommissioned are
unauthorized routes that are not on the Forest MVUM. These roads are not legally open to vehicles, even if
they are physically accessible. While closing roads and routes will reduce the number of miles physically
accessible by vehicles, decommissioning unauthorized routes would not affect the number of miles of FTS
roads available for vehicular use. Maintenance level 1 FTS roads are currently closed consistent with the
storage management for ML-1 roads, will be reopened for the project, then closed once the project
implementation is complete. Closed roads would still be accessible for non-vehicular uses but not for
vehicular use. The addition of 0.10 miles of road in Matrix to the Forest Transportation System as a
maintenance level-2 road will ensure access to a portion of the project area to public users by vehicle; nonvehicular access would not be affected. The hazard reduction treatment along key roads as well as the
extensive mortality treatment will reduce, but not eliminate, risk from falling trees. These effects will be the
same across action alternatives, as the alternatives all propose the same number of miles of decommissioning
of unauthorized routes, and addition to the Forest Transportation System.
Portions of the project area will not be available for public use during implementation activities, for public
safety reasons, but will be available again once implementation is complete. Forest stand treatments may
temporarily affect habitat for edible mushrooms and other edible plants, and so could affect mushroom and
246

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

plant availability. However, with Resource Protection Measures in place to protect and/or improve habitat,
mushroom and plant availability and harvesting is not likely to be affected, long-term. Snowmobile trails may
be temporarily reduced to one lane if winter hauling is necessary.
The availability of game for hunting in the project area may be reduced during implementation activities due
to noise and other disturbances, as game is likely to move out of the area temporarily. Game for hunting
would still be available outside the areas undergoing treatment/disturbance, and would be expected return to
those areas after activities are complete.
The project would not interfere with management of the range allotment (Wenham, 2015). A marginal
increase in forage would be expected for 10 to 20 years. The nearest water trough is 2.5 miles from the project
area so the marginal increase in forage would constitute a slight increase in transitory forage, with range
condition and use remaining substantially the same in no action versus the action alternatives.

Effects relative to Purpose and Need for Action
There are no elements in the project purpose and need that are related to the economic or social environments,
other than the need to manage the National Forest Transportation System (addition of a portion of an
unauthorized route to the system to access a known dispersed camping area). All three action alternatives will
have the same effect of providing legal access for the dispersed recreation area.

Cumulative Effects
A “cumulative impact” is the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the
action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency
(Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such actions (40 CFR 1508.7).
Cumulative effects include the total change in economic conditions that would result from any of these
alternatives in conjunction with the direct and indirect effects of other present and reasonably foreseeable
natural resource related activities. Estimates of the impacts associated with other projects are not readily
available; however, on the margin, it is expected that they will support additional jobs and income in a similar
fashion to the Elk Project. In general, the cumulative effects area has low population density, a large
proportion of the population is in the working age group, and unemployment rates are higher than state
averages. Thus, new jobs would likely be filled by unemployed residents. This should contribute to reduced
unemployment rates and increased resident incomes. Cumulative effects should continue to positively
influence employment and income. Due to the higher unemployment rates, it is not expected that those effects
will change household migration patterns; therefore the population base should remain unaffected.
Other present, or foreseeable future projects on either Forest or private land are unlikely to affect public
access to the Elk project area. They will not affect habitat or the presence of mushrooms or edible plants in
the project area, although if other projects adversely affect the presence of mushrooms or edible plants or
habitat in their areas, it could have the cumulative effect of resulting in heavier foraging in the Elk project
area. Additionally other projects, while active, could increase the presence of game species of wildlife within
the Elk project area as game would be moving temporarily out of areas of disturbance.

Alternative 4 - No Action
Under this alternative no project activities would be carried out in the Elk project area. This alternative
provides a baseline by which all action alternatives are analyzed for environmental effects.

Direct and Indirect Effects
There would be no direct or indirect effects on the economic or social environments if no actions were to take
place. Any change in conditions would occur as a natural progression of social and economic activities and
would occur regardless of this decision.
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

247

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Cumulative Effects
Given that there are no measurable direct and indirect effects that would occur under the no action alternative,
there would also be no measurable cumulative effects.

Summary and Conclusions
All three action alternatives will have negative PNVs and benefit/cost ratios less than one. It is expected that
the monetary costs associated with the project will be greater than the monetary benefits. The project will
produce jobs and income for local residents, regardless of the action alternative. There may be minor
temporary effects to public access for recreation, forest products and food gathering, hunting, and social
activities. Treatments would reduce hazardous conditions along key roads in the project area. Legal access to
the dispersed recreation area on Elk Flat would be gained. Long term effects would be minimal or none.

Effects relative to Purpose and Need for Action
There are no elements in the project purpose and need that are related to the economic or social environments,
other than the need to manage the National Forest Transportation System (addition of a portion of an
unauthorized route to the system to access a known dispersed camping area). All three action alternatives will
have the same effect of providing legal access to the dispersed recreation site at Elk Flat.

Other Required Disclosures
Short-term Uses and Long-term Productivity
NEPA requires consideration of “the relationship between short-term uses of man’s environment and the
maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity” (40 CFR 1502.16). As declared by the Congress,
this includes using all practicable means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a
manner calculated to foster and promote the general welfare, to create and maintain conditions under which
man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of
present and future generations of Americans (NEPA Section 101).
Under the Multiple-Use Sustained Yield Act and the National Forest Management Action, all renewable
resources are to be managed in such a way that they are available for future generations. The harvesting of
timber can be considered a short-term use of a renewable resource. As a renewable resource, trees can be
reestablished and grown again if long-term soil productivity is maintained through application of resource
protection measures described in chapter 2 and the Standard Operating Procedures and Best Management
Practices in Appendix C.
Short-term use (two to five years during treatment operations) for the Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project
would remove forest products and generate revenue for the Federal and State government. Treatment
activities and resulting forest products would directly support jobs in the forest products and management
industry. Existing roads would be used to access the treatment units during the timeframe for treatments.
When treatments have been completed road use would return to the status quo on most roads.
There would be a short-term loss of soil productivity on areas dedicated to landings (up to approximately 58
acres for Alternative 1, 53 acres for Alternative 2, and 47 acres for Alternative 3.) Of these estimates, some of
these needs are provided by existing landings in the project area. Currently approximately 50 acres in landings
exist in the project area, some of which would be used in the action alternatives. Soil in all treatment units in
all action alternatives would meet Forest Plan soil quality standards with implementation, and less than 15
percent of any unit would be in a non-productive state. Soil productivity would be restored in the previously
windrowed units, and improved by decommissioning roads with residual soil compaction Decommissioned
roads would return to forest or grassland.

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Unavoidable Adverse Effects
Implementation of this project may result in some negative effects that are necessary to obtain the benefits of
reducing the risk of large-scale habitat loss from natural disturbances and stressors such as insects, disease,
wildfire and drought in the Elk Late-Successional Reserve and accelerating development of late-successional
and old-growth habitat characteristics in project-area stands. Implementation of any of the alternatives, or no
action, could cause adverse environmental effects that cannot be effectively mitigated or avoided.
Unavoidable adverse impacts often result from managing the land for one resource at the expense or condition
of other resources. Some adverse effects are short-term and necessary to achieve long-term beneficial effects.
The application of Forest Plan standards and guidelines, RPMs, SOPs, and BMPs are intended to limit the
extent, severity and duration of potential impacts.
While adverse effects of the action alternatives fall within Forest Plan standards and comply with the
regulatory framework, some may view these losses as an adverse impact to the environment. Adverse effects
are discussed in detail by resource throughout chapter 3. Conversely, taking no action at this time would leave
stands susceptible to continued large scale disturbance that could threaten existing and developing latesuccessional habitat. Under no action, forest stands are less likely to develop into desirable late-successional
habitat conditions, due to overcrowding and increasing areas of root disease and insect activity.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments of Resources
Irreversible commitments of resources are those that cannot be regained, such as the extinction of a species or
the removal of mined ore. Irreversible commitments of resources are permanent losses of non-renewable
resources.
Irretrievable commitments of resources are temporary losses of renewable resources. Irretrievable
commitments are those that are lost for a period, such as the temporary loss of timber productivity in forested
areas that are kept clear for use as power line rights-of-way or road access.
With implementation of this project, there are no irreversible commitments of forest resources. The
irretrievable commitment of resources for the action alternatives include:
•

The temporary loss of productive forest lands from creation of landings (Alternatives 1,
approximately 58 acres; Alternative 2, 53 acres; Alternative 3, 47 acres), skid trails, and temporary
road uses (of existing unauthorized routes) or construction (Alternatives 1, approximately 8.6 miles;
Alternative 2, 8.3miles; Alternative 3, 6.2 miles), constitutes an irretrievable commitment of resources
for the action alternatives. Productivity is expected to return upon decommissioning and revegetation.

•

Boletus habitat in Elk Flat meadow will be reduced in favor of returning natural processes that
produce and maintain the unique dry meadow habitat.

•

A temporary reduction in the quantity and quality of northern spotted owl foraging habitat designated
as critical habitat (PCE 3) will occur under Alternatives 1 and 2 and is an irretrievable commitment of
resources. There will be no reduction of nesting/roosting habitat treated by any alternative, and no
treatments or effects will occur within suitable habitat designated as critical habitat under Alternative
3.

•

PCE 3 will be degraded (habitat quality reduced) on approximately 224 acres, and will be
downgraded to dispersal habitat (PCE 4) on approximately 46 acres under Alternative 1. Under
Alternative 2, these same effects will occur. While individual elements of PCE 1, PCE 2, PCE 3 and
PCE 4 will be removed or affected by project treatments, the overall habitat function in the affected
stands will not be removed. The treatments will affect less than one percent of the ECS-3 Critical

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

249

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Habitat Subunit and are considered discountable in terms of reducing the overall intended function of
this Critical Habitat Subunit.
Degraded Habitat - The temporary change in the quality but not function, of PCE3 would last for
approximately 5 to 20 years, depending on treatment location and type. Degraded foraging habitat
still functions at the pre-treatment habitat level since primary habitat elements of at least 40 percent
canopy cover, abundant down logs, abundant large snags, multi-layering, vertical and horizontal
structure, and other important habitat elements such as roosting structure, thermal refugia, shrubs and
openings for dusky-footed wood rat and other prey base are maintained in the post-treatment
condition. Degraded habitat generally returns to its pre-treatment quality levels over a 20-year
timeframe as the remaining trees grow larger and canopy levels reach and exceed 60+ percent, and
the mid- and understory continues to develop. These time estimates are barring any events such as
epidemic insect or disease outbreaks, or uncharacteristic stand replacing fires that can reset the seral
stage in a stand, or part of a stand.
Downgraded Habitat – The temporary reduction in the quality of PCE 3 would last for approximately
10 to 30 years. Downgraded foraging habitat is generally considered dispersal habitat post-treatment
due to the reduction of overall canopy closure, or the removal or significant reductions in understory
and midstory layering when combined with a significant removal or loss of large snags or large down
wood. Downgraded habitat usually returns to pre-treatment levels within 10 to 30 years, and the
timespan for recovery is usually dependent on the treatment causing the downgrade. Where 27 acres
of foraging habitat (PCE 3) are downgraded to dispersal habitat (PCE 4) through thinning and
California black oak release, the stand is expected to continue to provide some foraging opportunities
for NSO. Canopy closure and cover will be below the 40 percent level and the average basal area will
range from 60-120 sq ft/acre, on average. Follow-up underburning will incrementally reduce the
remaining under- and mid-story trees, and some down wood and snags, over the 30-year time period
for the three prescribed fire re-entries. While there will be patches of dense roosting sites, oaks that
are not released, large and small trees, and snags and down wood in the post-treatment condition,
these conditions do not provide enough residual habitat to consider the 27-acre area as ‘foraging’
habitat post-treatment. In this case, while the short- and long-term benefits of providing an increase in
hardwood diversity, improved hardwood condition and increased prey base are all considered
beneficial, the treatment is a ‘temporary’ loss of foraging habitat function and quality and PCE3
elements on these 27 acres. Radial thinning around predominant pine may also downgrade PCE3 to
PCE4 up to 19 acres scattered across an approximate 37-acre treatment area (based on the
prescription of releasing up to two legacy trees per acre, as available). As this treatment generally
removes all smaller diameter trees within a 50-foot radius of the bole, except for other predominant
legacy trees of any species or large diameter snags, numerous 0.25-0.30 acre size gaps will be spread
across the treatment area where little to no understory or midstory vegetation remains. The effects of
this treatment are expected to last for 20-30 years and while the radial release treatment will also
provide residual foraging opportunities, the habitat condition in these patches will be considered
dispersal in combination with the other thinning and underburning treatments.

A potential loss of habitat elements from new landing construction, existing landing enlargement or
temporary road construction for these landings will occur on approximately 4.25 and 8.75 acres of
PCE1 and PCE3 under all action Alternatives, and this constitutes an irretrievable commitment of
resources. The loss and reduction of habitat would be distributed throughout the portion of the project
area in critical habitat both spatially and temporally (i.e., not all landings or temporary roads would be
constructed and used at the same time). The project's design and applicable resource protection
measures will assure that existing landings within the project area are used to the extent feasible.

Energy and Natural or Depletable Resource Requirements and Conservation
Potential
Consumption of fossil fuels would occur with the action alternatives during treatment activities and timber
hauling as well as road and fuel treatment actions. There are no unusual energy requirements associated with
the action alternatives nor is it the type of proposal that provides an opportunity to conserve energy at a large
scale. Wood is a renewable resource. With the proper application of Forest Plan standards and guidelines and
resource protection measures described in Chapter 2 for soils, water, wildlife, forest vegetation and other
resources, the project would conserve resources.

Urban quality, historic and cultural resources and the built environment
Historic and cultural resources will be protected (flagged and avoided), as described in chapter 3, Cultural
Resources and in the RPMs and SOPs (Appendix C). There would be no changes to urban quality or the built
environment with this project.

Incomplete or Unavailable Information
Incomplete or unavailable information is discussed in the methodology of each resource report in the project
record incorporated by reference or described elsewhere in this document if pertinent to the individual effects
analyses. In general, much of the Forest resource data resides in an electronic database formatted for a
geographic information system (GIS). The Forest uses GIS software to analyze this data. GIS data is available
in tabular (numerical) format and as plots displaying data in map format. Knowledge about many of the
relationships and conditions of wildlife, hydrology, forests, jobs and communities is evolving as research
continues. The ecology, inventory, and management of a large forest area is a complex and ever-developing
science. However, the basic data and central relationships are sufficiently established in the respective
sciences in order for the deciding official to make a reasoned decision to select an alternative and to
adequately assess and disclose the possible adverse environmental consequences. Given the uncertainty of
any modeling exercise, the results are best used to compare the relative effects of the alternatives, rather than
as an indicator of absolute effects.

Compliance and Consistency
Appendix H – Compliance and Consistency, provides detail discussion of compliance and consistency under
law, regulation, executive order, agreement, and key policies (The legal and policy framework). Forest Plan
consistency not previously provided is detailed under the National Forest Management Act (NFMA) starting
on page I-12. The Project is consistent with the Forest Plan and all applicable legal and policy framework.

Consultation
Section 7 of the ESA

Appendix AThe species list for the Biological Assessment for the Elk
Project, using the legal requirements set forth under Section 7 of the
Endangered Species Act and Forest Service Manual direction (FSM
2672.42), was obtained from the FWS Information for Planning and
Conservation (IPaC) website on December 22, 2015 (included in s
Consultation
Appendix E – Threatened and Endangered Species Consultation Record). Between August 2009 and present, the
Forest has been intermittently consulting with the FWS on this project. Streamlined consultation was initiated in
December 2011 and Jordan and FWS wildlife biologists David Topolewski, Katherine Fitzgerald and Chad Anderson
have consulted on the project’s preferred alternative and anticipated effects since that time. Jordan presented a draft
Project Initiation Form to the FWS, Yreka Office on December 1, 2011, and a final Project Initiation Form was
presented on March 21, 2013. On January 6, 2016, the Shasta-McCloud Management Unit submitted the draft
Biological Assessment to the FWS. A formal request for consultation will be made when the Forest and the FWS have
a mutually agreed-to final Biological Assessment. This is in accordance with the streamlined consultation procedures.

Glossary of Acronyms and Terms
Adaptive Management

Adaptive management promotes flexible decision making that can be adjusted in the
face of uncertainties as outcomes from management actions and other events become
better understood. Adaptive management does not represent an end in itself, but rather
a means to more effective decisions and enhanced benefits. Adaptive management
identifies in advance precisely how, when, and why adaptive management plans will be
altered.

Aquatic Conservation Strategy
Objectives (ACS)

Aquatic Conservation Strategy was developed to restore and maintain the ecological
health of watersheds and aquatic ecosystems contained within them on public lands. It
employs several tactics to approach the goal of maintaining the “natural” disturbance
regime (NWFP pp. B-10). Aquatic Conservation Strategy Objectives are nine objectives
to meet the standards and guidelines in the Northwest Forest Plan Record of Decision
to manage the riparian dependent resources to maintain the existing condition or
implement actions to restore conditions (NWFP pp. B-11).

Area of Potential Effect
(APE)

The area of potential effects (APE) means the geographic area or areas within which an
undertaking may directly or indirectly cause alterations in the character or use of historic
properties, if any such properties exist. The APE is influenced by the scale and nature
of an undertaking and may be different for different kinds of effects caused by the
undertaking.” 36 CFR § 800.16(d). In defining the APE, the potential direct, indirect, and
cumulative effects to historic properties and all aspects of integrity, including their
associated settings as applicable is considered.

Basal Area (BA)

The cross-sectional area of all stems of a species or all stems in a stand measured at
breast height (4.5 feet above the ground on the uphill side) and expressed per unit of
land area (Society of American Foresters, 2008).

Biological Assessment (BA)

Biological Assessment refers to the information prepared by or under the direction of the
Federal agency concerning listed and proposed species and designated and proposed
critical habitat that may be present in the action area and the evaluation potential effects
of the action on such species and habitat (50 CFR §402.02)

Biological Evaluation (BE)

A Biological Evaluation analyzes and discloses the potential effects of a project on
sensitive species known or assumed to occur within the project area. The Forest
Service defines sensitive species as those plant and animal species identified by the
Regional Forester for which population viability is a concern.

Biological Opinion (BO)

A Biological Opinion is the document that states the opinion of the Service as to
whether or not the Federal action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed
species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat (50 CFR
§402.02).

Black Stain

Black stain is a wilt-like disease of conifers caused by the native, insect-vectored, fungal
pathogen Leptographium wageneri. Disease centers appear as small groups of dead
and symptomatic trees but can sometimes be much larger, especially in ponderosa pine
stands. Susceptible stands are usually densely stocked and consist of either pure or
predominantly ponderosa pine. Black stain predisposes trees to bark beetle infestation.
Vigorous trees with adequate spacing are more resistant. Open stands have warmer
soils that inhibits the fungus with fewer root contacts between susceptible trees.

Communities at Risk (CAR)

Communities at Risk in designated Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) (USDA & USDI,
2001). To help protect people and their property from potential catastrophic wildfire, the
National Fire Plan directs funding to be provided for projects designed to reduce the fire
risks to communities. To achieve this goal communities that are at high risk of damage
from wildfire were identified. These high risk communities identified within the wildlandurban interface, the area where homes and wildlands intermix, were published in the
Federal Register in 2001.
(http://osfm.fire.ca.gov/fireplan/fireplanning_communities_at_risk)

Coarse Woody Debris (CWD)

Piece(s) of dead woody material, e.g., dead boles, limbs, and large root masses, on the
ground in forest stands or in streams —synonyms are large organic debris (LOD), large
woody debris (LWD) (Forest Plan, Appendix O), down woody debris (DWD) (Society of

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

257

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

American Foresters, 2008). CWD is often described in size classes by diameter.
Co-dominant

A tree whose crown helps to form the general level of the main canopy and receiving full
sunlight from above and comparatively little sunlight from the sides (Society of American
Foresters, 2008).

Critical Habitat (CH), Critical
Habitat Unit (CHU)

Designated critical habitat and critical habitat unit for Northern spotted owl (USDI-FWS,
2012)

Crown Fire

Fire spread through the tree canopy

CVRWQCB

Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board

Diameter Breast Height (DBH)

The diameter of the stem of a tree measured at breast height (4.5 ft or 1.37 m) from the
ground. On sloping ground the measure is taken from the uphill side. DBH usually
implies diameter outside bark (DOB) but can be measured as inside bark (DIB) (Society
of American Foresters, 2008).

Dominant

That component of a community, typically a species, exerting the greatest influence on
its character because of its life form or great abundance or an individual or species of
the upper layer of the canopy (Society of American Foresters, 2008). Most commonly
used in this analysis as A tree whose crown extends above the crowns of the tree's
immediate neighbors and receiving full sunlight from above and complete to partial
sunlight from the sides.

Early-Seral/
Early-Successional

Potential natural community species are absent or in very low numbers. typically 6-12
inch dbh with >40% canopy closure comprised of both natural stands and older
plantations (LSRA, 1999 p. 22)

EIS, DEIS, FEIS

Environmental Impact Statement, Draft Environmental Impact Statement, Final
Environmental Impact Statement

Fire Hazard

Fire behavior potential based on fuels and weather (USDA-FS, 2015 p. 49).

Fire Regime

A generalized description of the role that fire plays in an ecosystem; the pattern and
variability of fire occurrence and its effect on vegetation by description of fire frequency,
predictability, intensity, seasonality and size characteristics of fire in a particular
ecosystem (Agee, 1993).

Fire Regime Condition Class

A fire regime condition class is a classification of the amount of departure from the
natural regime. Condition class can be utilized to describe the degree of departure (low,
moderate or high) from historical conditions. The condition class 3 (high departure) is
defined as “fire regimes have been substantially altered from their natural (historic)
range. The risk of losing key ecosystem components is high. Fire frequencies have
departed from natural frequencies by multiple return intervals. Dramatic changes occur
to one or more of the following: fire size, intensity, severity, and landscape patterns.
Vegetation attributes have been substantially altered from their natural (historic) range
(NWCG, 2003 p. 1).

Fire Return Interval (FRI)

The number of years between two successive fires documented in a designated area
(USDA-FS, 2015 p. 49).

Fire Return Interval Departure
(FRID)

A measure of how departed from the natural average fire return interval (USDA-FS,
2012a).

Fire Risk

The probability of a fire occurring in a given area based on historical fire occurrence
(USDA-FS, 2015 p. 49).

Fire Severity

The effect of a fire on ecosystem properties, usually defined by the degree of soil
heating or mortality of vegetation (Agee, 2007). The severity of a fire depends on the
fire intensity and the degree to which ecosystem properties are fire resistant. Therefore,
fire severity is, in part, a function of the ecosystem being burned and is not simply
indexed from fireline intensity. If a fire has a long residence time, fire severity will usually
increase.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Forest Transportation System
(FTS)

The designated road and trail network managed by the Shasta-Trinity National Forest
by maintenance levels (ML)1, 2 and 3. The FTS does not include unauthorized routes.
Forest Service Handbook 7709.59 (62.32) described maintenance levels (also see
(Bonivert, 2015a)). Maintenance levels define the level of service provided by, and
maintenance required for, a specific road. Maintenance levels must be consistent with
road management objectives and maintenance criteria.

Fuel Model (FM)

Fuel models are tools to help land managers estimate fire behavior and are described in
terms of both expected fire behavior and associated vegetation. Thirteen fuel models for
fire behavior are utilized for the severe period of the fire season.

Geographic Information
System (GIS)

A geographic information system (GIS) is a system for managing spatial data and
associated attributes. In the strictest sense, it is a computer system capable of
integrating, storing, editing, analyzing, and displaying geographically-referenced
information.

Heterobasidion Root Disease
or Heterobasidion annosum

A fungus that attacks the root system increasing susceptibility to bark beetles and
causing mortality. It spreads from root contact and can infect fresh cut stumps, and
survives in living or dead as well as rotting tree stumps, and can persist long term. The
fungus spreads via root-to-root contact to adjacent live trees and may survive for many
years. Infection centers may enlarge until they reach barriers, such as openings in the
stand or groups of resistant plants. Young conifers established near infected stumps
often die shortly after roots contact infected roots in the soil.

Historic Properties

Any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object included in, or
eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic Places maintained by the
Secretary of the Interior. This term includes artifacts, records, and remains that are
related to and located within such properties. The term includes properties of traditional
religious and cultural importance to an Indian tribe or native Hawaiian organization and
that meet the National Register criteria” 36 CFR § 800.16(l)(1).

Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC)

Watersheds in the United States and the Caribbean are delineated by the U.S.
Geological Survey using a national standard hierarchical system based on surface
hydrologic features and are classified into six types of hydrologic units: first-field
(region), second-field (sub-region), third-field (accounting unit), fourth-field (cataloguing
unit), fifth-field (watershed) and sixth-field (sub-watershed). Each hydrologic unit is
identified by a unique hydrologic unit code (HUC) consisting of two to twelve digits
based on the six levels of classification
(http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1042207.pdf).

Intermediate

A tree whose crown extends into the lower portion of the main canopy, but that is
shorter in height than the co dominants and receiving little direct sunlight from above
and none from the sides (Society of American Foresters, 2008).

Ladder Fuels

Fuels which provide vertical continuity between strata, thereby allowing fire to carry from
surface fuels into the crowns of trees or shrubs with relative ease. They help initiate and
assure the continuation of crowning. ( (NWCG, 2014).

Late Successional
Characteristics

Trees with distinct traits common to older overmature trees including large, decadent
boles and limbs, cavities and forked, broken or flattened tops, sometimes called “wolfy”
trees. These trees provide unique wildlife habitat not common in most overstory trees.
Unless stated within a stand specific prescription, trees with these late seral
characteristics should be retained except where they serve as a public or operational
safety hazard.

Late Successional Reserve,
(LSR)

Late-Successional Reserve is a land allocation managed to protect and enhance oldgrowth forest conditions (NWFP p. 8). LSRs are designed to maintain a functional,
interacting, late-successional and old-growth forest ecosystem (Forest Plan p. 4.37).

Late-Seral/
Late-Successional

Potential natural community species are dominant, but seral species still persist.
Typically greater than 25 inches in diameter with greater than 40% canopy closure.
Many of these stands tend to be multi-storied. The large overstory trees are spaced
fairly far apart. The large overstory trees, greater than 25 inches dbh are dominated by
shade intolerant species while white fir , some Douglas-fir and hardwoods have grown
up in the understory, increasing the vegetation biomass to a level where competition for

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

259

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

growing space is becoming a concern. This accounts for an increase in the number of
trees per acre and high basal area, as compared to historical conditions (LSRA, 1999 p.
22).

Late-Successional Old Growth
(LSOG)

Forest or stands consisting of trees and structural attributes and supporting biological
communities and processes associated with old-growth and/or mature forests (FEMAT
1993, p. IX-19).

Limited Operating Period
(LOP)

Restricted time of operations for resource protection

Live Crown Ratio

The portion of the tree which is occupied by live healthy crown. Live crown ratio is
expressed as a percent of the total height of the tree.e.g. 30% live crown ratio means a
100-foot tall tree has 30 feet of live crown.

LSRA

Forest-wide Late-Successional Reserve Assessment (LSRA, 1999)

Maintenance Level-1 (ML-1)

Roads that have been placed in storage (e.g. “closed”) between intermittent uses. Basic
custodial maintenance is performed to prevent damage to adjacent resources and to
perpetuate the road for future resource management needs (Forest Plan p. Appdx. K).

Maintenance Level-2 (ML-2)

Roads open for use by high clearance vehicles. Passenger car traffic, user comfort, and
user convenience are not considerations (Forest Plan p. Appdx. K).

Maintenance Level-3 (ML-3)

Roads open and maintained for travel by a prudent driver in a standard passenger car
(Forest Plan p. Appdx. K).

Maintenance Level-4 (ML-4)

Roads that provide a moderate degree of user comfort and convenience at moderate
travel speeds. Most roads are double lane and aggregate surfaced, but may be one
lane (Forest Plan p. Appdx. K).

Mature

Trees or stands pertaining to a tree or even-aged stand that is capable of sexual
reproduction (other than precocious reproduction), has attained most of its potential
height growth, or has reached merchantability standards —note within uneven-aged
stands, individual trees may become mature but the stand itself consists of trees of
diverse ages and stages of development (Society of American Foresters, 2008).

Mid-Seral/
Mid-Successional

Potential natural community species are increasing and colonizing the site. Typically 1324 inches in dbh with greater than 40% canopy closure. Most of these stands are evenaged and relatively dense, due to the encroachment of shade tolerant species.
Hardwoods generally make up a minor component within most mid-seral stands.
Suppressed and intermediate trees are beginning to die out of the stands as competition
for growing space becomes a factor (LSRA, 1999 p. 22).

Norther Spotted Owl (NSO)

The northern spotted owl is a medium-sized, dark brown owl with a barred tail, white
spots on the head and breast, and dark brown eyes surrounded by prominent facial
disks. Males and females have similar plumage, but females typically weigh 10 to 20
percent more than males. The northern spotted owl is Federally listed under the
Endangered Species Act as a threatened species in Washington, Oregon and California
(http://www.fws.gov/arcata/es/birds/NSO/ns_owl.html).

The mission of the Northwest Forest Plan is to adopt coordinated management direction
for the lands administered by the USDA Forest Service and the USDI Bureau of Land
Management and to adopt complimentary approaches by other Federal agencies within
the range of the northern spotted owl (NWFP, 1994)

Predominant
(Remnant, Legacy)

Predominant trees are above the general level of the upper canopy trees.
Remnant - Trees that remain from a previous management activity or catastrophic
event. The tree is significantly older than the surrounding vegetation. Remnant trees do
not form a canopy layer and are usually isolated individuals or small clumps (USDA-FS,
2010).
legacy tree - a tree, usually mature or old-growth, that is retained on a site after
harvesting or natural disturbance to provide a biological legacy (Society of American

Resilience

Resilience refers to the capacity of an ecosystem to not only accommodate gradual
changes but to return toward a prior condition after disturbances including fire, extreme
weather events, and climate change. Ecologically healthy and resilient landscapes, rich
in biodiversity, will have greater capacity to adapt and thrive in the face of natural
disturbances and large scale threats to sustainability, especially under changing and
uncertain future environmental conditions such as those driven by climate change and
increasing human use (USDA-FS, 2014 p. 12)

Roost/Rest Clumps

distinct groups of tightly spaced overstory trees/snags, often with late seral
characteristics and with smaller (<10-inch size class) shade tolerant trees growing
underneath. These clumps can range from a tight group of 3 to 6 trees/snags to an area
less than1/10 acre. In all natural stands, and as available, retain rest/roost clumps
throughout the stands. As they are available, ideally retain approximately 4 smaller
clumps and 2 larger clumps per acre.

Crown fire that jumps from tree to tree

SDI

Stand Density Index – A widely used measure developed by (Reineke, 1933) that
expresses relative stand density in terms of the relationship of a number of trees to
stand quadratic mean diameter. Any index that expresses relative stand density based
on a comparison of measured stand values with some standard condition (Society of
American Foresters, 2008)

Seral Stage/Successional
State.

A stage of ecological process of progressive change in a plant community after
disturbance leading to a relatively stable potential natural community under existing
environmental conditions. Succession may be retrogressive after disturbance to a less
stable plant community. (Hall, et al., 1995).

Silviculture

The art and science of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and
quality of forests and woodlands to meet the diverse needs and values of landowners
and society on a sustainable basis (Society of American Foresters, 2008).

Site Index

Site index is a measure of a forest’s potential productivity. Site index is usually defined
as the height of the dominant or codominant trees at a specified age in a stand. It is
calculated in an equation that uses the tree’s height and age. Site index equations differ
by tree species and region (Hanson, et al., 2002).

Stand

A recognizable area of the forest that is relatively homogeneous and can be managed
as a single unit.

Suppressed (overtopped):

A tree whose crown is completely overtopped by the crowns of one or more neighboring
trees —note the vigor of overtopped (suppressed) trees varies from high to low
depending on individual circumstances (Society of American Foresters, 2008)

Surface Fire

Fire that burns loose debris on the surface, which include dead branches, leaves, and
low vegetation. Burns only in the surface fuel bed.

The National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP)

The National Register of Historic Places is the official list of the Nation's historic places
worthy of preservation. Authorized by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, the
National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places is part of a national
program to coordinate and support public and private efforts to identify, evaluate, and
protect America's historic and archeological resources.

Timber Type Classification

Timber strata designations (see Forest Plan, p. D-3): M=Mixed Conifer, D=Douglas-fir,
P=Ponderosa or Jeffrey Pine, R=Red fir, LP=Lodgepole Pine, PL=Plantations, 2=polesized timber (6-12 ft.), 3=small sawtimber (13-24 ft.), 4=medium/large sawtimber (25+
ft.), G=good stocking (40-100 percent), P=poor stocking (10-40 percent), N&X=all
density classes

Torching
(Passive Crown Fire)

Fire that consumes single or small groups of trees or bushes.

Tree Well

An area free of snow around the base of the trees created by lower snow accumulation
directly below the crown of the tree and more rapid melting due to radiant heating from
the bole.

Unauthorized Routes

Existing roads that are not open to vehicular traffic or managed as part of the FTS.

Uncharacteristic Wildfire

A fire that does not closely resemble the expected historical natural fire regime in terms
of fire frequency and effects. The greater the departure from historical natural fire
regime, the more uncharacteristic is the fire. Typically used when describing fires with
more extreme behavior resulting in greater effects than what occurred historically.

Underburning

Prescribed burning with a low fireline intensity fire under a timber canopy.

Variable Density Thinning

Variable-density thinning is a silvicultural technique intended to promote biological
diversity and structural heterogeneity (biocomplexity) characteristic of old-growth
forests, by inducing fine-scale variation in homogeneous second-growth forest canopies
( (Carey, et al., 1995; Muir, et al., 2002). Variable-density thinning consists of thinning a
forest stand at different intensities in patches at a scale of approximately 0.1 to 0.5 ha,
mimicking the scale of patchiness found in old growth (Carey, et al., 1999) and creating
a mosaic of overstory tree densities.

Western Pine Beetle

A small black bark beetle that creates egg galleries are winding and packed with frass
and frequently introduces fungal infections such as blue stain. Western pine beetle most
commonly attacks trees of reduced vigor. While older, larger trees are generally
preferred, younger trees can also be infested, especially when they occur in dense
stands, are infected by pathogens, or are damaged by fire. During periods of drought,
the western pine beetle can overcome apparently healthy trees as well Western pine
beetle most commonly attacks trees of reduced vigor. While older, larger trees are
generally preferred, younger trees can also be infested, especially when they occur in
dense stands, are infected by pathogens, or are damaged by fire. During periods of
drought, the western pine beetle can overcome apparently healthy trees. Groups of
trees are sometimes killed, especially when growing under crowded conditions. Since
larger trees are generally preferred, the western pine beetle can dramatically alter the
character of a forest that comes under attack. (Snyder, 2012)

Wildland Urban Interface
(WUI)

The line, area, or zone where structures and other human development meet or
intermingle with undeveloped wildland or vegetation fuels. (Guidance for
Implementation of Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy)

Table Appendix A-2. Unit Treatments by Alternative

95

Acreages are approximate and rounded to nearest 0.1. All acres are estimates used for planning purposes and were generated using the Forest’s Geographic
Information System (GIS), ground measurements or digitized imagery. Actual sub-treatment acreages may range from this number based on site specific conditions at
the time of implementation.

96

Harvest acres are typically the unit acres minus unthinned patches, however some units have smaller harvest areas due to unforested areas within the unit boundary
from insect and disease activity or from natural openings.

97

Machine piling may be accomplished with a bulldozer and brush rake or an excavator that grapples and piles debris or equivalent.

98

This column shows the maximum estimated need for piling natural and activity-generated surface fuels based on total unit acres minus unthinned patches. Wholetree yarding where feasible will decrease activity slash within the units and decrease piling needs from activity-generated slash. Piling will not take place unless needed
and is constrained to one entry per unit. Table Appendix B-3 starting on page A-22 provides additional estimates of actual piling needs by unit.

99

Estimated need based on estimated acres of planting needed. Only areas that require site prep to assure seedling/sapling survival will actually be site prepped.
Mechanical site preparation is most often done using a machine scalp in strips or patches (pods) to peel back thick grasses. All acres are not impacted by site
preparation.
100

If thinning or removal of trees 4 to 9.9” DBH is included in the treatment, the most likely method is listed here as either mech.=mechanical removal (whole tree is
chipped and removed for biofuel, or mast.=mastication (tree is shredded and left on site).

Silvicultural Prescription Descriptions
The following silvicultural treatment prescriptions for Thinning (Plantation Thinning p. B-27 and Natural
Stand Thinning p. B-31), Meadow Enhancement (B-35), and Reforestation (B-33), Aspen restoration adaptive
management (p. B-34) and Adaptive Management Salvage (p. B-34) provide general guidance by treatment.
The general marking guidelines below provide prescription elements of thinning including designation of
unthinned patches (UTPs), habitat roost/rest clumps, tree selection, and other treatments for site specific
conditions (for example, the presence of predominant trees, aspen, oak, or sugar pine) within units. Stands
may have one to several different prescription elements in order to address site specific conditions and issues
of density, insects or disease and to develop and retain key late-successional habitat features.
Thinning prescriptions are discussed in two primary treatment groups: natural stands and plantations. Within
each of these primary groups several prescription elements vary by stand conditions. Table Appendix B-2
above lists the treatments by unit, and unit-specific detailed information is provided on the stand record cards
in the project record.
Variable density thinning would accomplish all thinning treatments for natural stands and some older
plantations. Variable density thinning does not include a singular density target, and instead is a treatment that
thins to retain a range of densities by including unthinned patches (UTPs that are also referred to as skips),
areas of heavy thinning or small openings (radial release, gaps, or group selections), and thinning within a
target basal area range elsewhere within the stand. More information on the placement of designing the UTPs,
gaps, group selections and radial release treatments, along with other specifics such as release around oak or
aspen are included in the general marking guidelines.
Biomass (4 to 9.9-inch DBH) would be mechanically thinned on a prescribed spacing, or to a prescribed basal
area, in those natural and plantation thinning units that have a biomass thinning component as listed in Table
Appendix B-2. As an adaptive management strategy dependent on market feasibility at the time of
implementation, biomass material may not be mechanically thinned and removed under the implementation
contract, but instead treated with a combination of mechanical treatments or hand thinning and left on site or
thinned through prescribed fire.
Borate fungicide such as Sporax® or Cellu-Treat® would be applied to stumps over 14 inches in all harvested
areas within 4 hours of harvest to prevent the spread of Heterobasidion annosum in all harvested areas as
listed in Table Appendix B-2.

General Marking Guidelines
Marking guidelines apply primarily to the natural stands, although they also apply in some plantations, and
are meant to be used in conjunction with individual stand prescriptions. Table Appendix B-2 summarizes
some of the unit specific information pertaining to how the general marking guidelines are implemented based
on unit specific conditions and the resulting unit specific treatments. Additional stand-specific marking
instructions are provided on the stand record cards in the project record.

Tree Selection Criteria for Thinning - Conifers
Tree selection for thinning is a process of identifying those trees that are desirable for the habitat objectives,
and removing the remaining trees to reduce competition for resources and reduce live ladder and canopy
fuels. Trees to be retained would include healthy large overstory dominant trees of all species, healthy pine of
any size where pine is underrepresented, a component of healthy small understory and midstory trees, a
component of heavily damaged or diseased trees that provide habitat, and all hardwood trees as operationally
feasible.

A-22

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

While there is no prescribed upper diameter limit for the project, or within specific treatment units, the largest
oldest trees (predominants and dominants) that exhibit old-growth characteristics such as large boles,
decadent branching, cavities and flattened tops would be retained as long as they are not a safety hazard. In
some treatments units, diameter limits are prescribed (e.g., when conducting California black oak release
within critical habitat for the northern spotted owl, certain species of snags). All predominant trees would be
retained, regardless of their current health/ condition when marking. Trees to be removed would primarily be
midstory intermediate and smaller co-dominant trees; primarily the shade tolerant white fir that has grown up
through the understory over the last several decades because of fire suppression and stand succession. For
example, white fir that are larger in relation to adjacent healthy trees of other less common mixed conifer
species such as Douglas-fir and incense cedar would be removed in some cases to promote species diversity.
Desirable (Healthy) Tree - A tree exhibiting no signs of defect, damage or disease. Crown appears full and
vibrant, bole is regular in form without excessive lean. Live crown ratio is 40 percent or greater. Desirable
trees should be preferred over acceptable trees as leave trees.
Acceptable tree - A tree that may exhibit some minor defect, damage or disease, but these characteristics are
not excessive - defect, damage or disease is not expected to appreciably reduce tree growth or its ability to
survive into the future. Live crown ratio is 30 percent or greater. Where they exist, desirable trees should be
selected for leave over acceptable trees.
Unacceptable Tree - A tree exhibiting damage, successful insect attack, defect or disease such that the tree is
not expected to thrive or survive long term, or the tree poses as an undesirable vector for the spread of
disease. Predominant trees or trees with late-successional characteristics are not included under this definition,
all large predominant trees are to be retained. Unless exceptions are stated in the unit-specific silvicultural
prescription, trees with the following characteristics should not be considered for leave trees:
1. A live crown ratio less than 30 percent.
2. Fading, thinning, off-color foliage dominating the crown appearance.
3. It is suppressed.
4. It is leaning more than 15 degrees from vertical – i.e. showing signs of torn or upheaved roots such
that the tree is likely to become unstable over time.
5. There is Excessive damage – A tree with 50 percent or more of the circumference of the bole
cambium damaged, or occupied by an open and bleeding mistletoe canker, at any location along the
stem is classified as excessively damaged. Trees with broken tops in the lower two thirds are
classified as excessively damaged and should not be considered as a leave tree. Trees with broken
tops in the upper third are not considered excessively damaged if they are not expected to prevent
the tree from reaching maturity. These trees should only be left if no better formed trees meeting
"leave tree" exist to meet prescription objectives.
6. There is Excessive disease/insect attack – the following describes symptoms of the most common
diseases in the project area and western pine beetle activity:
a. Dwarf Mistletoe - The Hawksworth six point rating system is used to determine the level of dwarf
mistletoe infection 102 in host trees. Trees bearing visible dwarf mistletoe plants on the trunk or
have a Hawksworth rating of 4 or greater for the tree should be classified as being excessively
damaged. Where dwarf mistletoe is present, select healthy non-infected trees regardless of species

102

Mistletoe "infection" refers to visible dwarf mistletoe fruiting bodies. Damage caused by prior infections, such as
witches brooms, should not be factored into a dwarf mistletoe rating without seeing fruiting bodies.

first, then infected trees with a Hawksworth rating of 3 or less as leave trees in order to meet
stocking (basal area or spacing) requirements. Infected trees are rated as follows:
1. Divide the crown into thirds
2. Rate each third separately as follows:
0 = No infection
1 = Less than 50% of the branches infected, or infection on the stem.
2 = More than 50% of the branches infected.
3 = Add ratings of thirds to obtain rating of total tree.
7. White Pine Blister Rust - This disease and its accompanying symptoms apply to sugar pine and
western white pine only. These trees should be considered as excessively blister rust infected if they
are bearing any visible blister rust cankers on the trunk or branches. Branch cankers can appear as
"flags" in which all the branch needles turn brown. Dead branches void of needles should not be
considered blister rust infected unless cankers are visible where the branch extends from the bole.
8. Western Pine Beetle – Successful attacks by beetles are visible by red pitch tubes that have a clear
opening or evidence of red frass on the ground or in bark crevices below. Pitch tubes that are white
or clear are signs of unsuccessful attack. Western pine beetle typically attack near the center of the
tree bole. Large patches of exposed inner bark from woodpeckers feeding on beetle larvae are
another indicator of successful beetle attack. Trees crowns typically begin to fade from pale green to
red usually within one year of a successful attack. Within the Elk project area and with extended
drought conditions, it is unlikely that trees with successful pine beetle attacks will survive long term.
With the exception of predominant trees, trees showing signs or symptoms of successful beetle
attack should be removed unless they are to be counted towards snag retention objectives.

Density/Fuels Thinning
Thin the portions of the stands not retained as unthinned patches or treated under the other prescription
elements described below, to a range of stand-specific basal areas provided (see individual stand
prescriptions). Generally retain the largest healthiest trees and remove suppressed and intermediate trees with
exceptions (see below). Recognizing that historically most stands in the eastern and southeastern portions of
the project area were pine dominated with a mix of species; promote pine health and survival and emphasize
removal of encroaching shade tolerant trees while retaining structural and species diversity in these areas.
Basal area can vary by locale to select the healthiest trees and promote diversity while maintaining the desired
stand average basal area. Most stands have a target basal area range rather than a single basal area value, to
meet the variable density thinning objectives. The stand specific prescriptions describe when to thin to a lower
or higher basal area, depending on the presence of disease, species mix and average tree diameter. As a
general rule of thumb, consider varying the basal area by 20% of the target average at any locale to achieve
stand health and habitat objectives. Objectives of variable density thinning include reducing overstocking
while promoting stand structure variability, biological diversity and characteristics of old-growth forests by
inducing fine-scale variation in homogeneous second-growth forest canopies and is expected to facilitate the
development of the structural and functional characteristics of late-successional forests. Retain all large
predominant trees of any species and health, as operationally feasible and where not a safety hazard.

Unthinned Patches
Retain at least ten percent of a unit proposed for thinning within LSR allocation in an unthinned condition.
Unthinned patches would be selected based on the presence of features that provide processes and conditions
such as thermal cover, natural suppression and mortality. These features include dense pockets of trees (large
or small), trees with cavities, trees with deformed or decadent limbs, large snags, large down logs,
A-24

undisturbed debris, and dense or multi-layered forest attributes. They may also include openings with dense
brush, small trees, or other vegetation that contributes to natural size differentiation.
Unthinned patches would vary in size and placement across the LSR and while fire (during underburning)
would be allowed to creep into these areas, there would be no direct ignition within some unthinned patches
(RPM 24 p. 85).
Snag retention areas may comprise some of the unthinned patches in heavy mortality areas when the other
features are not available to achieve the minimum ten percent threshold. Where safely feasible in LSR, snag
retention areas (ranging from 5 to 10 acres) will be strategically located within or adjacent to existing
mortality pockets. Snag retention areas will be at least 150 feet from System roads that will remain open after
project completion or 300 feet from private property boundaries. Snag retention areas will consist of a range
of size classes and species with a preference for areas that contain larger diameter snags (≥24 inches) with a
live tree component for wind-throw protection and little to no understory regeneration in known black stain
infection areas. Retention areas will be delineated by the project wildlife biologist. Units 158, 162, 175,176,
204 and 206 are known to be affected by mortality and likely to have snag retention areas. No piling,
reforestation or other mechanical activities will occur in these areas under the project.

Habitat Roost/Rest Clumps
These are distinct groups of tightly spaced overstory trees/snags, often with late-successional characteristics
and with smaller (<10-inch size class) shade tolerant trees growing underneath that provide avian and bat
roosting or fisher or Pacific marten rest and potential den sites. Clumps would be composed of white fir,
cedar, sugar pine or Douglas-fir, or any combination thereof and usually consist of a grouping of 3 to 6
trees/snags growing tightly spaced, with decadent branching, cavities, defect, or broken tops with smaller
(<10-inch size class) trees surrounding the larger live or dead trees. Clumps can range from a tight grouping
of trees/snags to an area about 1/10 acre or larger. These clumps would be retained at the rate of at least 4 to 6
small clumps per acre and at least 3 larger clumps per acre and These habitat features are one element of
consideration when marking for the low or high end of a variable density basal area target.

Radial Release – Predominant Pine
Conduct radial thinning around large legacy pine to reduce density, remove fuels and promote tree vigor and
long term survival. Large "legacy" predominant trees are trees that are distinctly older and larger than trees in
the main canopy layer of a stand. Radial thin around a maximum of two legacy pine per acre, except unit 157
which is a maximum of four trees per acre, where specified in the stand prescription. Generally remove all
smaller diameter trees within a 50 foot radius of the bole except for other predominant legacy trees of any
species. Select legacy pine that appear the most healthy and likely to survive long term (refer to attachment 1
as an aid in determining tree health and selection priority). Focus radial release where thinning can have the
greatest beneficial effect: on pine that are relatively healthy and are crowded by advanced second growth
trees, often shade tolerant white fir.

Sugar pine and hardwood retention
Retain healthy sugar pine that do not show symptoms of white pine blister rust, are not suppressed or heavily
damaged and otherwise are expected to survive long term. In unique instances of sugar pine aggregates, sugar
pine may be thinned to reduce density and achieve target basal area, but otherwise healthy sugar pines are
priority for retention.
Retain and promote oak and aspen as described below (p. B-26 to B-27), unless as otherwise prescribed
within critical habitat for the northern spotted owl. Thin overtopping conifers not otherwise designated for
retention (for example do not remove predominant trees or trees with late-successional characteristics).

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Snag Recruitment
Live trees with decadent late-successional characteristics may count towards the snag retention objective (see
RPM 40a, page 89) where snags are not available.

Black stain or western pine beetle (WPB)
Pockets of western pine beetle mortality ranging from a few trees to large expanses occur throughout the
project area. In this project area and vicinity, pine beetle mortality is frequently tied to black stain root disease
– a vascular disease that weakens the trees and predisposes them to insect attack. Where black stain root
disease is detected or deemed likely, basal area retention is lower than prescribed elsewhere.
Map and notify the Silviculturist or project coordinator of any areas of suspected black stain root disease.
Symptoms of black stain disease include reduced growth and fading of crowns, slow or rapid decline (slower
in old trees and faster in young trees), and crown wilt. Another indicator of black stain is trees in different
stages of mortality, typical of root disease infection centers, instead of a uniform onset of mortality, typical of
mass attacks by bark beetles.
Western pine beetle mortality in ponderosa pine occurs throughout the project area and is expected to be
ongoing. Trees (other than large predominant pine) that are recently dead, or have been successfully attacked
and are dying or likely to die should be removed to reduce future fuel loadings, when they are not needed to
meet wildlife snag retention needs.
Because of rapid decay, these trees may have little or no merchantable value at the time of harvest. These
trees would be designated for removal.

Riparian Reserves
Equipment may not enter into Riparian Reserves except for designated crossings, but trees may be removed
that can be reached from the edge of the Riparian Reserve, or the edge of the equipment exclusion zone (such
as equipment using a boom arm). Do not designate trees for removal that cannot be reached by equipment
from the edge of the Riparian Reserve or equipment exclusion zone. This generally means trees may be
removed that are 20’ or less from the Riparian Reserve or equipment exclusion zone edge.

Gaps and Group Selections in Dense White Fir
Group selection is the creation of small openings (or gaps) to provide for regeneration of a new age and often
species class, while leaving most of a stand's overstory intact. Group selection is a tool to develop species and
age/size diversity in stands that lack heterogeneity. Group selection is also a tool to regenerate pine, which
requires high amounts of direct sunlight if they are to thrive and survive to grow into the overstory. Young
pine in contrast to white fir are not shade tolerant and do not survive well in a shaded understory environment.
In order to regenerate pine in areas of dense homogenous white fir that have developed because of past
management practices and the exclusion of natural frequent fire, group selection and gap creation would
occur in several natural stands. To a limited extent, create group selections of 1 to 2 acres for pine
regeneration and in stands with homogenous white fir create small gaps in the canopy openings of 1/10 to ¼
acre to develop structural heterogeneity for natural understory vegetation development.
Unit-specific installation of groups and gaps in dense even-aged white fir are further described in the stand
specific prescriptions in the project record and pertain to LSR natural stands 151, 152-1, 153, 160, 170, and
178.

Oak Release
Release oaks 4 inches DBH and greater by removing adjacent conifers. Do not remove predominant (legacy)
trees, dominant trees that have late-successional characteristics or healthy sugar pine (not infected with blister

rust) when releasing oaks. Using a quadrant system, remove all conifers within 30’ of the dripline of oaks 4
inches DBH and greater to the west, north and east, remove all conifers within 60’ of the dripline in the south
quadrant. 103 Use directional felling away from oaks to
minimize damage to oak (especially when interlocking
crowns). This in effect makes an egg-shaped clearing around
the released oak – see diagram in Table Appendix B-2. Units 6,
14, 153, 154, 165, 168, 173, 178, and 317 are known to contain
oak. (unit 318 is also known to contain oak however it is not a
thinning unit therefore the oak release treatment would not be
applied).

Oak Release in Critical Northern Spotted Owl
Habitat
In units 6, 14, 153, 161, 168-1, 169, 170, 171, 172, 178 and
235, do not remove Douglas-fir, sugar pine or incense cedar
≥24 inches DBH within the oak prescription radius. In addition,
some conifers would be retained around oak that have cavities
or good resting or denning structure for fisher, roosting
structure for NSO, or where release would damage the oak.
This occurs primarily in units 153 and 178, but also in155, 165
and 154.

Figure Appendix B-1. Diagram of Oak Release

Aspen Release
Thin around aspen clones to remove conifer encroachment. Remove conifers for a distance of 150 feet from
the most distal live aspen tree or sprout. Retain large predominant conifers regardless of species or health or
density. Additionally retain healthy sugar pine 10 inches DBH or larger for a combined total of up to 10 trees
per acre (waive the 10 conifer tree maximum only if large predominant trees are in excess of 10 TPA.) Ten
trees per acre equates to approximately 70 foot spacing to reflect estimated pre-settlement forest conditions.
Favorably select trees with late-successional characteristics for retention where available. Aspen are known to
occur in units 157, 175, 402 and 318 (although 318 is not prescribed for release except through
underburning). The 150 foot buffer may extend into joining units if near a boundary, but would be truncated at
project area boundaries. The release treatment would be applied to other areas if additional aspen are located.

Plantation Thinning
Plantation thinning prescriptions are prescribed by age of the plantation then further divided by variations
based on site specific conditions. The age division is made for younger plantations at 39 or younger and older
plantations at 40 or older. Within older pine plantations, group selections are proposed in dense homogenous
stands to facilitate development of multiple-canopied and multiple-species stands that will be more resilient to
stocking pressure, drought stress and disease and insect impacts. Group selections would comprise up to 20
percent of a stand and would be re-planted with a mix of conifer species to increase diversity. Group
selections may range from approximately one to two acres.

103

Jerry Franklin described that success has been observed when you remove conifers from 2 times the individual
oak's dripline distance; and then on Southwest / South aspects, remove conifers within 1/2 the dominant tree height.
(Franklin, 2013). In order to provide uniformity and feasibility the oak release treatment described was developed for the
Elk project based on this information.

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Biomass material would be thinned through mastication or thinned mechanically and removed as noted for
each unit in Table Appendix B-2. Tree selections will be made per the general marking guidelines as described
starting page B-22 and as applicable for each unit conditions.
Table Appendix B-2 also lists borax applications for stumps greater than 14 inches to inhibit the spread of
Heterobasidion root disease.
The thinning prescription for plantations varies not only by age and conditions, but also by site-specific
features such as bordering the Elk Flat meadow or the presence of black stain root disease or western pine
beetle.

Young Plantation Thin
Young Plantation Thinning is prescribed for units 1, 106, 107, 114, 115, 116, 117, 208 and 233 which are
ponderosa pine plantations ranging from 10 to 39 years since establishment with scattered residual pole to
young mature overstory. The objective is to reduce density for stand plantation development, remove ladder
fuels and retain and promote species diversity as available. Trees within some of the 20 to 30 year-old
plantations, pre-commercial thinning of trees less than 8 inches DBH would be removed by either mechanical
thinning, hand thinning or mastication. utilized to reduce future stand density. If treatments of larger size
material (8 to 9.9 inches) are warranted, this material would be harvested as biomass. Black stain root disease
has been observed in some of the younger plantations (e.g., unit 113) and appears to be spreading. The
thinning prescription varies by site specific features such as bordering the Elk Flat meadow or the presence of
black stain or western pine beetle. This prescription would:
•

thin trees 4 inches DBH and larger to75 trees per acre (TPA) to an average 24 foot spacing (+- 4 feet)
(units 1, 106, 107), or to 100 TPA to an average 21 foot spacing (+- 4 feet) (units 114, 115, 116, 117,
208, 2330,

•

retain generally the healthiest larger trees,

•

promote species diversity and structural heterogeneity through favoring minor species while
considering tree health for diversity, and crown position (e.g. suppressed, dominant, etc.),

•

remove ladder fuels adjacent to healthy residual larger trees,

•

apply borax fungicide to stumps greater than 14 inches in those units likely to have stumps above 14
inches (106, 115, 116, and 208.)

Young Plantation Thin with Meadow Enhancement
Plantation stands 110 and 126 would be thinned as described in the young plantation prescription described
above (thinning to 75 TPA and 100 TPA, respectively), and will be thinned more heavily to enhance meadow
habitat within 100 feet of the Elk Flat meadow. The meadow enhancement would:
•

create a “feathered” effect near the meadow edge by thinning to approximately 25 TPA on an average
spacing of approximately 42 feet (+-8 feet),

•

favor leaving pine near the meadow edge, and

•

leave a few small groups (2 to 4 trees) of naturally clumped healthy co-dominant trees to reflect
natural stand development, while staying near 25 TPA average.

Young Plantation Thin with Interplant in Areas with Black stain or Western Pine Beetle
A-28

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

(WPB) Mortality
The “young plantation thin with interplant” prescription applies to those young ponderosa pine plantations
with recent mortality from black stain root disease or Western Pine Beetle activity. These plantations have
moderate/WPB varying to high levels of mortality, and often include scattered residual pole to young mature
overstory trees (e.g. units 113 104, 123, 124 and 125). This prescription would:
•

thin trees 4 inches DBH and larger to create buffer zones around mortality pockets and promote
survival and growth of remaining pine,

•

favor retention of non-susceptible species especially adjacent to areas of pine mortality,

•

remove ladder fuels adjacent to healthy residual larger trees,

•

remove all pine symptomatic of black stain and remove pine within 100 feet of symptomatic trees and
mortality pockets,

•

retain any healthy non-susceptible trees within buffer zones,

•

outside of mortality pockets and the 100’ buffer zones, thin pine to an average 50’ spacing to avoid
root-to-root contact and maximize growth,

•

retain healthy non-susceptible trees within these thinning areas up to an average of 24’ spacing. In
other words, there should be 50’ spacing between pine but other tree species can be retained in
between the pine as they are available,

•

select the healthiest largest trees for retention, favoring minor species for diversity,

•

interplant mixed species in existing mortality openings to increase diversity and provide a disease
barrier, and

•

apply borax fungicide to stumps greater than 14 inches in those units likely to have stumps above 14
inches (unit 124.)

Young plantations that are not excessively dense and are not showing signs of disease would be treated with
prescribed underburning. In most instances, these plantations do not contain heavy surface fuel loadings;
rather, fire would creep through some areas and naturally extinguish in others. Including these plantations in
prescribed underburning treatments makes for efficiency of implementation, reducing ground disturbance
impacts from creation of fire lines and more closely reflects the frequency of a natural fire disturbance.

Older Plantation Thinning
The “older plantation” prescription applies to plantations that are currently 40 to 50 years old (units 6, 7, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16 and 18). Stocking is very dense and these plantations are at high risk for bark beetle attacks.
Basal areas generally range from 180 to 240 square feet with average diameters of 16 to 22 inches DBH. The
prescription reduces stand density to reduce risk of future beetle attacks, breaks up fuel continuity and
promotes species and structural diversity and encourages the healthy growth of residual trees. Group

Unit 113 includes a Riparian Reserve and the guidelines for Riparian Reserves included in the general marking
guidelines would be applied.

selections would contribute toward development of a second age class and increases species diversity by
interplanting a mix of conifer species. This prescription would:
•

Retain species and structural diversity with trees that are expected to survive long term into the future
while meeting fuels and stand density objectives.

•

Retain an average basal area between 80 to 100 square feet (can vary by locale from approximately
60 to 120 square feet. Generally, basal area should not exceed 120 square feet except within
unthinned patches or natural aggregates of mixed species composition with generally larger trees
sizes.) Where black stain root disease is detected or deemed likely, basal area retention would be
lower than prescribed elsewhere.

•

Retain all healthy sugar pine that do not show symptoms of white pine blister rust, are not suppressed
or heavily damaged and otherwise are expected to survive long term.

•

Retain and promote all oak. Thin conifers from oaks 4 inches DBH or larger as described on page B26.

•

Retain all large predominant trees of any species and health. Implement radial thinning around
residual larger pines in units 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 18 as described on page B-25.

•

Install unthinned patches as described on page B-25.

•

Conduct radial thinning only around large healthy predominant pine (per general marking
guidelines).Thin all trees except for other predominant trees (any species) for a distance of 50’ from
the bole of healthy large predominant pine.

•

Remove trees in group selections in units 6, 7, 13, 14, 16 and 18 to further promote vegetation
structural and species diversity to create openings for natural and planted reforestation to promote a
second layer of mixed conifer species. Plant only in group selection areas and with mixed species for
diversity and to serve as a disease barrier. The thinning and group selections would also promote
shrub, forb and grass growth to a small extent given the created openings.

•

Promote diversity through selection of minor species. A healthy smaller conifer (not pine) may be
selected as a leave tree over larger adjacent healthy pine only when it is a minor species, is not
suppressed, does not appear damaged or diseased and is expected to thrive after thinning. Minor
species within the plantations include Douglas-fir, white fir, and incense-cedar.

•

Remove trees (other than large predominant pine) to reduce future fuel loadings, that have been
successfully attacked and are dying or likely to die when they are not needed to meet Forest Plan,
wildlife and LSRA snag retention requirements.

•

Apply borax fungicide Borate fungicide such as Sporax® or Cellu-Treat® would be applied to stumps
over 14 inches in diameter in all thinned areas within 4 hours of harvest to prevent the spread of
Heterobasidian root disease.

Variation for Habitat
As available, the retention of roost/rest clumps for wildlife use and habitat structure, as described for Natural
Stand Thinning, would also be retained within older plantations. During the release of California black oak,
no sugar pine, Douglas-fir, or incense cedar that are 24 inches DBH or larger would be removed. While these

species are less likely to be present within these older ponderosa pine plantations, the plantation units are
adjacent to natural stands that may have these species/size classes.)

Natural Stand Thinning
Natural stands prescribed for thinning range from approximately 60 to 120 years old. Natural stand thinning
includes a summary of the prescriptions for units 151, 152-1, 153, 154, 155, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162,
163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168-1, 169, 170, 171, 172, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 201, 204, 206,
235, 317, and 347. Natural stand thinning prescriptions are prescribed primarily by target basal areas as listed
by unit in Table Appendix B-2 starting on page B-6, and further divided by variations based on site specific
characteristics such as northern spotted owl foraging or dispersal habitat, the presence of aspen, oak or insect
or disease activity.
The prescriptions in natural stands do not purely thin-from-below as some lower and mid-story trees would be
retained (as is consistent with the thin-from-below technique). Residual density in the natural stand thinning
units would vary from an average 125 to 175 square feet of basal area per acre, but may be higher or lower
depending on species composition and current habitat function for NSO. Depending on the average tree
diameter, this equates to approximately 60 to 100 trees per acre. Lower densities would be retained in areas
that are predominantly dominated by ponderosa pine, higher densities would be retained in mixed conifer, and
white fir dominated stands. Higher densities would also be retained where clumped groups of large trees, and
smaller biomass sized (trees <10 inches DBH), occur to provide for age class and structural variability.
Instead of applying one target basal area across a stand, the variable density thinning prescription would help
promote within-stand structural heterogeneity that contributes to habitat function for late-successional species
while providing the needed growing space, nutrients and water for the remaining trees. Biomass thinning
would occur in some units through mastication or thinned mechanically and the material removed by means
listed in Table Appendix B-2.
In all natural stand thinning units in LSR, and as available, structural components (or clumps) that provide
avian or bat roosting or mammal fisher or Pacific marten rest and potential den sites would be retained at the
rate of at least four to six small clumps per acre and at least three larger clumps per acre. Clumps would be
composed of white fir, cedar, sugar pine or Douglas-fir, or any combination thereof and usually consist of a
grouping of three to six trees/snags growing tightly spaced, with decadent branching, cavities, defect, or
broken tops with smaller (<10-inch size class) trees surrounding the larger live and or dead trees. Clumps can
range from a tight grouping of trees or snags to an area about 1/10 acre or larger.
Borate fungicide such as Sporax® or Cellu-Treat® would be applied to stumps over 14 inches in all harvested
areas within 4 hours of harvest to prevent the spread of Heterobasidion root disease.

Thinning of Natural Stand - Variation for Critical Northern Spotted Owl Habitat
Thin from below to a target basal area of 150 applies to units 151, 161 and 172 with the following stand
specific guidelines. Species retention priority is SP, DF, IC, PP, WF, LP, KP, which is slightly different from
the “standard” retention priority in the general marking guidelines.

•

Thin smaller understory/midstory and co-dominant trees 4 inches DBH and greater. Focus on
removing and retaining the healthiest largest trees.

•

On up to 10% of the treatment unit create small gaps between 75 – 115 feet across in areas of white
fir dominated smaller trees (gaps would not be installed in areas of healthy pine or large predominant
trees) at the rate of no more than one gap on any one acre to develop structural heterogeneity and
small openings for natural understory development.

small openings for natural understory regeneration and development.

•

•

Thin from below trees 10 inches DBH and greater up to some codominant trees as needed (generally
24 inches DBH or less) to retain a fairly closed overstory and understory.

•

Retain all predominant trees and dominant trees that meet the desirable or acceptable leave tree
criteria (see B-22) which may cause target basal area to be exceeded.

•

Leave undesirable overstory trees to meet snag requirements if needed.

Thinning of Natural Stand, Radial Thin, Group Selection, Skips, Plant Groups - Variation for
Group selection for Heterobasidion root Disease
In order to regenerate pine in areas of dense homogenous white fir that have developed as a result of past
management practices and the exclusion of natural frequent fire, group selections would be installed in units
152 -1 and 160 (natural thinning stands) where Heterobasidion root disease has been observed and reforested
with pine. Group selections would generally range from one to two acres but would not exceed one acre in
natural stand 152-1 in order to retain larger areas of existing late-successional habitat function.

Thinning of Natural Stand, Interplant - Variation for Natural Stand Thinning to Trees per
Acre or Hardwood Release
Unit 317 would be thinned from below per the tree selection criteria (page B-22) to a target of 100 TPA
(average spacing 20 feet +- 4 feet) with a primary objective of oak release per the oak release prescription on
page B-26.
Unit 175 has an aspen component that will be treated per the aspen release prescription (page B-27).

Reforestation
A combination of planting and natural seed fall would provide regeneration. Openings created by mortality
pockets approximately one acre or larger would be evaluated for the need to site prep and interplant following
thinning or fuels treatments. Pockets of mortality less than one acre are expected to regenerate naturally from
seed fall of nearby residual trees.
Planting would promote stand resiliency by planting a mix of species that include non-host trees for black
stain and Heterobasidion root disease, and help assure pine reestablishment in areas where it is lacking. Hand
planting would be conducted in mortality openings and in group selections where:
•

Natural regeneration is not expected to sufficiently establish within five years of thinning or fuels
treatments, typically from a lack of nearby seed source or ground conditions not favorable to natural
seedling establishment.

•

A mix of tree species is desired to discourage the spread of disease (for example, interplanting nonsusceptible pine in pockets of white fir Heterobasidion root disease).

•

A mix of tree species is desired to promote diversity or certain species are not expected to establish
naturally. These may include ponderosa pine, sugar pine, Douglas-fir, incense cedar and hardwoods
such as black oak.
All group selections regardless of size, and openings created by mortality pockets two acres or larger would
be planted. Openings created by mortality pockets between one and two acres would be evaluated posttreatment for planting needs.
Table Appendix B-2 (starting p. B-6) lists approximate acres of group selections and mortality openings in
applicable units.
Mechanical site preparation would be implemented as needed to remove competing understory vegetation,
such as grass, prior to planting. Planting areas would be evaluated for site preparation needs after completion
of thinning and fuels treatments. Where the need is determined, mechanical site preparation would be
conducted in group selections and in large expanses of mortality (generally five acres or larger such as units
113 and 206) or areas of numerous concentrated smaller mortality gaps. Mechanical site preparation is
typically completed with a small tractor with a wildland rototiller or drum masticator. Competing vegetation
would be treated down to a soil depth of 4 inches to 6 inches to effectively sever grass/forb roots below the
root crown and brush below the first lateral root. Where mortality openings are smaller (generally less than 5
acres) and less contiguous, site preparation would be conducted as needed by hand scalping using hand tools.
Planting in areas generally five acres or larger would occur in a pattern of widely spaced clusters or groups of
three to five seedlings for a total of approximately 250 trees per acre, otherwise known as cluster planting.
Cluster planting helps establish seedling dominance in the vicinity of the cluster. Typically one or two
seedlings establish dominance over the others. Later excess smaller saplings may be removed adjacent to the
dominant conifers within the clusters. Smaller openings, generally less than 5 acres, would be planted with up
to approximately 150 trees per acre scattered as individuals throughout the planted area.

Reforestation treatments would be monitored for the need to control competing vegetation such as grasses,
forbs, brush and dense naturally seeded in conifers from the surrounding stand (typically white fir in an area
where ponderosa pine is being reestablished) that could inhibit the survival and growth of desirable seedlings.
Hand or mechanical cutting of competing vegetation may be implemented within the first one to five years
following reforestation, depending on monitoring results. Hand treatments would be most anticipated in the
areas of less than five acres that where mechanical site preparation was not utilized.
Interplanting-Only - Units 203 and 226 do not have thinning treatments but mixed species would be
interplanted as described above in existing openings after the first entry of prescribed underburning.

Adaptive Management
Aspen Restoration Adaptive Management
Aspen restoration would be completed through the marking guidelines for release of aspen during thinning
(see p. B-27). If aspen monitoring indicates clumps or stands are not actively suckering within three years of
conifer removal or fuels-only treatments, underburning or mechanical soil disturbance treatments (such as
disking) may be used to stimulate suckering. Use and timing of burning or mechanical treatments will depend
on readiness indicated by:
a. An overstory and understory made up primarily or completely of aspen, with few competing conifers
present. The overstory condition ranges from vigorous to declining aspen,
b. Newly regenerated trees below or around the edges of a more mature overstory of aspen. Where
overstory aspen are declining and dead, lack of a vigorous aspen understory indicates very poor aspen
health, and
c. An understory including a diverse plant community of native shrubs, grasses, sedges, rushes and forbs
(non-grass flowering plants), free of noxious weeds.
The need for removal of new conifer encroachment or enhancement of aspen age class variability through
application of underburning will be assessed on a site-specific basis once the initial objective of aspen
establishment as described above is achieved.
If aspen monitoring indicates browse damage at a level that may prevent achievement of healthy aspen
establishment, the appropriate type and size of fencing will be installed and maintained until monitoring
indicates it is no longer necessary:
a. Deer/Elk fencing constructed of poly mesh on T-posts, with a height of 6 feet or greater.
b. Cattle fencing constructed as a 36 to 48 inch 4-wire let-down fence on T-posts, with the top wire
being barbed.

Salvage Adaptive Management
Under adaptive management, salvage of dead and dying trees would be included in units experiencing
excessive ongoing mortality in the pine or white fir component (defined as more than 50% of the unit). The
total potential on the harvest acres are listed in Table Appendix B-2 (starting page B-6) and represent what
could be subject to salvage in the event conditions deteriorate further post-decision and post- marking.
Salvage treatment areas would be defined by white fir and ponderosa pine trees showing symptoms of rapid
decline such as: chlorotic foliage and poor needle retention; insect damage (white frass or pitch tubes on white
fir; multiple pitch tubes on ¾-bole circumference or with signs of successful attacks on pine). Areas would
typically be within or adjacent to larger mortality areas which are signs of an ongoing stocking, insect or
disease problem. During any salvage, the snag and CWD retention levels prescribed in would be in
accordance with the project’s design and resource protection measures would be met (as would all RPMs and
standard operating procedures). The adaptive management would extend only until the area was closed under
the implementation contract.

Meadow Enhancement
The meadow enhancement prescription applies to unit 402. Thinning for meadow enhancement is different
from thinning a forested stand in that there is no target density level such as a desired basal area or spacing.
Rather than manage for a forested stand, the intent is to create conditions more reflective of those found
historically; namely few scattered pine within an otherwise open meadow. A tree’s size, age and position –
within the meadow and in relation to adjacent trees, are considerations when selecting trees for retention or
removal.
Predominant trees would be retained. All other trees that have grown into and along the meadow edges would
be removed. A basal area of approximately 60 square feet per acre of the largest diameter trees would be
retained where the meadow transitions into conifer stands along the edge. This thinning prescription,
combined with the plantation thinning prescription in units 110 and 126 described above, would create a
‘feathered’ effect of few trees within the meadow, transitioning to an open forest stand along the meadow’s
edge. Prescribed burning would be utilized every five to ten years after initial treatments to maintain the
meadow, mimicking the effects of a historic natural fire regime and serving as an important tool in restoring
and enhancing ecological function and processes by promoting soil nutrients, perennial grass and forb
regeneration. While prescribed fire would be employed across Elk Flat, it is recognized that vegetation varies
some areas of the meadow will carry fire readily while other areas may not.
Borate fungicide such as Sporax® or Cellu-Treat® would be applied to stumps over 14 inches in all harvested
areas within 1 4 hours of harvest to prevent the spread of Heterobasidion annosum.

Fuels Treatment Descriptions
The fuel treatments described below would comply with the Resource Protection Measures Common to All
Action Alternatives (RPMs) (starting on page 81), Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) (starting p. D-1)
and Best Management Practices (starting p. D-4) for all applicable resources. The Standard Operating
Procedures for Silviculture and Fuels (SOP 17, p. D-3) describe the required burn plan that would be
completed prior to implementation to prescribe the onsite burning conditions, public safety, and measures to
implement the project objectives and resource protection measures. Also, see the Standard Operating
Procedures for Air Quality on page D-1 for routine practices pertaining to prescribed fire to comply with air
quality requirements.

Underburn
Underburning or broadcast burning (burning in a stand with little or no overstory, such as the meadow
restoration units) involves a prescribed burn utilizing a low to moderate intensity fire, often under a timber
canopy. 105 Underburning would be phased in incrementally over the project area (unless restricted by RPMs).
Table Appendix B-2 (starting p. B-6) lists units where underburning-only would be implemented without prior
thinning. The alternative maps for fuels (Appendix D – Maps) show the fuels prescriptions. Due to the high
degree of departure from the natural fire regime, one burn entry is unlikely to achieve the objective of
returning the natural role of fire to the ecosystem. Instead, 2 to 3 incremental underburns, repeated every 5 to
10 years would be implemented. The entire area would not be burned in any one year, contributing to a
diverse mosaic of treated area conditions. Achieving underburning treatments would require the following
connected actions:

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

•

Heavy concentrations of natural or activity-generated coarse woody debris would be machine piled as
a pretreatment before underburning to limit adverse fire severity effects to soils, wildlife and
overstory trees.

•

Fire containment methods such as hose lay, sprinkler system, hand line, or mechanical fire line
construction may be utilized to reduce impacts to resources of concern including but not limited to
cultural sites, visual resources, sensitive plant populations or wildlife habitat. Existing roads would be
the primary control lines where practical, resulting in fire moving across unit boundaries. In some
unthinned patches, no direct ignition would occur (RPM 24 (p. 85). Control lines to prevent
prescribed fire from entering private lands or to manage the fire within the project area would be
constructed by hand crews or small to medium crawler tractors where existing barriers are not
available. Where resource protection is required, such as to retain large down logs, within sensitive
Riparian Reserve areas, or near cultural sites or plant populations, line may be constructed in
accordance with the developed resource protection measures.

•

New fire control lines are approximately 2 feet wide when constructed by hand and up to 8 feet wide
where constructed by machine. Construction entails pushing the litter to the outside of the area to be
burned, resulting in a small berm of material alongside the line. Some small trees (typically smaller
than 10 inches DBH) and brush may be removed where there are limited openings to place the lines.
Alternatives 1 and 2 would require up to approximately 9.3 miles of control line with Alternative 3
requiring approximately 10.1 miles as shown in the fuels Alternative 3 map in Appendix D (Figure
Appendix E-6).

•

Natural and activity-generated fuels would be ignited by ground crews or aerial ignition and burned
with a low to moderate intensity surface fire. When underburning within unthinned patches, vary the
ignition pattern to achieve minimal heat and scorching of residual trees and downed wood and the
levels of acceptable mortality for non-thinned areas listed in Table 27 and Table 28 and per RPM 24
(p. 85)

•

Prescribed burning will be implemented to provide a result in a mosaic of retained levels of live
understory vegetation and will be in accordance with the prescribed levels of mortality listed in Table
27 and Table 28, as developed by the resource specialists and as agreed to with the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service and as described in (see RPM 24.)

•

Rehabilitation of control lines post-burning includes dragging the bermed material, brush, and small
trees back over the line.

•

Naturally ignited fires would be utilized and managed to accomplish underburning objectives as
appropriate.

Machine Pile and Pile Burn
Where there are heavy concentrations of coarse woody debris, typically more than 40 tons/ac (or as specified
by the Project RPMs), machine piling will be utilized as a pretreatment before underburning to increase
consumption of excess fuels over what underburning would accomplish and to limit adverse effects to wildlife
habitat.
Treatment-generated and natural fuels in excess of desired retention levels would be piled with mechanized
equipment such as an excavator or tractor with a mounted brush rake or grapple designed to minimize soil
disturbance.

A-36

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Post-harvest piling will focus on the high fuel load/mortality pockets and machine piling passes will be
limited to the extent needed to reduce fuel loads to the levels described in the resource protection measures.
Treated areas would not be rigorously cleaned of slash material, and duff materials would be largely left in
place for soil cover and erosion protection consistent with Forest Soil Quality Standards (Forest Plan p.
Appdx. O), RPMs and BMPs.
Piles would be burned when there is low fire danger and per the project burn plan specifications.
Table Appendix B-3 list units where machine piling and pile burn treatments may occur to address potentially
high fuel loading from ongoing mortality. The table lists the maximum potential piling acres (unit acres minus
the unthinned patches) and the percentage and acres actually estimated to need piling. Monitoring would
determine the actual need and extent of piling at the time of implementation.

Extensive Mortality Area
An approximately 79-acre area of contiguous pine mortality within units 112, 158, 175, 204 and 206 was
identified with little to no opportunity remaining to conduct thinning (see the fuel maps for alternatives in
Appendix D). Hazardous conditions from the numerous snags present a safety hazard to project implementers.
The Extensive Mortality Area would instead be burned (see discussion of underburning above) to reduce treat

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

heavy fuels, most likely utilizing aerial ignition techniques since it is unsafe to put firefighters on the ground
or conduct other machine-based fuels reduction within this area. The Extensive Mortality Area fuels subunit
overlays the underlying thinning units, however, no thinning will take place within it. This has been reflected
in the greatly reduced harvest acres for unit 206 shown in Table Appendix B-2. The harvest acres for the other
underlying units were not adjusted since the acres occupied by the extensive mortality area were not as
substantial.
If conditions at the time of treatment are unsafe for thinning operations in all or portions of the remainder
(outside of the Extensive Mortality Area) of these units, prescribed fire employed with felling and machine
piling as feasible to provide operational safety, would be employed as an adaptive management strategy. The
Extensive Mortality Area is not listed separately in Table Appendix B-2 or Table Appendix B-3, but enhances
the treatments already described for the underlying units.
The unthinned patches within the underlying units primarily consist of the larger snags, as described above in
the Unthinned Patch section. The ignition patterns would vary within and around the snag retention areas to
reduce impacts to standing snags as well as the natural regeneration and live tree components within and on
the periphery of the units.

Hydrologic Restoration Actions
Recontouring
Heavy equipment such as an excavator would be used to contour old landings followed by seeding to restore
floodplains, channels and meadows to pre-disturbance conditions. Recontouring would improve features to
allow sheet flow, infiltration and groundwater storage across Elk Flat meadow and Ash and Swamp Creek
Floodplains. Recontouring would improve or maintain water table depth. Buried large woody debris would
add structure to meet natural contours.

Decommissioning of Unauthorized Routes
Routes would be decommissioned as described in the transportation section to remove stream/road
interactions, and improve infiltration and function of intermittent channels. Decommissioning near stream
interactions would involve recontouring as described above.

Riparian Revegetation
After initial activities are complete follow-up treatments will include planting and seeding of native riparian
and upland (mesic) species that support riparian function. Areas will be planted with riparian vegetation along
the channel banks and seeded with shrub species where needed, including within UTP areas. Several old
landing areas (outside of UTP areas) will be recontoured and planted within the Ash Creek Riparian Reserve.
Road decommissioning in Elk Flat will remove stream crossings along Swamp Creek Riparian Reserves
where road runoff has eroded the channel. Recontouring activities will be followed by planting and seeding.

Thinning in Riparian Reserves
Thinning as described starting on page B-22 within the Riparian Reserves would increase instream structure.
The table below lists the actions proposed for hydrologic function restoration.

Road and Landing Actions
Road actions are those necessary to directly respond to the Purpose and Need for Action or needed to
implemented the other actions designed to meet the Purpose and Need for Action. Existing roads and
temporary roads would provide access for harvest operations. Most roads are suitable for hauling forest
products with pre-haul maintenance, and maintenance level 1 roads now closed to vehicles would be reopened
for the project then closed again upon completion. Table Appendix B-5 lists actions by individual road or
unauthorized route number. The alternative maps in Appendix D display the road actions, and descriptions of
the actions follow the table below. All road and landing actions would conform to all resource protection
measures (starting p.81). RPMs specific to roads and landings include 13 (p. 84), 14 (p. 84). 15 (p. 84), 16
(p. 84) and 17 (p. 84). Also see Standard Operating Procedures numbers 2 (p. D-1), 14 (p. D-2), 15 (p.D-3),

Road actions include:

Addition to the System
A 0.10 mile segment of unauthorized road U41N10A in the Matrix land allocation needed for current and
long-term management objectives as recommended by the Travel Analysis Process completed for the Elk
Project (Bonivert, 2015a p. Appdx. X) would be added to the system as a maintenance level 2 106 road and
maintained under all action alternatives. The road will remain open after completion of the project.

Maintenance
Over the course of the project approximately 17.9 miles of road (includes roads described in all FTS road
actions) would be actively maintained to standard as described in Standard Operating Procedures number 18
on page D-3. Approximately 15 miles would require only road maintenance. Maintenance activities can
106

Forest Service Handbook 7709.59 (62.32) described maintenance levels (also see (Bonivert, 2015a)). Maintenance
Level 1 roads are placed in storage between intermittent uses. The period of storage must exceed 1 year. Basic custodial
maintenance is performed to prevent damage to adjacent resources and to perpetuate the road for future resource
management needs. A maintenance level 2 road is open to high clearance vehicles. Maintenance levels define the level
of service provided by, and maintenance required for, a specific road. Maintenance levels must be consistent with road
management objectives and maintenance criteria.

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

include grading, resurfacing, culvert cleaning, hazard tree removal, snow plowing, and slide removal (36 CFR
220.6(d)4). After a road has been restored to its original condition, typical maintenance activities consist of
dust abatement (watering) and administrative monitoring. The volume of road maintenance conducted on
individual roads is directly proportional to unit size, treatment type and removal volume. Road adjacent to
larger units will require more truck trips over more days for treatment, increasing maintenance frequency and
intensity.
Closed roads, classified as level 1 maintenance, are included in the total maintenance mileage. Typical
maintenance activities for level 1 roads include maintaining the road barricade, signage and administrative
monitoring for effectiveness.

Reconstruction
Approximately 0.27 miles of existing FTS level 1 road (41N01YB) would be reconstructed to bring the road
to standard, then maintained for the project and closed. Reconstruction is required when the existing road
condition will not accommodate chip vans and logging trucks for removal of wood products and equipment
transport and the work is beyond the scope of road maintenance. Road Reconstruction for this project consists
of clearing and brushing, and installing, upgrading or replacing drainage structures, increasing road width and
turn radius widening to restore the road to a useable condition.

Temporary Roads and Landings
Temporary roads in harvest units across the project area would be used or constructed to provide access for
harvest operations. Temporary roads provide access to landings, facilitate treatments and to comply with log
skidding limitations where access is needed beyond ¼ mile from a FTS road. Temporary roads provide a
minimal road bed to direct operational traffic within harvest treatment units to protect resources. Previously
created skid trails and the unauthorized routes in the project area would serve as temporary roads rather than
constructing new temporary roads when possible to avoid new disturbance. Sections of unauthorized routes
used as haul routes would be improved for equipment access and hauling as needed. Once project operations
are completed temporary roads would be decommissioned.
Landings averaging approximately 0.75 acres each would be utilized as available or constructed if needed to
facilitate transfer of forest products to haul trucks. Actual landings would be approved on an individual basis
based on the operator’s requests at the time of implementation and consistency with RPMs.
Temporary roads, and landings would be decommissioned after project activities are concluded (see
“Decommission” below). Given the generally flat terrain, temporary road construction will be minimal and
the extent of decommissioning activities will be determined by the construction of the road. Typically, the
entrance will be blocked, drainage patterns will be restored and the temporary road surface will be disturbed
to break down compaction and allow the reestablishment of vegetation.
Table Appendix B-5 lists unauthorized routes that would be available for use as a temporary road then
decommissioned at the end of the project.
The table below displays the estimated temporary road needs by estimated landing within each unit, whether
the temporary road utilizes an existing unauthorized route or is new construction, and by Alternative.

Closure
Five roads, totaling approximately 3 miles, are currently closed and will need to be opened for project related
activities and closed again once project operations are complete. Approximately 0.27 miles of the 41N01YB
road will also be reconstructed prior to project related use and closure. Road closure methods consist of
physically blocking the road entrance, and may include installing water bars, removing and restoring drainage
structures and stabilizing drainage features depending on site conditions. Maintenance Level-1 closed roads
are not open to motorized vehicles but are considered to be in storage, retained for future management
activities. Road closures would be implemented after project treatments are complete. Table Appendix B-5
lists road-specific actions including closure.

Decommissioning
Decommissioning involves the demolition, dismantling, removal, obliteration 107 or disposal of a deteriorated
or otherwise unneeded road including the necessary cleanup work. Decommissioning eliminates the deferred
maintenance needs for the road. Portions of a road or component may remain if they do not cause problems
nor require maintenance. Decommissioning reestablishes vegetation and, if necessary, initiates restoration of
ecological processes interrupted or adversely impacted by the unneeded road. Decommissioning includes
applying various treatments, including one or more of the following 36 CFR 212.1 and as described in
(USDA-FS, 2014a p. FSM 7734.1 ):
1. Reestablishing former drainage patterns, stabilizing slopes, and restoring vegetation;
2. Blocking the entrance to a road or installing water bars;
3. Removing culverts, reestablishing drainages, removing unstable fills, pulling back road shoulders,
and scattering slash on the roadbed;
4. Completely eliminating the roadbed by restoring natural contours and slopes; and
5. Other methods designed to meet the specific conditions associated with the unneeded road.
In the Elk project, decommissioning methods for unauthorized routes will be determined on a route by route
basis and may include seeding or mulch consistent with RPMs 15 and 12 in addition to the actions listed
above.

107

Obliteration is to unbuild, decommission, deactivate, or dismantle a road; the denial of use, elimination of travel way
functionality, and removal of the road from the forest development road system; return of the road corridor to resource
production by natural or designated means (Moll, 1996)

Introduction
The Notice of Intent (NOI) was published in the Federal Register on February 28, 2013 (USDA-FS, 2013).
The NOI asked for public comment on the proposal by April 1, 2013. In addition, as part of the public
involvement process, the agency prepared a scoping document that was mailed or emailed to interested
individuals, organizations and agencies on February 14, 2013 (USDA-FS, 2013b). A Notice of Intent was
published in the Redding Record Searchlight on February 27, 2013 and March 3, 2013. Public meetings were
held March 5 and March 26, 2013 in McCloud and Mt. Shasta. The Forest Service received 11 comment
letters or emails.

All comments were reviewed. Issues were identified from public scoping comments. Issues are statements of
cause and effect, linking environmental effects to actions. Issues serve to highlight effects or unintended
consequences that may occur from the proposed action and alternatives, giving opportunities during the
analysis to reduce adverse effects and compare trade-offs for the decision maker and public to understand
(FSH 1909.15 Ch. 12.4).
The Council on Environmental Quality regulations for the National Environmental Policy Act explains this
delineation in Sec. 1501.7, “…identify and eliminate from detailed study the issues which are not significant
or which have been covered by prior environmental review (Sec. 1506.3)….” As such, issues were
categorized into two groups for this proposal: key and non-key issues. Key issues will be carried forward in
the environmental analysis process as a way to develop alternatives (alternative driving issues) or analyze
alternatives (analysis driving issues) (FSH 1909.15 Ch. 12.4). Key issues were defined as those directly or
indirectly caused by implementing the proposed action. Non-key issues were identified as those that are: 1)
outside the scope of the proposed action; 2) irrelevant or unrelated to the decision to be made; 3) already
decided by law, regulation, Forest Plan, or other higher level decision; or 4) conjectural and not supported by
scientific or factual evidence. Other Comments were non-issues (e.g. no cause effect) or were identified as a
question or a general statement (general in nature). They will be addressed in this document.
The following are issues and comments identified from public scoping. Comments/issues were paraphrased
from sometimes lengthier or duplicative comments. Comments are also grouped by subject. The number
preceding the comment indicates the commenter. For example, (1) = Richard Artley.

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Analysis Driving Issues/Non-Key Issues/Other Comments
Fuels/Fire
Comment-1 - Even though severe wildfire can be a significant CO2 emissions event, its chance of occurring and
reaching a given stand relative to where the wildfire started is still very low, with or without fuel treatments on the
landscape.(5)
In spite of what we often hear, that federal forests are not at imminent risk of destruction by wildfire. Fire return
intervals remain relatively long, due to both natural factors and active fire suppression policies. Wildfire severity
also remains moderate. Most wildfires are NOT stand replacing. Most fires are in fact low and moderate severity.
(5)
In an effort to advance the discussion and help the agencies conduct better risk assessments in the NEPA
context we have prepared a white paper in an attempt to clarify the critical considerations in a probabilistic risk
assessment that compares the risk of logging versus wildfire. This report is most relevant in SW Oregon but the
proposed evaluative framework is applicable in the east Cascades, northern California, and elsewhere. (5)
The probabilistic element of the risk equation demands careful consideration. Both logging and fire have
meaningful consequences, so the issue really boils down to a comparative probabilistic risk assessment where
risk is characterized by two quantities: (1) the magnitude (severity) of the possible adverse consequence(s), and
(2) the likelihood (probability) of occurrence of each consequence. (5)

Discussion: See also the response to Comment-122 that addressed carbon and fire effects in the Northwest
Forest Plan area over the last 20 years, including to late-successional old growth and northern spotted owl
habitat. While fire occurrence has been very low in the Elk Flat LSR, fire hazard/fire risk in the 1999 LSRA
was determined to be moderate/moderate due to several large pockets of standing dead trees. Lightning
caused fires accounted for 92 percent of the recorded fire occurrences. Due to the ongoing beetle outbreak, the
incidence of dead trees has increased substantially. While snags and large down logs are an important habitat
component in the project area, they also serve as a high fire hazard at the current densities. Widespread high
concentrations of snags and down wood create a fuel hazard. With the current and projected fuel loads, the
risk of human caused starts has increased, notably along roads, due to public firewood cutting.
If a wildfire were to start during the summer fire behavior, current modeling (based on stand exam data)
predicts rates of spread, flame lengths, and resistance to control that would lead to high acreage burned and
significant post-fire adverse effects on resources. The high heat and potential for torching and spotting that
would result from a fire in the heavy mortality areas presents a risk to current and developing latesuccessional habitat, adjacent private lands and WUI. Without action, the density-related mortality, further
exacerbated by drought, disease and future insect attacks will continue to increase and spread throughout the
project area, contributing to higher levels of standing and dead fuels and increasing the risk of high severity,
stand-replacing fire. The high incidence of tree mortality leads to a high safety hazard for suppression
activities. If no actions are taken, the tree mortality leads to our inability to safely place firefighters in these
areas during a growing incident. This difficulty can lead to larger fires (Titus, 2015).
This is the fourth year of drought in California. The United States Drought Monitor- California, classifies the
area where the Elk project is located as “severe” (U.S. Drought Monitor, 2015). The severely dry local
conditions resulted in unusual pre-fire season wildfires on the Shasta-McCloud Management Unit as well as a
relative high number of fires on the unit that spread fairly rapidly, though were contained at relatively small
acreages due to aggressive initial attack and availability of necessary resources. There were 82 total wildfires
on the Shasta McCloud Management Unit this year, 48 of which were lightning caused ignitions. Some
notable fires on the Unit include the following:

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

The 10-year historical average of total fires in the United States has been 63,790 fires for a total acreage of
6,571,723 acres. Total fires in the United States for 2015 to date have been 54,493 for a total acreage of
9,753,465 acres. Overall, the number of fires has somewhat decreased across the United States but the fires
we are having are getting larger (Titus, 2015).
Comment-2 - We urge the USFS to aggressively treat areas in the McCloud Flats that are unhealthy due to various
issues such as Annosus, overstocking, hazardous fuel loading, etc. Previous efforts by the Forest to treat only
“Red & Dead” have proved unsuccessful and the Flats are now primed for catastrophic mortality from fire,
insects, or both. (4)
Sierra Pacific Industries urges the Forest Service to continue proposing and implementing similar projects aimed
at improving forest health and restoring fire adapted ecosystems. (4)

Discussion: The Elk project was designed to treat current mortality (red and dead), along with the
surrounding forest stands to increase the resilience of the late-successional reserve and reduce the risk of
further stand and late-successional habitat loss. Treatments in natural stands and plantations are designed to
reduce stocking levels, increase tree size (thereby contributing to larger snags and down wood in the LSR),
and increase diversity and within-and between-stand heterogeneity making the stands more resilient to
uncharacteristic fire or epidemic insects and disease.
The goal for the U.S. Forest Service’s Pacific Southwest Region is to retain and restore ecological resilience
of the National Forest lands to achieve sustainable ecosystems that provide a broad range of services to
humans and other organisms. A portion of the Forest’s ecological resilience strategy includes the Integrated
Vegetation Management Strategy. The dominant Forest values emphasized for restoration and protection
through enhancing wildfire resiliency were water, wildlife, and wildland-urban-interface. Key components of
implementing the strategy include designing and developing treatments that meet multiple resource objectives
and taking advantage of large contiguous areas for landscape scale (USDA-FS, 2013c p. SHF p. 99). The
Forest is also operating in compliance with direction and standards and guidelines from the Northwest Forest
Plan (NWFP), Forest Plan and Forest’s Late-Successional Reserve Assessment (LSRA) with the project
where the balance between improving forest health, restoring fire-adapted ecosystems needs to be carefully
weighed with the intent of the LSR’s function.
Comment-3 - Yarding tops and lopping and scattering should take care of most of the fuels issues within the treated
stands. (2)

Discussion: Yarding tops and lopping and scattering is expected to minimize contributions to existing fuel
loading in treated stands. To the extent possible, felled trees would be whole-tree skidded to designated
landings for processing. Some slash would remain in the woods due to branch and top breakage during felling
and skidding, or because of mechanical felling and yarding equipment limitations. For example, some trees
that are over 24 inches at the stump may be hand felled with chainsaws, with the first two logs getting limbed
to protect the residual stand from undue damage. The need for fuels treatment is based primarily on the
existing natural fuels.
In areas with high levels of mortality (50-80% of more of a stand), the size and volume of fuels are too great
to safely and effectively pile by hand or underburn only and thus are proposed for machine piling. Where
there are heavy concentrations of surface and standing dead fuels that exceed the desired conditions as
specified in the resource protection measures (typically more than 40 tons per acre), machine piling and
burning of some piles would be utilized as a pretreatment before underburning. This would increase
consumption of excess fuels over what underburning would accomplish, and would limit adverse effects to
overstory trees, soils and wildlife habitat. Prescribed burning would help reduce excess fuels, but is also
proposed to begin returning the natural role of fire to the ecosystem.
Comment-4 - The location, timing, and severity of future fire events cannot be predicted making it difficult to
determine which forests will benefit from treatment - consequently fuel treatments must be extensive and many

stands will be treated unnecessarily, thus incurring all the costs of fuel logging, but receiving none of the
beneficial effects on fire behavior. (5)

Discussion: The commenter is correct that it is not possible to know exactly where, when, how many acres, or
what the effects would be from a wildfire in the analysis area. As part of the No Action analysis, modeling of
existing conditions and a fire start on 90th and 97th percentile weather days, and projected mortality, will be
completed. As described in Comment-1, the project area conditions are such that if a wildfire were to start, the
results could lead to high burned acreage and substantial resources effects. Project treatments are intended to
reduce the risk of large-scale disturbance and increase stand resiliency to natural disturbances such as
wildfire, insects, disease, and drought. Returning the natural role of fire to landscape is also an objective.
Treatments will promote stand structure and variability, biological diversity and characteristics of old-growth
forests, while reducing overcrowding and fuel levels, allowing these stands to persist and/or grow into latesuccessional habitat (Franklin, et al., 2007; Blate, et al., 2009; Franklin, et al., 2002; Kennedy, et al., 2009;
Stephens, et al., 2008; Stephens, et al., 2010). Restoring these features would also further allow disturbance
processes to play their inherent role in maintaining these features (Noss, 2006).
Comment-5 - Both the habitat and the NSO evolved with fire and can live with fire; the LSRA states wildfire is
expected to occur in LSRs; and we are not persuaded by the WUI arguments. McCloud is 9 miles away and can’t
be considered a WUI under any definition. The McCloud sub-division is 1.25 miles away and that area too is not
considered a WUI by FS wildland fire researcher Bechsta. (7)

Discussion: LSRA desired conditions do indicate it is desirable to have low to moderate intensity fires burn in
LSRs/MLSAs (p. 163). The LSRA also includes that the greatest threat to further loss and degradation of
habitat for late-successional associated species is catastrophic wildfire within the California Klamath and
California Cascades Provinces. It goes on to explain that fuel reduction treatments within LSR/MLSAs will
be necessary given the extent of LSRs on the Forest landscape. Furthermore, fuel reduction activities within
stands of late-successional and old-growth forest habitat will be essential to maintaining and protecting them.
Low and moderate intensity fire is one of the important ecological processes that is essential for the
development and maintenance of late-successional and old-growth forest ecosystems (LSRA p. 174). If
meeting the LSR objectives, fuel reduction treatments are not considered incompatible with the LSRA. While
NSO evolved with fire, the Revised Recovery Plan for Northern Spotted Owl includes, among other
important range wide threats to spotted owl, “… ongoing loss of spotted owl habitat as a result of…habitat
loss or degradation from stand replacing wildfire and other disturbances...” (USDI-FWS, 2011 pp. viii, II-2).
The “Guidance for Implementation of Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy” (USDA-FS, 2009) defines
WUI as “The line, area, or zone where structures and other human development meet or intermingle with
undeveloped wildland or vegetation fuels”. Generally, the WUI on the Shasta-Trinity is concentric rings
around structures, or groups of structures up to 1.5 miles, as described in the Fire Reference System. Within
the Elk project boundary, the WUI is not associated with the community of McCloud, or the Mount Shasta
Forest subdivision, but private land, with infrastructure to the southwest of the project boundary. WildlandUrban interface overlays land allocations and is displayed in Appendix D – Maps (Figure Appendix E-8).
The project area incorporates approximately 1,135 acres of WUI within the Zone 4-Threat Zone as defined in
the Forest’s Fire Reference System (USDA-FS, 2015). Zone 4 is the area beyond the ¼-mile defense zone
surrounding structures out to an approximate distance of 1.5 miles. The goal is to achieve an environment
where crown fires, headed towards communities, become surface fires within this zone before encountering
the “defense zone”. The wildfire behavior goal is to develop a fuels profile that will have moderate wildfire
intensities determined by flame length of 4 to 8 feet or less on a 90th percentile fire weather day over most of
the land base.”
Comment-6 - The project should carefully look at fuels reduction options. Hand piling should be the last option as it is
very expensive and can lead to a nonviable project. (2)

B-4

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Discussion: Fuel reduction options will be carefully assessed. As noted in Comment-3, some fuels are too
large and thus hand piling is not a feasible option. In sensitive areas, hand piling may be used as long as it is
safe to do so (material size, amount).
Comment-7 - The FS continues to trumpet the risk of wildfire which is virtually non-existent in the SMMU due to all
the roads and clearcuts on private lands, and FS lands. In fact, the ‘risk’ of wildfire is driving this entire project.
Again, we are curious to see the BAS the Forest is using in light of virtually all of the science in the past 5 years
refuting the FS assertions, including papers researched by the FS. (7)

Discussion: Project area stand conditions indicate that wildland fire hazard is high for the project area even
though historical starts (risk) are relatively low. As noted in Comment-1, the fire risk/hazard was identified in
1999 as moderate/moderate due to the mortality pockets which have since substantially increased. As
discussed in Comment-1, if a wildfire were to start during the summer, modeling predicts a high acreage
burned and significant post-fire adverse effects on resources. High heat and potential torching and spotting
from a fire in the heavy mortality areas presents a risk to current and developing late-successional habitat,
adjacent private lands and WUI. This EIS and the fire and fuels analysis cite scientific literature relied upon.
Comment-8 -.The entire project area is proposed for underburning after thinning treatments are completed. Multiple
similar projects have been proposed and implemented throughout the eastside of the Shasta-Trinity National
Forest. Please provide timelines for fuel treatments and analyze and disclose; how successful or unsuccessful
follow-up fuels treatments have been on forest timber sales, the likelihood of such treatments happening and
how treatment goals and objectives would be affected if fuels treatments are not carried out. (9)

Discussion: Fuels treatments can begin as soon as the timber sale is released by the timber sale administrator.
We would typically burn the landing piles in the first winter after they are released. Any machine piling within
post-harvest units, or other areas with high fuel accumulations, would typically begin the summer after is the
area is available/released from the timber sale. Piling is typically done during the summer to ensure the
material is dry, making for better consumption during burning. Machine piles would typically be burned the
winter after they are piled, and the project may include protection measures for leaving some piles unburned.
Underburning only could potentially occur at any time (depending on LOPs), but would be contingent on the
timber sale operator and contract agreement. Underburning in harvest units could begin in the spring or fall
(depending on LOP’s) after pile burning is completed. The SMMU fuels department also typically waits for
an entire “burn block” to be available in order to take advantage of using roads as control lines.
The SMMU fuels department also utilizes our own employees and our own equipment to complete all of the
fuels treatments. We do not need to wait on funding to become available, or follow timelines for contracting.
Our employees and our equipment are funded every year.
The SMMU fuels department has completed all of the piling that is available from past timber sales and
restoration projects. We have approximately 1000 acres of underburning to complete. In fall 2015, we were
able to complete second entry underburning.
The SMMU has been very successful in completing follow-up fuels treatments quickly, and in accordance
with any protection measures and new information by working with staff (soils, wildlife, botany and
hydrology). Based on monitoring, most treatments have been very effective in reducing surface fuel loading
and returning fire back to the landscape. In other cases, timing of burns or soil/duff conditions either resulted
in too hot of a burn in certain areas (aspen), or inadequate fuel consumption in other areas. The SMMU will
continue to monitor underburning, piling/burning and any other fuels treatments on a project-by-project basis
and incorporate any lessons into an adaptive management program.
If follow-up fuels treatments are not completed for the Elk project in those areas where they are deemed
necessary (machine piling, hand piling, underburning), the stands will not be entirely resilient for
uncharacteristic wildfire, insects and disease. Surface fuel loading within the project area is currently well
above Forest Plan standards. Fire exclusion has resulted in overstocking of white fir, cedar and pine

regeneration in the understory in some areas, excessive surface fuel loading and reduced nutrient cycling.
Follow-up fuels treatments are essential for meeting the objectives of the Elk project.

Forestry/Silviculture
Comment-9 - We urge the planning team to consider the following findings from your colleagues in the Rogue River
Siskiyou National Forest contained in the 2012 Bybee timber sale EA indicating that proposed logging activities
in the LSR may increase the impacts of existing pathogens:
A-15: Armillaria Root Disease “is often associated with trees under stress or where human caused disturbance is
evident.”
A-15: Annosus Root Disease “fungus can be found fruiting in scuffed white fir and western hemlock
stumps…infection and mortality are much greater in true fir stands that have been entered more than once than
in stands that have not been entered…”
A-16: Black Stain Root Disease is “associated with roadsides, skid trails, landings, [and] with trees on compacted
soils, recently cut thinning stumps and slash.”
A-17: Pine engravers are associated with logging slash and windthrow material.

Discussion: We recognize the insects and disease are important components of LSR, and that activities
intending to reduce large scale risk can in fact contribute to changes in existing pathogens. The project
includes design features or resource protections to limit undesired increases.
Armillaria is a root disease typically associated with sites that have been converted from oak stands to
plantations. It can also be found around dead oaks that have died from suppression or other causes and are
spreading the root disease to the surrounding conifers. Since this disease is more damaging in stressed stands,
thinning to avoid overcrowding, and not cutting or killing oaks near conifers are recommended.
Black stain root disease usually is found in areas where there has been significant site disturbance or
substantial amounts of tree injury. Stands with black stain are usually densely stocked and consist of either
pure or predominantly ponderosa pine. The largest and most rapidly expanding disease centers are often in
cool, low lying sites with high soil moisture levels in the spring. Thinning to reduce the frequency of harvest
entries and opening stands for warmer soils would inhibit black stain and reduce root contact between
susceptible trees. Trees that are not hosts to black stain would be retained. Thinning generally from late June
to early September would help limit impacts when insect vectors are most active. When establishing new
stands near areas where black stain has been a concern, a mix of species should be planted. Reintroducing
frequent low intensity ground fires into the landscape also disfavors black stain.
Annosus infection centers start when airborne spores produced by the conks land and grow on freshly cut
stump surfaces of all species. Infection in true fir may also occur through fire and mechanical wounds on the
butt. Fresh basal wounds on species other than true fir are rarely colonized. Treating freshly cut conifer
stumps greater than 14” across with a borate compound will help reduce the infection sites created by the
newly made stumps.
Pine engraver beetle (Ips) is most easily recognized by the rows of spines on the posterior ends of their wing
covers. In standing trees, fading tops of large trees or whole crowns in small trees can be indicators of Ips
infestation. Other external evidence consists of accumulations of boring dust in bark crevices and at the base
of the tree. Thinning activities should be concentrated between the months of August and December so slash
will dry out and will no longer be suitable for the first generation of beetles flying in April. An alternative
approach is to generate enough additional fresh slash in mid-summer to absorb the emerging second
generation and provide the beetles with an alternative to standing trees. Also, slash less than 3 inch diameter is
of little consequence in terms of brood production for Ips.

Comment-10 - Ground-based logging causes higher incidences of root damage and scarring of residual trees
(compared to skyline systems). (6)

Discussion: The DEIS will disclose the effects of the proposed activities relative to forest health. Logging can
create tree scars, which become potential infection sites for diseases, and insects can be attracted to the
wounds. Tree wounds and root damage are kept to a minimum by discouraging operators from damaging
trees. Mechanical and staged falling operations, proper skid trail design and contract provisions that limit tree
damage (e.g. B6.32 Protection of Residual Trees) can address root damage and tree scarring as well as onsite
sale administration of the contract. Project RPMs also help to minimize disturbance of soil and other
resources values. Skidding and landing use will be restricted to existing skid trails and landings where
possible. Adhering to BMPs will minimize erosion, compaction and subsequent root damage. The sale
administrators work with operators to minimize disturbance and damage.
Comment-11 - Logging to control insects and disease is controversial and scientifically debatable. It has not proven
to work in these watersheds. Please include and make available all science used to support any conclusions in
the forthcoming NEPA document. (9)
There is even less evidence that we can control insects once an outbreak starts. Citing several sources Hughes
and Drever (2001) assert that the weight of opinion seems to be that most control efforts to date have had little
effect on the final size of outbreaks, although they may have slowed beetle progress and prolonged outbreaks in
some cases. (6)
Bark beetles are always widespread and quite common. Even if an agency can control them in a stand of trees it
is likely to have little impact on infestation on a landscape scale. According to Wilson and Celaya (1998), removal
of infested trees may provide some protection to surrounding trees, but these insects [Western pine beetle] are
very common, so removal of a few infested trees is not a guarantee of protection. (6)
Although the Forest Service often asserts that the most effective means of reducing losses to the western pine
beetle is by risk rating trees with subsequent removal of those that are high-risk. There is no evidence that this
works to protect trees in a diverse forest.(6)
In some situations, removal of infested trees prior to emergence of brood is recommended in an attempt to
protect surrounding trees. However, the overall effectiveness of this strategy is unproven (Wilson and Celaya
1998). Further, in most forest situations, it is not feasible to locate and remove all trees prior to emergence.
(Wilson and Celaya 1998) (6)
A recent report by the Xerces Society includes a summary of relevant studies on the importance of insects to
forest function and the methods used to control forest ""pest"" insects, and a compilation of summaries of over
150 scientific papers and Forest Service documents. The report may be downloaded in .pdf format from
http://www.xerces.org/Forest_Pest_Myths/Logging_to_Control_Insects.htm"
Key findings in the report include:
Native forest pests have been part of our forests for millennia and function as nutrient recyclers; agents of
disturbance; members of food chains; and regulators of productivity, diversity, and density.
Fire suppression and logging have led to simplified forests that may increase the risk of insect outbreaks.
Forests with diverse tree species and age classes are less likely to develop large insect outbreaks.
There is no evidence that logging can control bark beetles or forest defoliators once an outbreak has started.
Although thinning has been touted as a long-term solution to controlling bark beetles, the evidence is mixed as to
its effectiveness. The report also outlines general guidelines to follow when considering pest insects and forest
management.
A review of over three hundred papers on the subject reveals that logging is not the solution to forest insect
outbreaks and In the long run, logging could increase the likelihood of forest insect epidemics. (6)
Even more striking is the paucity of studies that have examined the consequences of human intervention on pest
movement patterns. In fact, we know of no studies that have experimentally evaluated the effects of
management strategies on the dispersal of insect pests in forest systems. (6)

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

As in the Elk project, logging is often recommended to control outbreaks of bark beetles but there is little direct
evidence that this works. Much relies on the assumption that as tree vigor increases the trees are able to ward of
infestation by insects. Some scientists have suggested caution in using thinning to control bark beetles as
geographic and climactic variables may alter the effect. (Hindmarch and Reid 2001). Hindmarch and Reid (2001)
found that thinned stands exhibited a higher attraction rate of mates by males of Ips pini, while females had
longer egg galleries, more eggs per gallery and higher egg densities. Warmer temperatures in thinned stands
also contributed to a higher reproduction rate. The number of males and females setting on logs was also higher
in thinned stands. However, pine engravers in Arizona responded differently to thinning (see Villa-Castillo and
Wagner 1996).(6)
Wickman (1990) detailed the effort to control the Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) at Crater
Lake National Park from 1925 to 1934. Although he did not calculated how many trees in the areas were treated
(cut down and then burned) in the nine year period, over 48,000 were treated in a three year period alone. The
main lesson learned was that once a mountain pine beetle population erupts over a large area of susceptible
forest type, and as long as environmental conditions remain favorable, there really is no way to stop it until
almost all the susceptible trees are either killed or removed by logging. Treating trees perhaps slows the
progress of the outbreak, but the outcome is inevitable. (Pg 38) Wickman (1990) The report goes on to state
“Perhaps the cold winter in 1932-33 helped, but most importantly, the depletion of susceptible trees ended the
outbreak rather than the annual control efforts for 10 years. Wickman (1990)"(6)
"In 1984, lodgepole pine stands in central Oregon were once again infested with mountain pine beetle. By 1985 a
severe outbreak covered thousands of acres and extended south nearly to the park boundary. In 1986, beetlekilled trees were found in the northern end of the park (Wickman 1990). In the end the control methods did not
work."(6)

Discussion: Logging to control insects and disease is not proposed. The proposed treatments are aimed at
reducing inter-tree competition and increasing the resiliency of these stands, which will increase the tree’s
resistance to insect attacks when they occur.
Diseases, insects, and other natural disturbance factors are important shapers of landscapes. As described in
the purpose and need, it is desired that levels of mortality from these natural disturbance factors are closer to
endemic levels; about 0.2 to 0.5 percent of standing live biomass mortality per acre per year, with occasional
spikes of 1.0 to 1.5 percent during drought periods. The project does call for providing conditions in treated
stands that increase the capacity of remaining stands to respond to and withstand natural disturbances so that
large habitat losses are not sustained (USDA-FS, 1999).
Researchers began to recognize the importance of tree stocking control to reduce bark beetle activity in about
1941 (Eaton 1941 in (Oliver, 1995). Within the last several decades, a number of studies examined the
relationships between tree thinning to reduce bark beetle activity and risk. Many of the studies observed
decreased bark beetle activity with decreased tree stocking required to prevent endemic and epidemic levels
of bark beetle mortality in even-aged pine stands in Northern California levels ( (Fettig, et al., 2007; Cochran,
et al., 1995; Cochran, et al., 1999; Schmid, et al., 2005; Oliver, et al., 1997; Fiddler, et al., 1989; Oliver,
1995). They considered stand density index of 230 to be the “zone of imminent bark beetle mortality.”
Variable density thinning does not include a singular density target, and instead is a treatment that thins to
retain a range of densities by including areas of heavy thinning or small openings (radial release, gaps, or
group selections), unthinned patches (UTPs that are also referred to as skips), and thinning within a target
basal area range elsewhere within the stand. In any case, the thinning reduces stand densities. Scientific
literature supports the use of thinning in ponderosa pine to lessen disease viability and spread ( (Kliejunas,
1992; Otrosina, et al., 2007; Woodruff, 2002). Silvicultural treatments can be used to create conditions that
increase stand resilience (promoting sustainability) and accelerate the rate at which larger tree sizes are
attained. It can also be used to introduce spatial and species heterogeneity within stands.
Comment-12 - While the Forest Service should examine, incorporate and respond to all of the relevant peerreviewed citations regarding insects and disease contained in the Xerces Report, we hereby especially highlight
four papers for your consideration.

Discussion: (Schowalter, 1990)and (Schowalter, 1995) are discussed in the Xerces Report. As summed in
Xerces, the 1990 paper discuss that healthy trees and diverse forests, including old growth forest, are resistant
to potential pests. The 1995 paper indicated that arthropod community structure diversity and abundance for
several taxa was significantly lower in plantations than older forests and concluded that reduced predator
diversity could lead to a greater likelihood of pest outbreaks. We were unable to locate Scholwalter et. al
1989.
The project maintains the largest oldest trees (predominants and dominants) that exhibit old-growth
characteristics such as large boles, decadent branching, cavities and flattened tops would be retained as long
as they are not a safety hazard. All predominant trees would be retained, regardless of their current health/
condition when marking. The preponderance of the activity is in thinning; reforestation of the groups/gaps is a
small proportion of the treatment areas. Where that occurs though, the gaps will be planted with a mix of
species to promote diversity.
The mixed conifer types in the project area support a variety of species in the overstory, while the ponderosa
pine does to a lesser degree. Variable density thinning includes promoting stand structure variability,
biological diversity and characteristics of old-growth forests by inducing fine-scale variation in homogeneous
second-growth forest canopies. As noted about, the groups/gaps would be planted with a mixture of species.
These may include ponderosa pine, sugar pine, Douglas-fir, incense cedar and hardwoods such as black oak.
The assessment area also exhibits a mixture of age classes.
Comment-13 - AFRC wants to go on record of not supporting alternatives that set diameter limits within any land
allocation. Concerned about diameter limited being counterproductive to meeting the purpose and
need/hindering ability to meet identified desired conditions, incompatible with land management goals for this
project area, arbitrary and capricious, not scientifically supported (e.g. why one particular diameter is more
appropriate than another diameter. (2)
Instead of setting arbitrary diameter limits it is much better to describe the desired stand conditions following
treatment. Meeting those desired conditions can easily be monitored following implementation. (2)
It is critical as part of the NEPA analysis that desired stand characteristics for late-successional habitat is
displayed. We ask that you display the desired levels of trees per acre by size class, desired stocking levels,
desired snag and down log levels, and desired species makeup.(2)
The FS disclosed age classes but not diameter limits for the units proposed for logging. We specifically request
this information be disclosed in the DEIS. (7)

Discussion: The Forest Plan has no standard and guideline pertaining to diameter limits for timber
management. While there is no prescribed upper diameter limit for the project, or within specific treatment
units, the largest oldest trees (predominants and dominants) and those that exhibit old-growth characteristics
such as large boles, decadent branching, cavities and flattened tops would be retained as long as they are not a
safety hazard. In some treatment units, diameter limits are prescribed to meet certain habitat objectives (e.g.,
when conducting California black oak release within critical habitat for the northern spotted owl, certain
species of trees that are 24” or larger would not be cut to release oak). All predominant trees would be
retained, regardless of their current health/condition when marking. We recognize the importance of large
trees on the landscape for a variety of reasons including fire resiliency, various species’ habitat needs

(including NSO, northern goshawk, fisher and Pacific marten) and stand structural legacies, particularly in
LSR. Desired stand conditions are described in the Purpose and Need in Chapter 1.
Comment-14 - Note that the Thom Seider FEIS acknowledges that the diameter of conifer trees acts as a “measure
of resistance to fire.” Hence the forest health and fire resiliency goals of the Elk LSR timber sale project may be
best achieved by retaining such trees where they still exist in the watershed. (2)

Discussion: Fuel reduction actions designed to reduce fuels are based on several principles of forest fuel
reduction in dry forests: reducing surface fuels, increasing the distance between surface fuel and the live tree
crown (i.e. reducing ladder fuels), decreasing the density of tree crowns, and retaining fire-resistant trees
(Agee, et al., 2005). Trees to be thinned would primarily be midstory intermediate and smaller co-dominant
trees; primarily the shade tolerant white fir. See also Comment-13 regarding retention of the largest oldest
trees.
Comment-15 - As a forest industry and being professional foresters we are very concerned that good forestry be
practiced on the Forest Service land base. (2)

Discussion: The prescriptions were developed by a Certified Silviculturist. Best available science has been
reviewed in addressing project conditions and for methods to reach desired conditions and to meet direction
for the LSR and habitat recommendations for late-successional dependent species.
Comment-16 - Much of the area is currently experiencing extreme mortality due to black stain root disease and
subsequent bark beetle attacks. Hundreds of acres are currently dying because of these conditions. It is
imperative to control the spread of this mortality before the entire project area becomes affected. (2)
The Province Forest Pest Management (FPM) personnel have spent a considerable amount of time evaluating
the current mortality. The FPM staff has prepared recommendations on what should be done to control the
spread of the insect and disease problem. Many of these treatments are aggressive in terms of spacing
treatments and tree removal. These treatments will be a cause concern by groups and individuals who do not
have a concept of what it takes to deal with these disturbance factors or what it takes to responsibly manage the
forest. It is imperative the Interdisciplinary Team fully utilize the findings of the FPM staff in order to fully meet the
purpose and need of the project and stem the continued spread of mortality. It is also important because private
lands are being affected by the lack of treatment occurring on the Forest Service land base. (2)
There have been enough public meetings for this project. This project has been on the radar since 2009. Given
the dire conditions found across a large part of the project area, it is imperative that implementation occur very
rapidly. The drought outlook highlighted by the Province Entomologist at the meeting re-emphasized the
importance of enough talking and switching to emphasizing implementation. (2)

Discussion: As described in Chapter 1, there has been a marked increase in pine mortality over the past five
years within the project area. Expanded areas of mortality were observed in 2010 and 2012 and have
continued to expand. Mortality is occurring in the larger diameter (20-inch, plus) ponderosa pine as well as
spreading throughout plantations of varying ages. The primary purpose of the Elk LSR project is to reduce the
risk of stand and habitat loss in early, mid and late- successional habitat and to increase stand resilience to
disturbance. Project actions were designed to address this need as well as other secondary needs, in order to
meet the overarching objective for LSRs to protect and enhance conditions of late-successional forest
ecosystems.
Comment-17 - Much of the area within the project area cannot be maintained as dense stands over the long-term.
They are not resilient and historically never contained those types of stand conditions. The current insect and
disease problem clearly highlights what will happen if dense stands are desired for the future. We ask that the
analysis clearly display what type of late-successional habitat is sustainable for the long-term within this project
area. (2)
The document states that stand composition is shifting from predominantly pine to mixed conifer. This is actually
desirable for LSR/CHU and should not be a concern of the Forest. (7)

Discussion: As described in Chapter 1, approximately 75% of the 3,519-acre project area is classified as
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest. Southeast of Elk Flat, stands transition to a drier East Side Pine
B-10

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

forest type. In the northwest and western portions, approximately 10% is classified as Sierra Mixed Conifer
(SMC) and 15% is perennial grassland (PGS). These designations for the project area are based on the
California Wildlife Habitat Relationship (CWHR) System (CDFW, 2008) and cross-walked into the Forest’s
2007 Existing Vegetation Layer from the Regional Office’s Remote Sensing Lab. While ponderosa pine is the
primary stand component in the majority of the project area, it is also nested within mixed-conifer pine, and
white fir-pine stands. The ponderosa pine-dominated stands are located within the eastern and southeastern
portions of the project area, and the majority of the 20-40+ year old plantations. The younger plantations have
a wider range of species mix. Ponderosa pine cannot sustain in the long term at high stand densities that
provide over 70% canopy cover, and ponderosa pine-dominated stands do not provide for NSO nesting,
roosting or foraging habitat. They can provide dispersal habitat, depending on specific stand conditions and
other abiotic factors.
Comment-18 - Radial thinning as disclosed is completely subjective and inappropriate in LSR/CHU. Discretion
should not be given to either the FS or the timber contractors based on past performance. Trees must be marked
for cut and that information disclosed to the public. (7)

Discussion: The described radial thinning is consistent with the goals and objectives of the Northwest Forest
Plan, LSRA and recommendations for dry forest restoration principles within the Revised Recovery Plan.
This type of treatment can help assure that legacy structures remain on the landscape and also contribute to
increased heterogeneity and younger age classes. This type of treatment is primary proposed around the
predominant legacy pine in the project area that remains at risk. How and where these pine will be released
will be worked out through coordination and consultation with the public, the project silviculturist and
wildlife biologist and the FWS during consultation. Based on the future prescription details of “how many”
trees per acre or what species to radially thin, or areas to not use this treatment, the marking guides will
dictate what trees are retained or removed. Additionally, LSRA activity design criteria 4 objectives, leave tree
criteria, provide for culturing individual trees specifically for large crowns and limbs. The activity design
criteria 4 treatment standards include up to 15 percent of the area in heavily thinned patches, or in openings
up to 1/4 acre in size, to individual tree development.
Comment-19 - There are many plantations planned for treatment within the project area. We believe the proposed
Rx’s developed for these plantations fully meet the purpose and need for the project. Very wide spacing, creating
openings for age class diversity, and promoting species diversity are clearly needed for these plantations. We
will continue to support your proposals for treating the plantations within the project area and ask that you not
modify those proposed Rx’s because of other unwarranted concerns. (2)
We ask you to develop prescriptions that truly meet the particular needs of the stands and land base. We have
recently seen too many instances where prescriptions are developed to address public concerns from entities
that have personal agendas and biases and have no background or knowledge of the forest environment and
ecosystem. Prescriptions developed in these instances do not meet the needs of the stands, land allocation
standards and guides, project purpose and need, and long term forest protection and health. (2)
We feel this project needs to treat as many acres as possible in order to fully meet your designated purpose and
need. We encourage you not to reduce the project any further. (2)

Discussion: The general proposed actions that were developed and scoped were fully intended to address
differences between Forest Plan and LSR desired conditions and existing ground conditions. This includes
maintaining and protecting late-successional habitat. It is recognized that 24 percent of the project area is
within plantations (10-40+ years old) where thinning and other mechanical treatments would occur, they were
developed to reduce stocking and increase diversity, tree size and resilience. Part of the project’s design, given
existing conditions, also includes precluding treatment in certain areas that are functioning as quality latesuccessional habitat. Part of the NEPA process however, does involve scoping. Public scoping is used in
several ways but includes refining issues, establishing analysis criteria, and exploring possible alternatives
and their probable environmental effects (FSH 1909.15 ch.10 [11]). Issues derived from public scoping serve
to highlight effects or unintended consequences that may occur from the proposed action and alternatives,
giving opportunities during the analysis to reduce adverse effects and compare trade-offs for the decision

maker and public to understand. As such, there may be instances when alternatives, project design features or
resource protection measures are proposed to address issues and compare tradeoffs for better decision making.
See also Comment-15.
Comment-20 - I am concerned about proposals to log snags in the Elk Flat LSR. (8)

Discussion: Generally, logging snags is not proposed. In the event conditions deteriorate post-decision and
post marking, salvage of dead and dying trees may occur in conjunction with harvest in 12 ponderosa-pine
dominated treatment units. The extensive mortality area would be prescribed burned to reduce heavy fuels. If
safe, a combination of felling and machine piling may be used in this area. We recognize the importance of
snags (and logs) on the landscape for a variety of reasons species’ habitat needs (including NSO) and stand
structural legacies. The project includes specific criteria for retaining or protecting snags. For example, RPM
40a requires that within all thinning and fuels treatment units in LSR, 7 snags per acre ranging from 15 to 20+
inches diameter with a preference for snags larger than 20 inches or the largest size class available would be
retained, on average. RPM 40b requires retention of Douglas fir, sugar pine and incense cedar snags larger
than 20 inches diameter, safety and species ID permitting. Groups of snags would also be retained, where
safely feasible, in existing mortality pockets.
Comment-21 - The proposed action calls for creating a “buffer” of 50 feet around pockets of disease to prevent rootto-root contact as a means to thwart the spread of black stain and/or annosus. Does this mean you will thin 50
feet past the most distal tree exhibiting mortality characteristics or signs of infection? What exactly is your
definition of “buffer” in this situation? (4)

Discussion: The “young plantation thin with interplant” prescription applies to those young ponderosa pine
plantations with recent mortality from blackstain root disease or Western Pine Beetle activity. These
plantations have moderate/WPB varying to high levels of mortality, and often include scattered residual pole
to young mature overstory trees (e.g. units 113 , 123, 124 and 125). Among other things, this prescription
would remove all pine symptomatic of black stain and remove pine within 100 feet of symptomatic trees and
mortality pockets (dead and dying trees) and outside of mortality pockets and the 100 foot buffer zones, thin
pine to an average 50 foot spacing to avoid root-to-root contact and maximize growth,
Comment-22 - We were somewhat amused at the Elk Flat 1944 photo that allegedly shows open space. The FS
forgot to also state that the forested area in the 1944 photo no longer exists and has largely been clearcut. This
isn’t 1944. We have climate change as well as a threatened species with designated critical habitat that didn’t
exist in 1944. That photo is irrelevant to the discussion today. (7)

Discussion: It is not entirely clear what the commenter meant by “the FS forgot to also state that the forested
area in the 1944 photo no longer exists and has largely been clearcut.” Based on 1998 aerial photography, the
extent of the meadow at Elk Flat was less than 50 percent of its extent in 1944 (see also the 2012 and 1944
aerial photography comparison, which shows continued meadow area loss from encroaching conifer, Figure
12 in Chapter 1 for more information on Elk Flat).
Elk Flat appears to be in a drying phase which is allowing tree encroachment to occur (in combination with
other factors such as fire suppression). Currently, the water table is greater than a meter below ground surface
in most years. In the past, sufficient seasonal runoff likely provided a higher water table with adequate soil
moisture to support perennial grasses and forbs. Due to the current gully confinement, and lower seasonal
water table, Swamp Creek is no longer able to hydrate the meadow. Although, during periods of snowmelt
and rainfall, relict multiple channels on the meadow experience minor flooding and transport of sand and
gravels, this is a minor contribution to the larger-scale disturbance required to maintain the natural opening. In
addition to reducing conifer encroachment to restore the dry meadow system, restoration of the natural water
table is also important to restoration of the Elk Flat dry meadow ecosystem.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

While it is not specific to the treatment proposed in and around the edges of the meadow at Elk Flat, there is
no designated critical habitat for the NSO in this area, and this area largely does not function as suitable or
dispersal habitat for the NSO. See also the response to Comment-123 that addresses climate change.”
Comment-23 While it is not specific to the treatment proposed in and around the edges of the meadow at Elk Flat,
there is no designated critical habitat for the NSO in these area, and this area largely does not function as
suitable or dispersal habitat for the NSO.- The fact the FS would consider salvage logging of large dead trees,
preferred by late-successional species; with regeneration harvesting and planting in an LSR and CHU speaks
volumes to the fact this project is nothing more than a timber grab of old growth and late-successional trees.
There is simply no legitimate science to back-up this method of logging in LSR/CHU. (7)
I am concerned about proposals to conduct regeneration logging and proposals to log large trees in the Elk Flat
LSR. (8)

Discussion: There is no regeneration logging or mechanical regeneration treatments proposed with the Elk
project. The primary purpose of the project is to reduce the risk of stand loss in early, mid and latesuccessional habitat and increase stand resilience to disturbance. Other objectives include accelerating
development of late-successional and old-growth forest characteristics and promoting connectivity; restoring
Elk Flat meadow habitat; retaining and promoting hardwoods, etc., as described in Chapter 1. As described in
the response to Comment-13, the largest, oldest trees are proposed for retention. Additionally, unthinned
patches, designated no-treatment areas, and habitat roost/rest clumps would retain small and large tree
patches, often with late-successional characteristics. Project actions and potential effects to habitat and species
were and will be weighed seriously against the need for long-term habitat resilience and persistence. Best
available science on restoring dry forest ecosystems and balancing those activities with species habitat and
life-history needs was utilized to develop the project, including that provided by the public during scoping.
The proposed silvicultural methods that increase resilience and restore heterogeneity within and between
stands, and also maintain existing late-successional habitat elements (legacy structures such as large trees,
snags, down wood) support the project’s intent (Franklin, 2002; Franklin, 2013; USDI-FWS, 2011; Blate, et
al., 2009; Franklin, et al., 2007; Kennedy, et al., 2009) (Stephens, et al., 2008; Stephens, et al., 2010; Bull, et
al., 1980; Marshall, et al., 2003a; Marshall, 2003; Lehmkuhl, et al., 2003; Wisdom, et al., 2000). The
proposed action overall is consistent with the goals and objectives of the Northwest Forest Plan and LSRA,
though certain actions will be reviewed by the Regional Ecosystem Office for consistency. For example,
LSRA activity design criteria 6 addresses hazard reduction relative to blowdown, insects or wildfire (LSRA,
1999 p. 189). LSRA activity design criteria #9 addresses fuel reduction and prescribed burning (LSRA, 1999
p. 192).
Comment-24 We did not see any numbers regarding canopy closure? What is the canopy closure pre-project and
post-project? This information needs to be disclosed in the DEIS. (7)

Discussion: A suite of attributes relative to wildlife habitat, including canopy closure will be summarized in
the affected environment portion of the Chapter 3 wildlife section in this EIS. The Biological Assessment will
also include the pre- and post-canopy closure/cover information for proposed thinning stands. The reported
post-treatment information is based on FVS modeling however (combined with monitoring of similar
treatments), and should not be considered an absolute representation of post-treatment stand conditions. For
example, the thinning that is modeled will not account for the retained unthinned patches and retained
rest/roost habitat within thinning units that would continue to contribute to canopy closure and
thermoregulatory sites closures within the stand.
Comment-25 -. All treatments should be aggressive enough in order to maintain effectiveness for at least 30-40
years.(2)
The analysis needs to display time frame effectiveness for the proposed treatments in terms of meeting the
designed purpose and need and long-term desired condition. (2)

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

B-13

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Discussion: For the majority of natural stands, depending on the stand objective, the thinning prescriptions
were developed to remain effective for about 20 years. Prescribed burning would be effective for about ten
years and with the repeated burn entries (up to 3), would be effective for about 30 years. While not the 30-40
year timeframe as suggested, it is consistent with direction from the Regional Forester (Blackwell, 2004).
Timeframe effectiveness is discussed in Chapter 3.
Comment-26 The current stand conditions are in dire need of treatment. The NEPA analysis needs to state whether
the proposed action will meet the desired long-term stand and project objectives. If it doesn’t we want to know
how many more entries will be required to meet the desired long-term stand characteristics. (2)

Discussion: The DEIS will discuss the alternatives achievement of purpose and need. A description of
anticipated entries is included in Chapter 2, as needed (e.g. number of prescribed fire entries to meet desired
conditions). See also Comment-25.
Comment-27 - We also request how much old growth remains in the LSR and how much this project will log. We
also request how much old growth acreage (NOT general late-successional habitat) that remains in the 5th field
watershed for this project. On the STNF, old growth is defined as trees 180 years old and above. The project will
log 150 year old trees, well on their way to old growth status. How many of these trees will be cut? We request
stand exam data be included in the DEIS or Silviculture Report that documents the exact units and number of
trees 80 years old and above, that will be logged and their diameter limits. This information must be disclosed
since the Forest states that variable density thinning will be based on “average tree diameter.” We are also
opposed to this method of thinning since basal areas for units can’t be disclosed. The Forest can’t ensure
adequate basal area will be maintained in late-successional habitat without disclosing the pre and post project
basal areas for each unit. (7)

Discussion: The project will not treat old growth stands (there are none). Scattered, individual trees, remnants
from historic stands, are occasionally present. Within treated stands, all predominant and most dominant trees
would be retained, regardless of their current health/condition when marking. The largest oldest trees that
exhibit old-growth characteristics such as large boles, decadent branching, cavities and flattened tops would
also be retained as long as they are not a safety hazard. The stand age range for the oldest treated stands in the
project is 80-120 years old, though there are remnant trees that are older within these stands and these fit into
the ‘predominant’ and late-successional trees with old-growth characteristics. Common Stand Exam data was
collected in 2007 and will be included in the project record. It was and will be utilized to model the estimated
tree growth and snag development post-treatment and 20 years post-treatment. Stand age ranges are also listed
by unit in Appendix A, Table Appendix B-1. The seral stage information for the 5th field watershed will be
included in the vegetation diversity report, the silviculture report or included in the EIS.
The scoping document does not state that “variable density thinning will be based on “average tree diameter””
as noted in the comment. Rather, it states: “Forest stand species diversity, hardwood diversity, existing
openings, large down logs, snags and other structural components of suitable NSO habitat have been
documented and these areas are either targeted for retention in variable density thinning prescriptions, or
would be included in the 10 percent unthinned areas within LSR treatment units….Residual density in the
natural stand thinning units would vary from an average 125 to 175 square feet of basal area per acre, but may
be higher or lower depending on species composition and current habitat function for NSO. Depending on the
average tree diameter, this equates to approximately 60 to 100 trees per acre. Lower densities would be
applied in areas that are predominantly dominated by ponderosa pine and higher densities would be retained
in mixed conifer and white fir dominated stands. Higher densities would also be retained where clumped
groups of large trees, and smaller biomass sized (trees <10 inches DBH), occur to provide for age class and
structural variability. Instead of applying one target basal area across a stand, the variable density thinning
prescription would help promote within-stand structural heterogeneity that contributes to habitat function for
late-successional species while providing the needed growing space, nutrients and water for the remaining
trees.” While tree diameters are mentioned, it is not as a function of tree selection during the variable density
thinning treatment, but as a measure to describe the estimated residual trees per acre.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Comment-28 - The agency must carefully review and document their consideration of all the reasons not to log
mature forests set forth in this paper: To address this short-fall of old-growth forests it is necessary to protect
mature forests and trees because (a) they are already provide some values associated with old growth forests
and b) they are poised to become old growth more quickly. This paper also urges not just conservation of
existing old growth but also the ecological processes that sustain and continuously recruit old growth. (5)
If mature forest is left unprotected, some members of the environmental community will distrust the agencies and
oppose them on many fronts. (5)
Leaving mature forests unprotected would leave substantial areas of roadless lands subject to future conflict.
Many westside roadless areas may not qualify as old-growth, but still provide important values as roadless and
mature forests. (5)
"Why Mature Forests Must be Protected. “As recognized by FEMAT, a conservation strategy for the Pacific
Northwest must consider mature forests as well as OG. Forests are considered to enter maturity when their
mean annual increment culminates, following which time they begin developing the characteristics that ultimately
produce OG. Mature forests serve various important ecologic functions. They serve as future replacements for
old-growth, help protect existing OG by reducing the starkness of age-class boundaries, and provide landscape
connectivity and transitional habitat that compensate to some degree for the low levels of OG. Moreover, they
are almost certainly more resistant to crown fires than younger forests, and hence contribute to buffering the
landscape.” (5)
Mature forests provide essential habitat for the species we are most concerned with such as: spotted owl,
marbled murrelet, Pacific salmon, and most of the “survey and manage” species.
There is a serious region-scale deficit in mature and old-growth forest habitat. Over time, the Northwest Forest
Plan seeks to re-establish 3.44 million acres of mature and old-growth forest
(http://web.archive.org/web/20030402090844/http://www.fs.fed.us/land/fm/oldgrow/oldgrow.htm) (Accessed
7/31/2012).
By continuing to log mature forests we are significantly delaying this recovery. If we are going to make a timely
recovery from that deficit, and give struggling species a chance to survive the habitat bottleneck that we have
created, we must protect mature forests so that they can become old-growth, and we must manage young forest
so they can become mature. (5)
The transition from mature forest to old growth is a process that takes time and varies depending on factors such
as location and species and disturbance events. In a mature forest, all the ingredients are there to make old
growth (e.g., large trees) and the scientists agree that these forests need protection to help meet the current oldgrowth forest deficit. (5)
Protecting mature and old-growth forest leads to a real ecological solution, while protecting only old-growth is
merely a partial solution to an ecological problem that is bigger than just old-growth. (5)
Cutting mature forest will remain controversial and socially unacceptable. If we seek to resolve conflict over
management of older forests, protecting the old-growth while leaving mature forests unprotected would be only
half a solution and would lead to more conflict. Shifting to a restoration paradigm gets everyone at the table
working toward the same goal. (5)
The architects of the Northwest Forest Plan found that many of our best large intact forest landscapes are
mature forests, not old-growth. Some large forest fires burned westside forests between 1840 and 1910 and
many such areas were skipped over by the timber harvest planners because they were more intent on converting
the very old forests to tree plantations. These former fire areas, now mature forests, offer some of our best hopes
of recreating large blocks of intact older forest. (5)
The agency must protect mature forests because they are the best candidates to grow and develop into oldgrowth habitat in the shortest time frame. (5)

Discussion: Initial logging occurred in the project area in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Large overstory
ponderosa pine and sugar pine as well as Douglas-fir were preferentially removed, with smaller trees and less
marketable species being left. Selective overstory cutting has occurred over roughly the last 20 to 40 years.
The average measured age of the natural stands is approximately 55 to 95 years (while the estimated stand
ages in natural stands are 60-90 or 80 to 120), with a minor scattered component of older remnant trees (see
also Comment-27).

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Mature forests are defined as stands are generally greater than 80-100 years old and less than 180-200 years
old (USDA-FS, 1994 pp. FEIS Glossary p. F-4, VIII-II) (FEMAT, 1993 pp. IX-20). Old-growth forests are
defined as forest stands usually at least 180-220 years old (USDA-FS, 1994 pp. FEIS Glossary p. F-4, VIII-II)
(FEMAT, 1993 pp. IX-24)in wet climates, on productive sites, old-growth characteristics can begin to develop
as early as 150 years. On dry sites (such as the project area), stands may be well over 180 years before these
characteristics develop (LSRA, 1999 p. 1). As described at Comment-36, per the Forest Plan (pp. 4-37) and
Northwest Forest Plan (pp. C-13), while risk reduction efforts should generally be focused on young stands,
activities in older stands may be appropriate if: (1) the proposed management activities will clearly result in
greater assurance of long-term maintenance of habitat, (2) the activities are clearly needed to reduce risks, and
(3) the activities will not prevent the LSR from playing an effective role in the objectives for which they were
established. The Northwest Forest Plan indicates younger stands are stands less than about 80 years old
(USDA-FS & USDI-BLM, 1994 pp. C-12).
See Comment-13 for retention of the largest, oldest trees. The project specifically retains (does not treat)
unthinned patches and habitat roost/rest clumps.
The project area is well roaded; containing an approximate road density of 3.32 miles per square mile (does
not meet the criteria of a roadless area) 108.
Comment-29 - Cutting mature forests is not needed for ecological reasons. These forests are already exhibiting the
characteristics that provide excellent habitat and they continue to develop and improve without human
intervention. As recognized in the Northwest Forest Plan standards and guidelines for Late Successional
Reserves, stands over 80 years old do not need to be manipulated to become old-growth. All the ingredients are
there, they just need time. (5)

Discussion: Many of the natural stands in the Elk LSR contain elements of late successional habitat and
provide stand structural conditions suitable as either spotted owl nesting/roosting or foraging habitat. These
stands generally meet all of the Forest Plan classification elements of older late-seral stands except for canopy
closure. Currently, there is a shortage of high quality late-successional habitat in the Elk Flat LSR. Many latesuccessional stands are deficient in structural diversity.
As described in the Chapter 1 however, these stands are at risk of loss from large-scale disturbance events
such as insect outbreaks, diseases, and fire. The project was designed to enhance and protect important late
successional habitat and components in the project area in the short term while addressing objectives to
reduce large-scale risk, accelerate development of late successional habitat, and other stated project needs.
Comment-30 - Complicated environmental analysis will be required for logging mature forests compared to thinning
plantations. Wildlife surveys will be needed. Environmental Impact Statements will more often be needed instead
of abbreviated Environmental Assessments. Formal consultation under the Endangered Species Act will more
often be triggered. (5)

Discussion: The DEIS and/or supporting specialist reports will address Forest Plan and other laws,
regulations, and policy including regulatory consultation requirements.
Comment-31 - The FS states there are currently 46% late-successional habitat, 30% mid-successional habitat, and
24% early-successional habitat in the project area. What will these figures be post project? This information
needs to be disclosed in the DEIS. The document states it takes several hundred years to grow old growth and
late-successional habitat required by late-successional species. In our view this project will return the area to
mostly early-successional habitat. How does that improve the LSR/CHU and old growth habitat? (7)

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Discussion: None of the action alternatives would reduce the percentage of late-successional forest in the
watershed or project area, though the no action alternative is actively reducing late-successional ponderosa
pine forest (units 204, 206) and portions of this stand element in other parts of the LSR. Thinning treatments
would retain all of the predominant trees as well as the majority of the dominant and most of the codominant
trees within the stand (provided they are not a safety hazard). Thinning treatments would also result in lower
basal areas overall by thinning from below the suppressed, intermediate and some codominant trees, but
would not change the age classes that remain on the landscape. The thinning treatments would increase the
average stand diameter and concentrate site growth potential on the residual trees maintaining, while
enhancing, mature late-successional forest characteristics that are more resilient over time. In the long term,
this would accelerate development of old growth late-successional forest characteristics in the thinned stands
of larger diameter trees, larger diameter snags and larger down wood.
Comment-32 - We do not need to log mature forest to provide jobs. Less than 2% of the jobs in Washington and
Oregon are in the lumber and wood products sectors, and only a small fraction of those are on federal land and
only a fraction of those are related to mature forest logging. Many more environmentally benign jobs are
available in restoring roads, streams, thinning young plantations, and managing fire and recreation. (5)
We do not need to log mature forest to prop up the economy. The NW economy has greatly diversified in the last
decade. Our economy typically creates more new jobs every year than exist in the entire lumber and wood
products sectors (5).
We do not need to log mature forest to prop up the timber industry. Less than 10% of the logging in Oregon and
Washington in recent years has been on federal lands. Only a fraction of that is mature forest. Much more
environmentally benign and socially acceptable timber can be derived from thinning young plantations or small
diameter fuel reduction where it is appropriate. (5)

Discussion: The project actions were developed to address the gap between existing and desired conditions
(and not to prop up the economy). Proposed treatments would be accomplished through a variety of methods,
which may include service contacts, stewardship contracts, commercial timber sale contracts, force account
crews, etc., which may result in jobs and economic benefits to the local area.
Comment-33 - Since managing these stands is not "needed" for any ecological reason or any economic or social
reason, what would be the objective? (5)

Discussion: The project objectives are described in chapter 1, under the Purpose and Need section, which are
based on an ecological need and direction from the NWFP, Forest Plan and Forest’s Late-Successional
Reserve Assessment.
Comment-34 - When developing measurement standards for NEPA implementation do not use crown closure. There
is no one set way to measure crown closure before or following treatment. No method has been developed that
gives the same or an accurate measurement. (2)
The measurement standards need to be something that can be measured correctly before and following
treatment; basal area, trees per acre, stand density index, spacing, etc.(2)

Discussion: Overall, crown closure will not be used as a target measure for purpose and need achievement. It
may be used to describe certain effects or nuances, however in terms of qualifying and quantifying habitat
changes from the treatments. It is also often used as a measure of connectivity, and to define dispersal,
foraging, nesting/roosting, and resting/denning habitat for the NSO, northern goshawk, fisher and other
species, such as rare plants and mosses.
Comment-35 - It is essential that that public and the Decision Maker know via NEPA the number and size of trees to
be logged prior to a decision being made to implement the timber sale. This is particularly relevant for older trees
>30”dbh. Please estimate the number mature trees (20-30” dbh) and the number of “old growth” trees >30” dbh
that would be logged from each unit. The most informative way of disclosing this data would be to report the prelogging number of trees in these size classes and the post-logging number and size of trees in these size
classes. We have previously reviewed modeled results of these data for other timber sales thus the data is
available for NEPA purposes and the Forest Service is required to disclose for comment and analysis prior to

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

issuing the decision to implement the project. The proposed action must demonstrate that this standard is being
met for each unit logged. (6)

Discussion: Please refer to Comment-13 for retention of the largest oldest trees.

LSR
Comment-36 - Regen harvest in a LSR will have significant effects including: land allocation conflicts, precedence
setting significant and long-term loss and degradation of forest cover and habitat, Forest Plan violation, public
and scientific controversy, impacts to listed species, impacts to ecologically critical areas, etc. (5)

Discussion: There is no regeneration logging or mechanical regeneration treatment proposed with the Elk
project. The DEIS and supporting analyses will disclose the effects of the proposed activities. Thinning or
other silvicultural treatments inside LSRs may occur in stands up to 80 years of age if the treatments are
beneficial to the creation and maintenance of late-successional forest conditions (USDA-FS & USDI-BLM,
1994 pp. 8, C-12, C-13, C-26). In addition, while risk-reduction efforts should generally be focused on young
stands, management activities may be appropriate under the Northwest Forest Plan to reduce the risk
associated with large-scale disturbance in existing late-successional habitat East of the Cascades and in the
Oregon and California Klamath Provinces. These activities are considered appropriate -if: 1) the proposed
management activities will clearly result in greater assurance of long-term maintenance of habitat; 2) the
activities are clearly needed to reduce risks, and 3) the activities will not prevent the LSR from playing an
effective role in the objectives for which they were established (USDA-FS & USDI-BLM, 1994 pp. C-13).
The project will be reviewed by the Regional Ecosystem Office and/or Regional Interagency Executive
Committee where thinning or other silvicultural activities in LSR are neither consistent with the LSRA nor
fall under a specific REO review exemption.
Comment-37 - Logging old growth, dominant and co-dominant trees over 80 years of age is a violation of the NWFP
and 2011 Recovery Plan and will adversely modify habitat and adversely impact NSO. (7)

Discussion: The DEIS will disclose the effects of the proposed activities relative to consistency with direction
from the NWFP, Forest Plan and the Forest’s Late Successional Reserve Assessment.. Large-scale disturbance
risk reduction activities may occur in stands older than 80 years of age if they meet the three criteria described
in Comment-36. The 2011 Revised Recovery Plan for the Northern Spotted Owl also does not provide a
definition of an old-growth tree, but instead discusses the suite of conditions that characterize old-growth
forest, stating that “[o]ld-growth forests are forests that have accumulated specific characteristics related to
tree size, canopy structure, snags and woody debris and plant associations….Old-growth forests support
assemblages of plants and animals, environmental conditions, and ecological processes that are not found in
younger forests (younger than 150-250 years) or in small patches of large, old trees,” (USDI-FWS, 2011).
Recovery Plans are also non-regulatory (USDI-FWS, 2011 pp. I-3), and the Recovery Plan for the NSO
includes recommendations for a recovery strategy and recovery actions. The Forest designed the Elk project
to be consistent with applicable recovery actions (10 and 32). An in-depth analysis of treatment prioritization
and rationale to support the Forest’s contention that it is consistent with the recommendations will be included
in the project record. Certain proposed treatments may result in an adverse effect to elements of critical
habitat, but are not expected to adversely affect any NSOs (e.g., oak release in critical habitat, radial thinning
depending on amount of area and species affected). At present, there are no NSOs occupying the project area,
or the historic activity center associated with the project. We kindly refer the reader to the Final Rule (USDIFWS, 2012 p. 71939) for a description of what may potentially constitute an adverse effect to NSO critical
habitat. If it is determined by the Forest Service that the project will adversely affect critical habitat elements,
that determination will be disclosed and supported with the best available scientific rationale in the Biological
Assessment. If that determination is made, then the FWS will make a determination during formal
consultation on whether the project has an adverse modification on the entire designated critical habitat (also
see the Final Rule (USDI-FWS, 2012 p. 71940) for a description of adverse modification and destruction of
critical habitat and what the FWS’ responsibilities entail).

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Comment-38 - A considerable part of the LSR is not conducive to growing dense stands of conifer trees that are
more representative of Northern Spotted Owl (NSO) habitat commonly found on the western portions of the
Shasta Trinity National Forest. This area is more conducive to growing open grown forest stands, especially
where ponderosa pine is the dominant species. (2)
We understand the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) have canopy closure requirements for various habitat
classifications (nesting/roosting, foraging, and dispersal) for the NSO. We are not sure whether there is research
that shows 60% canopy closure can be sustained for nesting/roosting habitat in this forest type. (2)
The current stand characteristics are artificial only having developed over the last 100-150 years. These kinds of
stand conditions did not exist prior to that time frame. Any treatment done to meet standard NSO canopy closure
levels will only have short term effectiveness, 10 years or less, in terms of meeting the objectives of stand
development and protection. Historically, old growth stands within this forest type did not have the levels of
canopy closure required by the FWS. It will be absolutely necessary to articulate to the FWS what kind of
vegetative conditions should be grown for long term sustainability and resiliency. (2)

Discussion: See the response to Comment-17. The Elk Flat LSR was identified as an area of important latesuccessional habitat during the late-successional mapping effort (LSRA p. 124). Stands that meet all of the
Forest Plan classification elements of older late-seral stands do so except for canopy closure.
Comment-39 - It must be remembered the LSR network was not just set up to grow NSO habitat. It was designed to
grow late-successional habitat that can be resilient and sustained on any given vegetative type and ecosystem.
The intent of the Northwest Forest Plan was to grow long-term late-successional habitat based on land
capability. (2)

Discussion: Within the Elk Flat LSR, 2,836 acres are capable of supporting late-successional habitat (LSRA
p. 125). Of lands capable of supporting-late successional habitat, 1,306 acres (46% of capable acres within the
LSR) were in late-successional habitat as of the publication of the LSRA. Currently, there is a shortage of
high quality late-successional habitat in the Elk Flat LSR. Many late-successional stands are deficient in
structural diversity. See also Comment-29.
Comment-40 - We believe that retaining large diameter trees and snags where they still exist would benefit the
project in a number of ways. Large trees are a primary element of late successional habitat function, which this
project seeks to retain. Retaining large trees in the project would greatly reduce the scientific and social
controversy regarding the harvest prescription. Large trees provide disproportionate hydrological benefits to
these watersheds. The crowns of such trees help moderate peak flow events via canopy cover. Large live and
trees are the primary source of future large down wood, which also helps to filter and moderate water flow
throughout the year.(6)

Discussion: Please refer to Comment-13 for retention of the largest oldest trees. The project includes design
features and protection measures to assure that predominant trees, trees with late-successional characteristics,
and large/small snags are retained during operations and prescribed fire. Due to the epidemic level of
ponderosa pine snags in the area of extensive mortality (units 204, 206, 158, 159, parts of 163), not all snags
will be retained. Some will fall naturally prior to project implementation, and some will fall during the
treatment of this area. Snag retention patches in these areas of extensive mortality will be designated however,
and they will be focused away from roads, private property boundaries and in areas where there is a
component of large live trees to provide some protection from windthrow.
Comment-41 - The document states desired late-successional and old growth characteristics includes multi species
and multilayered assemblage of trees; moderate to high accumulations of large snags and logs, moderate to
high canopy closure, moderate to high numbers of trees with physical imperfections such as cavities, broken
tops, and large deformed limbs, and moderate to high accumulations of fungi, lichens, and bryophytes . How
much of each of these criteria will be left post-project in the LSR and CHU when 90% of the habitat will be logged
including all of these criteria? (7)

Discussion: The project analysis and DEIS will discuss the desired conditions and retention standards which
meet Forest Plan direction and best available science recommendations for snags, 109 coarse wood, decadent
trees, vertical and horizontal heterogeneity, etc. The Biological Assessment will describe where mechanical
thinning treatments will occur in natural stands (and plantations), underburning, other fuels treatments within
the project area, and critical habitat.
Comment-42 - The fact this project will log old growth and “pre-dominant” trees makes this project a non-starter from
the beginning. There is simply no legitimate reason to log any tree over 100 years old in the LSR. (7)

Discussion: Please refer to Comment-13 for retention of the largest oldest trees, Comment-14 regarding
variable density thinning, and Comment-28 regarding stand age and LSR guidelines.
Comment-43 - The current levels are endemic at 7% not epidemic. Both insects and disease such as beetles and
mistletoe are good for late-successional habitat and the species that rely on it. The LSR/CHU could benefit from
MORE insect and disease, not less. We are not persuaded by Figure 4 in the document showing pine mortality.
What we are persuaded by are the clearcuts, fragmentation and lack of habitat connectivity in the southern
portion of the Elk LSR. The LSR was never intended to be a pine plantation for logging. Just what exactly does
the Forest not understand about this simple concept? The only reason to log these areas is for timber production.
We remind the FS once again that timber emphasis areas include Matrix lands – not LSR/CHU. (7)

Discussion: Please refer to Comment-11 regarding insects and disease and endemic levels, Comment-23
regarding the project’s objectives, and Comment-103 regarding clearcutting. The levels occurring in the
southeastern, eastern and various pockets in the remainder of the LSR are considered epidemic for the stand
loss that is occurring, which was described in the scoping document at about 15%, not 7% (it is not clear
where the comment’s 7% figure originates from). This is notably a concern when the 15% or higher mortality
is compared to the LSRA determination that 2% of the LSR would be subject to lethal effects (p. 125). The
levels of mortality at scoping were approximated at 15% based on review of pockets and stands of dead and
dying trees. By the time implementation occurs, these levels are likely to be steady or potentially higher,
pending a stochastic event such as uncharacteristic or high-severity fire, extensive blowdown or subsequent
bark beetle flights and attacks that stress the trees further.
Comment-44 The authors of the Northwest Forest Plan accounted for large-scale disturbance in the design (and
function) of the LSR system (e.g. Dr. Jerry Franklin’s comments regarding the proposed Biscuit Fire Salvage
timber sale within Late Successional Reserves on the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest,) (6)
The LSR network was designed to accommodate large, intense natural disturbances and allow for natural
recovery processes. This is one reason that the FEMAT report and PNW Forest Plan provide for conservative
direction with regards to salvage in LSRs and direct that activities should enhance or at least not interfere with
natural recovery processes. Chapter and verse are cited in the text of these comments.
Salvage logging of large snags and down boles does not contribute to recovery of late successional forest
habitat; in fact, the only activity more antithetical to the recovery process would be removal of surviving green
trees from burned sites. Large snags and logs of decay resistant species, such as Douglas-fir and cedars, are
109

The Forest Plan Management Prescription 7 (Late Successional Reserve) standard and guideline D5 states, “Maintain
dead/down material, hardwoods, and snags at naturally occurring levels” (Forest Plan p. 4-44). The LSRA describes
desired conditions (desired naturally occurring levels) for Late Successional Reserves (and Managed Late Successional
Areas). The LSRA describes that desired future conditions will vary according to the primary vegetative species, site
class, topography and other site factors and these condition descriptions are to be used to guide the development of the
prescriptions, with development and maintenance of late-successional habitat as the ultimate objective of the treatment. It
further describes that the levels and ranges of various attributes should allow for long term viability of late-successional
characteristics. For mixed conifer habitat, the average number of snags at least 20 inches in diameter is 2-4, per acre and
6-7, 20+ inch diameter down logs on north and east aspects and less on south and west aspects and the McCloud Flats
(LSRA p. 166). The desired levels identified in the vegetative descriptions represent an average for a landscape or
treatment area (i.e., 100 acres). Numbers of snags and down logs can vary on any particular acre (LSRA p. 164).

critical as early and late successional wildlife habitat as well as for sustaining key ecological processes
associated with nutrient, hydrologic, and energy cycles. (6)

Discussion: As described in Comment-37 and Comment-36, the project was designed to reduce the risk of
loss of LSR habitat from large scale disturbance as permitted by the Northwest Forest Plan (pp. C-12, C-13).
Snags are being retained (see Comment-20) as well as the largest oldest trees that exhibit old-growth
characteristics such as large boles, decadent branching, cavities and flattened tops (as they are not a safety
hazard) (Comment-13).
Comment-45 - The ecological differences between biologically rich stands that result from natural disturbance and
stands that are subject to regeneration logging, skid trail establishment, machine piling and road construction are
well known and pronounced. Early-successional forest ecosystems that develop after stand-replacing or partial
disturbances are diverse in species, processes, and structure. Post-disturbance ecosystems are also often rich
in biological legacies, including surviving organisms and organically derived structures, such as woody debris.
These legacies and post-disturbance plant communities provide resources that attract and sustain high species
diversity, including numerous early-successional obligates, such as certain woodpeckers and anthropods... (6)

Discussion: There is no regeneration logging or mechanical regeneration treatments proposed with the Elk
project. The Forest agrees that biological legacies are important, the project would retain important elements
such as snags, CWD, shrubs, small trees /large trees, and untreated stands (e.g. unthinned patches, deferred
units/areas, habitat roost/rest clumps). The project’s design follows guidelines for the Management
Prescription that are intended to protect and enhance conditions of late successional and old-growth forest
ecosystems, of which early seral habitat is an important component to provide for prey base in certain areas
(e.g., whitethorn, other shrub habitats, hardwoods for dusky-footed woodrats and other potential NSO, fisher
and northern goshawk prey).
Comment-46 - The disturbances occurring within the Elk LSR are considered more than small-scale in nature. (2)
The Elk proposal is dealing with reducing the risk of a large-scale disturbance that is currently occurring. Your
project proposal is in complete compliance with the NWFP and Land and Resource Management Plan based on
this direction/guidance. Nowhere is found direction or guidance to allow 100’s of acres of mortality to continue to
spread across the landscape. (2)

Discussion: Please refer to Comment-23.
Comment-47 - "The following highlights direction/guidance from the NWFP concerning treatments within LSR’s. All of
the following quotes are found in the ROD within the Standard and Guidelines section. (2)
Page B-1: “In Late-Successional Reserves, standards and guidelines are designed to maintain late-successional
forest ecosystems and protect them from loss due to large-scale fire, insect and disease epidemics, and major
human impacts.”
Page B-1: “These standards and guidelines encourage the use of silvicultural practices to accelerate the
development of overstocked young plantations into stands with late-successional and old-growth characteristics,
and to reduce the risk to Late-Successional Reserves from severe impacts resulting from large-scale
disturbances and unacceptable loss of habitat.”
Page B-4: “In the warmer, drier physiographic provinces (i.e., the Washington Eastern Cascades, the California
Cascades, and the Oregon and California Klamath Provinces), fire is more frequent, less intense, and is an
integral part of the internal dynamics of a typical stand (tens of thousands of acres). In the drier provinces, fire
control and timber harvest have decreased the abundance of some types of old growth, such as ponderosa pine,
that are dependent on frequent, low-intensity fires. Other types of late-successional forest that are less fire
resistant or are less desirable for harvest have become more widely distributed. In these areas, the potential for
stand-replacing wildfires has increased, resulting in a higher risk to the stability of current stands reserved for
late-successional species.”
Page B-5: “Silvicultural systems proposed for Late-Successional Reserves have two principal objectives: (1)
development of old-growth forest characteristics including snags, logs on the forest floor, large trees, and canopy
gaps that enable establishment of multiple tree layers and diverse species composition; and (2) prevention of
large-scale disturbances by fire, wind, insect, and diseases that would destroy or limit the ability of the reserves

to sustain viable forest species populations. Small-scale disturbances by these agents are natural processes,
and will be allowed to continue.”

Discussion: Thank you for the comment. Chapter 1, any LSR indicator analyses and sections of Chapter 3 of
the DEIS, along with the supporting analyses, will disclose how the project meets the management direction
and standards and guidelines. Please also refer to Comment-23.
Comment-48 - The document states the current project area is 25% 10-50 year old plantations and another 20%s of
plantations will be logged in the project. That adds up to 45%. The document also states there is 46% latesuccessional habitat and 90% of the project is in LSR so it’s appears that ALL of the late-successional habitat will
be logged except for 380 acres. Again we are curious as to how the Forest believes this is “protecting” late
successional habitat. Instead of actually protecting and maintaining the habitat, the Forest is proposing to return
the entire LSR to early-successional habitat. We believe this is a violation of the LRMP, NWFP, LSRA, and
Recovery Plan. Please show us how we are incorrect. (7)

Discussion: The preponderance of activities proposed within the Elk Flat LSR consist of thinning and
prescribed fire. There is no regeneration logging or mechanical regeneration treatment proposed with the Elk
project. Limited group selections are proposed in some thinning stands that would create small openings (up
to about 2 acres) within older plantations and natural stands, due to root disease or stagnated tree growth from
density. Meadow enhancement treatments will also aim to restore the dry meadow habitat in Elk Flat by
removing encroaching conifers. Silviculture treatments in the project will not appreciably change the current
seral distribution in the Ash Creek 5th field watershed under any action alternative. Thinning will shift some
stands from seral stage 4b to 4a for approximately one to two decades until residual tree canopies reoccupy
thinning space. Thinning will also increase the 3b and 3c seral stage classes. Please also see Comment-23,
Comment-28, and Comment-29. LSR protection and enhancement includes the Guidelines to Reduce Risks of
Large-Scale Disturbance in forests in the California Cascades Provinces.
Comment-49 - The Forest intends to leave a 380 acre island of late-successional habitat for the NSO AC stating it
will “contribute” to late-successional processes. Where does the BAS document that leaving a small island of
habitat surrounded by clearcuts benefit the NSO? The Forest is mandated to maintain and improve LSR habitat
– not simply contribute to it. The Forest also intends to burn the 380 acres and expects to lose 5-10% of it to the
burn. So in reality the project would lose between an additional 19 to 38 acres of the 380 acres. (7)

Discussion: The Proposed Action that was scoped deferred approximately 380 acres of stands in the project
area from mechanical treatment and thinning. This acreage may increase, or decrease, depending on
additional stand review and treatment prioritization. There will be untreated areas throughout the project area
(in the form of the unthinned patches, roost/rest clumps, whole units deferred from treatment and other areas
of high quality NSO, northern goshawk and fisher habitat). These stands would be excluded from silviculture
treatments because they are not currently at risk, or they are at a density-related risk, but are being left
untreated or unthinned at this time to maintain current nesting, roosting and foraging habitat for these species.
As described in the February 2013 scoping document, this is “one element of an overall spatial and temporal
strategy to retain high quality habitat function on the landscape and address forest change over time in the
advent of disturbance events”. Also as described in Comment-48, the unthinned blocks and areas of habitat
will not be surrounded by clear cuts but rather will be mostly within a mosaic of variably thinned stands.
Comment-50 - Since the Northwest Forest Plan was adopted there are even more reasons to protect and restore
mature & old-growth forests, including: 1. to alleviate barred owl/spotted owl competition (even though there are
not owls there now, there could be anytime in the future, and the LSR should be managed to accommodate
them); 2. to store carbon and mitigate climate change; 3. to mitigate for the significant cumulative loss of snags
and dead wood habitat from extensive logging on public and private lands.(5)
"The Northwest Forest Plan requires that: The Watershed Analysis] will serve as the basis for developing projectspecific proposals, and determining monitoring and restoration needs for a watershed...Hence the following
findings of the McCloud Flats Ecosystem Analysis should be addressed in project development and
implementation.:
Distribution of snags and deadwood is spotty because large areas of plantations have almost no deadwood or
snags. This reduces the average below forest minimums. Page 22.

Discussion: The Elk LSR project is guided by direction in the NWFP, the Forest Plan, and the LSRA as
described earlier in this DEIS. In addition, the need for action was determined by comparing existing
conditions with the desired condition relative to the identified purposes. Existing conditions, causal
mechanisms and needs for action in relation to the Forest Plan desired conditions were identified in Step 5 of
the Edson WA and Chapter 5 of the Mount Shasta WA (both which overlap portions of the project and the
1995 McCloud Flats Watershed Analysis). Many of the watershed analysis recommendations have been
incorporated or addressed in the project’s design. In regards to the comment and the project being used to “1.
alleviate barred owl/spotted owl competition (even though there are not NSOs there now, there could be
anytime in the future, and the LSR should be managed to accommodate them); 2. to store carbon and mitigate
climate change; 3. to mitigate for the significant cumulative loss of snags and dead wood habitat from
extensive logging on public and private lands,” the proposed and refined treatments all aim to meet some of
these objectives, while remaining in accordance with the management direction. The Forest Service’s
direction does not include “mitigating” for actions taken on private or public lands or climate change. The
activities proposed are to increase stand and LSR habitat resilience to stressors however, such as prolonged
drought, fire and insect attacks.
Comment-51 - Snags are currently at 10 snags, 20” dbh per acre. This is excellent for late-successional species. The
document states “excess” snags will be taken. The amount of “excess” snags must be disclosed considering it is
equally important habitat along with old growth for late-successional species. (7)

Discussion: Please see Comment-20. The project discusses retention standards which meet Forest Plan
direction for snags. 110

The Forest Plan Management Prescription 7 (Late Successional Reserve) standard and guideline D5 states, “Maintain
dead/down material, hardwoods, and snags at naturally occurring levels” (Forest Plan p. 4-44). The LSRA describes
desired conditions (desired naturally occurring levels) for Late Successional Reserves (and Managed Late Successional
Areas). The LSRA describes that desired future conditions will vary according to the primary vegetative species, site
class, topography and other site factors and these condition descriptions are to be used to guide the development of the
prescriptions, with development and maintenance of late-successional habitat as the ultimate objective of the treatment. It

Comment-52 - A commenter present at a public meeting on March 26, 2013 stated there should be nothing wrong
with leaving 100’s of acres of dead trees within the Elk LSR. It was stated this was expected in the Northwest
Forest Plan. We don’t believe that was the full intent of what the authors of the Northwest Forest Plan had
envisioned for LSR’s. (2)

Discussion: The NWFP includes information on the basis for the standard and guidelines including ecological
principles for management of late-successional forests (USDA-FS & USDI-BLM, 1994 p. Section B). Dead
trees are an important component in LSRs. Simultaneously, there is direction to protect and enhance LSRs
(including reducing risks of large-scale disturbance in this province).
Comment-53 The document states that due to 100 years of fire suppression stands are dense and risk of wildfire is
high. The need to “protect” late-successional habitat is great. We believe the proposed action is not a rational
response to these assumptions that are not based on the best available science. The Forest wants to log 90% of
the LSR leaving only 10% in un-thinned units and then burn it. The FS also intends to reduce basal area to a
maximum of 150 ft/sq.ac. and in some areas much less. ... log a majority of 80-150 year old trees, including
stands of old growth with trees 30” dbh and greater. ...convert the LSR to another pine plantation and regenerate
Ponderosa pine rather than maintain the preferred mixed conifer species by late-successional animals. This will
require REO approval because it violates the NWFP....also the LSRA, the 2011 Recovery Plan, and the 2012
Critical Habitat designation. (7)

Discussion: See also Comment-27, Comment-28 and Comment-48. The Elk LSR project is designed to move
the landscape toward the desired condition for the Elk Flat LSR as guided by the visions, goals, strategies and
design criteria embodied in the NWFP, the Forest Plan, and the LSRA as described in the scoping document
and Chapter 1 of this EIS. It is consistent with general objectives from the LSRA, all of which fall under these
LSRA Activity Design Criteria: 1 (Reforestation and revegetation), 4 (Thinning in early successional pole and
mid-successional stands - Hazard Related), 5 (Thinning in early successional pole and mid-successional
stands -Development of Late-Successional Habitat), 7, 9 and 10 (Fuel Reduction, Hazard Reduction Prescribed Burning and Manual and Mechanical Fuels Reduction) and Miscellaneous Activity 7 (Maintaining
Hardwood Stands, forest openings, meadows, and glades) (LSRA pp. 182-195). The proposed treatments
require REO review to ensure consistency with the NWFP and LSRA (see also Comment-36). The proposed
action was also designed to be consistent with recommendations from the 2011 Revised Recovery Plan for the
NSO (see Comment-37) and the 2012 Critical Habitat designation. This information will be included in the
project record and the project Biological Assessment.
Comment-54 With treatments planned in an LSR one would expect the decision maker to limit the number of entries
required to fully achieve the desired stand characteristics. The intent of the Northwest Forest Plan was to
minimize the number of entries within LSRs. One would also think the FWS would welcome proposals that limit
the number of disturbance entries in order to achieve long term desired conditions. (2)

Discussion: See Comment-25 for thinning effectiveness (which can be roughly translated to expected reentry). Due to the high degree of departure from the natural fire regime, one prescribed burn entry is unlikely
to achieve the objective of returning the natural role of fire to the ecosystem. Instead, 2 to 3 incremental
underburns, repeated every 5 to 10 years would be implemented. The entire area would not be underburned in
any one year, contributing to a diverse mosaic of treated area conditions.
Comment-55 - Please also take a hard look as to the ecological contribution that snag forest habitat is providing this
LSR and the possibility of spreading disease through logging, road and landing construction.(9)

further describes that the levels and ranges of various attributes should allow for long term viability of late-successional
characteristics. For mixed conifer habitat, the average number of snags at least 20 inches in diameter is 2-4, per acre and
6-7, 20+ inch diameter down logs on north and east aspects and less on south and west aspects and the McCloud Flats
(LSRA p. 166). The desired levels identified in the vegetative descriptions represent an average for a landscape or
treatment area; i.e., 100 acres. Numbers of snags and down logs can vary on any particular acre (LSRA p. 164).

Discussion: Please refer to Comment-20 and Comment-51 regarding snags, and Comment-10 and Comment11 regarding disease spread.
Comment-56 - The LRMP also encourages the agency to use prescribed fire and thinning from below, focus on
younger stands, and accelerate development of late-successional characteristics in the LSR. None of these
objectives will be furthered by removing large snag habitat from over 1,500 acres of the LSR.(6)

Discussion: Please refer to Comment-28 regarding treatment in mature stands, and comments Comment-20
and Comment-51 regarding snags. See also Comment-53 regarding consistency with the LSRA management
direction.

Machine Piling
Comment-57 - Do not be forced into dropping the option of machine piling. This technique has been used effectively
for decades with no detrimental effects to the soils resource. (2)

Discussion: The Forest Service will determine, based on review of the existing conditions prior to
underburning and after thinning treatments, what type of surface fuels reduction methods to use that limit the
most disturbance to soils, CWD, snags and residual vegetation. Where heavy concentrations of CWD exceed
the desired conditions as specified in the resource protection measures (typically more than 40 tons per acre),
machine piling and burning of some piles would be utilized. This method would reduce surface and activity
fuels, and would be pretreatment before underburning to increase consumption of excess fuels over what
underburning would accomplish and to limit adverse effects to overstory trees, soils and wildlife habitat (see
also Comment-3). Piling would focus on the high fuel load/mortality pockets and machine piling passes
would be limited to the extent needed to reduce fuel loads to levels described in the resource protection
measures. Treated areas would not be rigorously cleaned of slash material, and duff materials would be
largely left in place for soil cover and erosion protection consistent with Forest Soil Quality Standards, RPMs
and BMPs.
Comment-58 - Manual piling is a reasonable alternative to the avoidable impacts associated with machine piling
while mechanical piling is universally recognized as an outdated practice that has disproportionately harmful
impacts on watershed and soil resources. Please see: Evelyn Bull et al. Trees and Logs Important to Wildlife in
the Interior Columbia River Basin PNW-GTR-391 (1977). BLM, USGS, Biological Soil Crusts: Ecology and
Management (Technical Reference 1730-2(2001) (Available from BLM Publication Management Distribution
Service, Bldg 41, E-16 (BC-650B) Denver, CO 80255 (6)
Our organizations remain convinced that manual piling is far preferable to tractor piling. Manual piling has none
of the negative impacts to soils associated with tractor piling, provides an increased opportunity for local
employment and significantly reduces long term damage to soil health and productivity. Hence manual piling
would better achieve the stated forest health purpose and need for the project.(6)
I am concerned about proposals to conduct machine piling in the Elk Flat LSR. (8)

Discussion: Machine piling was identified as a significant issue for this project and is discussed in Chapter 3.
As described in Comment-6, as well as the existing condition section of Chapter 1, many of the surface and
standing dead fuels are too large and too abundant to safely or effectively pile by hand. See also Comment-3
and Comment-57 that address when machine piling may occur.
Bull et al. 1977 (and 1997) discusses the importance of trees and logs to wildlife, including downed coarse
wood. USDI BLM and USGS discuss biological soil crusts (in arid and semi-arid regions) as indicators of
ecological health. The project incorporates project measures to retain and/or protect large CWD that is an
important habitat component for wildlife (and soils). For example:
•

Piling would focus on the high fuel load/mortality pockets and machine piling passes would be
limited to the extent needed to reduce fuel loads to the levels described in the resource protection
measures;

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

B-25

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

•

Treated areas would not be rigorously cleaned of slash material, and duff materials would be largely
left in place for soil cover and erosion protection consistent with Forest Soil Quality Standards
(Forest Plan p. Appdx. O), RPMs and BMPs;

•

Existing CWD would be maintained and protected from disturbance to the greatest extent possible
within all thinning and fuels treatment units in LSR and matrix land allocation;

•

An average of 6 to 10 large down logs per acre in a variety of decay classes with a preference for 20inch diameter logs, or the largest size class available would be retained;

•

Where piling and burning is conducted within NSO and NGO foraging habitat, two unburned slash
piles per acre would be left to provide small mammal habitat.

No biological soil crusts were observed during soil surveys (Courtney, 2015). Machine piling earned a
reputation as a harmful practice on soils in the past, from the era where machine piling almost exclusively
referred to site preparation for planting after a clearcut, and often occurring on moderately steep slopes.111
However, slash piling as practiced in the past has not occurred on National Forest System lands since the mid1990s. Mechanical operations are limited to slopes less than 35%. Much smaller tractors equipped with a
brush rake on the blade are typically used, which result is little to no topsoil displacement or compaction that
would be of any detrimental degree. 112 In some areas of the project, an excavator may also be utilized to pile
(see Chapter 2 description of machine piling and burning, and EIS Appendix A). Piles are to be “clean”
(without soil), which helps them burn properly. Tractor piling often takes place in thinned stands, so there is
much less slash generated when compared to regenerated stands. Combined with whole tree yarding, the
overall results are much less slash material being moved into piles, and much less equipment traffic on the
soils compared to past practices.
Forest monitoring found machine pile and burning overall effects on the soil were minimal due to clean piles
that lacked displaced soil (Rust, 2013d). Fall burning consumed most of the slash, and had minimal loss of
soil organic matter and topsoil. Soil heating was 2 to 4 inches deep had high levels of soil organic matter,
roots, low to moderate levels of compaction. The areal extent of tractor piling is limited to slash
concentrations in much if not most of the areas that include machine piling. Some soil displacement may
occur associated with equipment operations but this should be limited in extent due to flat topography and the
spatially patchy distribution of activity generated slash. Slash (LWD) and litter/duff remaining on site will
provide for soil cover, erosion control, and provides a source of nutrient supply over time. If done properly,
machine piling is expected to meet soil quality standards. The size of the material being piled is too large for
manual methods.
Comment-59 Forest monitoring found machine pile and burning overall effects on the soil were minimal due to clean

Heavy slash accumulations were “straight-bladed” into piles, often also piling large amounts of topsoil into the piles
(sometimes purposely, to reduce re-growth of sprouting species as competition for planted trees). This practice was
eventually widely recognized as harmful to soil productivity, and one of a few practices that directly led to topsoil
displacement standards incorporated in national and regional soil management direction from 1991 to 1995.

The Forest has a long track record of working directly with equipment operators to achieve minimal soil displacement
or other soil impacts historically associated with this practice.

erosion control, and provides a source of nutrient supply over time. If done properly, machine piling is expected
to meet soil quality standards. The size of the material being piled is too large for manual methods. - We
continue to emphasize the need to carefully look at all fuels reduction options. We highly encourage you to keep
all options open for treating fuels within the project area. Hand piling should be the last option as it is very
expensive and can lead to a nonviable project. Do not be forced into dropping the option of machine piling. Given
the current mortality conditions within many of the stands, machine piling is the only feasible option. This
technique has been used effectively for decades with no detrimental effects to the soils resource.(2)

Discussion: See also the responses to Comment-3, Comment-6, Comment-57, and Comment-58. Machine
piling is being evaluated for use in the Elk project. This activity would be limited to the areas where it is
needed to reduce surface fuel loading to Forest Plan standards for the LSR and matrix lands, and the resource
protection measures. The SMMU currently employs several equipment operators and owns various pieces of
equipment, including . two dozers and an excavator that may be used for piling. Hand piling is a less safe and
viable option due to the size of the material to be piled, though this option may be used in sensitive areas.
Comment-60 - The Six Rivers National Forest recently concluded: “Machine piling/burn piles would increase ground
disturbance and soil displacement when the machine turns.” -Little Doe and Low Gulch Timber Sale DEIS p 110.
(6)

Discussion: It is difficult to compare a timber sale on the Six Rivers with one on the SMMU. The topography
is greatly different. See also the discussion for Comment-71, Comment-3, Comment-6, Comment-57, and
Comment-58. The description of proposed machine piling in EIS Chapter 2 and Appendix A, and the resource
protection measures, describes the equipment and protection measures that would be used during piling
activities.

NEPA
Comment-61 - Blending 36 CFR 215 and 36 CFR 218 is a NEPA violation. (7)

Discussion: There is no blending of these regulations in the scoping document, or other elements of the
project. 36 CFR 218.16 addressed the effective dates for the 218 pre-decisional objection process as well as
provisions for the process transition. This was fully described in the scoping document to assure that the
Public was aware of the process transition.
Comment-62 - A proper consideration of the cumulative impacts of a project requires “some quantified or detailed
information;…[g]eneral statements about some possible effects and some risk do not constitute a hard look
absent a justification regarding why more definitive information could not be provided.” 1998)). The analysis
“must be more than perfunctory; it must provide a useful analysis of the cumulative impacts of past, present and
future projects.” (6)
It appears that much of the LSR and surrounding Forest Service lands have been subjected to logging, road
construction and fire exclusion. We have also observed implementation of regeneration logging, large tree
logging, large snag logging, tractor yarding and machine piling activities in the matrix land use allocation in the
Pilgrim and Mayflower timber sales on the McCloud District. These prescriptions have turned public forestlands
into highly compacted dirt fields largely devoid of vegetation. See attached photos. The cumulative impacts of
these practices are severe and significant."
"The many severe cumulative impacts from timber sale activities, road construction, fire suppression, and
machine piling for this planning area must meet the requirements of NEPA such that: A proper consideration of
the cumulative impacts of a project requires “some quantified or detailed information;…general statements about
possible effects and some risk do not constitute a hard look absent a justifications regarding why more definitive
information could not be provided.” The analysis “must be more than perfunctory; it must provide a useful
analysis of the cumulative impacts of past, present, and future projects.”"
Given the repeated acknowledgements in the watershed analysis regarding the impacts of past logging and road
activities on the hydrological and terrestrial health of the project area, it is vital that the Forest Service analyze
and disclose the cumulative impacts of past activities and its future plans.
Please disclose and analyze all previous projects in the LSR that were mentioned in general in the document.
How are these previous projects impacting habitat, species, soils and water quality in the project area?

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Please provide a thorough cumulative impacts analysis of the proposed logging in combination with other federal
logging and early 50% of this watershed has been commercially logged in the last 15 years. 480 acres of mature
forests have been removed from this watershed. Please honestly analyze and disclose how continued grazing
and additional logging, road and landing construction will affect wildlife, soils, recreation, late successional
characteristics and heritage resources.(6)

Discussion: The analysis will follow regulations and policy regarding NEPA cumulative effects, which are
described in the DEIS. The IDT reviewed information from the past 30 years for activities that are contained
within or intersect with the Elk project general cumulative effects review area. The specialists reviewed past
actions to: (1) determine if past actions are relevant and useful in analyzing whether the reasonably
foreseeable effects of the agency proposal for action and its alternatives may have a continuing, additive and
significant relationship to those effects, and (2) determine if past actions help illuminate or predict direct and
indirect effects of the proposed action or its alternatives. This approach is consistent with the Council on
Environmental Quality (CEQ) letter “Guidance on the Consideration of Past Actions in Cumulative Effects
Analysis” of June 24, 2005. Ongoing and future actions were also considered in this boundary. The wildlife
analysis will also consider cumulative effects as they are defined under the ESA, pending the determination
(formal vs. informal consultation).
Spatial and temporal boundaries are the two critical elements to consider when deciding which actions to
include in a cumulative effects analysis. Spatial and temporal boundaries set the limits for selecting those
actions that are most likely to contribute to a cumulative effect. The effects of those actions must overlap in
space and time for there to be potential cumulative effects (FSH 1909.15 (15.2)). This is determined by how
long, and how far reaching direct and indirect effects of a project are felt on a given resource area ((FSH
1909.15 (15.3)). Therefore, relevant boundaries and projects assessed for cumulative effects vary by resource.
Each resource’s cumulative effect area can be different and possibly larger or smaller. Details are described in
individual resource analyses . The boundaries used for the resource analyses are described in Chapter 3.
Comment-63 - We are submitting four maps with our scoping comments that document all the timber sales in the
SMMU by the FS as well as industry (THPs), owl ACs, and the Elk project in relation to the Pilgrim project. We
included 10 major FS timber sales that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. In fact the Elk project units are actually
units left by the Pilgrim project. All 10 projects include designated critical habitat for the NSO yet the FS keeps
insisting this “death by a thousand cuts” is not harming the owl. We also note there are approximately 40 THPs in
the SMMU. We expect the FS will conduct a NEPA analysis of cumulative effects that considers the broader
implications to owls.

Discussion: Please see Comment-62 for discussion of cumulative effects. A NEPA cumulative effects analysis
will be completed for the NSO, as well as other species considered in the project analysis. The DEIS will
summarize the cumulative effects relative to the NSO. Regarding overlap of Elk and Pilgrim treatment units,
the DEIS describes that unit 401 overlaps with the Pilgrim project. Unit 401 will receive underburning under
the Elk project to further enhance meadow characteristics, and implement the thinning treatments that were
assessed under the Pilgrim project, and that is why it is included in the Project area and analysis.
Comment-64 - The document states that stands that are deferred from treatment (the 380 acres) will provide
heterogeneity at the larger project area scale; therefore the Forest needs to analyze fragmentation and
connectivity at the larger project scale. It also needs to disclose when it intends to log the 380 acres not treated
in this project. The units in the Elk LSR are basically part of the Pilgrim project which logging began in 2010. So
that analysis claimed units were also deferred and apparently they were only deferred for 2 years. If the only
habitat the Forest intends to leave in late-successional condition is 380 acres, and states they were deferred,
then the cumulative effects analysis must disclose when they are planned for treatment as a foreseeable impact.

Discussion: See also the response to Comment-48 and Comment-49. The scoping document states: “In
addition to retaining a minimum 10 percent of the proposed thinning treatment units in LSR allocation
[footnote omitted] in an unthinned condition to retain features such as thermal cover, dense pockets of trees,
trees with cavities, deformed and/or decadent limbs and openings with dense brush, small trees, or other
vegetation for size differentiation, approximately 380 acres of natural stands have been excluded from
thinning treatments as field review shows they are either not currently at a high risk of loss or to maintain

certain current late-successional habitat for northern spotted owl and northern goshawk.” When scoped, the
380 acres was deferred from mechanical treatment, but planned for underburning and that amount may
increase, or even decrease, during additional project planning and consultation with the FWS and other
resource agencies and as conditions change in the stands. At this time, there is no plan to thin the stands that
will not be mechanically thinned under the Elk project. Connectivity within the LSR will be assessed and
discussed in the EIS and Biological Assessment/Biological Evaluation as it relates to treatment objective 4 of
the LSRA, and late-successional habitat and dependent species.
Comment-65 - All of the units have been identified and have associated prescriptions. We looked at the Elk LSR
project in 2012 and it’s marked. We have photographs and videos documenting this. The purpose of scoping is
to notify the public that a project is being considered and to request general information prior to a proposed
action. (7)

Discussion: The scoping document for the proposed action was detailed with maps and draft prescriptions for
the existing conditions to permit the public an opportunity to comment on, contribute to, and identify issues
with the proposed action. Responses to the proposed action and scoping document, as discussed in the
Introduction to this Appendix, will be used to identify key issues, alternatives and indicators. In regards to the
2012 review noted in the comment, there had been no designation of timber (painted) in the project area. The
national standard for surveyed property lines are blazes and portions of these trees are painted red to
differentiate land ownership between private property and Forest Service property. The preliminary flagging
(orange/blue), orange paint (draft unit boundaries) or tagging (yellow) that may have been observed in 2012 is
used on the ground to assist resource specialists during the planning phase of most projects. It is not the final
treatment boundary designation, but is a preliminary identification to help with development of different
alternatives, resource protection measures, location of potential suitable landing locations, assessing logging
systems, designating wildlife leave areas and identifying mortality areas. Unit boundaries and/prescriptions
are also sometimes marked prior to a decision being made. This allows for a better visual representation of
what is proposed with thinning and other treatments. It permits FS specialists and other agency staff (FWS,
NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service, SHPO, Water Board), county personnel and landowners the
opportunity to review what the proposed or draft treatments are and visualize what conditions would be like
post-thinning or harvest. It is not possible to pre-mark areas of underburning, but the SMMU has several postburning examples that the public is able to review. If changes result during the NEPA analysis and decision
process for mechanical thinning operations, or no-treatment areas (unthinned patches are modified, additional
timber is designated for retention or removal, exclusion of units, etc.), marking, and cruise data, changes are
made prior to implementation to ensure consistency with whatever decision is made.
Comment-66 - The document states “If you reference scientific literature in your comments, you must provide a copy
of the entire cited reference and include rationale as to how you feel it is pertinent to the project.” The 36 CFR
215 regulations have no such requirement. Generally scientific literature is submitted during the draft stage
because of the assumption the FS is actually drafting alternatives and has not already come up with a “Proposed
Action”. (7)

Discussion: Providing the scientific literature that is cited in scoping comments and response letters helps us
understand the public’s and other agency’s concern(s). . Often literature or other information is cited in
scoping (and other comment) response letters and we are not able to locate it.
Comment-67 - Regardless, we want to document this NEPA violation up front prior to the actual “comment period.”
We are puzzled why the Forest is asking for public input when it already has a proposed action that is fully
developed. We don’t see how a reasonable range of alternatives can be met considering the action is developed,
units identified, and stands marked. (7)

Discussion: See also Comment-65. The IDT developed a draft proposed action that addresses the purpose and
need, and law, regulation and policy. It was the Agency’s best effort at putting forth a draft proposal to close
the gap between existing and desired conditions. Public comments on the draft proposed action and proposal
are meant to help refine the proposal and identify preliminary and key issues. The results of scoping (usually
transmitted through written or verbal comments or at the public meetings) are used to clarify public

involvement methods, refine issues, select an interdisciplinary team, establish analysis criteria, and explore
possible alternatives and their probable environmental effects (FSH 1909.15 ch.10 [11]).
Comment-68 - It would have been far more prudent to develop an action alternative that retained all Old Growth
(predominant trees) and dominant and co-dominant trees. Instead, it intends to leave all trees under 10” dbh, and
leave the current pine plantations that are only 10-20 years alone. We fail to see how regeneration harvest and
planting in a late-successional reserve is preserving late-successional habitat? We also fail to see how creating a
Ponderosa pine plantation that requires an open canopy and a lot of sunshine in an LSR is protecting latesuccessional habitat? (7)

Discussion: A s described in Comment-13 and Comment-27, the project proposes to retain predominant trees
and most dominant trees, and trees with late-successional attributes. There is no old growth in the project
area, but legacy trees (predominants) would be retained. See also Comment-23, Comment-38 and Comment39 regarding natural regeneration and pine. There is no regeneration logging or mechanical regeneration
treatment proposed with the Elk project. The project does not propose to retain all trees <10” dbh; it would
retain and thin this size class mechanically, depending on stand and habitat conditions, and this size class
would also be affected during underburning operations.

Soils
Comment-69 - New road construction, landings, machine piling and tractor yarding have significant (and cumulative)
impacts to forest soils. (6)

Discussion: The DEIS discloses the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of the proposed activities on forest
soils (see Chapter 3, Soils).
Comment-70 - Soil loss with respect to method of harvest is directly related to the amount of soil disturbed and bared
by harvest activity, especially the density of skid trails and roads required to access the timber. Megahan (1981)
found tractor logging on granitics to result in 28 percent of the soil disturbed, ground cables with 23 percent,
suspended cables with five percent and helicopter logging with two percent. Similarly, Swanston and Dyrness
(1973) found tractor yarding in granitics to result in 35.1 percent bare soil, hi-lead in 14.8 percent and skyline in
12.8 percent. In a Trinity County study on mixed soil types, skid trails averaged four to eight percent (6-12
km/sq.km) for clearcut areas (Scott et al., 1980). (6)

Discussion: The project area is composed of generally deep to very deep (40 to 60 inches) sandy loams to
loamy sands rather than granitics. The project is on flat terrain and will utilize ground based logging systems
to accomplish most of the project. Slopes in within the Elk project are gently sloping and with proposed
treatments the likelihood of erosion occurring due to slopes are very low. The EHR post-implementation
remains low. The soils analysis indicates that all action alternatives in the Elk the project will meet or exceed
the Forest Plan soil quality standards, maintaining soil productivity in support of healthy forests (see Chapter
3, Soils).
Comment-71 - We further encourage the agency to examine the soil compaction monitoring reports from 1985
through 1997 on the Payette National Forest. While the Payette contains different ecotypes and soil types than
does the Trout Creek project area, the monitoring reports clearly show long-lasting and significant soil damage
from tractor piling activities.
Similar monitoring in the Idaho Panhandle (Jerry Niehoff) and the Kootenai National Forest (Lou Kuennen)
demonstrate significant impacts to soils. We also encourage the agency to review the findings of Geppert, R.R.,
Lorenz, C.W., and Larson, A.G., 1984. Cumulative Effects of Forest Practices on the Environment: A State of the
Knowledge. (6)

Discussion: Copies of the referenced monitoring reports were not available, but the comment refers to the
First Creek project area on the Klamath National Forest (USDA Forest Service, 2007), so the response of Tom
Laurent (Soil Scientist, Klamath National Forest) for First Creek is included: Soil compaction monitoring on
the Payette National Forest focused on tractor logged units that were on steep ground and tractor piled
(referenced within USDA 2007: Dean Pacific martens, Soil Scientist, Payette National Forest, pers. comm.
March 6, 2007). Pacific martens indicated that the monitoring units selected were those that had a high

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

probability of not meeting soil disturbance guidelines, and the data concluded that post-treatment conditions
in these steep units did indeed not meet the guidelines. This caused the Payette Forest to change its slope
limitations for tractor piling from <45% to <35%. This monitoring indicates that tractor piling on slopes
between 35 and 45% on the Payette National Forest has a high probability of exceeding soil disturbance
guidelines. Tractor piling proposed as part of the Elk project activities would occur on slopes <20%, so the
Payette monitoring is not relevant to specific activities proposed. Other “similar monitoring” referenced is
similarly dated and not relevant to specific activities proposed for this project.
Comment-72 - Edson Watershed Analysis (WA) page 28, “Overall, based on monitoring results using the Soil
Disturbance Monitoring Protocol (Page- Dumroese, et al., 2009) and anecdotal evidence on pumice soils, Edson
watershed soils show low levels with only one to four percent of the area with high levels of disturbance. Only
relict converging main skidtrails on fine to medium fine-grained soils are over the soil quality standard threshold
bulk density levels. With most soils being medium to coarse grained, soil compaction levels are low throughout
the watershed along with soil disturbance.”(9)

Discussion: See also Comment-70. With protection measures in place (SOPs for wet weather and following
BMPs for soil protection) and decompaction of units currently above threshold (4 units), the entire project
area is expected to meet the soil porosity standard of at least 90% of the natural porosity for the soil over at
least 85% of the treatment unit (see Chapter 3, Soils).
Comment-73 - "The Forest Service may only yard timber if the activity will be ""carried out in a manner consistent
with the protection of soil."" 16 USC §1604(g)(3)(F)(v); 36 CFR §219.27(c)(6). Management plans and projects
must ""insure that timber will be harvested from National Forest System lands only where-""soil, slope, or other
watershed conditions will not be irreversibly damaged."" (6)

Discussion: The EIS discloses evaluation of project actions for compliance with the Forest Plan soil quality
standards and for National Forest Management Act compliance.
Comment-74 - Medford District BLM: Resource management plans call for limiting compaction in harvested areas in
order to minimize soil productivity losses. Therefore, no additional use of mechanical equipment for fuels
reduction was proposed, as ground-based logging would compact up to 12 10 percent of the harvest units. This
is particularly important in the Cottonwood planning area as the majority of soils contain high rock content. It was
identified that ripping the soils in this area would bring rocks and cobbles to the surface. The priority was given to
minimizing the soil area compacted instead of trying to mitigate the effects. Additionally, the harvest prescription
resulting in relatively few trees per acre being cut minimizes the slash, and consequently, also reduces the need
for mechanical fuel treatment. (6)

Discussion: As described in Comment-3, there are areas of already high fuel loadings that are too large or too
many to be addressed by hand piling or burning alone. The DEIS evaluates project actions for treatments,
including mechanical fuel reduction, in the Soils section of Chapter 3.
Comment-75 - Soil integrity is a key issue for this timber sale. Please address soil chemistry, productivity, hydrology,
and biological integrity on a site-specific (i.e., unit-by-unit) basis. Please map soil types and composites using
field reconnaissance data and include the maps in the NEPA document. Include a qualified, journey-level soil
scientist on the ID Team. Design actions and mitigation after you have collected field reconnaissance data on
soils at every site proposed for action. (6)

Discussion: The project was field evaluated by a qualified soil scientist. Information relative to the analysis is
described in the specialist report and summarized in the Soils section of DEIS Chapter 3.

Transportation
Comment-76 - Numerous road segments are proposed for Closure or Decommission conflict with the MVUM (the
development of which included participation by recreation groups and the public); these closures infringe upon
the Public’s ability to recreate on THEIR national forest. (4)

Discussion: A project travel analysis process (TAP) (Bonivert, 2015a) was completed for the project. Portions
of the road analysis process completed for the Pilgrim project overlap the Elk project area and that document
was incorporated as well. A need exists to increase Forest transportation system efficiency and provide access
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

B-31

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

to a dispersed recreation area in Elk Flat. The TAP completed for the project recommends an approximately
0.10 miles of existing unauthorized route that is currently utilized as public access to a dispersed recreation
area in Elk Flat should be added to the FTS as an open level 2 road to provide legal motorized access. A need
exists to remove several unauthorized routes in the project area from the landscape for restoration to a more
natural condition.
Travel Management is an on-going effort that will continue to evolve as work is done to analyze and modify
the transportation system to meet the recreational and access needs of local citizens and visitors, while
protecting important resources. Subsequent decisions will be made using the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) process which allows the public to be involved in the decision making process. These decisions
will result in changes to route designations on the forest. Route designations are reflected on the Motor
Vehicle Use Maps (MVUM). The MVUM will be revised annually to reflect modification and improvements
to the Forest transportation system.
Comment-77 - Decommissioning temporary roads can result in sedimentation so they should be obliterated and
seeded instead. (1)

Discussion: The DEIS discloses the effects of the proposed activities relative to hydrology. Temporary roads
would be decommissioned following Forest Service policy and/or timber sale contract provisions, which
include blocking normal vehicular traffic. The roads will be located in relatively flat areas with no streams or
waterways nearby. Obliteration, which includes scarifying the road and re-contouring the road prism back to a
properly functioning condition, is the highest level of decommissioning. Depending on ground conditions,
obliteration is one of the decommissioning options for temporary roads.
Comment-78 - Roads at 4.6 -> 3.1 miles per square mile cause significant impacts to habitat by fragmentation and
increase of fire risk by humans. (7)

Discussion: The DEIS discloses the effects of the proposed activities relative to connectivity and fuels and
fire effects.
Comment-79 - We are very aware there will be undue pressure put on the decision maker to not develop any
temporary roads for this project. We take the opposite view point. Temporary roads can allow for more effective
and efficient management of the public’s land. They can provide for better economics and in many cases reduce
environmental impacts as compared to alternative treatments such as long skids. (2)

Discussion: The need for temporary roads was carefully evaluated for the project. Temporary roads in
thinning and meadow enhancement units across the project area would be used or constructed to provide
access for harvest operations. Approximately 1.5 to 2.9 miles of new temporary road are proposed to facilitate
the project’s proposed actions. About 4.7 to 5.7 miles of existing unauthorized routes may be used for the
project and then decommissioned.
Comment-80 - I am concerned about proposals to build roads in the Elk Flat LSR.(8)

Discussion: There is no new permanent road construction proposed for the project or in the LSR. Temporary
roads are proposed and would be decommissioned after project completion, as discussed in Comment-79.
Comment-81 - Edson WA page 74, “Transportation System -The current GIS transportation layer (4/09) shows the
Edson watershed contains approximately 505 miles of road, including forest development roads, private
timberland roads, and other unclassified roads. Approximately 212 miles of routes in the analysis area are
designated for vehicle travel on national forest. Approximately 23.9 miles of unauthorized routes exist where
motorized travel is prohibited.” Edson WA page 75, “Current road density in the watershed is approximately 4
miles of road per square mile of land.” Given that the current road density in the watershed is approximately 4
miles of road per square mile of land, we are curious to know how soils standards are being met in this
throughout the Edson watershed. Please disclose the cumulative impacts to soils caused by reconstruction of
four miles of road, construction of two miles of “temporary” roads, landing construction and machine piling.
Please note that road closure does not substitute for decommissioning nor does it eliminate the negative
environmental effects.(9)

Discussion: Please refer to Comment-62. The DEIS (Chapter 3, Transportation) describes the direct, indirect
and cumulative effects of transportation.
Comment-82 - It is important an adequate road system be developed and utilized in order to effectively and
efficiently harvest the timber from this project. (2)

Discussion: As noted in Comment-76, a TAP was prepared. The project area was evaluated for project
facilitation as well as recreational and access needs and protection of important resources.
Comment-83 - While decommissioning unneeded roads is understandable and supportable we also ask that serious
consideration be made for including temporary road construction that will assist with the implementation of this
project. We encourage the building of temporary spurs where feasible to reduce the harvest costs and more
effectively treat the land base. (2)

Discussion: The project utilizes existing unauthorized routes as well as limited temporary road construction
to facilitate project actions. Temporary roads would be decommissioned post project.
Comment-84 - Careful analysis should be done for those roads earmarked for decommissioning. Make sure they
have been identified in your travel management planning efforts and that no roads are planned for closure that
have been designated as open in the travel management plan.(2)

Discussion: Please refer to Comment-76.
Comment-85 - "Trombulack, S.C. and C.A. Frissell. 2000. Review of ecological effects of roads on terrestrial and
aquatic communities. Conservation Biology 14(1): 18-30. “Various studies (e.g., Ortega and Capen 1999; Marsh
and Beckman 2004) show that the negative impacts of roads to wildlife habitat are not limited to the road prism –
there is a zone of influence that extends into the adjacent habitat. For example, Marsh and Blackman (2004)
found that some terrestrial salamanders decreased in abundance up to 80 meters from the edge of a forest road
due to soil desiccation for the edge effects. Ortega and Capen (1999) found that ovenbird (a forest-interior
species) nesting density was reduced within 150 meters of forest roads. This study suggests that even narrow
forest roads fragment habitat and exert negative effects on the quality of habitat for forest-interior species.”(6)

Discussion: The article by Stephen C. Trombulak and Christopher A. Frissell (2000), “Review of Ecological
Effects of Roads on Terrestrial and Aquatic Communities” is a general accounting of how road construction
and maintenance can impact terrestrial and aquatic organisms through habitat fragmentation, compaction of
soils, collision/construction related mortality, invasive species introduction/spread and chemical
contamination.
The project will not construct new permanent roads. To avoid new disturbance, unauthorized routes (existing
routes) will be utilized when available (about 5.7 miles for Alternative 1). New temporary road construction is
limited (about 2.9 miles for Alternative 1). All temporary roads would decommissioned post project. The
proposed temporary roads will allow access for necessary equipment to accomplish the prescribed treatment
of the units and will also alleviate the need for long skid trails that could impact soils resources and existing
vegetation. Best Management Practices will be used to minimize or eliminate soil or hydrologic impacts. The
assessment of the anticipated effect of the proposed roads on air quality, noxious weed spread, fisheries,
wildlife and hydrology has been completed and is found in each respective section of Chapter 3.

Watershed
Comment-86 - The Forest Service is proposing temporary road and landing construction; gap creation and
regeneration logging; ground-based yarding and machine piling, which will increase the hydrological and
terrestrial impacts of the equivalent roaded acres in the planning area. (6)

Discussion: The DEIS (Chapter 3) discloses the effects of the proposed activities relative to hydrology
including ERA at the project scale.
Comment-87 - Timber harvest and road building can cause sediment and turbidity problems even when these
activities take place outside of the reserves. (6, 7)

Discussion: The DEIS (Chapter 3) discloses the effects of the proposed activities relative to hydrology inside
and outstide of the Riparian Reserves.
Comment-88 - Proposed riparian reserve thinning would not achieve aquatic conservation strategy objectives. (6)
There are already impacts to soils, water quality, and RR in Ash Creek from previous logging. We don’t believe
this project will meet ACS objectives. Again, we would expect substantive analyses of these issues that meet the
requirements of NEPA. (7)

Discussion: The DEIS discloses the effects of the proposed activities relative to the aquatic conservation
strategy. The Forest Plan Standards and Guidelines for timber management in Riparian Reserves allow for the
application of silvicultural practices and salvage in Riparian Reserves when they are needed to control
catastrophic events, control stocking, reestablish and manage stands, and acquire desired vegetation
characteristics needed to attain Aquatic Conservation Strategy objectives (USDA Forest Service 1995, p. 454).
Comment-89 - With regard to “large wood” (EA p. 50), NMFS 2010:9 states that “[a]lthough NMFS included this [24
inch diameter] value in NMFS (1996), and did not advocate changing the value during negotiations on the AP
document, we recognize now that (1) it does not provide a target that is based on reference conditions for
Westside forests, (2) this target is not sensitive to site-specific conditions (e.g., stream size and power), and (3)
use of this target exclusively results in analyses that do not adequately address other sizes of wood that provide
important ecological functions in streams” Thus the size standards used for the desired condition are not
appropriate because all sizes wood entering small streams would improve channel function. NMFS 2010 p.6
states: “[a]ll wood and other organic material, whether large or small, is important to the proper functioning of
streams; none of it is unimportant.” NMFS further states that “[o]f particular note is that large wood that cannot
singly form pools will form pools in combination with other pieces of wood and other obstructions by forming
“wood jams.” The NMFS 2010:4 state: “[w]hile thinning increases tree diameters, it does not increase tree
heights; thus, it will not increase the length of tree boles entering streams.” (6)

Discussion: The Forest Service recognizes the need for and benefits of large woody debris within riparian
systems. The project would retain an average of 6 to 10 large down logs per acre as described on page 88.
Retained logs are to be in a variety of decay classes with a preference for 20-inch diameter logs, or the largest
size class available. Within all Riparian Reserves, embedded downed logs, stumps and riparian plants and root
systems will be retained during burning operations with minimal (up to 5%) damage. The project area does
not contain anadromous fisheries that NMFS is the regulatory and resource agency for. It is not located within
an anadromous watershed. While the comments included from NMFS (2010) are valuable in terms of overall
LWD benefits in stream systems, these comments are also out of context. The comments are clearly
addressing the AP document (which is the 2004 Analysis Process for assessing impacts to anadromous fish
and habitats within the NWFP area).
Comment-90 - The USFS and BLM should leave more thinned trees on the ground in riparian areas, particularly
close to streams, on floodplains, and on steep sideslopes where some trees are likely to slide down into streams,
than are required to meet wildlife needs.(6)

Discussion: The Forest Service does recognize the need for and benefits of large woody debris within riparian
systems. Currently within the project area there are places (along Ash Creek) where large amounts of woody
debris have caused debris dams and channel widening. This has resulted in an increased rate of bank erosion
as water moves around the log jams (see existing condition for a description and photo). After treatment, the
Forest Service expects the rate of woody debris input would change from the undesirable current state of
whole tree failure, causing bank erosion and debris dams, to incremental input of woody debris as riparian
vegetation stabilizes banks and forest stands increase in health and vigor.
Comment-91 - In order to better portray environmental baseline conditions and to understand the likely effects of
thinning proposals, the USFS and BLM should develop stand data separately for riparian and upland forests.(6)

Discussion: The comment is noted and the Silviculture and Forest Health section and specialist report
describe the stand inventory methods. Data was collected based on stands – areas with similar tree species,

density, seral stage, canopy cover, overstory tree diameter and stand development characteristics. However,
the project hydrologist, wildlife biologist and silviculturist conducted field reviews in the Riparian Reserves
to better describe the existing conditions and develop treatments and resource protection measures. There was
not a sole reliance on the 2007 Common Stand Exam data and inventory plots for describing the baseline
conditions in the Riparian Reserves.
Comment-92 - The document states the No Action alternative would result in continued impacts to water quality and
stream channel floodplain function and Elk Flat meadow from existing unauthorized routes. This statement is
telling because it demonstrates that past mitigation from past projects has failed causing water quality problems;
past activities have likely altered the stream channel floodplain; and illegal OHV use is occurring and the Forest
has not acted to stop it. The Forest uses this project as a red herring to “fix” these problems. The Forest could
correct these problems without a timber sale. (7)

Discussion: The Purpose and Need for Action and Proposed Actions recognizes the needs in this Project.
Currently, there are not other proposals that would also address the identified needs; therefore, No Action
does not address them.
Comment-93 - "A copy of the National Marine Fisheries Service 84 page memo (NMFS 2010) supports our
contention that commercial thinning the riparian reserve is not appropriate and is likely harmful for achieving
aquatic conservation objectives. NMFS 2010 p. 8 states that “In examining forest thinning proposals designed to
accelerate the development of late-successional forest conditions and restore instream fish habitat, NMFS is
finding that, in many cases, they are likely to do neither. NMFS 2010: 31 states “our results suggest that the
thinning regimes proposed by the Siuslaw National Forest will delay the development of key structural elements
of forest and stream habitat by more than a century. The delay in stream habitat recovery can be minimized by
creating a no cut buffer of 150 feet or more in width between streams and any forest thinning operations.” The
NMFS 2010: 4 states that “[t]he tradeoff of getting a few more large standing live trees sooner at the expense of
a continuous supply of both large and small trees over the long term period always needs to be considered.”" (6)

Discussion: The DEIS describes the specific thinning treatments proposed for the Riparian Reserves. The
treatments are designed to address site-specific variation within the Riparian Reserves. Thinning would be
implemented to both retain current stand densities for shade and thermal regulation on terraces, and reduce
shade to promote riparian vegetation development for near-stream shade, water temperature, thermal
regulation, stream bank strength, and stream bank stabilizing vegetation such as willow (Simon, et al., 2002).
Resource protection measures are included in chapter 2 of the DEIS to ensure that the activities are consistent
with the ACS objectives and Riparian Reserve function. See also Comment-89 regarding NMFS. Again, while
the comments included from NMFS (2010) are relative to the ACS objectives and late-successional reserves,
they are also placed out of context. The Elk project will have site-specific protection measures and treatments
for the Riparian Reserves associated with Elk Flat, along Ash Creek and other portions of the project area (see
Figure 2 in Chapter 1).
Comment-94 - The forthcoming NEPA document must analyze and disclose the impacts of road construction,
landing construction, timber haul and soil compaction on peak flows, flow timing, and sediment loading.(6)
It appears the Forest Service is proposing logging activities within designated riparian reserves. Aquatic
conservation is therefore a significant issue for this action. Direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of proposed
activities on hydrologic function, sediment regimes, stream temperatures, nutrient cycling, pH, and habitat
connectivity should be evaluated in detail. Consider both positive and negative impacts. Implement the ACS at
the site scale and meet its objectives immediately after the project’s implementation, not in the “long-term”
several years out.(6)

Discussion: The purpose and need recognizes old landings and unauthorized routes exist on Ash Cr
floodplains and recontouring floodplains is needed to promote the Aquatic Conservation Strategy. The DEIS
(Chapter 3, Hydrology section) discloses the effects of the proposed activities relative to hydrology.
Comment-95 - The USFS and BLM should include all sizes of wood in describing environmental baseline conditions
and in analyzing the effects of its proposed actions, not just pieces of wood that are greater than 24 inches in
diameter and greater than 50 ft in length.D137(6)

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Discussion: In the DEIS, Chapter 3, Methodology for fire and fuels, as well as the fuels specialist report, the
inventory is described. Surface fuel data collection was completed using the Brown’s method. This inventory
accounts for all down wood from less than ¼” to the largest log. The 2007 Common Stand Exams, and follow
up field reviews in 2011-2015, documented the coarse wood size classes. As fuel accumulations have
increased since 2007, the data collected at that time should only be seen as a general representation of size
classes. The majority of additional CWD recruitment has occurred in the ponderosa pine-dominated stands
located in the eastern and southeastern portions of the project area. However, additional pockets of mortality
scattered across all natural stands and older plantations, and diseased white fir, have also contributed.
Comment-96 - The USFS and BLM should adjust their tree diameter targets based on stream size. Database curves
are available for both functional-sized and key pieces of wood (e.g., Fox and Bolton 2007).I134(6)

Discussion: See the discussion for Comment-93 for the thinning prescriptions developed near streams.
Comment-97 -We urge the Forest Service to propose and implement a vegetation management project that
implements the ACS of the Northwest Forest Plan and the findings and recommendations of the Watershed
Analysis by:
Avoiding and deferring new road construction;
Minimizing new landing construction; and
Decommissioning unneeded roads.(6)

Discussion: No new permanent roads are proposed for construction. Limited temporary road construction is
proposed (with decommissioning post-project). Existing landings will be used where feasible and if in
compliance with all RPM’s (legacy landings in Riparian Reserves will not be utilized and all new landings
will be constructed outside of Riparian Reserves), minimizing new landing construction. Decommissioning
existing unauthorized routes, new temporary roads, landings and skid trails is included in the action
alternatives considered in detail.
Comment-98 - Please analyze and disclose the cumulative effects from past, current and future logging, cattle
grazing and other land management activities and their effect on Riparian Reserves and riparian dependent
species.(9)

Discussion: Please refer to Comment-62. The hdrology analysis in the DEIS discloses cumulative effects.

Wildlife
Comment-99 - Reducing basal area down to 150 square/feet acre does not maintain high quality foraging habitat or
nesting/roosting habitat. (7)
Thinning to 50-70 foot spacing with a basal area of 60 square/foot per acre would not retain foraging habitat for
the owl. The proposed action will destroy the entire function of the LSR and the CHU. (7)

Discussion: The wildlife Biological Assessment will address the predicted effects of the variable density
thinning treatments and prescribed basal areas, prescribed fire, and other treatments on NSO habitat
(including critical habitat) in the short and long term. This information will be summarized in Chapter 3 of the
EIS. The analysis will also discuss the proposed activities effects and compliance with LSR direction and the
Final Rule for NSO critical habitat (December 2012).
Comment-100 - Logging for fuel reduction impacts owl and prey habitat, e.g. reduction of complex woody structure,
and the long-term reduction in recruitment of large snags and dead wood. Fuel reduction logging also has
complex effects on fire hazard with potential to increase fire hazard, especially when fuel reduction efforts involve
removal of canopy trees. (6)

Discussion: The predicted effects of the proposed activities, such as fuel reduction, on the northern spotted
owl and its prey will be described in the wildlife Biological Assessment. This information will be summarized
B-36

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

in Chapter 3 of the EIS. The project-level fuels report and EIS will also asses and summarize the expected
effects of fuel reduction relative to fire behavior and intensity effects.
Comment-101 - We would expect a legitimate BE be prepared for this project that discloses all direct and indirect
impacts to sensitive species. We already know the Forest’s determination for all sensitive species is “may affect,
not likely to adversely affect” because that is the determination made for each and every project in the SMMU.
But now that we have documented at least 10 major FS projects and 40 THPs in the SMMU – that are all logging
late-successional habitat, increasing fragmentation, and decreasing connectivity, we would ask that a
substantive rationale be provided for MANLAA determination for each species.

Discussion: The Forest will prepare a Biological Evaluation that addresses the proposed project activities and
their predicted direct, indirect and cumulative effects on sensitive wildlife species.
Comment-102 - When all this evidence is put together, it becomes clear that "saving" the spotted owl by logging its
habitat to reduce fuels often does not make any sense. (5)

Discussion: The project does not propose to ‘save the spotted owl by logging its habitat to reduce fuels’. The
proposed action was designed based on direction in the NWFP, Forest Plan and Forest-wide LateSuccessional Reserve Assessment (LSRA) treatment objectives. Without action, continued losses in early-,
mid- and late-successional stands and existing and developing structural composition are expected to result
from the combination of tree overstocking and density-related mortality, root disease, epidemic insect attacks
and predicted lethal fire effects. Then “No Action” alternative and its effects on overall tree growth, stand
health (approximated using Stand Density Indices based on tree species composition) and fire behavior (of
unplanned/natural ignitions) will be modeled and summarized in the EIS. The expected general results of “No
Action” are a continued loss of late-successional tree species (i.e., the pine component), continued stagnation
of habitat development for late-successional dependent wildlife species (as well as a decline in habitat
quantity and quality), and failure to maintain or meet Forest Plan and LSRA objectives for the Elk Flat LSR
and surrounding stands. While NSOs can make use of some post-fire landscapes, fire also reduces the
function of some habitat and likely removes important habitat (nesting/roosting) from immediate usability,
particularly in areas of high-severity fire.
The proposed action includes risk reduction treatments in early-, mid- and late-successional habitat, consistent
with the NWFP, Forest Plan and LSRA. The variable density thinning treatments that will thin trees to varying
stand basal areas (dependent on species composition); retain unthinned patches of large and small trees, whole
stands and microsite habitat elements (e.g., patches or small groups of small and large trees for
roosting/resting sites); install small ~¼-acre and large (~2 acre) gaps in homogenous plantations or white firdisease centers; and radial thin around legacy pine and black oak are also consistent with several of the dry
forest restoration principles and ecological forestry approaches discussed in the Revised Recovery Plan for
the Northern Spotted Owl (USDI-FWS 2011) and the Final Rule for NSO Critical Habitat (USDI-FWS 2012).
Strategic treatment of surface and ladder fuels where they exceed Forest Plan standards and guidelines and to
meet wildlife habitat capability models, and reintroducing fire, are also included in the proposed action. The
proposed action will not log within nesting/roosting and higher quality foraging habitat for the NSO (or
important reproductive habitats for the Forest Service sensitive northern goshawk and fisher). Prescribed fire
will be implemented in these areas however, with the mechanical thinning and fuels reduction treatments
discussed above strategically placed to better protect these habitat areas from loss. The Forest Service expects
that implementing these treatments would reduce the risk of further stand loss and increase resiliency in the
treated stands so they are better able to withstand and survive disturbances like prolonged drought, root and
other diseases, insect attacks and low to moderate-severity fire conditions.
Comment-103 - We note the north side of the project area is clearcut as well as the south side. There is one THP
that appears to be inside the project area. How is the FS maintaining dispersal habitat and connectivity with this
significant level of current forest fragmentation? The loss of forest habitat and the dramatic increase in
fragmentation is obviously impacting NSO that continue to decline by 5.5% in N CA. (7)

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Discussion: It is not clear what the comment is referring to in terms of the north side of the project area being
clearcut. There is private land immediately north and west of the project area, but not within the project area.
There are planned and ongoing Timber Harvest Plans on the private lands in these areas where regeneration
harvest has been used in the past, and is also planned in the future. There has been no regeneration harvest in
the northern portion of the project area however. The comment’s reference to clearcuts in the south side of the
project area is also not clear. A clearcut is defined as “a stand in which essentially all trees have been removed
in one operation (Society of American Foresters 2010). The Pilgrim Vegetation Management Project treated
three units (305, 453, 456) southeast of the project area with a regeneration harvest that retained 15% of the
treatment stand and it may appear to be a ‘clearcut’. Prior salvage treatments within the south-central portion
of the project area also occurred (see EIS Appendix G that discusses cumulative effects). These treatments
were deemed appropriate for those projects and the existing conditions within the ponderosa pine-dominated
and white fir stands of root disease and insect attacks, though each treatment retained reserve trees that were
healthier or a different species than ponderosa pine. Directly south of the project area is Coonrod Flat, and
this area is a natural opening and may appear to be a ‘clearcut’.
Regardless, the habitat typing for NSO in the project area and action area (including private lands and NFS
lands outside the project area) will be completed for the Elk LSR Enhancement project. From field reviews,
portions of areas to the north, west and east (and all areas south and southeast) of the project area are not
considered suitable or dispersal habitat for the NSO. Additionally, portions of the eastern/southeastern portion
of the project area are also not considered suitable or dispersal habitat, primarily due to the ponderosa pinedominated stands, lack of prey base and low water availability. With the Elk LSR Enhancement project, the
Forest aims to maintain dispersal and connectivity where it occurs within the LSR through various treatments
that will maintain adequate canopy cover, tree size classes, perching and roosting structure, large and small
down wood, small trees, shrubs and prey base that support dispersing NSOs, fisher, and northern goshawk.
The Riparian Reserve network along Ash Creek would also contribute to connectivity within the LSR and its
varied successional habitats, in accordance with the Forest Plan (USDA-FS 1995 pp. 3.27, 4.14, 4.41). The
Forest Service currently has no influence on management of surrounding private lands and maintaining
connectivity, though privately managed timberlands are required to comply with the California Forest Practice
Rules and often include protection measures along streamcourses and to maintain habitat elements in
proximity to NSO and other federally listed and state-protected species. The wildlife Biological Assessment,
Biological Evaluation and Draft and Final EIS will evaluate connectivity within and outside of the Elk Flat
LSR in relation to other LSRs.
The Forest is aware of the range-wide annual population decline of NSO, which was reported as 2.8% in the
2012 meta-analysis (Forsman, et al., 2011; Forsman, et al., 2012). That meta-analysis was based on annual
survey data from 1985-2008 in the 11 demographic study areas under the NWFP. In regards to the 5.5%
decline noted in the comment, it is not clear what this number refers to as there are no “5.5% declines for N
CA [northern California]” noted in any of the recent literature, 2011 Revised Recovery Plan, 2012 Critical
Habitat Rule, the 2011/2012 meta-analysis or any other NSO study area reports for northern California. The
Northwestern California demographic study area’s estimated population decline (based on annual survey
results and response rates) has been less than 3% since monitoring began in 1985 (Franklin et al. Various
Years). That specific demographic study area is located ~65 miles west of the project area in a much different
habitat type. There are no demographic study areas on the Shasta-McCloud Management unit; however local
species status information for NSO on the SMMU and the project area (extending from 1989 to current year),
as well as any updated rangewide population information, will be discussed in the project’s wildlife
Biological Assessment.
Comment-104 We look forward to reviewing the voodoo science the FS used to claim that Recovery Actions 10 and
32 will be met in this project. (7)

Discussion: How the Forest interprets the proposed action, project design and the project’s overall
consistency with the Revised Recovery Plan, including prioritization under Recovery Action 10 and habitat

conservation and enhancement under Recovery Action 32, will be addressed in an appendix to the Biological
Assessment.
Comment-105 - The document states there are only 720 acres of designated critical habitat in the project area.
Please break down the amount of N/R/F habitat that makes up these 720 acres. We also request the amount of
N/R/F habitat in the owl AC and LSR. What are they pre project and post project? How does thinning ALL
foraging habitat in the LSR/CHU benefit the owl and other late-successional species. Every project on the maps
we included have logged virtually ALL remaining owl foraging habitat. We fail to see how this benefits the owl
when its population continues to decline on the Forest. (7)

Discussion: Under the 2012 Final Rule that designated critical habitat for the NSO, there are 720 acres within
the project area (wholly in the western portion). The PENDING-Wildlife section in Chapter 3 of the dEIS and
the Biological Assessment (to be included as an appendix to the EIS) will address the existing
conditions/acres of nesting/roosting, foraging, dispersal, capable and non-habitats for the NSO. This baseline
information for the project area (and NSO action area) will also be included for the ST-215 activity center
core and home range, and any additional activity centers in the action area, critical habitat and the LSR
allocation. Effects to these habitat types will also be discussed, including the beneficial, discountable,
insignificant, adverse short-term, and short- and long-term beneficial effects.
Comment-106 - The document states NSO have been detected in the project area since 2003, but in 2012 a Barred
owl pair was discovered. How will this project decrease the value of habitat for NSO and increase the value of
habitat for Barred owls? How will NSO prey be affected? (7)

Discussion: The proposed action scoping document states “The last nesting at the ST-215 activity center
occurred in 1990 and no NSOs have been detected during the surveys completed over the nine years of
surveys since 2003 (District NSO Survey Records).” Information was provided to the Forest on May 9, 2013
(after the scoping document was released) by a local contract biologist regarding the find of a probable NSO
feather in the ST-215 activity center in June 2011 and this information will be included in the species status
and survey section of the Biological Assessment. A barred owl pair was detected in 2012 and NSO survey
efforts based on the most recent (January 2012) survey protocol will be continued through and after project
implementation, per annual discussion and coordination with the FWS. Effects to prey that NSO may utilize
in the project area, and the potential for competitive barred owl/NSO interactions will also be discussed in the
project Biological Assessment. -. In the map we included documenting all the owl ACs that CalFire lists in the
SMMU, there is only one AC in the project area. However, the Elk LSR has at least 6 other ACs nearby that
are being impacted by the other FS TS and THPs. How is the FS working to recover the NSO on the STNF
when it is logging all CHUs, logging all remaining foraging habitat, and nesting/roosting habitat is below
threshold levels in every AC throughout the SMMU. (7)
The Biological Assessment and EIS will address connectivity within the Elk Flat LSR (and outside of it to
other LSRs which typically either had or have an NSO occupied activity center). An appendix to the
Biological Assessment will also discuss the Forest’s interpretation of the project’s consistency with Recovery
Plan’s recommendations for Recovery Actions 10 and 32 (see Comment-104). It is beyond the scope of this
project to assess other treatments on private lands or National Forest System lands within critical habitat and
those effects (unless they fall within the action area as defined under the ESA or the established cumulative
effects analysis area for NEPA). Effects to the East Cascades Critical Habitat Unit, specifically Subunit 3-East
Cascades South [ECS-3], will likely be addressed in the project Biological Opinion however, pending the
determination for critical habitat. Treatments in other project areas in close proximity to the Elk LSR
Enhancement project that affected NSO critical habitat (e.g., Mudflow, Algoma) and those that are more
distant (Porcupine) were designed to maintain foraging and dispersal habitat function post-treatment while
increasing overall tree and stand resilience. Those projects were also designed to not treat within
nesting/roosting habitat or higher quality subsets of NRF habitat. While the Algoma project may have shortterm adverse effects to critical habitat elements of foraging (PCE3), the other three projects were found to
have beneficial and insignificant effects. Annual stand searches at activity centers (as time, staff and funding
permit) and project-level surveys in these areas have continued and will continue, providing the SMMU with
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

B-39

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

additional data on NSO occupancy and annual reproduction, though survey results may not always be
conclusive given the potential presence of barred owls.
Comment-107 - The regional decline of migratory birds is a significant issue for this project. Numerous studies have
reported local and regional trends in breeding and migratory bird populations throughout North America (e.g.,
DeGraaf and Rappole 1995, Sauer et al. 2004). These studies suggest geographically widespread population
declines that have provoked conservation concern for birds, particularly neotropical migrants (Askins 1993). (6)

Discussion: The project was designed in accordance with Forest Plan and LSRA management direction
LSRA and recommendations from the Watershed Analysis. Opportunities to promote conservation of
migratory birds and their habitats in the project area were considered during project and resource protection
measure (RPM) development. This is in accordance with the December 2008/June 2014 Memorandum of
Understanding, specifically Section C: item 1, and Section D: items 3a-3d, and 6. The migratory bird report
for the project will address the bird species of management concern for the Forest. This includes those that are
listed under the Endangered Species Act as threatened or endangered, those designated by the Regional
Forester as sensitive, those associated with management indicator assemblages (MIAs) affected by the
project, and those species of conservation concern within the Great Basin Bird Conservation Region (BCR-9;
(USDA-FS & USDI-FWS, 2008). The project and specific treatments were designed to help ensure that
treated areas continue to provide habitat necessary to maintain a diversity of species at both the stand and
landscape scale after the project is completed. This includes development and implementation of specific
RPMs that limit operations in important breeding areas at critical reproductive times and that retain shrubs,
trees, down logs and snags that provide habitats for migratory birds. Treatments were designed to reducing
reduce the risk of continued tree and stand loss and increase stand resilience; accelerate development of latesuccessional and old growth forest; restore meadow habitat at Elk Flat; retain (and enhance) black oak and
aspen habitats; improve water table elevation, streamflow and water quality and vegetation conditions within
riparian reserves; and decommission unauthorized routes. The RPMs and treatments are intended to reduce
the potential for adverse effects to, and enhance habitats for, individuals that are part of local and regional
populations. But they are not considered significant at the scale of affecting local or regional population
patterns that may be more threatened in other parts of their range or the region due to climatic and weather
patterns, predation, or other threats.
Comment-108 - Simply concluding that the scale of the project is small, relative to the size of the nation, hence
migratory bird populations will not be affected, will not suffice. As you know, the Spotted Owl was driven into
threatened status by lots of “little clearcuts” that individually were insignificant, but cumulatively resulted in
extensive habitat loss. (6)

The project includes numerous RPMS aimed at reducing the potential for adverse effects to individuals that
are part of local and regional populations. It is designed to enhance and protect late-successional habitat and
restore riparian and meadow habitat within the project area and provide for a variety of migratory bird
habitats in a variety of stages (see also Comment-107).
Comment-109 - Please consider and disclose how logging, particularly group selection and regeneration in 80-120
year old natural stands would effect cavity nesting birds. The Northwest Forest Plan Standards and Guidelines at
pages C-45-47 requires specific protection buffers for certain bird species including the White-headed
Woodpecker, Black-backed Woodpecker, Pygmy Nuthatch and Flammulated Owl. Three of these cavity-nesting
birds, with the exception of the Black-backed Woodpecker, have home ranges within Siskiyou County. (9)

Discussion: The 2001 ROD (USDA-FS & USDI-BLM, 2001) and Forest Plan include standards and
guidelines and management recommendations for white-headed woodpecker, black-backed woodpecker,
pygmy nuthatch and flammulated owl. There are no ‘protection buffers’ but the standard and guideline is: “To
ensure that the distribution and numbers of all four species do not decline on BLM Districts and National
Forests within the range of the northern spotted owl, adequate numbers of large snags and green-tree
replacements for future snags in appropriate forest types within the range of these four species will be
maintained in sufficient numbers to maintain 100 percent of potential population levels of these four species”
(pp. 33-34). The project area is located within the range of all four species and all species, as of the writing of

this Appendix response, have been observed during the wildlife fieldwork for the project (point counts; snag
and habitat quality assessments; NSO, northern goshawk and carnivore surveys; project field trips). Where
safely feasible and available, the project’s design addresses the standard and guideline and subsequent
management recommendations in the 2001 ROD. This is achieved by: retaining Douglas fir, sugar pine and
incense cedar snags larger than 20 inches diameter; retaining groups of snags in existing mortality pockets;
retaining, on average, 7 snags per acre ranging from 15 to 20+ inches diameter with a preference for snags
larger than 20” or largest size class available; within the forested portions of the meadow unit 402maintaining 15” or larger diameter snags; retaining all predominant trees as well as the majority of the
dominant and most of the codominant trees within thinning and meadow enhancement stands. The wildlife
analysis will consider and disclose how the variable density thinning treatments, including planned group
selections in 40+ year old ponderosa pine plantations and white fir disease infection centers in two 80-120
year old natural stands (152-1, 160), may affect cavity nesting birds. There is no regeneration logging or
mechanical regeneration treatment proposed. The wildlife analysis will also disclose other project effects on
these species’ habitats (underburning, hazard reduction treatments along roads/private property lines). The
silviculture report and EIS will include modeling data for the variable density thinning treatments that
describes the existing condition, and the expected post and 20 years post-thinning conditions for tree size
classes per acre, trees larger than 24” in diameter, and snags. Modeling limitations and assumptions will be
included in the silviculture, fuels and wildlife reports and the relevant EIS Chapter 3 methodology sections.
Comment-110 - Limited operating periods (LOP’s) can have significant negative impacts to implementing a proposed
action. LOP’s have serious implementation economic affects. Many of these restrict operations between
February 1 and September 15. This does not allow much time for harvest activities to occur prior to the wet
weather period. These restrictive LOP’s will significantly increase logging costs as contractors cannot afford to
utilize very expensive equipment for such a short time period. It is also more difficult to hire employees with such
a short guarantee for work. These factors need to be included in your logging cost assessment. (2)

Discussion: Limited operating periods will be used as a resource protection where necessary to reduce the
potential for adverse effects to breeding and rearing individuals. This includes listed, proposed listed and
Forest Service sensitive species and their habitats. In the case of the NSO or goshawk, an LOP would offer a
measure of protection to a known nest site that may reduce or eliminate disturbance during critical periods.
For fisher or migratory birds or other species of concern, an LOP may be used to protect habitat features that
may be used or removed. The Forest Plan mandates limited operating periods for listed and sensitive species,
including northern goshawks (USDA-1995 p. 4.30). It should also be noted that not every LOP and RPM that
may be needed is currently in the project, and in the event of a new discovery an additional or modification of
an existing LOP may be required, in accordance with timber sale contract provisions.
The current proposed LOPs will also be considered during stumpage appraisal. An appraiser can account for
the added cost of LOP’s in four ways: 1) Extend the length of the contract term. This would allow more time
for operations; 2) increase the number of times an operation moves in and moves out to address increased
number of operating seasons. This would increase the moving costs and help reduce the minimum bid for the
sale; 3) Increase the amount of equipment used. Appraising for increased equipment will increase the overall
logging cost; and 4) Using a cell on the R5 Log Cost Spreadsheet on the moving tab to “Input the estimated
days the operation (system wide) is likely to be shut down (without a move-out) over the general operating
season.” For example: Fire hazard, soil moisture, wildlife. The cost of the shut-down will be added to the sale
as a whole cost. The appraiser’s experience and knowledge will help them determine the number of days that
will be affected in LOP and make sure that the proper adjustments are made.
Comment-111 - We ask that owl surveys be done to protocol prior to sale advertisement in order to eliminate any
unnecessary LOP’s. (2)

Discussion: The Forest’s ability to conduct annual and pre-project surveys for NSOs, and other species, is
dependent on annual budgets, the approved Program of Work for the Forest and Management Unit, and
staffing levels. Surveys have been ongoing and are planned for NSO and are in accordance with the January
2012 FWS survey protocol. The protocol does include provisions for flexibility and modified surveys (stand

searches, spot checks, modified visits) and annual coordination with adjacent landowners and the FWS is also
planned. The LOPs that are currently proposed for the project are not considered unnecessary (see Comment110) and are a requirement under the Forest Plan or are minimization measures that were agreed to during
streamlined consultation with the FWS, and technical assistance, to help the Forest Service meet its
responsibilities under Section 7a(1) of the Endangered Species Act. In any given year, activities may occur
during the proposed LOPs if NSO stand searches and spot checks, or nest assessments done after June 1 for
northern goshawk determine there are NSO are no breeding individuals or young.
Comment-112 - When logging intended to benefit habitat will also reduce the quality of habitat, the NEPA analysis
must include some evaluation of ecological costs and benefits — e.g., the probability that logging will degrade
habitat vs. the probability that fuel reduction treatments will interact favorably with fire and thus benefit habitat.
This evaluation requires an estimate of the probability of future wildfire. To assume, as many analyses do, a
100% chance of future wildfire over-estimates the likelihood of treatments will interact with fire, thus overestimating the ecological value of fuel treatments, and under-estimating the ecological effects of logging on
habitat. (5)

Discussion: The project proposes various silvicultural techniques intended to increase the resilience of early-,
mid-, and late-successional forest stands in the Elk Flat LSR. In the case of a wildfire during the summer
season, fire behavior modeling predicts rates of spread, flame lengths, and resistance to control that would
lead to high acreage burned and significant post-fire adverse effects on resources. The Forest Vegetation
Simulator and Fire and Fuels Extension tool are used to model No Action and what fire behavior would be
with treatment. This modeling approach is based on data collected from the project area stand exams in 2007
and from the local Remote Automated Weather Station. Models are typically run under 90th and 97th
percentile weather conditions and the project’s purpose and need (and the modeling) do not assume a 100%
chance of future wildfire, but assess what might occur within stands in terms of fire behavior and intensity
(measured by rates of spread, flame lengths, severity) under those weather conditions.
Comment-113 - There is a strong interest among the federal land management agencies to conduct widespread
logging in suitable spotted owl habitat in order to reduce the effect of fire. The agencies view fuel reduction
logging as beneficial to owl habitat because modeling shows that fire behavior is moderated by fuel reduction,
but proponents never seem to conduct a careful evaluation of the relative probability, and the relative harms, of
logging versus wildfire. Strangely, the probabilistic aspects of this issue have been largely ignored in the owl
science literature, but recently explored in the forest-carbon literature which recently showed that although
thinning can modify fire behavior, logging to reduce fire effects is likely to remove more carbon by logging than
will be saved by modifying fire. (5)

Discussion: The comment is noted. See also the responses to Comment-1 and Comment-102.
Comment-114 - The Agency Must Quantitatively Disclose Future Snag Reductions and How this Will Impact Wildlife,
Especially Woodpeckers and Cavity Nesters. Large numbers of mature trees and snags will be removed from
proposed logging units. All of these trees would have died and created snags and down wood for wildlife. (6)

Discussion: There is no realistic method available to “quantitatively disclose” future snag reductions, as tree
mortality prior to, during and after the project will contribute to snags. In regards to the project’s effects on
current snags and future snag development, as described in Comment-13, the project will retain largest, oldest
trees as predominant and most dominant trees would be retained, regardless of their current health/condition.
The project also includes specific criteria for retaining or protecting individual snags and groups of snags as
described in Comment-20, and Chapter 2 of the EIS (resource protection measures). The UTPs and roost/rest
clumps will also retain snag habitat. Where safely feasible in LSR, snag retention areas (ranging from 5 to 10
acres) will be strategically located within or adjacent to existing mortality pockets. Snag retention areas will
consist of a range of snag size, decay and species classes with a preference for areas that contain larger
diameter snags (≥24 inches) that also have a live tree component for wind-throw protection and little to no
understory regeneration in known blackstain infection areas. Retention areas will be delineated by the project
wildlife biologist and trained marking crew/timber preparation staff. Units 158, 162, 175,176, 204 and 206 are
known to be affected by high levels of mortality and will likely have snag retention areas. No piling,
reforestation or other mechanical activities will occur in these areas under the project. In regards to “future

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

snag reductions”, the analysis for the project is limited to the timeframe that proposed activities would be
occurring and the timeframes that thinning and fuels treatments are expected to have an effect on the stand
development (e.g., thinning, landing/road construction, route decommissioning, machine piling/burning piles,
underburning). This timeframe typically spans 20 to 30 years, and all of these activities may remove trees,
remove snags, fall trees or snags and leave in place, or create snags. The modeling of the thinning and fuels
treatments for No Action and Action is expected to show the anticipated tree growth, and snag recruitment,
over this time period.
Comment-115 - "Snags are an essential element of forest health, forest structure, and late-successional habitat.
Thomas et al (1990) and the Fish and Wildlife Service (1990) defined Spotted Owl (old-growth) habitat as
including “numerous large snags.” Similarly, the Shasta-Trinity National Forest LRMP directs the agency to
“protect and enhance late-successional characteristics” in LSRs. Large snags are a key late-successional
characteristic. Hence snags should be retained as essential habitat elements in a Late Successional Reserve."
(6)

Discussion: The project was designed to be compliant with the management direction, standards and
guidelines and LSRA desired conditions for snags. See also the Discussion for Comment-20 and Comment114.
Comment-116 . The Forest must disclose how much forested habitat will be lost due to these activities. We also
request that placement of landings be disclosed. Stating those decisions will be made post decision is a violation
of NEPA. If the Forest has actually ground-truthed each unit as it claims it should be able to disclose where the
landings will be placed. (7)

Discussion: Chapter 3 will disclose effects from the proposed action and alternatives considered in detail,
including effects to forested habitat. Landing needs have been reviewed on the ground and estimated by
alternative.
Comment-117 - The pacific fisher, northern spotted owl, long-legged myotis, fringed myotis, Yuma myotis (all
bats),western bluebird and pileated woodpecker may all be affected by reduction of forest stand structure,
canopy closure and/or snag density in planning area. Please address and disclose the cumulative impacts of
your activities on these species. (6)

Discussion: See also the response to Comment-62. In accordance with the NFMA and Forest Service Manual
direction, the project’ Biological Evaluation will assess direct, indirect and cumulative effects to Forest
Service sensitive species (this includes, but is not limited to the fisher, northern goshawk, fringed myotis). In
accordance with the ESA, the project’s Biological Assessment will assess direct, indirect and cumulative
effects under the ESA for the northern spotted owl. A separate cumulative effects analysis under NEPA will be
completed for this subspecies. The information from these analyses that is relevant to the Issue Indicators and
Purpose and Need for the project will be summarized in Chapter 3 of the EIS. The other species listed in the
comment are not federally listed or designated by the Regional Forester as sensitive, nor are they special
status species under the NWFP. The project-level management indicator assemblage and migratory bird
compliance reports will address representative species for the assemblages (as guided by Forest Plan
direction); and birds of conservation concern within the Great Basin Bird Conservation Region (BCR-9;
USDI-FWS 2008). See also the responses to Comments 108, 109, 120 and 121.
Comment-118 - The forthcoming NEPA document should also address the impacts of the proposed logging and road
construction on Goshawks. A peer-reviewed survey of Goshawk habitat use suggests that current management
of the bird’s habitat may be inadequate to provide for its persistence in viable populations. Greenwald et al, A
review of northern goshawk habitat selection in the home range and implications for forest management in the
western United States. Wildlife Society Bulletin 2005, 33(1): 120-129. (6)

Discussion: The Forest has prepared a wildlife Biological Evaluation according to NFMA and Forest Service
Manual regulations, which includes the project’s predicted effects to northern goshawks (direct, indirect and
cumulative effects). A summary of the effects relevant to any Issue Indicators and the project’s purpose and
need will be disclosed in Chapter 3 of the EIS.
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

Comment-119 - "The forthcoming NEPA document for this project should analyze and disclose the potential impacts
of conifer thinning operations and brush removal on neotropical bird population trends." (6)

Discussion: Please also see Comment-107 and Comment-119. The compliance section in the EIS will
summarize the project’s compliance with current direction for migratory birds.
Comment-120 Comment 121 "The cumulative effects analysis on migratory birds should not rely exclusively on
Wilderness, Riparian Reserves and LSRs to provide for species viability into the future, because many Forest
Service and BLM Districts are actively logging those land use allocations, regardless of the effects on migratory
birds, despite their reserve status. We refer you to this very timber sale as one of many examples." (6)

Discussion: Cumulative effects for migratory birds are not assessed under NEPA. Please also see Comment107 and Comment-108 that discuss migratory bird compliance. The project will include a Migratory Bird
report that discloses the Forest’s compliance with the diversity requirements and direction under NFMA, and
the December 2008/June 2014 Memorandum of Understanding between the Forest Service and FWS to
promote the conservation and reduce take of migratory birds.
Comment-121 - Please develop and implement seasonal operational restrictions to avoid project impacts while land
birds are nesting in the project area. (6)

Discussion: The project includes protection measures for NSO and northern goshawk during critical breeding
periods. The project also includes protection measures designed to limit the potential for adverse effects to
ground-nesting and riparian-obligate migratory bird species in Elk Flat meadow and along the Ash Creek
Riparian Reserve when underburning. These protection measures will be implemented through use of LOPs,
managing smoke dispersal, and varying ignition patterns.
Comment-122 - Both carbon and spotted owl habitat tend to accumulate in relatively dense forests with intermediate
or longer fire return intervals. Thus, we can likely read these studies and replace the word "carbon" with the word
"spotted owl habitat" and the results will likely hold. (5)

Discussion: The comment is noted. Spotted owl habitat develops over time, and is typically based on tree and
shrub species composition, tree and snag size classes and conditions, down wood (large, decaying), and soil
types that support these conditions. Prey base is also required. It is not disputed that NSO habitat can be
shaped by fire, and low to moderate intensity fires can be beneficial due to increases in prey base. But as
evidenced in recent fires on and near the Shasta-Trinity National Forest (2008 Complexes, 2012 Bagley Fire,
2014 Complexes), high severity fire removes habitat that is suitable for nesting and roosting NSOs, which is a
required habitat element for NSO survival and population growth. Abiotic factors such as aspect, elevation
and slope position also all contribute to habitat development (as well as predicted NSO use). While dense
forests can provide spotted owl habitat, fires have been more severe in the past decade (see also the response
to Comment-1). The 2011 Revised Recovery Plan for the NSO describes that while thinning activity removes
carbon from the forest system in the short-term, it may reduce risk of subsequent carbon release through fire
or disease outbreak. It states that “Thinning can also encourage carbon being concentrated in fewer, larger
trees that approximate old-growth structure of pre-fire suppression forests (Hurteau et al. 2008)” though also
concedes that where, when and how such treatments occur needs to be carefully examined (USDI-FWS, 2011
pp. III-11).
The 20-year monitoring report summary for the ‘Status and Trend of Late-successional and Old-growth
Forests’ states: “some portions of the NWFP area have been setback by decades from achieving those
outcomes [expectations for older forest abundance, diversity, and connectivity] particularly resulting from
large wildfires in the fire-prone portions of the NWFP area” ( (Davis, et al., 2015). Also, the summary report
for the 20-year monitoring of the ‘Status and Trend of Northern Spotted Owl Habitat’ states: “large wildfires
continue to be the leading cause for loss of NSO habitats on federal lands. Most of these fire-related losses
have occurred within the network of large reserves that were designed for the protection and restoration of
habitat for long-term northern spotted owl conservation” (Davis, et al., 2015). This summary report further
notes that the loss rates in fire prone portions of the NSOs range exceeded the expected 2.5% rate for the 20B-44

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

year period at rates of 3.9-7.4% per decade. Climate change is expected to expand the area of fire-prone
landscapes and an increased frequency of large wildfires this century has already been observed. Most large
wildfires and resulting habitat losses have occurred in the federally reserved land use allocations. Monitoring
future trends of both wildfire and habitat will be important.
The 2011 Revised Recovery Plan for the NSO also states habitat loss from wildfire as one of the three main
threats to its recovery (USDI-FWS, 2011 pp. vii, II-2). It also discusses regional warming and consequent
drought stress as the most likely drivers of increased mortality rates of trees in recent decades in the western
United States, noting the increase was evident across the Pacific Northwest and California regions, elevations
(i.e., topography), tree size, type of trees, and fire-return-intervals (USDI-FWS, 2011 pp. III-9).
Comment-123 - To justify such fuel reduction logging in suitable owl habitat on ecological grounds requires several
findings: (1) that wildfire is highly likely to occur at the site of the treatment, (2) that if fire does occur it is likely to
be a severe stand-replacing event, and (3) that spotted owls are more likely to be harmed and imperiled by
wildfire than by logging at a scale necessary to reduce fire hazard. Available evidence does not support any of
these findings, which raises serious questions about the need for and efficacy of logging to reduce fuels in
western Oregon and other forests lacking frequent fire return intervals. (5)

Discussion: Please see the responses to Comment-4, Comment-5,Comment-100 Comment-102, Comment112and Comment-122 regarding fire and NSOs and NSO habitat.

Other
Comment-124 - Are there grazing allotments that overlap the proposed aspen treatments? (6)

Discussion: The Bartle grazing allotment overlaps the project area.
Comment-125 - "Coarse woody material densities should support the natural range of biota for the site. Snags and
down logs build soil and provide habitat for a variety of organisms critical to ecosystem recovery after natural
disturbance. The adaptive management direction of the NFP encourages site-specific research and planning for
CWM retention." (6)

Discussion: See Comment-23 and Comment-51.
Comment-126 - Economic consideration is very important for successful implementation of this project. It will be very
important to assess the feasibility of each logging system in relation to volumes per acre, size of trees being
removed, distance to landing, species of tree being removed, current delivered log prices, etc. (2)
We ask that you do an in-depth economic analysis in order to make sure your proposal is economically viable.
Logging costs, fuel costs, and haul costs have all increased dramatically over the last few years. We ask that you
take these recent increases into consideration in your economic analysis. (2)
Carefully assess and review proposed restrictions and mitigation items. It must be clearly documented they are
needed. Additional mitigation items will require contractors to incur additional costs for a project that may have
marginal economics.

Discussion: See Comment-23. Effects relative to economics have been assessed for the project (DEIS
Chapter 3, Socio-Economics). Although the project objectives are large scale disturbance risk reduction,
commercial timber sales and stewardship are recognized as a primary mechanism for moving the project area
toward the desired condition. The project may use a variety of methods including commercial timber harvest,
service contacts and mechanical fuel treatment to fulfill the purpose and need. A commercial timber sale is
one implementation mechanism planned for a portion of the project. Depending on the market conditions at
the time of implementation, biomass material that is 4 to 6.9 inches DBH may not be mechanically thinned
and removed, but instead would be treated on site with a combination of mechanical treatments, hand thinning
or thinned with prescribed fire during the underburning operations. The impact of requirements and
restrictions on timber sale operations is recognized by the Agency. That said, requirements and restrictions are
a cost of doing integrated resource management on National Forest System lands. This was considered during
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

B-45

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

the development of the project actions and alternatives. Economic viability of timber offerings is considered
during appraisal and contract preparation processes.
Regardless of the implementation method or funding source, project actions were designed to address and
enhance environmental conditions that are not monetary to meet the purpose and need. The effects analysis in
Chapter 3 provides environmental effects of the proposed actions.
Comment-127 - The current industry infrastructure is very important in terms of implementing your projects. This
needs to be a consideration when assessing economics and project design. As project size and volumes shrink
during the NEPA analysis it may not individually seem to have any impact on industries ability to implement. But
cumulatively, as all projects shrink, it has a major impact on the ability to maintain adequate infrastructure to
accomplish your land management activities. (2)

Discussion: While the Forest Service does recognize industry infrastructure is an important factor in project
implementation, it is beyond the scope of this analysis to consider the cumulative effect of individual project
sizes across a wide region on industry infrastructure.
Comment-128 -. The use of Stewardship or even Service Contracts may be necessary to complete the objectives
outlined for the mortality issues in/around Elk Flat. Please look closely at the economics of the entire project area
to determine if a commercial timber sale could possibly achieve your purpose & need. A Stewardship will not
generate receipts for Siskiyou County. We encourage projects that generate a positive cash flow for the Agency
when possible.(4)

Discussion: A stewardship sale is a method of achieving the ecological objectives of the project, from which
renewable forest byproducts are expected. A stewardship sale will not be the sole method used to implement
project actions, however.
Comment-129 - Please disclose and analyze the effects from the proposed activities on heritage resources. (9)

Discussion: A Cultural Resources Report (Johnson, 2015) was completed for this project. The EIS Chapter 3
summarizes the effects relative to heritage resources.
Comment-130 - Please disclose how all treatment activities would increase the potential for the spread of non-native
invasive species. (9)

Discussion: Executive Order 13112 addresses preventing the introducing invasive species, their control, and
minimizing the economic, ecological, and human health impacts of the invasive species. The required
compliance with this order is discussed in Appendix H.
Comment-131 - If whole tree yarding/top yarding is proposed make sure landings can accommodate the
merchantable and unmerchantable material. (2)

Discussion: The proposed mechanical treatment areas were reviewed for implementation viability using
existing roads, routes, corridors and landings. Landings ranging from 0.5 to 0.75 acres each would be utilized
as available or constructed if needed to facilitate transfer of forest products to haul trucks. Actual existing
landing use and new locations of landings would be approved on an individual basis based on the operator’s
requests at the time of implementation and consistency with RPMs (e.g., some existing landings in the
project’s Riparian Reserves would not be used).
Comment-132 - We strongly encourage the Forest to choose the No Action alternative. It can and should also
develop action alternatives that would actually improve late-successional habitat and decrease fire risk by taking
only the trees 10” dbh and below, and closing roads. While this may not make an economic timber sale, it isn’t
supposed to. Timber production for the sake of timber production is not permitted in LSR and CHU. (7)

Discussion: The No Action alternative is evaluated in the EIS (Chapter 3). Two alternatives are responsive to
this issue: Alternative 6-Limit Harvest to Trees Less than 10 Inches in Diameter, and Alternative 8-Limit
Harvest to Trees Less Than 20 Inches in Diameter within the Elk Flat Late-Successional Reserve. See also
Comment-68. The project does not propose timber production in LSR and CHU for the sake of timber

production. The project’s purpose and need are clearly outlined in Chapter 1 of the EIS, along with how the
project aims to meet the direction set forth under the NWFP, Forest Plan, and LSRA. The Forest expects the
network of land allocations that are withdrawn from active timber management 113 (e.g., wilderness,
administratively withdrawn areas, wild and scenic rivers, others) to provide habitat adequate to maintain
viable, well-distributed populations of federally listed or proposed and Forest Service sensitive species
(USDA-FS 1995 p. 3-27). Where active management occurs in Late-Successional Reserves and Riparian
Reserves, standards and guidelines and project design features for snags, logs, hardwoods, biodiversity, and
protection and enhancement of habitats also contribute towards this goal. The use of best available science,
recommendations form the 2011 Revised Recovery Plan for the NSO, and information from the Final Critical
Habitat Rule for the NSO regarding active management and special management considerations in the East
Cascades Critical Habitat unit (and East Cascades South subunit) will be addressed. These recommendations
and considerations will be summarized in the project’s wildlife Biological Assessment, and relevant portions
of the EIS.
Comment-133 - Please keep us on the mailing list for this project and forward the DEIS to our office immediately
upon release. We request that all specialist reports, including the FWS consultation, be posted on the Forest’s
website. (7)

Discussion: Your name is on the project mailing list. Specialist reports are often posted to the project’s
website, though those with sensitive information may not be posted, or would be posted with information
redacted in accordance with the relevant law, regulation or policy.

Appendix D-Standard Operating Procedures and Best Management
Practices
Appendix C - Standard Operating Procedures and Best
Management Practices
While not meant to be all inclusive, the following practices listed by resource are some of the most pertinent
compliance items, standard operating procedures (starting page D-1) and Best Management Practices (starting
page D-4) apply to all similar activities as those proposed in the Elk Project. Site specific Resource Protection
Measures Common to All Action Alternatives are listed in Chapter 2 (starting p. 81).

Standard Operating Procedures
The following practices are commonly implemented in similar projects to comply with Forest Plan standards
and guidelines, Forest Service Policy, Regulation or law. These practices do not represent all standard
operating or routine compliance procedures. In particular, timber harvest implemented through timber sale
contracts or stewardship contracts have standard provisions beyond those listed here to protect the
environment.

Air Quality
1. All prescribed burning will be consistent with the provisions of the Siskiyou County Air Pollution
Control District (APCD) rules and regulations through the permit process. The smoke management
plan would adhere to air quality regulations, and restrictions set forth and approved by the North
East Air Alliance. A Smoke Management Plan will be completed and submitted to the Siskiyou
County Air Pollution Control District with the project burn plan. The county would issue a burn
permit upon approval of the smoke management plan.
2. During harvest activities, dust will be abated in accordance with Road Maintenance Contract
requirements. If surface water drafting is utilized for watering roads and landings, BMPs (starting p.
D-4) will be required to maintain water quality and prevent the loss of road and landing surface
material.

Cultural Resources
3.

If new cultural resources are discovered during project activities, all work in the vicinity will cease
until the Heritage Program Manager or a delegated archaeologist examines and assesses the
resource. Appropriate measures will be undertaken to protect the new resource as activities resume.

4. If ground disturbance is proposed outside of treatment units, a management unit archaeologist will
be contacted to ensure that no historic properties will be affected.

Hydrology and Soils
5. Maintain ground cover (duff and or fine woody debris less than 3 inches) across at least 50 percent
of all activity areas to maintain soil productivity.
6. Prior to entering the harvest units with equipment, the sale administrator will verify ground
conditions are such that operations will not cause resource damage, using the current standard for
soil conditions and operability (e.g. “Wet Weather Operation” guide and “Field Guide to Soil
Moisture Conditions Relative to Operability”). The timber sale administrator will consult with the
unit soil scientist and hydrologist if there is any doubt as to whether ground conditions are
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

C-1

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

satisfactory for operation. 114 An earth scientist or hydrologist may be requested by the sale
administrator to review ground conditions prior to operations in seasonally wet areas.
7. Implement Best Management Practices (BMPs) and Forest soil quality standards for all activities.
Best Management Practices will be used to prevent or mitigate project-associated effects related to
soil erosion, compaction, and productivity and to prevent or mitigate any project-associated effects
related to water quality. The complete list of BMPs is found in a Water Quality Management for
Forest System Lands in California (USDA-FS, 2000). 115 Follow all BMPs listed (starting on page D4). These BMPs are incorporated into the project design to ensure that potential impacts to soils and
water quality would be prevented or effectively mitigated and include general and wet weather
operation schedule information.
8. Standard timber sale contract provisions for landing location would apply to all units containing
seasonally wet areas and intermittent streams.

Invasive Species 116
9. Use standard timber sale contract provisions to ensure appropriate equipment cleaning, which
addresses cleaning of ground-disturbing equipment, in the contracts to help prevent the introduction
and spread of weed species into and out of the project area. Similar requirements would apply to
Forest Service operations.
10. Prior to implementation, exclusion areas (high priority weeds 117) will be flagged with orange and
black “noxious weed” flagging and will be included on contractors' maps. Staging of equipment will
be done in weed free areas.
11. Equipment operating in areas known to be infested with noxious weeds will be washed prior to
leaving the infested area. If new occurrences of noxious weeds are identified during treatment
implementation, equipment used will be washed prior to leaving an infested area.
12. If project implementation calls for mulches, gravel, or fill, they would be certified weed free as these
products become available.
13. Forest Service personnel or contractors will report any new invasive weed populations by calling the
range department at (530) 226-2432 or the district botanist at (530) 926-9665.

Landings and Skid Trails
14. All skid trails and landings will be flagged and approved by the sale administrator in advance of
skidding operations. If it is determined that landings or skid trails need to be constructed outside of a

The extent of the wet weather and snowmelt season in Northern California can be very unpredictable, therefore a fixed
LOP for wet weather conditions will not be set for any of the proposed actions. Standard timber sale contract provisions
can be used to close down operations because of wet weather, high water, or other considerations in order to protect
resources.
115

116

Per Forest routine practice, if new populations of noxious weeds are found, treatment (will be implemented in
accordance with priorities set by the Shasta-Trinity National Forest noxious weed program. Other weed infestations will be
treated by according to District and Forest priorities.

thinning treatment unit boundary, the appropriate agency resource specialists will be consulted prior
to construction.
15. Limit no more than 15 percent of a treatment unit to non-productive purposes such as roads, skid
trails and landings (Forest Plan pp. 4.25, O-2). 118 The objective is to design a skidding pattern that
best fits the terrain and limits soil impact and pre-designated skid trails, felling to the lead and end
lining are methods that achieve the objective. Re-use previously created skid trails, yarding
corridors, temporary roads and landings to the extent feasible to avoid new ground disturbance,
minimizing soil displacement and concentrated surface flow.

Sensitive Vascular and Non-Vascular Plants 119
16. If new populations of any plant species needing special protection are discovered during project
implementation, an agency botanist will be notified to develop protection measures to maintain
population viability, such as altering or dropping proposed units from activity; modifying the
proposed activity; flagging and avoiding plant occurrences, or restricting the operating period in a
specific area. A limited operating period would depend on the species and phenology at the time of
discovery, and could last four to six months to allow for seed to set. Sensitive species are usually
protected by flagging and avoiding the plant occurrences

Silviculture and Fuels
17. All prescribed burning would follow the guidelines set forth in a prescribed burn plan developed
specifically for this project. Prescribed burning will only be initiated when relative humidity,
temperature and soil moisture conditions are optimal for meeting treatment unit fuel objectives. The
prescribed burn plan will address parameters for weather, air quality, contingency resources,
potential escapes, and personnel and public safety. See also RPMs 24 on page 85, 25 (p. 86), 27(p.
87), 28 (p. 87), 34 (p. 87), 37 (p. 88), 42 (p. 89), and 43 (p. 90).

Road Management
18. All System roads used for the project would be maintained, including installation of rolling dips
where appropriate, to provide adequate drainage and minimize runoff concentrations.
19. BMP 2.21Water Source Development, maintenance activities associated with drafting surface water
for dust abatement includes implementing water quality protection measures such as “drainage or
surfacing measures, limits on location or size, etc.”

Wildlife
20. Standard contract provisions will be included in all implementation contracts for project
implementation to extend protection to any federally threatened or endangered or sensitive wildlife
and plant species listed on the Regional Forester’s sensitive species list. Provisions will provide for
halting operations in the vicinity of newly listed or discovered individuals or populations after
completion of the biological assessment or evaluation, NEPA document or Issuance of Decision.

statements to directly or indirectly maintain or improve resource qualities or to abate or mitigate impacts
while meeting other resource goals and objectives (USDA-FS, 2000 pp. 21-22). The IDT selects BMPs
necessary to protect or improve the covered resources for specific sites and identifies the appropriate methods
and techniques for their implementation. While all or portions of individual BMPs may not specifically apply
to all or portions of the Elk Project, they would be implemented as applicable and per the project design and
resource protection measures. The following BMPs are particularly applicable to the Elk Flat LSR
Enhancement Project (USDA-FS, 2000): 120

Practice 1.4 – Use of Sale Area Map for Designating Water Quality Protection Needs
The Contract would delineate the location of protection areas and insure their recognition and proper
protection. Protection areas include, but are not limited to; stream courses, meadows, harvest unit boundaries,
available water sources, Riparian Reserves and roads where hauling is restricted.

Practice 1.10 – Tractor Skidding Design
Skid trails would be designed to fit the terrain, minimize erosion, and keep water from concentrating. The
Forest Service prior to use by the Purchaser would approve all skid trails. On-site evaluations would be
documented during implementation.

Practice 1.12 – Log Landing Location
To locate new landings or reuse old landings in such a way as to avoid watershed impacts. The Purchaser and
the Sale Administer must mutually agree upon landing locations.

Practice 1.13 – Erosion Prevention and Control Measures During Timber Sale Operations
To ensure that the purchasers’ operations will be conducted reasonably to minimize soil erosion.

Practice 1.16 – Log Landing Erosion Control
Contract specifications require the Purchaser to install erosion control measures on landings. Erosion
prevention and control measures would be designed to insure that landings have proper drainage. This may
include ditching, outsloping, water barring, and ripping.

Practice 1.17 – Erosion Control on Skid Trails
Contract specifications require the timber sale operator to install erosion control measures on skid trails.
Closure work may include mulching, outsloping, water barring, ripping, removal of berms and road barrier
construction.

Practice 1.18 – Meadow Protection during Timber Harvesting
As a minimum, meadow protection requirements specified in the Forest Plan would be implemented. The
Timber Sale Contract prohibits unauthorized operation of vehicular or skidding equipment in meadows or in
protection zones designated on the sale area map and marked on the ground.

Practice 1.20 – Erosion Control Structure Maintenance

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

During the period of the Timber Sale Contract, the Purchaser would provide maintenance of soil erosion
control structures constructed by the Purchaser until they become stabilized, but not more than one year after
their construction.

Practice 1.21 – Acceptance of Timber Sale Erosion Control Measures before Sale Closure
Onsite evaluations during operations would be monitored and documented (BMEP AE-1: Timber Sales and
Roads) and the first winter after the completion of the project (BMPEP T05-Timber Sale Administration).
Incorporation of this BMP into Timber Sale Contract Provisions is as follows: C6.6, B6.6, B6.63, B6.64,
B6.65, and B6.66.

Practice 1.25 – Modification of the Timber Sale Contract
The Timber Sale Contract can be modified or terminated if new circumstances or conditions indicate that the
timber sale would damage soil, water, or watershed values.

Practice 2.2 – Erosion Control Plan
The Timber Sale Contract requires that a general plan of operations, including planned periods and methods
of erosion control be developed by the purchaser and presented to the Forest Service. This plan would set
forth erosion control measures and discuss mitigation required by the Timber Sale Contract. Operations
cannot begin until the Forest Service has given written approval of the plan.

Practice 2.12 – Servicing and Refueling of Equipment
Purchasers are required to take all reasonable precautions to prevent pollution of air, soil, and water.
Purchaser shall furnish oil absorbing mats for use under all stationary equipment or equipment being serviced.
A Spill Prevention, Containment and Counter Measures Plan is required if the volume of oil or oil products
fuel exceeds 1,320 gallons in containers of 55 gallons or greater.

Practice 2.21 – Water Source Development Consistent with Water Quality Protection
Water source development is normally needed to supply water for road construction and maintenance, dust
control, and fire control. At no time would downstream water flow be reduced to a field that would be
detrimental to aquatic resources, fish passage, or other established uses.

Practice 2.22 – Maintenance of Roads
Roads would be maintained in a manner that provides for water quality protection by minimizing rutting,
failures, side casting, and blockage of drainage facilities. The purchaser and the Forest Service would agree to
an Annual Road Maintenance Plan that outlines responsibilities and timing of maintenance. This would be
done before the beginning of the operating season.

Practice 2.24 – Traffic Control during Wet Periods
Roads that must be used during wet periods should have a stable surface and sufficient drainage provided to
allow such use while at the same time maintaining water quality. Where wet season field operations are
planned, roads may need to be upgraded or use restricted.

Practice 2.25 – Snow Removal Controls to Avoid Resource Damage
When roads are used in the winter, snow removal would be done in a manner to protect roads and adjacent
resources. Snow berms would be removed where they result in concentration of snowmelt runoff on the road.
The Purchaser and the Forest Service would agree to measures prior to snow removal activities.

I. Introduction
The purpose of this ESA Consultation and Coordination section is to provide the reader with the
consultation background and regulatory framework for the Elk Late-Successional Reserve
Enhancement Project.
The Biological Assessment prepared for the project (BA) provides the analysis of effects that are
expected to occur from implementing the Preferred Alternative (Alternative 1). The DEIS examines the
other action alternatives. The BA was prepared in accordance with the legal requirements set forth
under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended [16 U.S.C. 1536 (c) et seq.
50CFR 402] (ESA), and its implementing regulations and follows the standards established in the
Forest Service Manual direction (FSM 2672.42; USDA-FS 1991) and the guidance provided in the
Consultation Handbook (USDI-FWS and National Marine Fisheries Service 1998). The BA is available
in the online project record.
The Shasta-Trinity National Forest (Forest) obtained a list of threatened, endangered, proposed and
candidate species for the 7.5-minute USGS quadrangles that comprise the project’s action area 121 from
the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Arcata Field Office species portal on February 10,
2015 (http://arcata.fws.gov). The Forest Service was notified about the FWS’ planned transition to
utilizing the IPaC system for obtaining official species lists in March 2015 (Fitzgerald 2015) and the
Forest Service and FWS began providing trainings for the IPaC system in June 2015 (Krueger and
Nicolaysen 2015).
Based on the revised methods for obtaining official species lists and new information regarding listed
species that may be near the Project, a subsequent list that comprises the project’s action area 122 was
obtained December 22, 2015 from the Yreka Fish and Wildlife Service field office through IPaC 123 at
https://ecos.fws.gov/ipac/gettingStarted/index. The official list, though truncated to reduce pages in this
EIS, is attached to the end of this section. The complete list, which includes a listing of the County
FWS offices in California, a list of potential migratory birds and other non-relevant information is
included in the BA.
It is important to understand that the IPaC system allows project proponents to input a proposed
project's location (including estimated or exact boundaries) or an action area so they may instantly
receive a list of FWS trust resources that may occur within the boundary identified. The list identifies
potential trust resources that may occur or that may be affected by the project and is not, and should not
be confused with, a list of species that ‘may be affected’ in terms of an ESA effect determination. An
ESA effect determination is made through site-specific analysis of a project’s activities in combination
with the particular species’ known range and habitat requirements, its biology, and the timing,
magnitude, duration and proximity of project activities. It is also important to understand that many of
121

For the northern spotted owl, the action area is based on a 1.3-mile radius of proposed activities. It is 15,960 acres; 52% on
National Forest System lands and 48% on private lands managed for timber production.

122

For the gray wolf, the action area is based on a 5-mile radius of proposed activities. It is 86,759 acres; 48% on National
Forest System lands and 52% on rural residential lands and lands managed for timber production.

123

IPaC refers to the USDI Fish and Wildlife Service’s Information for Planning and Conservation. It is a tool meant to assist
project proponents in increasing the compatibility of activities with the conservation of FWS trust resources. It is meant to
assist in implementation of all activities proposed under section 7 or 10 of the ESA.

the FWS field offices generate species lists within the IPaC system based on County-level lists; not
specific species or habitat polygons. The FWS has been further refining this information and as time,
data and field office capabilities allow, the IPaC system will move from including species that may be
within a County to using more specific species and habitat polygons (USDI-FWS 2015).
In accordance with the ESA and regulatory guidance, only those organisms and critical habitat listed on
the official species list are considered. The listed species and designated critical habitat considered in
detail in the BA (and proposed species considered in the project-level Biological Evaluation) are:
Endangered
•

Gray wolf (Canis lupus)

• Critical Habitat is not designated in California at this time (USDI-FWS 1978)
Threatened
•

Northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina)

• Critical Habitat Unit 8, Subunit 3 East Cascades South [ECS-3]
Proposed for Listing as Threatened (considered in project-level Biological Evaluation)
•

West Coast Distinct Population of fisher (Pekania pennanti)

•

Critical habitat is not proposed at this time

Species Dropped from Further Consideration
There are 16 threatened, endangered, proposed or candidate species 124 on the official species. Based on
a review of this list, it is my determination that the project will have no effect on the listed California
red-legged frog, Oregon Spotted frog, yellow-billed cuckoo (Western U.S. DPS), conservancy fairy
shrimp, vernal pool fairy shrimp, vernal pool tadpole shrimp, delta smelt or valley elderberry longhorn
beetle as there is no suitable or potential habitat within the project area, or the project area is wholly
outside the species’ known or expected range. A detailed consideration for these species is included in
the BA and they will not be further discussed in this document. The remaining six species are also
dropped from detailed consideration in this document as they are listed plants that are likely addressed
in the botanical Biological Assessment (Posey 2015), candidate species that do not require analysis
(USDI-FWS and NMFS 1998 pp. 1-5 to 1-6) or proposed listed species that are addressed in the
project’s Biological Evaluation (Jordan 2015c).

Critical Habitat
The FWS revised critical habitat for the northern spotted owl (NSO) on December 4, 2012 and the Rule
became final January 3, 2013 (USDI-FWS 2012). The action area for the NSO contains approximately
797 acres of critical habitat within Unit 8, Subunit 3 (East Cascades South [ECS-3]). There are 720
acres within the project area, wholly in the western portion of the Elk Flat Late-Successional Reserve.
Critical habitat is not designated on surrounding private lands or within the project area’s ponderosa
pine-dominated stands and meadow at Elk Flat. The remaining 77 acres are located approximately four

124

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

miles east of the project area critical habitat, along the base of Black Fox Mountain (see the EIS for a
general map of critical habitat in the project area, and the BA for the action area map).
In the Final Rule, the FWS describes that in the drier, more fire-prone regions of the owl’s range,
habitat conditions will likely be more dynamic, and active management may be required to reduce the
risk to essential physical or biological features of critical habitat from fire, insects, disease and climate
change. While the Rule recommends conserving high-quality and occupied habitat in accordance with
recommendations from the Revised Recovery Plan for the Northern Spotted Owl (USDI-FWS 2011), it
also describes that long-term recovery for the owl could benefit from forest management actions that
restore or maintain ecological processes and resilience (USDI-FWS 2012 p. 71908). The Rule’s
discussion of active management in the East Cascades Unit, and balancing short-term adverse effects
with long-term beneficial effects in dry forests, relies heavily on recommendations from the Revised
Recovery Plan. The dry forest restoration principles are highlighted as management options in the Final
Rule, and federal land managers are also encouraged to consider the range of management flexibility
contained in the NWFP (USDI-FWS 2012 pp. 71910, 71889). The FWS also supports vegetation and
fuels management within dry and mixed-dry forests where treatment goals are to conserve or restore
natural ecological processes, including fire, where they have been modified or suppressed (USDI-FWS
2012 pp. 71882).
While the Rule recommends active management, it also describes that treatment activities should be
focused on lower quality habitat with lower relative habitat sustainability and based on ecological
restoration and application of ecological forestry principles; or where ecological conditions are most
departed from the natural or desired range of variability. The Rule recommends following NWFP
guidelines and focusing on lands in or outside LSRs where uncharacteristic disturbance has occurred, or
where the landscape management goal is to restore more natural or resilient forest ecosystems; avoiding
or minimizing activities in active NSO territories (or high-quality habitat in those territories); and using
an active adaptive forest management framework to assess effects of activities on NSOs and their prey
(USDI-FWS 2012 pp. 71882-71883).
The East Cascades Critical Habitat Unit is described in the Final Rule (pp. 71930-71931). The ECS-3
subunit consists of approximately 112,179 acres of land managed by the USDA Forest Service under
the NWFP, and respective Forests that overlay the subunit (Shasta-Trinity, Klamath, Modoc National
Forests). The subunit’s function is to provide demographic support in an area of sparsely distributed,
high-quality habitat and Federal land and to provide population connectivity between subunits to the
north and south. Special management considerations in the subunit are “required to address threats to
the essential physical or biological features of critical habitat from current and past timber harvest,
losses due to wildfire and the effects on vegetation from fire exclusion, and competition with barred
owls” (USDI-FWS 2012 p. 71931). The Final Rule states that “the increase and enhancement of
northern spotted owl habitat in this subunit is especially important for providing essential connectivity
between currently occupied areas to support the successful dispersal of northern spotted owls, and may

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

also help to buffer northern spotted owls from competition with the barred owl” (USDI-FWS 2012 p.
71931). How the forest interprets the project’s treatments meeting the intent of the Final Rule, the
management considerations for ECS-3 and the recommendations in the Recovery Plan is addressed in
the Critical Habitat section of the BA.
There is no designated critical habitat for the gray wolf in California; critical habitat for the gray wolf is
only designated in Minnesota and Michigan (USDI-FWS 1978). Therefore, effects to critical habitat for
the listed gray wolf will not be discussed further in this document.
There is no proposed critical habitat for the West Coast DPS of fisher at this time. The FWS has “found
the designation of critical habitat to be ‘not determinable’ for the West Coast DPS of fisher” (USDIFWS 2014 p. 60420). Therefore, effects to critical habitat for the proposed listed fisher will not be
discussed further in this document.

II. Consistency with Resource Plans and Other Guidance
The content of the project BA complies with the legal requirements set forth under Section 7 of the ESA
[19 U. S. C. 1536 (c), 50 CFR 402] and standards established in Forest Service Manual direction (FSM
2672.42). It used the best scientific and commercial information available at the time of preparation to
determine the likely effects of the preferred alternative on federally listed species and designated critical
habitat. The Elk LSR Enhancement Project is guided by management direction found in the ShastaTrinity National Forest’s Land and Resource Management Plan, which incorporated the Northwest
Forest Plan (NWFP), as amended.

Northwest Forest Plan and Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource
Management Plan
The Forest is operating in full compliance with the Record of Decision for Amendments to Forest
Service and Bureau of Land Management Planning Documents within the Range of the Northern
Spotted Owl (NWFP ROD; USDA-FS and USDI-BLM 1994). The Regional Forester approved the
Forest’s Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) on April 28, 1995 and it became effective
June 5, 1995 (USDA-FS 1995).The Forest integrated direction from the NWFP ROD into its Forest
Plan through reproduction of its Standards and Guidelines. The NWFP standards and guidelines were
subsequently updated in 2001 (USDI-FS and USID-BLM 2001). The Forest Plan adopts the NWFP as
the Federal contribution to the recovery of the northern spotted owl and this Project has been designed
to be consistent with all applicable Forest Plan and NWFP guidance. The Forest expects the network of
land allocations that are withdrawn from active timber management 125 (e.g., wilderness,
125

Including those land allocations such as Late-Successional Reserves or Riparian Reserves that may be treated
to reduce the risk of losing habitat, to enhance habitat, and to contribute to Aquatic Conservation Strategy
objectives but that do not regularly contribute to allowable sale quantity.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

administratively withdrawn areas, wild and scenic rivers, others) to provide habitat adequate to
maintain viable, well-distributed populations of federally listed or proposed and Forest Service sensitive
species (USDA-FS 1995 p. 3-27). Where active management occurs in Late-Successional Reserves and
Riparian Reserves, standards and guidelines and project design features for snags, logs, hardwoods,
biodiversity and protection and enhancement of habitats also contribute towards this goal.
Forest-wide direction, which applies to all management areas, is described on pages 4-11 through 4-30
of the Forest Plan. Management Prescriptions are described on pages 4-33 to 4-71 and Management
Area direction is on pages 4-80 through 4-85. Project activities will occur in Late-Successional Reserve
(LSR) and matrix, including the Riparian Reserves that also overlap these allocations. Land allocations,
management areas and matrix prescriptions within the project area are displayed in Table Appendix F-1
below. Refer to Chapter 1 of the EIS for additional details regarding specific Forest Plan land
allocations and direction applicable to the project, including maps.

Late-Successional Reserve Assessment
Late-Successional Reserves or LSRs were established under the NWFP and are intended to provide oldgrowth forest habitat, provide for populations of species that are associated with late-successional
forests, and to help ensure that late-successional species diversity will be conserved. The management
objective within LSRs is to protect and enhance conditions of late-successional forest ecosystems,
which serve as habitat for late-successional and old-growth related species, including the northern
spotted owl (USDA-FS and USDI-BLM 1994; USDA-FS 1995 pp. 4-37 to 4-43; USDA-FS 1999 p. 1).
Forest Plan goals describe that the network of LSRs are designated to provide for a viable population of
northern spotted owls throughout their historic range (USDA-FS 1995 p. 3-27). Protection of LSRs
includes reducing the risk of large-scale disturbance, including stand-replacing fire, insect and disease
epidemics, and major human-caused impacts (USDA-FS 1999 p. 1). Both protection and enhancement
can include application of silviculture and other treatments designed to reduce the risk of loss and/or
accelerate development of late-successional stand characteristics (USDA-FS 1995 pp. 4-37 to 4-39;
USDA-FS 1999 pp. 174-203).
In accordance with NWFP Standards and Guidelines (C-11), the Forest prepared a Late-Successional
Reserve Assessment or LSRA (USDA-FS 1999). The purpose of the LSRA was to develop
management strategies for the LSRs, determine their sustainability, and provide information to decision
makers for managing LSRs to meet Forest Plan goals and objectives. Approximately 87 percent of the
project area is within the Elk Flat Late-Successional Reserve, designated as RC-360 in the LSRA
(USDA FS 1999 pp. 124-129). The LSRA describes four objectives that guide the development and
application of treatments in LSRs. The Elk Flat LSR is described as a priority for treatment objective II,
which is to “promote the continued development of late-successional forests/characteristics” (USDA-FS
1999 p. 178). The Project is also designed to meet the other three treatment objectives (USDA-FS 1999
p. 175):

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

E-9

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

I.

Protect existing late-successional habitat from threats (of habitat loss) that occur inside and
outside LSRs.

III.

Protect mid and early-successional vegetation from loss to large-scale disturbance events.

IV.

Promote connectivity of late-successional habitat within LSRs.

As described in the LSRA and NWFP, where levels of risk in LSRs are particularly high (East of the
Cascades and in the Oregon and California Klamath Provinces), they may require additional measures.
Consequently, management activities designed to reduce risk levels are encouraged in those LSRs even
if a portion of the activities must take place in current late-successional habitat. While risk reduction
efforts should generally be focused on young stands, activities in older stands may be appropriate if: the
proposed management activities will clearly result in greater assurance of long-term maintenance of
habitat, the activities are clearly needed to reduce risks, and the activities will not prevent the LSR from
playing an effective role in the objectives for which it was established (USDA-FS and USDI-BLM
1994; USDA-FS 1999 p. 174).

Other Forest Plan Land Allocations, Forest Plan Direction and Guidance
Approximately 445 acres of the project area are classified as matrix with a commercial wood products
emphasis along the eastern edge of the project area near and within Elk Flat meadow (units 177, 317,
318, 401 and a portion of unit 402). Per the Forest Plan, Commercial Wood Products lands are managed
to obtain an optimum timber yield of wood fiber within the context of ecosystem management.
Investments will be made in road construction, fuels management, reforestation, vegetation
management and timber stand improvement and timber stands are managed to obtain optimum growth
and yields using cultural practices (USDA-FS 1995 p. 4-67). The majority of matrix lands are
considered non-suitable, or dispersal habitat for NSO.
Riparian Reserves associated with Ash and Swamp Creeks, and their tributaries, comprise
approximately 245 acres in the project area. Ash Creek bisects the Elk Flat LSR, flowing intermittently
from late spring through early fall, depending on Water Year 126 conditions. The ephemeral channel of
Swamp Creek cuts across the eastern section of the project area within and along the Elk Flat meadow.
Riparian Reserves are managed to maintain or enhance riparian areas, wildlife and fisheries habitat, and
water quality by emphasizing streamside and wetland management and their Standards and Guidelines
supersede underlying land allocations. The riparian management prescription also emphasizes retention
and/or enhancement of old-growth vegetation, and the retention and/or enhancement of habitat for listed
and sensitive wildlife species, as these corridors provide connective habitat for migration, dispersal and
foraging for several wildlife species (USDA-FS 1995 p. 4-59). All management activities in Riparian
Reserves must also meet, or not prevent attainment of, the Aquatic Conservation Strategy Objectives
126

A Water Year is the time period of 12 months for which precipitation totals are measured between October 1 of
one year and September 30 of the following year to account for spring/summer runoff of the winter’s snowpack
(USGS).

E-10

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

(USDA-FS and USDI-BLM 1994 pp. B-9 to B-17; USDA-FS 1995 p. 4-53). The Forest Plan Standards
and Guidelines for timber management in Riparian Reserves allow for salvage and silvicultural
practices when they are needed to control catastrophic events, control stocking, reestablish and manage
stands, and/or acquire desired vegetation characteristics to attain ACS Objectives (USDA-FS 1995 p. 454). Three Watershed Analyses (WA) have been completed that include all or portions of the project
area. They are the Mount Shasta WA (USDA-FS 2012), Edson WA (USDA-FS 2011) and the McCloud
Flats Ecosystem Analysis (USDA-FS 2004). As described in the EIS and hydrology report, the
management activities proposed in Riparian Reserves are consistent with management opportunities
recommended in these Watershed Analyses.
The Project’s design also incorporates supplemental management direction from the Forest Plan for the
McCloud Flats and Mount Shasta Management Areas. This includes managing the non-timbered
portion of Elk Flat primarily for earlier seral stage vegetation (p. 4-81) and managing existing
hardwoods as a stand component to maintain or improve stand health and wildlife habitat (pp. 4-82, 486).

National Fire Plan
Under the National Fire Plan (USDA and USDI 2000) Federal agencies, working with their State,
Tribal, and local partners, must accurately assess the level of wildfire risk and types and extent of
treatments required to mitigate this risk. One approach is to conduct fuels reduction in and around the
Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) to reduce the risk of stand-replacing wildfire to people, communities
and natural resources while restoring forest ecosystems to more closely match their historical
characteristics. The National Fire Plan prioritizes fuel treatments near Communities at Risk (CAR) that

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

E-11

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

are listed in the Federal Register as urban interface communities within the vicinity of Federal lands
that are at high risk from wildfire (USDA and USDI 2001). The nearest listed CAR is the town of
McCloud. While the project area is not within the designated McCloud CAR, it is bounded on the east
and west by private lands and is approximately 1.25 miles east of the Mt. Shasta Forest subdivision.
This distance, combined with the Forest’s additional designations of WUI, results in the project area
containing 1,135 acres of Forest-designated WUI (see below).

Shasta-Trinity National Forest Fire Management Plan
The Forest is operating under the “Guidance for Implementation of Federal Wildland Fire Management
Policy” (2009), which defines WUI as “the line, area, or zone where structures and other human
development meet or intermingle with undeveloped wildland or vegetation fuels”. Generally, the
Forest-designated WUI is comprised of concentric rings around structures, or groups of structures, up to
1.5 miles. Within the project area, the 1,135 acres of Forest-designated WUI is associated with private
lands and infrastructure south of the project boundary (refer to Figure 3 in the EIS). While not
considered direction, the Forest’s April 2014 Fire Management Plan (USDA-FS 2014) outlines fuels
treatment goals for four WUI Zones. The 1,135 acres is within Zone 4-the Threat Zone (USDA-FS
2014 p. 35). This is the area beyond the ¼-mile defense zone (which surrounds structures) out to an
approximate distance of 1.5 miles. The goal within Zone 4 is to achieve an environment where crown
fires that are headed toward a community become surface fires before encountering the defense zone.
The wildfire behavior goal within Zone 4 is to develop a fuels profile that will have moderate wildfire
intensities determined by flame lengths (a measure of fire intensity) of four to eight feet or less on a
90th percentile (mid to late summer or hotter) fire weather day over most of the land base. The
mechanical thinning and fuels treatments, combined with follow-up prescribed fire, are intended to
create stand and fuel loading conditions that would allow a natural ignition to be managed for multiple
objectives. While a fire directly adjacent private property may be suppressed, a natural ignition within
the interior of the project area would be a prime candidate for managed fire, under the right conditions.

Recovery Plans
Recovery plans often identify tasks that will benefit listed species which may be carried out on or near a
project site. While listed species’ recovery plans are not considered regulatory documents (USDI-FWS
2015, 2011 pp. I-3 to I-4) and are not required to be addressed as a part of Section 7 consultation under
the ESA, the Forest Plan states that “T[hreatened] &E[ndangered] species will continue to be managed
under existing recovery goals identified in individual species recovery plans” (USDA-FS 1995 p. 3-28)
and the Standards and Guidelines require the Forest to “[M]aintain and/or enhance habitat for
TE&S[enstive] species consistent with individual species recovery plans” (USDA-FS 1995 p. 4-30).
The only recovery plan currently published and in effect for a listed species in the Action Area is the
Revised Recovery Plan for the Northern Spotted Owl (see below). In order to provide decision makers
and the FWS with relevant information, and to address general requirements listed under Section
7(a)(1) of the ESA, the Forest’s interpretation of the Project’s consistency with the Forest Plan standard
and guideline is included in Appendix C of the BA.

Revised Recovery Plan for the Northern Spotted Owl

E-12

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

In June 2011, the FWS released the Revised Recovery Plan (Recovery Plan) for the Northern Spotted
Owl (USDI-FWS 2011). It replaced the 1992 Draft Recovery Plan which had been used as a
foundation, in part, for the NWFP. The Recovery Plan is an important reference for the biology and
management of the NSO, providing the best overall guidance currently available in regards to the
survival and recovery of the subspecies. It identifies the primary range-wide threats to the NSO as
competition with barred owls; ongoing loss of spotted owl habitat as a result of timber harvest, habitat
loss or degradation from stand-replacing wildfire and other disturbances; and the loss and reduced
distribution of spotted owl habitat due to past activities (p. vii). It describes a Recovery Strategy which
includes habitat conservation and active forest management as necessary steps to address these threats,
including conserving more occupied habitat and unoccupied high-value habitat; and encouraging and
initiating active management actions that restore, enhance and promote development of high value
habitat, consistent with broader ecological restoration goals (pp. III-4 to III-5).
Specific to the dynamic, disturbance-prone, drier forests of the California Cascades physiographic
province where the project is located, the Recovery Plan recommends active management “in a way
that reconciles the overlapping goals of spotted owl conservation, responding to climate change and
restoring dry forest ecological structure, composition and processes, including wildfire and other
disturbances” (USDI-FWS 2011 pp. III-20 to III-21). The California Cascades also scores high in terms
of threats from ongoing habitat loss as a result of wildfire, and the effects of fire exclusion on
vegetation change (USDI-FWS 2011 p. I-8). Management within dry forest ecosystem is described in
the Recovery Plan, including seven principles that should be part of any dry forest restoration treatment
(USDI-FWS 2011 pp. III-20 to III-40).
It also describes that short-term impacts to provide for long-term benefits may occur, and that “land
managers should not be so conservative that, to avoid risk, they forego actions necessary to conserve
forest ecosystems necessary to the long-term conservation of the spotted owl. But they should also not
be so aggressive that they subject spotted owls and their habitat to treatments where long-term benefits
do not clearly outweigh short-term risks. Finding the appropriate balance to this dichotomy will remain
an ongoing challenge for all who are engaged in spotted owl conservation and all Federal actions will
be subject to section 7 consultation allowing for site-specific analyses of the effect on spotted owls”
(USDI-FWS 2011 pp. II-11 to II-12).
This BA fully describes the Section 7 consultation process, how recommendations for management of
dry forests were utilized to develop the silvicultural treatments, and how the project meets the dry forest
restoration principles. The specific Recovery Actions related to vegetation management on National
Forest System lands include Recovery Actions 10 and 32. In summary:
•

Recovery Action 10 states “Conserve spotted owl sites and high value spotted owl habitat to
provide additional demographic support to the spotted owl population.” The intent of RA 10 is
to protect, enhance and develop habitat in the quantity and distribution necessary to provide for
the long-term recovery of NSO. Where forest stands can be enhanced or developed through
vegetation management activities, they should generally be encouraged, particularly where
long-term goals outweigh short-term impacts. As a general rule, forest management activities
that are likely to diminish an NSO’s home range capability to support NSO occupancy, survival
and reproduction in the long-term should be discouraged. The FWS recognizes, however, that
active forest management may be necessary to maintain or improve ecological conditions. It
supports projects that intend to provide long-term benefits to forest resiliency and restore

natural forest dynamic process, notably when implemented in a landscape context with
carefully applied prescriptions that promote long-term forest health. The FWS also recognizes
these projects may have both short- or long-term effects to NSOs and suggests treatments be
designed to minimize impacts as much as possible while keeping with a project’s intent (USDIFWS p. III-46). The Recovery Plan does provide prioritization guidance for treatments in
current and historic NSO home ranges (USDI-FWS pp. III-44 to III-47), and the Forest
consulted with the FWS on more specific home range treatment prioritization for this Project.
•

Recovery Action 32 states “Because spotted owl recovery requires well distributed, older and
more structurally complex multi-layered conifer forests on Federal and non-federal lands
across its range, land managers should work with the Service…to maintain and restore such
habitat while allowing for other threats, such as fire and insects, to be addressed by restoration
management actions. These high quality spotted owl habitat stands are characterized as having
large diameter trees, high amounts of canopy cover, and decadence components such as
broken-topped live trees, mistletoe, cavities, large snags, and fallen trees.” The intent of RA 32
is to provide additional support for NSOs while reducing key threats, particularly negative
competitive interactions with barred owls that likely occur where the two species’ home ranges
overlap. Forest stands or habitat patches that meet the described conditions of RA32 are a
subset of nesting, roosting, foraging habitat and actual stand conditions will vary across the
NSOs range. The FWS recognizes these stands or patches may be relatively small (but
important in a local area), may not be easily discernable using remote sensing techniques and
likely require project-level analysis and field verification. The Project biologist completed field
reviews and identified RA32 areas and at the site-potential level, habitat that meets the intent of
RA32 is not proposed for mechanical treatment. While the greater proportion of RA32 stands
and patches are not considered “high quality” NRF habitat, they are the best of what is
available in the project area. These stands and patches either encompass entire “treatment”
units, a portion of a unit (ranging from 10 to 20 acres in size), or are incorporated into the
unthinned patches prescribed in the Forest’s LSRA (USDA-FS 1999 pp. 185, 188). Refer to
Appendix C of the BA for more detail.

The Project’s treatments and overall design were developed to protect, enhance and help ensure longterm sustainability of late-successional habitat in the Elk Flat Late-Successional Reserve, including
NSO habitat, and contribute toward meeting the goals and objectives of the Recovery Plan while also
meeting the need for action in the project area. Where applicable, treatments were specifically designed
to be consistent with the intent of Recovery Actions 10 and 32 and the dry forest restoration principles,
while following management direction from the Forest Plan, LSRA and best available science on
thinning and fuels treatments. The Project incorporates recommendations from Recovery Action 11
(monitoring) and indirectly addresses several other Actions. A detailed description of Forest Plan
consistency with Recovery Actions 10 and 32, as well as all other Recovery Actions, is included in
Appendix C of the BA.

Recovery Plans for Other Species Considered in Detail
There are no recovery plans for any other listed species considered in this document, or the proposed
listed West Coast Distinct Population of fisher, at this time.

III. Consultation to Date
The focus of the consultation for the Elk LSR Enhancement Project is the threatened northern spotted
owl (NSO) and its designated critical habitat, and the endangered gray wolf. The life history of both
species dictates the habitat characteristics and spatial scales considered in this analysis (summarized in
the Species Status section of the BA. Streamlined consultation offers action agencies like the Forest
Service an opportunity to address their conservation responsibilities under section 7(a)(1) of the ESA,
similar to the early consultation process described at 50 CFR 402.11. Region 5 of the Forest Service has
a Memorandum of Understanding with the Pacific Southwest Region of the FWS (USDA-FS and
USDI-FWS 2013) that outlines procedures for streamlining consultation. This includes early
involvement by FWS biologists on FS Interdisciplinary Teams (IDTs), FWS participation in FS IDT
meetings and field reviews, FWS providing feedback to the FS on prescriptions and minimization
measures that reduce or avoid adverse effects to species and their habitat, and discussions about
preliminary effect determinations.
The Forest, through a TEAMS enterprise unit 127 initiated consultation for the Project on August 25,
2009 with the Red Bluff FWS field office. In October 2011, the responsibility for Section 7 consultation
on the Forest transitioned from Red Bluff to the Yreka FWS field office. What follows is a summary of
the consultation process between TEAMS and the Red Bluff office, and the detailed streamlined
consultation process between the Forest and the Yreka office. Throughout the planning process,
potential treatment units or areas have been added or numbering changed. The units listed here
correspond to the current Preferred Alternative however. This information is based on IDT meeting
notes and field reviews, email correspondence, phone conversations, Level 1 meetings, and FS-FWS
consulting biologist discussions:
August 25, 2009: Initial IDT meeting with TEAMS wildlife biologist Rick Baxter and fuels specialist
David Riegle and other TEAMS specialists; silviculturist Lauren Payne from Vegetation Management
Solutions enterprise unit (VMS); SMMU counterparts, resource specialists, and applicable staff; and
FWS biologists Keith Paul and Michelle Havens from the Red Bluff FWS field office. Discussions
relevant to NSO center on the: past, ongoing and future surveys; 2000 NSO Baseline habitat map
(USDA-FS 2000) that requires field verification and updating; 2008 critical habitat rule [vacated];
importance of retaining vertical structure and tree height diversity at 10 and 15 feet for NSO
127

Enterprise Units are Forest Service resources that offer an internal choice for the accomplishment of the
agency’s work. The teams operate as independent, financially self-sustaining units funded by Forest Service
clients. See http://www.fs.fed.us/enterprise/ for more information.

roosting/thermoregulation sites; and retaining understory (brush, small trees), the majority of large
snags and logs, and 0.25-0.5 acre mortality patches for prey base. FWS made a recommendation for notreatment patches every 3-5 acres. The Team discussed balancing the short and long term impacts for
both the short and long term needs to provide (maintain) and develop habitat for NSO use. Existing
stand conditions, Common Stand Exam results (USDA-FS 2007), preliminary growth modeling by the
Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS), and cumulative effects from private and Forest Service projects
were also discussed.
August 26, 2009: Field review in portions of project area by Baxter, Riegle, Payne, other IDT
members, and Paul and Havens. Field discussions relevant to NSO focused on mortality in the pine
component and ongoing loss of foraging habitat (unit 162); and the high stand density and habitat value
in nesting/roosting habitat (unit 150 in ST-215 core). The group discussed the potential to thin this area,
now since it was not being used by NSO, or to leave the stand to grow/stagnate while treating all around
it. The potential to underburn only with some hand thinning pre-burning, or creating fuelbreaks along
the roads surrounding unit 150 was also discussed. Group reviewed a mixed conifer stand with some
legacy pine and cedar and dense understory of white fir, determining thinning would be beneficial in
order to develop better quality foraging and nesting/roosting habitat for the future (unit 161 in ST-215
core).
September 2009: Baxter and Paul visit 22 stands to verify and update the 2000 NSO Baseline habitat
map (Baxter and Paul 2009). They review initial thinning prescriptions from Payne and Paul provides
feedback on what treatments would be beneficial for NSO habitat, and the integrity and progression of
the LSR (Baxter and Paul 2009a). These ideas are presented to Payne and Riegle at the October 20,
2009 IDT meeting to adjust certain thinning and fuels prescriptions.
October 2009: IDT conference call. Discussions include the preliminary Arc-based fuels modeling for
no action where 90th percentile weather condition runs show a fair amount of the project area in passive
crown fire (see Map 6 data in the BA). Baxter discusses the September 2009 field work and describes
the updated proposed treatments and NSO habitat map to the IDT. He shares Paul’s recommendations
that non-NSO habitat should be treated aggressively, low-quality foraging habitat should be treated
somewhat less aggressively, and nesting/roosting habitat has little or no mechanical treatment. The IDT
discusses potential for prescribed burning, including opposing objectives in the project area where
ladder fuels and down woody material are desirable for NSO habitat and the need to find an appropriate
compromise to reduce the risk of loss while maintaining and enhancing habitat function. Baxter
describes Paul’s support for prescribed burning in some areas to reduce fine fuel accumulations, but is
not generally supportive of burning in high-quality habitat. The need for new temporary roads is also
discussed and protection measures to reduce these in high quality habitat.
June 2010: Payne, Greg Casselberry (IDT lead), Riegle and Debbie Derby (SMMU wildlife biologist
counterpart) meet to discuss the modified thinning prescriptions provided by Baxter and Paul.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

October 2011: Section 7 ESA consultation responsibility for the Forest is transferred to the Yreka FWS
field office. All prior consultation records for the Project were transferred to the Yreka field office.
November 2011: Project is assigned to a SMMU IDT, with continued support from VMS silviculturist
Payne, and TEAMS fuels specialist Riegle and biologist Baxter who continued consultation with FWS.
December 1, 2011: Christine Jordan presents the Draft Project Initiation Form (PIF) at the December
Level 1 meeting on behalf of Baxter (general discussion of project planning since August 2009,
estimated acreage of suitable, dispersal and non-habitat for NSO in project area per 2000 Baseline and
September 2009 field verification by Baxter and Paul). The NSO survey history, existing stand
conditions and increasing mortality in the southeast and eastern portions of project area’s pinedominated stands, and the planned December 6, 2011 field review, are discussed. Jordan described that
habitat typing in the action areas (including private lands) needs refinement and will be completed in
2012, along with continued left side planning by the IDT. This meeting starts the streamlined
consultation process between the Forest and the Yreka FWS field office, as described in the
Streamlining MOU (USDA-FS and USDI-FWS 2013).
December 6, 2011: Brief field review of project area by Jordan, Forest Biologist Kelly Wolcott, SMMU
staff (District Ranger Carolyn Napper, Planning Officer Emelia Barnum, Timber Management Officer
Ed Domanski) and FWS biologists Brian Woodbridge, Karen West, Dave Topolewski and Michelle
Havens. Reviewed the extensive mortality area in units 158, 204, 206 to demonstrate ongoing and past
mortality in ponderosa pine-dominated stands. Reviewed along Ash Creek near the NR habitat block
(unit 150) to review mortality and fading condition of pine component in a mixed conifer stand. At unit
206, the group discussed NSO habitat use and the value of this area as prey base, but not as suitable
NRF due to species composition, nor as functional dispersal due to the lack of overstory canopy cover.
At the Ash Creek area, the group discussed the potential for salvage (as safely feasible) or machine
piling and burning some of the dead trees, combined with follow-up prescribed fire in the NR habitat of
unit 150.
January 12, 2012: Jordan and Derby coordinated with the FWS on SMMU’s annual NSO surveys, per
recommendations in the survey protocol (USDI-FWS 2012a pp. 4-6). For this Project, the 2012 survey
year is the start of implementing the revised survey protocol. We discussed that the last documented
NSO nesting attempt in 1990 failed, and that recent logging had occurred on private lands in the ST-215
home range. We discussed NSO survey history, that the last verified aural and visual detection of NSO
in ST-215 was in 2003 (single female), and the adult barred owl detection in 2004. We mutually agreed
to a 6-visit survey protocol in 2012 and 2013, and to revisit the survey plan in year three, depending on
results. Adjacent landowners had not granted survey access to date, and Derby contacted Sierra Pacific
Industries/Hancock to discuss data sharing and coordination.
December 7, 2011-June 8, 2012: Various IDT meetings, but no fieldwork with FWS. Both agencies
identify/discuss information gaps and other NSO issues (Revised Recovery Plan, habitat typing, stand

data) and discuss the proposed fall 2009 treatments. In May 2012, the SMMU biologist role transitioned
to Jordan, who continued consultation with FWS biologist Topolewski. Jordan transmitted the draft
proposed treatment unit and ST-215 activity center maps with 2012 NAIP to Topolewski on June 8,
2012.
June 12, 2012: IDT meeting and field visit to discuss proposed prescriptions, habitat and refinements:
Reviewed units 150, 152, 153, 155, 160, 161 and 166 (Payne, Craig Sewell-SMMU silviculturist,
Jordan, Topolewski, Steve Clark-SMMU fuels specialist and Domanksi). Given unit 160’s location
outside the home range (near Elk Flat meadow), lower quality foraging habitat, Heterobasidion root
disease in white fir and dying ponderosa pine, group decided to change the proposed thinning treatment
of 150 sqft/ac of basal area to 125-150, but to not thin biomass and retain it as feasible. The original
prescription also included ≤2-acre group selections to reduce root disease and promote age class and
species diversity, and this element was retained. Discussed that within groups, foraging and dispersal
elements (primarily dying trees and stagnant conditions) would be removed, but the overall stand would
continue to function as foraging habitat (degrade). In unit 161 (in ST-215 core, foraging and critical
habitat with pockets of dense white fir and roosting sites) the group decided to implement the proposed
thinning treatment of 150 sqft/ac of basal area, retain biomass, not machine pile/burn and drop the
proposed radial thinning, which could remove roosting elements. Discussed incorporating roost site
element retention in marking guides and that the overall treatment, followed by prescribed fire, would
degrade foraging habitat function. In unit 153 (part in ST-215 core/home range), discussed the foraging
habitat quality (moderate to low), black oak, and pine mortality where it was occurring. The proposed
treatment of thinning to 150 sqft/ac basal area was modified to a more variable prescription of 125-175
sqft/ac, species dependent. The need for and benefits of black oak release were discussed, but not in
detail for treatment design or protection measures. Within the stand portions that have a legacy pine
component, and ~12-18” dbh dense white fir, radial thinning and the potential for small (<0.25-acre)
gap creation was discussed, given that small gaps could increase diversity and heterogeneity over time
(no replanting of gaps). The variable thinning and gap creation would degrade foraging habitat function.
Topolewski and Jordan noted that more specific measures for radial thinning around pine and oaks need
to be developed (e.g., limit the trees per acre or TPA, add protection measures to retain certain
species/size classes) and that these treatments could likely downgrade habitat, depending on specifics.
The group discussed prescribed fire use in unit 150 and a portion of unit 152 (NR habitat in ST-215
core) and the benefits. In unit 152, discussed radial thinning around legacy pine, large tree and biomass
retention, group selection in dense white fir, and modified the 150 sqft/ac basal area to a variable
density of 125-175. Group noted that complex marking guides are needed here (and elsewhere) to
assure habitat function is maintained. In units 155 and 166, discussed the dense understory and
overstory stand conditions and using variable density thinning here and similar stands. In general, the
group discussed trade-offs of thinning or retaining dense biomass (fire effects); the need to develop
some measures for mortality during prescribed fire and retaining understory and CWD for prey base;
the location of and impacts to then-designated critical habitat (2008); the potential for dbh limits; and

developing oak/ and pine radial thinning measures. Decision point that Jordan would continue
reviewing each natural stand to prioritize where treatments were needed and determine if biomass
retention, radial thinning pine, prescribed fire, or machine piling would contribute to or hinder habitat
function.
June 26, 2012: Jordan transmitted Payne’s initial draft prescriptions to Topolewski, noting the June 12
modifications had not been incorporated. Jordan also conducted field reviews for habitat typing and
treatment effects in units 151, 154, 156, 165, 168, 173, 182, and a separate portion of 155. Some units
should be excluded from mechanical treatment either by deferring entirely (156, 173, 182) or including
portions in unthinned patches (per the LSRA) or using marking guides to direct ‘skipping’ treatment in
a stand given existing large or small trees, decadence and vertical/horizontal structure and heterogeneity
(151, 154, 165, 168). Also reviewed areas of private land in home range to update the NSO habitat map.
July 2 and 9, 2012: IDT meetings and field reviews with FWS participation, primarily to discuss
Riparian Reserve conditions, potential mechanical thinning and prescribed fire, and consistency with
the Aquatic Conservation Strategy objectives in Reserves (George-hydrologist, Snyder-Forest
entomologist, Jordan, Topolewski and other IDT specialists). Reviewed units 152 and 157 along Ash
Creek and discussed Heterobasidion root disease impacts, no treatment and treatment areas to maintain
cool-air refugia along the creek, the existing large down wood that benefits fisher, and the likely effects
of prescribed fire without pre-treatment of machine piling/burning. Decision point to likely develop a
linear area along the creek where no mechanical treatments would occur, and measures for prescribed
fire and CWD retention. Within rest of unit, thinning to 125-175 sqft/ac basal area, maintaining biomass
and radial thinning a limited number of legacy pines would degrade foraging habitat function. Group
also reviewed units 162 and 176 to discuss Heterobasidion and blackstain root disease in these
ponderosa pine-dominated stands, NSO habitat (non-habitat with pockets of potential dispersal at that
time) and snag retention feasibility. The treatment of thinning to 80-140 sqft/ac basal area (what could
be thinned at time of implementation), interplanting and retaining snag pockets in the interior away
from roads was also discussed. Snyder reiterated that where blackstain vascular wilt occurs, opening the
pine stand to direct sunlight can warm and dry the soil and greatly reduce progression of the disease
within residual trees.
July 26, 2012: Stewardship Collaboration Field Trip 1 of 2: The Shasta Valley Resource Conservation
District, several local participants, Project IDT, SMMU staff members and Topolewski reviewed five
locations in the project area to discuss existing conditions and potential treatment options. The second
field trip occurred August 9, 2012 but FWS did not attend. The feedback from the FWS (and other
participants) that was not already being considered was integrated into the Project’s design.
July 27 and 31, 2012: Jordan and Topolewski emailed regarding his comments from the July 26th field
trip on designing the project to treat 30% or less of the foraging habitat designated as critical habitat.

E-19

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

This discussion clarified that the recommendation was for “mechanical treatments that would notably
degrade or downgrade/remove [foraging] habitat quality”.
August-November 2012: Jordan continued habitat typing and stand identification for Recovery Action
32, biomass and treatment assessments, and several field reviews with various IDT members.
August 27-31, 2012: Jordan transmitted to Topolewski the September 2009 NSO habitat map and
spreadsheet from Baxter and Paul regarding treatments in NSO habitat; Jordan’s updated NSO habitat
notes for key areas in the core (150, 151, 153, 161, 168) and home range (155, 165, 169, 173) and
updated habitat map (to date); and the 2007 Common Stand Exam summary, data and inventory maps.
September 6-7, 2012: Jordan conducted additional habitat typing on private lands in the ST-215 core
and home range, and a field visit with FWS and FS biologists Derby and Susan Thomas to treatment
and no –treatment areas in the core and home range (units 14, 151, 153, 165, 168, 173, 178). The group
reviewed the updated NSO habitat map (to date) and discussed capable, dispersal, and non-habitat and
treatments, suitable habitat treatment prioritization, RA10 prioritization guidance from the Yreka FWS
for home ranges (see Appendix C of the BA), and variable density thinning approaches. Topolewski and
Jordan also discussed separating habitat typing by Roosting and Nesting/Roosting, given the variability
of this habitat type within portions of the project area. It was mutually decided that because potential
roosting habitat was dispersed throughout potential treatment areas that were: 1) either not functioning
as quality foraging (i.e., habitat elements are present, but stands are too dense for owls to fly through),
or 2) were in an area of more dispersal or capable habitat, that a project design feature that retains roost
site habitat components would be a better approach. Jordan and Topolewski also mutually agreed that
habitat typing for the Project would consist of Nesting/Roosting, High Quality Foraging, Foraging,
Dispersal, Capable and Non-Habitat due to the variability and proposed treatments in older plantations
that are ‘capable’ of becoming dispersal or suitable foraging. Topolewski agreed with the proposal to
not treat units 156, 173, 182, portions of 151, 165 and 168 (based on Jordan’s field work on June 26,
2012) and to move forward with the previously-discussed thinning, small gap creation and groups in
natural stands and the ‘capable’ habitat in older plantations (14, 16, 18, 6, etc.).
September 19 and 29, 2012: Jordan received a PDF file of an NSO habitat map and GIS shapefiles
from Jim Wolter of Hancock Forest Management (adjacent private lands owner) and Stu Farber,
consulting biologist for Hancock Forest Management for the ST-215 core and home range. This
map/data was shared with Topolewski and utilized by Jordan, in combination with field reviews for
habitat characterization of private lands in the NSO action area. During the field reviews, and GIS work
by Jordan for the final NSO habitat map, it was noted that on private lands, some typing differed in their
core and home range. They primarily had low quality foraging for what is mostly dispersal habitat, and
several polygons that are barren (based on 2009 and 2012 NAIP) were typed as foraging, potential due
to their proximity of foraging. For the most part, where they had designated non-habitat and foraging
habitat in the home range on private lands matched with the FS typing that was done.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

October 2012: Jordan, Topolewski and other FWS biologists (Fitzgerald, Hellekson), Payne, Sewell
and Clark re-reviewed NSO habitat in units 165 and 168 to provide the new FWS staff familiarity with
the Project and habitat conditions. We discussed that portions of these units would be deferred, as they
are considered high quality foraging trending toward NR of cedar, fir, and pine, ~10+ TPA >26” dbh,
abundant large down wood and snags, tree size differentiation, understory perching structure, and small
openings of bush chinquapin, manzanita and whitethorn. These areas would not be mechanically
thinned, but would be underburned. Reviewed unit 154 to discuss variable stand conditions (mixed
conifer with dying pine), dense incense cedar biomass in portions of the stand, large tree retention, notreatment areas, and radial thinning. Decision made that radial thinning would not be used (similar
rationale for unit 161 as the majority of roost habitat could be removed with this treatment). Group
discussed that thinning to 125-175 sqft/ac basal area and thinning biomass would degrade foraging
habitat. Biomass thinning was not excluded, given the dense conditions of small <4-4-9” understory
cedar and fir in 70% of the unit. Other portions of this unit are going to be excluded from mechanical
treatment due to NR characteristics, higher quality foraging and fisher habitat near Ash Creek.
Reviewed the extensive mortality areas in units 158, 159, 204 and 206 to discuss habitat (non/some
dispersal of ponderosa pine with prey base due to abundant down wood and natural regeneration), snag
retention as feasible, radial thinning around predominant legacy pine, and thinning to 80-140 sqft/ac
basal area where it could be safely done during implementation. The group also discussed oak release
treatments and how release distances would be larger on southern aspects, that predominant trees would
not be cut and how diameter limits would be used in critical habitat. October 12, 2012, Topolewski
transmitted the Northwest Forest Plan NSO relative habitat suitability map (completed by Raymond
Davis) to Jordan for a comparison.
December 4, 2012: Revised Final Rule for NSO Critical Habitat was published in the Federal Register,
resulting in 720 acres of critical habitat in the northwestern and western portions of the project area.
February 26, 2013: Jordan meets with FWS staff and adjacent private landowners to discuss annual
survey coordination on the SMMU. 2013 is the second year of 6V surveys for the Project, and private
landowners and the FS will continue data sharing and coordinating stand searches for ST-215.
March 21, 2013: Jordan presented the Final PIF at the March 2013 Level 1 meeting with a broad-scale
project area habitat map, an estimated project timeline and details from the February 2013 proposed
action and scoping document. Jordan provided the meeting participants with stand photos and maps and
discussed the proposed variable density thinning, biomass retention, gap creation, and the process for
prioritizing treatments under RA10 and RA32. General protection measures for LOPs, snag and CWD
retention, and roost/rest site retention were described. At this time, specifics on machine piling and
burning had not been worked out by the IDT, nor had some of the finer-scale protection measures.
Discussed the field work and treatment modifications in 2012 by the IDT and FWS; the coarse levels of
habitat in the project area, core and home range based on revised habitat typing; the preliminary effects
determinations made in the field with FWS and the IDT; and the preliminary effects within the ST-215

core, home range and critical habitat. Discussed that the current unoccupied status, 32% plantation
stands on NFS lands in the core and 15% in the home range and ability to affect change in the ST-215
core and home range in less than 30 years with treatment make this a prime candidate for treatment
prioritization under RA10. Noted concerns included the large proportion of the home range in private
lands (~60%), the logical shift of home range use to be within more of the LSR should NSOs re-occupy
the activity center, and the timing and cumulative effects of proposed treatments (i.e., thinning,
followed by potential piling and burning in some areas, followed by prescribed fire entries). Concerns
were noted by Jordan regarding the wide range of habitat variability in stands (169, 235) and the effects
of proposed treatments to foraging and dispersal. Both FS and FWS personnel contributed input (e.g.,
suggested a finer scale GIS representation of NSO habitat, additional reviews to discuss treatment
concerns, and finalizing areas that would be subject to machine piling and burning). There was
sufficient data available for the FS to present a draft determination that the Project was not likely to
adversely affect the NSO (based on occupancy) and that it would have an adverse effect on designated
critical habitat (primarily PCE3).
March 26, 2013: Second public meeting for Project scoping (Robert Carey of the Yreka FWS office
attended as FWS could not attend the initial public meeting on March 5, 2013). No comments were
provided at or after this meeting by the FWS regarding the scoping document/proposed action.
May 9, 2013: Jordan receives ST-215 stand search information from Stu Farber that dates back to June
16, 2011. It includes information about a probable NSO feather found in the core area (unit 150) that
same day (Farber 2013). This information is transmitted to Topolewski on May 10, 2013.
November 2013: FWS Level 1 consulting biologist role transitioned to Katherine Fitzgerald. Jordan
provided a list of draft project design features that were developed and discussed with Topolewski.
These include LOP dates and survey/spot check plans, unthinned patch design, RA32 stands/elements,
roost/rest habitat retention, diameter limits in oak release areas and NSO critical habitat and damage
minimization measures for oak, limits on annual prescribed fire within a home range and general tree
mortality levels during underburning (~10%), snag and down wood retention and CWD piling measures
and monitoring. These measures were discussed, revised as needed (e.g., the FS desired specifics for
underburning-see below) and fully incorporated into the Project’s design features and resource
protection measures. All measures are included in Chapter 2 of the EIS, and those specific to NSO are
in Table 6 of the BA.
November 12, 25 and 26, 2013: Field reviews with Fitzgerald, Sewell and IDT leader Cindy Diaz; and
Clark, Sewell and Heather McRae (project fuels specialist). Re-briefed Fitzgerald on purpose and need
and natural stand/plantation thinning prescriptions and discussed habitat types and prior agreements on
effects determinations in suitable and critical habitat (degrade for majority, downgrade in oak release
areas, short-term adverse effects in critical habitat PCE3-similar to the March 2013 PIF presentation).
Discussed variable density thinning, group selection, radial thinning and underburning-only in detail;

established a realistic percentage of acceptable mortality for the <4-10, 10-15, 16-20 and >20-inch dbh
tree size classes during prescribed fire and how this would maintain/benefit habitat function; discussed
existing project design features and RA10/RA32 and how the Forest perceives meeting
recommendations; and discussed the NSO survey plan. In addition to re-verifying habitat conditions in
units 150, 151, 152, 153, 161, 168-2 and 178 with Fitzgerald, and discussing preliminary
determinations for effects in nesting/roosting (maintain/benefit), foraging (degrade or downgrade,
treatment dependent), and dispersal habitat (improve/modify), the group also reviewed units 169 and
235. These areas are in critical habitat and the southwestern portion of the home range, and consist of a
mix of dispersal and foraging habitat with a dying pine component. Review was needed to clarify
concern over treatment effects raised during the March 2013 PIF presentation and the strong variation
in these units of mixed conifer, pine pockets, dying pine and legacy trees. It was determined that within
dispersal and foraging habitat, the treatments of thinning to 125-175 sqft/ac basal area would degrade
foraging, and maintain/improve dispersal. Marking began in the plantations and continued through early
winter 2015. While thinning, groups and radial thinning are planned in these non-suitable or capable
NSO habitat areas, the measures developed for the natural stands to retain unthinned patches and
roost/rest sites as they occur carried over to the plantations. Jordan, Sewell and the TEAMS marking
crew met in unit 6 to discuss the thinning prescription, roost/rest clumps, and retention of larger
decadent trees in plantations that contribute to late-successional habitat objectives for the Project. A
sample mark was completed and reviewed, with few adjustments needed.
February 19, 2014: Field review with Fitzgerald, Sewell and Domanski to discuss treatment
modifications and Jordan’s concern regarding prescribed fire in RA32 stands. Reviewed units 161, 165
and 167 (all within core/home range) for this purpose. Also discussed unthinned patch designation and
mapping, which includes RA32 stands and elements. In unit 165, discussed the potential for an oak
release-only treatment and prescribed fire, and consistency with RA32 when using prescribed fire.
Decision made to thin portions of this stand in lower quality foraging (~10-18” dense white fir along the
edges and oak release) and retain, unthinned, the central higher quality foraging habitat of 26-30”+ dbh
trees of mixed species, abundant down wood, large snags and shrub openings. Reaffirmed with
Fitzgerald that prescribed fire, depending on timing and ignition patterns, is a beneficial treatment. Rereviewed unit 161 and Sewell’s inquiry to utilize radial thinning. As discussed by Jordan, Topolewski
and others on June 12, 2012, unit 161 is in the core and critical habitat and radial thinning would
significantly remove roost site elements (contributor to PCE2). The stand has numerous roost/rest
microsites and radial thinning around the trees that comprise those sites would effectively remove them.
Radial thinning will not be included as a prescription element in unit 161. Where white fir is dense in
unit 161, the proposed thinning would improve foraging function, and in remaining portions, degrade it.
Reviewed unit 167 to discuss prescribed fire and downed wood conditions (~28 tons/acre of jackstrawed 10-20” diameter, 20’ long white fir, pine and cedar in this 5-acre unit). Decision made that as
long as underburning occurs within the parameters developed November 25, 2013, that foraging habitat

function would be maintained. Fitzgerald and Jordan also discussed survey history and the (still)
unknown location(s) of the barred owls.
March 20, 2014: Jordan, FWS and private landowners participated in the annual survey coordination
for the SMMU. Fitzgerald and Jordan mutually decided that due to barred owl presence (detections in
last two seasons) that a third year of 6V surveys is appropriate. Jordan coordinated survey plans with
private landowners and both parties will continue sharing data and coordinating ST-215 stand searches.
July 30, 2014: Marking started in natural stands and Jordan invited FWS. Jordan, Payne, Sewell and the
TEAMS marking crew met in unit 161 to discuss variable density thinning prescriptions and its
application, roost/rest clump identification within natural stands as compared to plantations, the ST-215
core and home range area, critical habitat and to discuss overall late-successional habitat objectives for
the Project. A sample mark is completed and reviewed, with few adjustments needed. Jordan also talked
with the crew about oak release treatments in units 153 and 178 and diameter limits in critical habitat.
August 26, 2014: Jordan completed a post-marking field review of unit 153 (foraging habitat with oak
release element in critical habitat) with Fitzgerald and FWS biologist John Morris, the project botanists
(Rhonda Posey and Brenna Montagne), Sewell and Domanski. This review was to identify if there were
additional leave trees for wildlife use in the mixed conifer/oak stand area within critical habitat. The
group discussed trade-offs and benefits to oaks, prey base, critical habitat function, NSO and fisher and
agreed on the overall effect determination that foraging habitat would be downgraded to dispersal
habitat where oak is released. Additional leave trees and cut trees were identified by the group,
including oaks/clumps of oaks. The group (minus Posey and Montagne) continued to another portion of
unit 153 to review the marking for small (~0.20-acre) gaps in white fir, and overall variable density
thinning from 125-175 sqft/ac basal area. Here, the determination was also re-affirmed that thinning
would degrade foraging habitat function. While the small gaps would remove habitat elements (12-18”
dbh white fir trees with short limbs and infection), the gaps do not downgrade the habitat function for
the stand. One gap location was adjusted to be more centrally located in stagnant white fir, similar to the
other gaps. The group also reviewed the initial marking in units 154 and 161. It was re-agreed that
based on the mark in unit 161, foraging habitat function would be degraded post-thinning and
underburning. For this stand, and stands similar to unit 153 that have similar conditions and variable
density thinning treatments, the same determination of ‘degrading’ foraging habitat was agreed to. In
portions of unit 154, the mark did not match the prescription that was developed in October 2012 and
the group discussed these concerns. The stand was reviewed and areas were mapped that should have
been left untreated. In other portions of unit 154, the mark met the prescription of variable density
thinning to 125-175 sqft/ac basal area (combined with roost/rest habitat clumps, unthinned patches and
biomass that will leave some areas at >200 sqft/acre post-thinning). It was re-agreed that these
treatments would degrade foraging habitat function.

September 23, 2014: Additional leave tree marking was completed by Jordan, Sewell and the SMMU
timber preparation shop in the previously-reviewed portions of unit 154.
November 10, 2014: Jordan is notified by Robert Feamster of Sierra Pacific Industries that the barred
owls that were detected in the project area (and on private lands) during 6V surveys the past three
seasons were removed. This information was discussed with the FWS at the November 20, 2014 Level
1 meeting.
March 3, 2015: Jordan met with FWS to discuss annual survey coordination for the SMMU (private
landowners were contacted later). Jordan and Jan Johnson (FWS wildlife biologist) agreed that due to
the barred owl removal in fall 2014, and the barred owl detections over the last three years of 6V
surveys, that Project-level surveys for 2015 could consist of three “modified” spot check visits (USDIFWS 2012a pp. 17-18). This consisted of three visits in and within a 0.25 mile of suitable habitat in the
project area. Jordan coordinated survey plans and the stand searches for ST-215 with private
landowners, who continued to survey portions of the action area due to planned and ongoing THPs.
March 31, 2015: Jordan met with Fitzgerald, Carey and Laura Finley (FWS wildlife biologist) to
discuss the proposed fisher 128 analysis area and home range estimates based on previously collected
home range data in similar habitat types. Since there are no telemetry studies in this part of the fisher’s
range to base an average female home range size upon, the group agreed to use a habitat-based
approach. The analysis would include: 1) the local population area on the SMMU; 2) an analysis area
encompassing the entire project area. Then to the north, up to 6,500-foot elevation range, and to the
west, east and south, delineating the extent there is likely reproductive habitat based on stand
conditions, age class, species composition and cover. This approach would be biologically meaningful
for this species, and is an estimated 10,100-acre analysis area which is likely adequate to support
approximately three female home ranges. The “fine-scale” analysis would consist of the treatment unit,
stand and resting/denning structure.
April-August 2015: Additional unit and marking reviews were completed by Jordan to verify that the
prescription and habitat objectives were being met with the mark. Jordan emailed Fitzgerald on July 9,
2015, summarizing the season’s surveys, field review of the current marking and plans for adjustments,
the IDT’s progress and treatment changes for machine piling/burning acre estimates, reforestation plans
and methods, road action modifications and protection lines/methods during prescribed fire.
August 20, 2015: Forest Ecosystem Staff Officer, Kathy Roche, participated in a telephone
conversation with Klamath National Forest staff, Klamath Falls Oregon FWS staff, and Yreka FWS
Supervisor Erin Williams regarding the new information on the Shasta Pack. They discussed that only a
few staff members and biologists from CDFW have the exact location information for the cameras that
128

photographed the Shasta Pack, and that CDFW is not sharing specific location information at this time.
No information was provided to FWS by CDFW on a den site, only a rendezvous site (photographs
from August 9, 2015; CDFW 2015). They discussed typical den site timing restrictions as April 1-June
30, and that none of the animals are collared, so day-to-day information is lacking. They also discussed
that while there is no conclusive genetic information to date; Shasta Pack individuals are not considered
part of an experimental population. Draft conservation measures for range allotment permits were also
discussed.
August 27, 2015: Jordan, Emelia Barnum (SMMU Natural Resource Planning Officer) and Roche
participated in a telephone conversation with Williams and Nadine Kanim (Yreka FWS fish and
wildlife biologist) to discuss a separate project and its ongoing treatments. Jordan inquired if FWS
could share information on the Shasta Pack’s general location, or an estimated distance to known
activity areas, from the separate project. Williams shared that CDFW staff had requested the locations
of the remote cameras and Pack not be shared at this time, but did state that if the FS provided an action
area map, FWS could likely share an approximate distance range from the action area to the Pack’s
potential use area(s) and detection area(s). The group also discussed accepted distances and time
periods for den site LOPs.
October 7 and 13-14, 2015: Additional leave tree and cut tree marking completed by Jordan and the
SMMU timber preparation shop in units 151, 152-1, 153, 154, 163, 166 and 169 to meet the project’s
purpose and need and design features in critical habitat, overall LSR objectives, and to assure that the
NSO foraging habitat/fisher habitat treatment objectives would be met. No other units in NSO or fisher
habitat required marking modifications. Additional leave trees in unit 402 that contribute to LSR
function (though outside suitable/dispersal NSO habitat) need to be marked for retention prior to
implementation.
November 30, 2015: Per the August 27, 2015 telephone conversation, Jordan emailed Kanim and
Morris the Project’s NSO survey map and proposed gray wolf action area map, requesting if an
estimated distance to CDFW’s detection areas could be provided, and if the CDFW had provided any
new releasable information to the FWS.
December 1 and 2, 2015: Kanim emailed Jordan, describing the distance from the detection area to the
project area and the action area, based on the detection area maps provided by CDFW (Kanim 2015).
Kanim also noted the wide error bars included on the CDFW detection area maps. Kanim also noted
that CDFW had not provided any additional information to the FWS.

Appendix GAppendix F-Past, Present and Reasonably
Foreseeable Management Activities
Appendix F-Past, Present and Reasonably Foreseeable
Management Activities
This appendix describes the overall approach to the Elk project cumulative effects analysis and
summarizes a list of potentially relevant ongoing and reasonably foreseeable futures actions.
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future management activities were considered for this project,
in order to assess accumulated impacts. According to the Council on Environmental Quality NEPA
regulations, a “cumulative impact” is the impact on the environment which results from the incremental
impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions
regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such actions (40 CFR 1508.7).
Spatial and temporal boundaries are the two critical elements to consider when deciding which actions
to include in a cumulative effects analysis. Spatial and temporal boundaries set the limits for selecting
those actions that are most likely to contribute to a cumulative effect. The effects of those actions must
overlap in space and time for there to be potential cumulative effects (FSH 1909.15 (15.2)). Spatial and
temporal boundaries are the two critical elements to consider when deciding which actions to include in
a cumulative effects analysis. Spatial and temporal boundaries set the limits for selecting those actions
that are most likely to contribute to a cumulative effect. The effects of those actions must overlap in
space and time for there to be potential cumulative effects (FSH 1909.15 (15.2)). Therefore, relevant
boundaries and projects assessed for cumulative effects vary by resource. Each resource’s cumulative
effect area can be different and possibly larger or smaller.
With respect to already completed (past) actions, this cumulative effects review does not attempt to
quantify the effects of past human actions by adding up all prior actions on an action-by-action basis.
There are several reasons for not taking this approach. First, a catalogue and analysis of all past actions
would be impractical to compile and unduly costly to obtain. Current conditions have been impacted by
innumerable actions over the last century (and beyond), and trying to isolate the individual actions that
continue to have residual impacts would be nearly impossible. Second, providing the details of past
actions on an individual basis would not always be useful to predict the cumulative effects of the
proposed action or alternatives. In fact, focusing on individual actions may be less accurate than
looking at existing conditions, because there is limited information on the environmental impacts of
individual past actions, and one cannot reasonably identify each and every action over the last century
that has contributed to current conditions.
The cumulative effects analysis for each environmental component or resource area is guided by and
consistent with the Council on Environmental Quality letter “Guidance on the Consideration of Past
Actions in Cumulative Effects Analysis” of June 24, 2005. The current environmental conditions on the
landscape reflect the aggregate impact of all prior human actions and natural events that have affected
the environment and might contribute to cumulative effects and can be used as a proxy for the impacts
of past actions (CFR § 220.4 (f)).
For each resource area, direct and indirect effects of the proposed action were reviewed, in accordance
with the Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 (15.2), and relevant spatial and temporal boundaries for
cumulative effects analysis were determined. For the Elk project, the longest relevant temporal
boundary in this review was 30 years. The largest relevant spatial boundary in this review encompasses
the 5th field watershed that intersects the project area, Ash Creek, modified to expand the boundary

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

F-1

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

where any other resource cumulative effects boundary extends past it. All other spatial and temporal
boundaries either fell within the expanded 5th field HUC boundary, or were unneeded. 129 130The Elk
project area boundary was the most common cumulative effects spatial boundary used. Additionally,
most specialists considered existing conditions as the aggregate of past actions in lieu of designating a
specific temporal boundary.
Once this “general review area” was identified (Elk Project general cumulative effects review area),
activities were reviewed for data contained within or intersecting this largest boundary within the last
30 years to generate a list of potentially relevant actions. The interdisciplinary team reviewed for past,
present, ongoing and future activities that are contained within or intersect with the Elk Project general
cumulative effects review area from the following sources: Forest Activities Tracking (FACTS)
database for the Shasta-Trinity and Klamath National Forests, CALFIRES’s timber harvesting plan
(THP) status table (for THPs submitted to CALFIRE) and CALFIRE’s Forest Practice Geographical
Information System timber harvest data in ERSI formats (for THPs approved, completed, etc.), the
Schedule of Proposed Actions (SOPA) for the Shasta-Trinity and Klamath National Forests (January 1March 31, 2015 Quarterly SOPA, and the Current SOPA January 1, 2015). 131 The information is
characterized in the Cumulative Effects Worksheet for each resource as applicable (in the project
record).
Potentially relevant present and reasonably foreseeable future actions is summarized in Table Appendix
G-1. A column is included in the table indicating the estimated acreage or mileage within the project
area boundary because it is the most common cumulative effects boundary used by specialists. Refer to
the cumulative effects worksheet summary of past actions assessed. Relevant cumulative effects are
documented for the resource in the project specialist reports and are summarized in Chapter 3.
Following the tables, two figures are shown displaying this information. Figure Appendix G-1 displays
the locations of past actions in 10-year increments. Figure Appendix G-2 displays the ongoing and
future projects.

A few resources such as socio-economic had larger spatial boundaries but because of the nature of the
resource and/or effects, a cataloguing of actions was not necessary to the analysis.
130

Rationale for selection of boundaries as well as analysis can be found in individual specialist reports and are
summarized in chapter 3.
131

There may be a slight overestimate of the amount of activity conducted because activities
intersecting the boundary were used in addition to those contained completely within the boundary.

Appendix H-Changes in the Proposed Action
Appendix G-Changes in the Proposed Action
The Proposed Action for the Elk Flat Late Successional Reserve Enhancement Project (Alternative 1, the
Modified Proposed Action) was incrementally modified since the project was originally scoped and noticed in
2013 (USDA-FS, 2013; USDA-FS, 2013b). 132
The original Proposed Action described the Purpose and Need for Action in terms of the primary purpose to
reduce the current and future risk of large-scale disturbance events within early, mid and late-successional
habitat within the Elk Flat LSR and nearby stands per LSRA Objectives III and I. Additional benefits of the
project were to increase resilience and promote continued development and connectivity of late-successional
forest habitat in the Elk Flat LSR (LSRA Objectives II and IV); restore and maintain meadow habitat in Elk
Flat, increase hardwood diversity across the project area, and improve streamflow and vegetation conditions
within Riparian Reserves associated with Ash and Swamp Creeks and their tributaries. To clarify that they
were part of the Purpose and Need for Action, the “additional benefits” are now identified as secondary
purposes under Alternative 1. The primary purpose was slightly rephrased for consistency with wording in the
LSRA Objectives. Additionally, the original Proposed Action noted road decommissioning in support of the
meadow habitat and streamflow aspects. It did not explicitly include management of the transportation system
as a purpose, whereas Alternative 1 lists it as a secondary purpose for clarity.
In summary, the most substantial modifications to the original proposed treatments in Alternative 1 are:
•

Radial Thinning – Radial thinning trees per acre were modified from 5 trees per acre on average to 2
trees per acre, except for unit 157, which is a maximum of 4 trees per acre (see pp. B-25). The higher
level of radial thinning as originally proposed would thin the canopy more than is desired for wildlife
habitat.

•

Reforestation – The original proposed action did not refine the interplanting and group selection
planting needs by acres and specific units and did not include specific site preparation techniques and
acres, or the potential for release treatments. The modification discloses the action more specifically
and incorporates the potential for release as needed in order to assure growth to accelerate
development per the Purpose and Need for Action. Alternative 1 provides this more detailed
information on pages B-33, 50, and 61.

•

Underburning – The original Proposed Action did not specify that repeated entries for underburning
would be 2 to 3 prescribed fire entries on a 5 to 10 year interval within the project area boundary may
occur to fully restore the natural fire regime as described for Alternative 1 (see p. B-35, 52, and 62).
Some areas between treatment units and existing barriers were originally left untreated. The original
proposed action did not include underburning units 1-U, 156-U, 157-U, 159-U, 346-U. Alternative 1
increases underburning to take advantage of existing barriers to minimize fireline construction and to
full restore the project area to the natural fire regime consistent with the Purpose and Need for Action.

•

Mortality Levels During Underburning – Mortality in the residual stands from underburning are
refined for site-specific conditions in Alternative 1 (see RPMs 25-27).The original Proposed Action

132

The responsible official may modify the proposed action and alternative(s) under consideration prior to issuing a draft
EIS. In such cases, the responsible official may consider the incremental changes as alternatives considered. The
documentation of these incremental changes to a proposed action or alternatives shall be included or incorporated by
reference in accord with 40 CFR 1502.21. (36 CFR 220.5(e))

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

included mortality from underburning between 5% and 10%. The refinements inform the effects
analysis.

G-2

•

Oak and Aspen Release Treatment and Aspen Adaptive Management – Alternative 1 modified the
original Proposed Action to more thoroughly describe the oak and aspen release treatments and sets a
diameter or canopy class limit within the release areas and adds Aspen Restoration Adaptive
Management to provide a strategy to adjust future treatments based on release success (see pp. B-27
and B-34).

•

Hazard Reduction Treatment – Alternative 1 provides a description of hazard reduction as a
connected action to the thinning and fuels treatments (see pp. 56, and 64) to accommodate the
concern of ongoing mortality on safety in specific areas.

•

Extensive Mortality Area Treatment – Alternative 1 adds the Extensive Mortality Area treatment (see
pp. B-38, 53, and 61) due to ongoing and contiguous mortality and a concern for safety in the area.

•

Salvage Adaptive Management – Alternative 1 adds a salvage adaptive management of salvage of
dying trees in units 6, 14, 16, 18, 113, 123, 124, 125, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 175, 176,
204, and 206 in the event conditions deteriorate further post-decision and post marking (see pp. B-34,
51, and 61). Salvaging the trees would reduce the safety and hazard concern post-project from
continued mortality.

•

Follow-up Mechanical Fuels Treatment - The original Proposed Action described that the entire suite
of fuels treatments could be employed and the decision on appropriate method would be made based
on post-thinning activity and surface fuels levels. Alternative 1 clearly defines where machine piling
and pile burning would take place (see p. Table Appendix B-3 and p. 62) to inform the effects
analysis.

•

Road Actions –Road Actions in the original proposed action are shown in Table 4 of the Scoping
document (USDA-FS, 2013b). Table 10 on page 63 summarizes the road actions in Alternative 1 and
the specific road action list is on page B-41. Changes occurred as analysis of the existing condition
and connected actions refined the proposed action since scoping. For the most part mileages of all
road actions decreased; for example, the proposed reconstruction of 4 miles in the original Proposed
Action down to 0.3 miles in Alternative 1. Additionally, the original Proposed Action did not include
addition of 0.10 miles of unauthorized route to the FTS to provide legal access to an existing
dispersed recreation site near Elk Flat meadow.

•

Adaptive Management for Biomass Thinning – Alternative 1 added adaptive management for
biomass thinning (see pp. 51 and 58) to address potential market fluctuations and provide an
alternative method of thinning material 4 to 6.9 inches DBH.

•

Meadow Enhancement dropped in Unit 401 - The original Proposed Action included unit 401 as a
meadow enhancement unit. Review of the stand history revealed the prescription for treatment under
the Pilgrim Vegetation Management Project was for a transition zone between meadow and forest
with widely spaced overstory (80 square feet of basal area per acre) and all understory removed to
resemble a pine savannah. That treatment has been partially completed under Pilgrim. Alternative 1
drops the meadow enhancement prescription in favor of fully implementing the Pilgrim project’s
treatment of the unit. Underburning unit 401 remains in Alternative 1. See footnote 25 on page 58 for
more information.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

•

Unthinned Patches – the original Proposed Action included approximately 10% of units included as
unthinned patches. Alternative 1 includes a minimum of 10% but most units having between 12% and
50% UTPs. The original Proposed Action included no burning in UTPs. Alternative 1 instead
prescribes no direct ignition in some UTPs (RPM 30) and has other protections to prescribe mortality
limits throughout the project area (starting p. 85). Alternative 1 adds snag retention areas as part of the
unthinned patch prescriptions in areas of heavy mortality. This primarily affects units 158, 162,
175,176, 204 and 206. These were added due to ongoing mortality reducing the options for unthinned
patches consisting of mostly live trees. See pages B-24, Table Appendix B-2). Table 7 (p. 59) for
acres of unthinned patches.

•

Borax Treatment – The connected action of Borate fungicide treatment to inhibit the spread of
Heterobasidion root disease may include different formulations based on changing market
availability. The solid Sporax® or liquid Cellu-Treat® or possibly other brands or formulations may be
used. Additionally, it is clarified that borax may be applied to stumps meeting the requirement (over
14 inches in diameter) in all harvested areas, including equipment exclusion zones in Riparian
Reserves where equipment may reach in to thin trees without entering the exclusion zone.

•

Acreages of Treatments – Alternative 1 provides refinements, corrections and display of acres by
treatments and prescriptions elements. See Table Appendix B-2 for unit acres by treatment.

Appendix I– Compliance and Consistency
Appendix H – Compliance and Consistency
NEPA at 40 CFR 1502.25(a) directs “to the fullest extent possible, agencies shall prepare draft environmental
impact statements concurrently with and integrated with …other environmental review laws and executive
orders.” Compliance with the legal and policy framework at the federal, state, and local level (applicable
Forest Plan standards and guidelines, principle laws, regulations, executive orders and policies) that has not
been previously discussed, are addressed here by resource topic or by the guiding authority. When there are
multiple requirements from different authorities the discussion is introduced by resource topic. When the
requirement is confined to a single authority, the discussion is introduced by that authority. Topics are listed
here in alphabetical order except the National Forest Management Act (NFMA) is presented last to provide
the Forest Plan consistency evaluations for those items not previously included.

Air Quality Requirements-Local, State and Federal
The project area is within the Northeaster Plateau Air Basin consisting of Siskiyou, Modoc, and Lassen
Counties in a Class II airshed. Air Quality at the local level is regulated by the Siskiyou County Air Pollution
Control District (APCD). The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has noted that Siskiyou County
adequately represents the air basin as a whole (CARB, 2010 p. 15).
The major project activity relative to the decision with respect to air quality is smoke produced from
prescribed burning. Other project actions that have the potential to affect air quality include dust from heavy
equipment and trucks using native surface and gravel roads, and emissions from mobile equipment for
implementation operations, hauling, and road actions. Projected vehicle emissions, including those from
timber harvest activities, are already accounted for in the emissions inventory for Siskiyou County. 133
Maximum vehicle emissions are regulated through state and federal mobile source emissions standards with
which all vehicles and equipment must comply. 134 Therefore, the compliance evaluation for air quality
primarily concerns smoke and dust emissions.
Since air quality is transient; air quality impacts from activities prior to the project will have dissipated.
Similarly, air impacts from the project would dissipate before future projects begin, so there is no potential for
past or future projects, in conjunction with the proposed action, to cumulatively affect the air resource. For
that reason, they are not catalogued specific to air quality.

133

The emissions inventories for various years by County or air basin are provided online at the California Air Resources
Board website. See http://www.arb.ca.gov/app/emsinv/emssumcat.php
134

Vehicle emissions would vary in both timing and quantity produced based on the actual complement of equipment and
strategy of implementation employed. It is assumed that given similar equipment and timing, more acres treated using
heavy equipment, including thinning, machine piling, road maintenance and decommissioning, would produce
correspondingly higher vehicle emissions to accomplish the treatments. Therefore Alternative 1 is likely to produce more
vehicle emissions than Alternatives 2 and 3, with Alternative 3 producing the least.

Federal Clean Air Act and Federal Policy
General Conformity Rule
The conformity provisions of the Federal Clean Air Act (Section 176c) prohibit federal agencies from taking
any action that causes or contributes to any new violation of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards,
increases the frequency or severity of an existing violation or delays the timely attainment of a standard. The
federal agency responsible for the action is required to determine if its actions conform to the applicable State
Implementation Plan.
There are eight criteria pollutants for the federal standards (CARB, 2015). No criteria pollutants are in a
federal nonattainment status for Siskiyou, Modoc or Lassen Counties, which comprise the Northeastern
Plateau Air Basin (CARB, 2013). Because Siskiyou County and the air basin are in federal attainment, a
conformity determination is not required for this project.
While fires managed for resource benefits generally are not subject to a preconstruction review and the
issuance of a prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) permit, the emissions from such activities may
affect the air quality in a PSD area. Under adverse conditions, the combined particulate matter (PM)
emissions from increased fire activities and from other sources could possibly result in ambient
concentrations that exceed the allowable PSD increments for PM. Historically, EPA has often regarded fires
managed for resource benefits to be temporary activities (US-EPA, 1998 p. 32). The PM emissions resulting
from fire activities differ from the PM emissions generated by most other sources because they are generally
short-lived. That is, the burning generally is carried out infrequently at a specific location (once every 5-20
years) and the duration tends to be short (approximately 1-2 days).

Environmental Protection Agency Interim Air Quality Policy on Wildland and
Prescribed Fires (US-EPA, 1998)
Under air quality regulations, prescribed burning is usually considered a temporary, intermittent source of air
pollution and therefore is not subject to the same visibility requirements as a major “Prevention of Significant
Deterioration” (PSD) source. The interim policy (US-EPA, 1998) integrates two public policy goals, (1) to
allow fire to function, as nearly as possible, in its natural role in maintaining healthy wildland ecosystems,
and (2) to protect public health and welfare by mitigating the impacts of air pollutant emissions on air quality
and visibility. The document provides guidance on mitigating air pollution impacts caused by fires in the
wildlands and the wildland/urban interface. It identifies the responsibilities of wildland owners/managers and
State/tribal air quality managers to work together to coordinate fire activities, minimize air pollutant
emissions, manage smoke from wildland and prescribed fires managed for resource benefits, and establish
emergency action programs to mitigate the unavoidable impacts on the public. The indicators of effects under
the policy are ambient air quality impacts above National Ambient Air Standards, visibility impairment and
regional haze.
Air quality managers are urged to help evaluate the potential impacts of alternative resource treatments and
assure that air quality concerns (also visibility and regional haze concerns, where appropriate) are adequately
addressed in the public land use planning process. It allows flexibility in regulating fire managed for resource
benefits when a smoke management plan is being implemented in that EPA will use its discretion not to redesignate an area as nonattainment when fires cause or significantly contribute to federal particulate matter
standards violations. The policy also encourages collaboration and communication among land managers and
integration of air quality into planning processes, describes analysis of air quality impacts in planning
processes, and lays out basic requirements of smoke management plans.
The project complies with the policy through the smoke management plan process and burn permit process,
the NEPA process, and compliance with the Regional Haze Rule.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Federal Clean Air Act Regional Haze Rule (US-EPA, 1999) [and California Regional
Haze Plan (CARB, 2009)]
The nearest Class I airshed, Lava Beds National Monument, is within the Northeastern Plateau air basin.
States prepare Regional Haze Plans to meet the Haze Rule. The latest California Regional Haze Plan Progress
Report indicates Lava Beds visibility exceeds the 2018 goals (CARB, 2014 p. 12). Prescribed burning is a
common practice in the air basin. The Elk project area is roughly 33 miles southeast of Lava Beds National
Monument. At this distance, the class I airshed would likely be minimally impacted during burning because of
the favorable atmospheric conditions present during permissible burn days. No significant deterioration of
visibility would be expected with the action alternatives.

California Clean Air Act
In general, the California standards are stricter than the federal standards. The California Air Resources Board
(CARB) directly regulates mobile sources of pollutants, while delegating regulation of nonmobile source to
local air districts. None of the 11 State criteria pollutants (CARB, 2015) are in a nonattainment status in
Siskiyou County (CARB, 2013). Burning activities on several projects could occur within the same season;
however, burning over any period would be limited to assure air quality is maintained. Potentially cumulative
simultaneous burning projects are not possible to catalogue at this time because the information for the exact
years and days burning will occur is not available for this project or other projects. Under the Siskiyou
County Air Pollution Control District Rules, the control officer may restrict burning to selected permittees on
designated burn days if total tonnage to be ignited would discharge a volume of contaminants into the
atmosphere sufficient to cause State ambient air quality standards to be exceeded (APCD, 2014 pp. 7.5-1.N).
The project would not cause a State criteria pollutant to be reclassified into a nonattainment status.

Siskiyou County Air Pollution Control District Requirements
The Siskiyou County APCD handles the day-to-day field operation of agricultural burning: issuing burn
permits and informing growers and land managers of when and how much burning can be undertaken.
Burning would be done only on designated “burn days” as designated by the APCD when predicted weather
conditions are favorable for good smoke dispersal.

Burn Permit and Smoke Management Plan
Consistent with SOPs (see p. D-1), a prescribed burn plan, including a Smoke Management Plan in
compliance with the EPA Smoke Management Program, would be submitted to the Siskiyou County APCD
per their rules. 135 The Siskiyou County APCD requires burn permits for all burns over 50 acres 136 or burn
more than 3,000 tons material to be consumed, or are within 5 miles of a sensitive receptor (APCD, 2014 p.
7.6).
The Northeast Air Alliance (NEAA) has developed a standard Smoke Management Plan template (NEAA,
2012). As part of the Smoke Management Plan for the prescribed burn, the Forest must provide a detailed
meteorological prescription to be met prior to ignition. The prescription must include acceptable wind
direction. Other considerations include: wind speed, temperature profile, winds aloft, humidity, temperature,
135

Regardless of local requirements, the Forest Service Manual Chapter 5140 requires that all burning on National Forest
System lands have an approved prescribed fire plan prior to any ignitions. Burning activities will be coordinated with
affected landowners and control agencies.
136

While the APCD rules require approval for all burns over 50 acres or within 5 miles of a sensitive receptor, the Forest
Service has agreed as a member of the Northeast Air Alliance to submit plans for approval when more than 10 acres are
planned for prescribed fire.

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

actual and predicted inversions, burn day status and forecast, precipitation forecast, and any other
meteorological conditions that may affect smoke dispersion and/or fire behavior. Projects exceeding 100 acres
must include a map showing smoke sensitive areas (or Sensitive Receptors) likely to be impacted.
Prescribed burning takes place on permissive burn days 137 and is managed in real time to avoid cumulatively
significant effects through the issuance and administration of burn permits including smoke management
plans. The NEAA provides an effective communication forum for land managers and regulators to discuss
ongoing impacts throughout burning processes and make adjustments locally and regionally to avoid
significant cumulative effects. Forest staff would coordinate burn ignitions to ensure smoke from any one
project has dissipated prior to additional ignitions. The NEAA has proven to be an excellent forum to discuss
ongoing burns, new burns planned, air quality issues, marginal burn days, fuel loadings, etc. This process
strengthens agencies’ commitments to cooperate and makes for a more efficient smoke management program.
Local districts have the authority to suspend all or some burning operations should conditions change or
monitoring indicates standard thresholds are being exceeded.

Sensitive Receptors
Smoke sensitive areas include but are not limited to Class I airsheds, populations centers, hospitals, schools,
daycare centers, nursing homes, shopping centers, populated recreation areas, well attended public events,
major roads, airports, campgrounds and trails (NEAA, 2012).
Sensitive receptors within relatively close proximity to the project area includes the Shasta Forest subdivision
approximately 1.25 miles southwest and the Pilgrim Creek Snowmobile Park and dispersed use areas adjacent
to the project area. Use at the snowmobile park is unlikely during burning operations. Prescribed fire would
not occur during times of more concentrated use at the dispersed area in summer. Smoke may potentially
impact dispersed use during the burning season and residents of the Shasta Forest subdivision. However, the
Forest Service will follow Siskiyou County ACPD requirements 138 in order to avoid creating a nuisance,
visibility impairment or impacts to public health. Public education and information release are part of the
prescribed burning procedures and will be followed. A severe smoke-created nuisance from prescribed fire is
unlikely to occur due to the conditions under which burning is conducted (burn days).

Fugitive Dust
Rule 4.2 of the Siskiyou County APCD rules (APCD, 2014) regulates creation of dust that could pose a
nuisance. Numerous native surface and gravel roads cross the project area. Fugitive dust can become airborne
through ground disturbance and the spatial boundary for effects is actual treatment units and road actions, and
sensitive receptors directly adjacent to ground disturbance areas. Low levels of fugitive dust are created by the
public accessing the National Forest and administrative use. Fugitive dust from unpaved roads is included in
the emissions inventories for the County under “Miscellaneous Processes.” St
Vehicular travel on paved and unpaved roads and logging operations will produce some dust, primarily from
tractor skidding of log bundles and hauling over earth surface (dirt) roads. When materials are being
137

Atmospheric conditions (smoke dispersal) and air quality determine the amount of burning that can take place on a
given day without adverse impacts to air quality. CARB determines Permissive Burn Days and the number of acres
allocated for agricultural and open burning based on meteorological and air quality factors. CARB Meteorologists utilize
specific criteria such as mixing heights and wind speeds in conjunction with air quality data to determine the daily burn
day status for the air basin. Weather forecasts will be reviewed and a spot forecast requested that specifies predicted
transport winds and mixing heights. Burning on days when conditions are favorable for transport and dispersion will
reduce the impacts of smoke. Ignition can be stopped where practical to hold the fire until conditions improve.

dust that would be created by the increased road usage. Dust generated and the resultant particulate matter is
directly related to vehicle miles traveled on un-surfaced roads in the project area. It can also be attributed to
tractor work on harvest units.
Standard Operating Procedures (see p. D-1) require dust abatement, which is most often water applied to the
road surface at regular intervals. If agreed upon, a temporary road surface material especially made for dust
reduction may be applied to the roads instead of water. A Forest Service Timber Sale Administrator oversees
all such operations, ensuring they adhere to contract specified requirements. With the above constraints in
place and enforced, fugitive dust from logging equipment will have little measurable impacts on the airshed.
There might be periods of localized impacts from created dust by logging and recreational activities
conducted on both public and private lands within the analysis area. Logging operations are generally done
over several years and localized dust from skidding and hauling dissipates rapidly. The project will comply
with the APCD rules for a dust nuisance.

Naturally Occurring Asbestos (NOA)
California Final Regulation Order 2002-07-29 regulates construction of roads associated with timber
harvesting in areas that have naturally-occurring asbestos, serpentine, or ultramafic rock (CARB, 2002).
Although NOA is documented in Siskiyou County, it is not known to occur in or near the Elk project area
(Churchill, et al., 2000), therefore no protective measures are needed to comply with the NOA regulation.

Forest Plan Compliance – Air Quality
The Forest plan directs air quality to meet or exceed applicable standards and regulations (4.4), and directs
coordination with affected landowners and control agencies, and smoke management controls be incorporated
into smoke management and prescribed fire plans. The proposed action and action alternatives are consistent
with the Forest Plan. The project meets applicable air quality standards and regulations. Burning will be
coordinated with the local air district in conjunction with CARB meteorological forecasts for burn days. The
Northeast Air Alliance facilitates coordination and communication between area land managers. Smoke
management controls are incorporated into the NEPA design and SOPs and will be incorporated into burn
plans, smoke management plans, and part of the burn permit.

Climate Change
Forest Service Strategic Plan
The USDA Forest Service Strategic Plan for FY 2015-2020, Strategic Objective “A” calls for fostering
resilient, adaptive ecosystems to mitigate climate change. This is accomplished by improving the ability of
forests to remain healthy and resilient, despite stresses and disturbances such as drought and wildfire, and
using information from climate change vulnerability assessments to inform adaptive management strategies.
The strategy is to develop and apply detection, prediction, prevention, mitigation, treatment, restoration, and
climate adaptation methods, technologies, and strategies for addressing disturbances such as changing
climatic conditions (USDA-FS, 2015a).The purpose of the Elk project is in part to increase forest stand
resilience to large scale disturbances attributed to climate change (such as drought).
Although future climate change at the local level is uncertain, the Elk project action alternatives will improve
the ability of the forest to withstand drier or seasonally drier conditions by maintaining stand densities that
promote forest health, and by favoring drought resistant species in appropriate residual stands. By promoting
healthier stands, the project treatments will reduce the susceptibility of trees to insect attack during prolonged
drought periods. If the local climate shifts towards wetter conditions, these measures would not have a

Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

H-5

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

detrimental effect, because treatments would still promote healthier stands for other reasons than climate
change such as through less competition for sunlight and nutrients.

California Assembly Bill 32
In 2006, California enacted Assembly Bill 32, The Global Warming Solutions Act, which required a scoping
plan for achieving reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2020. The 2020 Scoping Plan target for
California’s forest sector is to maintain the current 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent
of sequestration through sustainable management practices.
With the removal of trees via thinning, oak release, and aspen release under the action alternatives, there
would be an immediate reduction in the capacity of the remaining standing forest to store carbon. The carbon
storage capacity of thinned stands will increase as trees grow and forest stocking (density) increases. The
action alternatives will reduce the risk of a mass release of a large volume of carbon to the atmosphere as a
result of catastrophic, stand-replacing wildfire in the project area by modifying vegetation and fuel conditions.
There will be short-term releases of carbon to the atmosphere during prescribed burning. Emissions would
most likely occur over a period of several years, as actual burning activities will be spread over the project
implementation period.
On the global scale, the Elk project will have a negligible effect on climate change from any action alternative
in terms of GHG. GHG from the project would mix readily into the global pool of GHG, and so it is not
currently possible to determine the cumulative effects of emissions from single or multiple sources (projects).
Carbon storage (both in the standing forest and as wood products resulting from project timber harvest), the
use of energy from biofuel displacing energy from fossil fuel consumption, and the reduced risk of losing
large volumes of carbon to the atmosphere due to catastrophic wildfire indicate that the project will likely not
have an adverse net effect on carbon cycling.

Endangered Species Act
A thorough analysis of potentially affected federally listed species has been completed. Refer to the Wildlife
section (starting page 158) and the Botany section (starting page 186). These sections address endangered and
threatened species and their designated critical habitat. Resource specialists determined that the project would
have no effect to endangered, threatened, or proposed plant, fish or other aquatic species or their designated
critical habitats due to the lack of suitable habitat or the project area being outside of a species known or
expected range. The project would have no effect to federally listed wildlife species, with the exception of the
northern spotted owl and its designated critical habitat and the gray wolf. There is no critical habitat
designated for the gray wolf in California at this time.
The Yreka FWS field office and the Forest have been consulting on the project’s effects to listed wildlife
species since December 2011 and the Draft Biological Assessment was transmitted to the Yreka FWS field
office on January 6, 2016. Consultation on the effects to the northern spotted owl and its critical habitat, and
effects to the gray wolf, is ongoing with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and is yet to be completed.
Once completed, the consultation will fulfill Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act’s consultation
requirements ((19 U.S.C. 1536 (c)). Refer to the ESA Consultation and Coordination section for additional
detail (p. 254).
The West Coast Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of fisher is proposed for federal listing (USDI-FWS,
2014). The fisher is a Forest Service sensitive species and the project effects are evaluated in the project
wildlife Biological Evaluation. This evaluation determined that the project may have an adverse effect on
individuals in the project area, but not contribute to a loss of viability of the local population, and no

meaningful effects at the range of the DPS. Refer to the Wildlife section of this EIS and the wildlife
Biological Evaluation (Jordan, 2015c) in the project record for more detail.

Environmental Justice – Executive Order 12898
As stated in Executive Order 12898 (Office of the President, 1994) all Federal actions are required to consider
the potential of disproportionate effects on minority and low-income populations in the local region. The
principals of environmental justice require agencies to address the equity and fairness implications associated
with Federal land management actions. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) provides the following
definitions in order to provide guidance with the compliance of Environmental Justice requirements:
•

“Minority population: Minority populations should be identified where either: (a) the minority
population of the affected area exceeds 50 percent or (b) the minority population percentage of the
affected area is meaningfully greater than the minority population percentage in the general
population or other appropriate unit of geographic analysis...”

•

“Low-income population: Low-income populations in an affected area should be identified with the
annual statistical poverty thresholds from the Bureau of the Census' Current Population Reports,
Series P-60 on Income and Poverty. In identifying low-income populations, agencies may consider as
a community either a group of individuals living in geographic proximity to one another, or a set of
individuals (such as migrant workers or Native Americans), where either type of group experiences
common conditions of environmental exposure or effect.” (CEQ, 1997).

According to the American Community Survey and US Census data, it is suggested that the Native American
population meets the Environmental Justice criterion as a minority population meaningfully greater than the
general population of the state. Therefore, decision makers should pay careful attention to the potential
impacts of management actions on Native Americans.
Table Appendix I-1 reports the number of individuals below the poverty level and poverty rates in 2000 and
2008. Both counties have higher poverty rates than the state. Shasta County experienced a 3% increase in
poverty during the specified period, while Siskiyou County experienced a slight decline. These poverty rates
suggest that a substantial proportion of the existing population should be considered as a low income group.
Therefore, decisions regarding future management actions should carefully assess the effects on low income
populations in the study area.

In cases where the management decisions are expected to create jobs and income in the local economy, it is
unlikely that there would be a disproportionate adverse effect on minority and low income populations.
Individuals in that population may benefit from any increase in jobs and income in the area. There are
expected to be no disproportionate adverse effects on low income or minority populations because of
implementation of any of the Elk Project action alternatives.

Historically, Native Americans collected edible berries such as strawberries, currents and gooseberries.
Manzanita flowers and berries were eaten and the leaves were used medicinally. Manzanita berries can also be
used to make a sugar. Many of these plants are still collected today by Native Americans and others. Most of
these plants are common throughout the project area. Edible fungi species may be the most important species
being collected in the project area. Prince’s pine (Chimaphila umbellatum) and wintergreen (Pyrola picta) are
plants that occur in the project area that are important culturally for the Pit River Tribe. Concerns have been
voiced by the Pit River Tribe regarding the retention of Prince’s pine and wintergreen in the project area.
These are important cultural plants for the tribe and they can be sensitive to ground disturbance and burning
(Posey, 2015). There are specific areas within and near the Elk project area that are of importance to local
Native American tribes, and some ceremonial activities that occur periodically in the vicinity. The Forest has
worked with local tribes to protect or avoid special areas and coordinate the timing of implementation
activities to avoid disrupting traditional and ceremonial activities. There are expected to be no
disproportionate adverse effects on Native Americans because of implementation of any of the Elk Project
action alternatives.

Invasive Species-Executive Order, Regulation, Policy
Executive Order 13112, of February 3, 1999
Executive Order 13112 addresses preventing the introducing invasive species and provides for their control
and minimization of the economic, ecological, and human health impacts the invasive species causes. The
order states that Federal Agencies should:
Identify actions that may affect the status of invasive species.
Use relevant programs and authorities to: (a) prevent the introduction of invasive species; (b) detect and
respond rapidly to and control populations in a cost-effective and environmentally sound manner; (c) monitor;
(d) restore; (e) research; and (f) promote public education on invasive species.
Not authorize, fund, or carry out actions that it believes are likely to cause or promote the introduction or
spread of invasive species.
Coordinate these duties with the National Invasive Species Council that coordinates Federal strategies to
address the problem of noxious weeds.
This project is compliant with the executive order because project actions that may affect the status of
invasive species have been identified. Relevant programs and authorities will be used to prevent the
introduction of invasive species, and measures to minimize risk and harm caused by invasive species (see
RPM 15 (Chapter 2) and Invasive Species Standard Operating Procedures 9 to 13 (Appendix C) will be taken
in conjunction with this project.

Departmental Regulation 9500-10: Noxious Weed Management
USDA Regulation 9500-10 directs the Agency to integrate noxious weed management into all programs and
activities and to develop, demonstrate, and apply the essential science, technology, and stewardship to
effectively manage and prevent the spread of these plants. As described under FSM 2900 and Executive Order
13112, the Elk project also complies with this regulation.

Forest Service Manual (FSM) 2900
Forest Service Manual Chapter 2900 – Invasive species Management sets forth National Forest System
policy, responsibilities and direction for the prevention, detection and restoration of effects from aquatic and
terrestrial invasive species (This new chapter replaces FSM Chapter 2080 – noxious weed management).
H-8

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Section 2902 strategic objectives include prevention, early detection and rapid response, control and
management, restoration, and collaborating with other organizations. Section 2903 established policy at the
project level. The Shasta-Trinity National Forest has placed a high priority on management of invasive weed
species. This includes reducing management-related introduction and spread of invasive weeds on the Forest.
Initial implementation of the Elk Project any of the action alternatives would involve increased ground
disturbance and vehicle travel in the short-term, increasing the opportunity for invasive plant introduction,
spread, and establishment. In the long-term, the action alternatives would result in a healthier more resilient
forest environment and a smaller road system with lower erosion risk and requiring less maintenance,
resulting in decreased opportunity for invasive plant introduction, spread, and establishment. Implementation
of mitigation (ore resource protection measures (see RPM 15 in Chapter 2) and Invasive Species Standard
Operating Procedures 9 to 13 (Appendix C) to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive plants during
project implementation would minimize the risk involved with any of the action alternatives considered in
detail.
There are no known populations of any weed species rated moderate or high by the Forest within the Elk
project area. If any new populations are found before or during implementation, these populations will be
incorporated into any contract maps implementing the project. They will be flagged on the ground as
exclusion areas.

Migratory Birds – Executive Order 13186 of January 10, 2001
Under the National Forest Management Act (NFMA), the Forest Service (FS) is directed to “provide for
diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area in
order to meet overall multiple-use objectives.” (P.L. 94-588, Sec 6 (g) (3) (B)). The January 2000 Landbird
Conservation Strategic Plan , Executive Order 13186 (Office of the President, 2001), the Partners in Flight
specific habitat conservation plans for birds, and the January 2004 Partners in Flight North American
Landbird Conservation Plan (Rich, et al., 2004), all reference goals and objectives for integrating bird
conservation into forest management and planning. On December 2008, a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) between the FS and the FWS to promote the conservation and reduce take of migratory birds was
signed, and was reaffirmed in 2014 (USDA-FS & USDI-FWS, 2008; USDA-FS & USDI-FWS, 2014c). The
intent of the 2008/2014 MOU is to strengthen migratory bird conservation by identifying and implementing
strategies that promote conservation and avoid or minimize adverse impacts through enhanced collaboration
and cooperation between the FS and the FWS as well as other federal, state, tribal and local governments.
On National Forest System lands, conservation of migratory birds focuses on providing a diversity of habitat
conditions at multiple spatial scales and ensuring that bird conservation is addressed when planning for land
management activities. A Migratory Bird Report was completed for the project and is incorporated by
reference (Jordan, 2015f). Information relevant to the decision to be made is summarized here. Opportunities
to promote conservation of migratory birds and their habitats in the 3,519-acre project area were considered
during project development per the 2008/2014 MOU, specifically Section C: item 1, and Section D: items 3a3d, and 6.
For the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, the bird species of management concern are those listed under the
Endangered Species Act as threatened or endangered, those designated by the Regional Forester as sensitive,
those associated with management indicator assemblages (MIAs) affected by the project, and those of
conservation concern (USDA-FS & USDI-FWS, 2008).
Effects to the federally threatened northern spotted owl are discussed in Chapter 3, starting on page 158, and
effects to the sensitive northern goshawk are discussed starting on page xxx. Effects to MIAs and
representative species are summarized above on page I-17 and described in detail in the project-level MIA

report. Project effects to other bird species of conservation concern within the Great Basin Bird Conservation
Region (BCR-9) are assessed in the project-level Migratory Bird report (Jordan, 2015f).
The need to maintain, enhance and restore habitat components important to migratory birds and reduce the
potential for take and adverse effects in the project area was emphasized throughout project development, in
accordance with MOU Section D, item 3b and items 3c1-3c4. The project’s design, specific treatment
prescriptions and resource protection measures will help ensure that treated areas continue to provide
necessary habitat to maintain a diversity of species at both the stand and landscape scale during and after the
project is completed, and that the potential for adverse effects to individuals and project-level populations is
reduced if not eliminated.
The project’s design and resource protection measures preclude mechanical treatments in certain high quality
habitat areas, known breeding sites, and near riparian zones that provide habitat for listed, sensitive and
species of management concern. Treatments will maintain large and small trees; trees with old-growth and
late-successional characteristics such as large branching, cavities, flattened tops; variable canopy cover of
trees and shrub species; large and small snags and down logs; and shrubs that provide breeding, roosting and
foraging habitat. Treatments will increase oak, aspen and open meadow habitats, and limited operating
periods are in place for thinning and burning actions during critical breeding periods.
The FS has also assessed the potential for environmental contaminants and other stressors relevant to
migratory bird conservation in accordance with MOU Section D, item 3c5 through the Human Health and
Risk Assessment for Borax (USDA-FS, 2006). While the potential exists for migratory birds to consume prey
exposed to borax application, the risks to terrestrial species are low, with most acute and chronic risk
quotients well below levels of concern (USDA-FS, 2006). Considering it is unlikely for birds to ingest borax
from treated stumps, that none of the hazard quotients exceed the level of concern for contaminated water
(even at application rates 10 times the rate proposed), and that the 2006 risk assessment indicates boric acid is
practically non-toxic to avian species, borax application is not expected to have measurable effects on
migratory birds or their prey.
Implementation of the project is expected to maintain as well as enhance the existing functional habitat used
by migratory birds over the short- and long-term, contributing to long-term sustainability and resilience of
foraging and reproductive habitat that may be used by migratory birds (Jordan, 2015f).

Watch List (WL) botanical species - Departmental Regulation
USDA Regulation 9500-4 directs the Forest Service to manage habitats for all existing native and desired
nonnative plants, fish, and wildlife species in order to maintain at least viable populations of such species, and
to avoid actions that may cause a species to become threatened or endangered. Forest Service objectives
further state that viable populations of all species must be maintained in habitats distributed throughout their
geographic range on National Forest System lands (Forest Service Manual [FSM] 2670.22). The Compliance
Report for Botanical Species (Posey, 2015) provides information specific to Watch List species and
information most relevant to the decision and compliance with 9500-4 is summarized here.
The California Native Plant Society’s Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants of California describes a
watch list (WL) species as species that do not meet all the criteria to be included on the Regional Forester’s
Sensitive List, but are of sufficient concern that we need to consider them in the planning process. These
include species that are locally rare (as opposed to declining throughout their range), are of public concern,
occur as disjunct populations, are newly described taxa or lack sufficient information on population size,
threats or distribution. The creation of the sensitive species and watch lists are key steps in meeting the

commitment to maintain biologically diverse and healthy ecosystems.” 139 The Shasta-Trinity National Forest
does not maintain a Watch List (WL), but instead considers all CNPS Inventory taxa of lists 1-4 (CNPS, 2015)
[that are not already managed as Regional Forester’s Sensitive Species or Forest Plan Endemics] to be eligible
for mitigation at the project level if needed.
A WL perennial bunchgrass, Muhlenbergia jonesii (Jones’ muhly), occurs within the project area throughout
parts of Elk and Coonrod Flats, All areas combined cover many acres. The populations are in more open areas
with few trees. Generally, grasses of this type are more robust and more nutritious after burning. Burning in a
mosaic pattern will reduce the loss of soil biota. Removal of conifers will create habitat for this species.
Decommissioning unauthorized routes may improve habitat for Jones’ muhly by discouraging illegal
vehicular use. The project will benefit the species through removal of dead thatch during burning. Equipment
disturbance may crush, uproot and possibly cause mortality of individual plants; however, the sparse conifer
cover near these populations will minimize disturbance from equipment. Burning may kill some individual
plants. The population as a whole will benefit as disturbance, especially burning, is generally important for
maintaining healthy grasslands.
Resource Protection Measures, SOPs, and BMPs in place for protecting soils, and improving and protecting
hydrological function will provide protection for this species in compliance with DR-9500-4 and Forest
Service Policy.
Should other watch list species be found before or during project implementation, protection measures will be
put into place to protect the species and its habitat. Protection measures will depend on the species. However,
many watch list species require disturbance especially fire to maintain their habitat. Many early seral species
respond favorably to mechanical disturbance. In this case, it may not be necessary to protect the sight from
either mechanical or fire disturbance. If the species is one that does not respond favorably or require
disturbance, the site would be flagged and avoided.

Water Quality – Basin Plan
Designated beneficial uses, water quality objectives (standards), and a policy statement regarding maintaining
high quality waters in California are within the Board’s Water Quality Control Plan (Basin Plan)
(CVRWQCB, 2011). Under section 303(d) of the 2006 Clean Water Act where water quality is limited, state
agencies develop plans to improve water quality to support the beneficial uses of water (US-EPA, 2002). This
information was reviewed in context of the project area boundary and proposed treatment units. According to
the Section 303(d) list of water quality limited segments for the State of California, there are no water quality
limited waterbodies related to the project area (CVRWQCB, 2011).
There are no municipal watersheds within the 5th field watershed of the Project Area; A municipal watershed
is a community water system “that serves at least 15 service connections used by year-round residents of the
area served by the system; or regularly serves at least 25 year-round residents” (Safe Drinking Water Act,
Section 1401, 42 U.S.C.A. 300f.(15)).
Through a memorandum of understanding with the State of California, and in compliance with the Clean
Water Act for controlling non-point pollution sources, the U.S. Forest Service will implement Best
Management Practices (BMPs) on ground disturbing activities that are approved by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (USDA-FS, 2000). All timber sales that may have the potential to impact water quality are

evaluated, identified, monitored, and reported by the forest service and the state under a Conditional Waiver
of Waste Discharge Requirements to assure BMPs are applied to prevent impacts to water quality
(CVRWQCB, 2010).

National Forest Management Act (NFMA) [Forest Plan Consistency]
The National Forest Management Act (NFMA) requires specific findings and the development, maintenance,
amendment, and revision of land and resource management plans [Forest Plan(s)] for each unit of the
National Forest System. The Forest Plans help create a dynamic management system so that an
interdisciplinary approach to achieve integrated consideration of physical, biological, economic, and other
sciences will be applied to all future actions on the unit [16 U.S.C. 1604(b), (f), (g) and (i)]. A Forest Plan
consistency discussion follows the NFMA finding provided below.

NFMA Findings [16 U.S.C. 1604 (g)(3)(E)]
1. Soil, slope, or other watershed conditions will not be irreversibly damaged - None of the alternatives
would irreversibly damage soil, slope or other watershed conditions. See the soils section (p. 225) and
hydrology section (starting on p. 201).
2. There is assurance that such lands can be adequately restocked within five years after harvest Reforestation will occur within five years of final harvest. Any stand that receives any harvest activity
will not be maintained as a permanent opening and will be fully stocked, or can be adequately restocked
with natural regeneration within five years of final harvest. Live green trees retained on each unit will
serve as seed sources where regeneration is inadequate. Minimum stocking levels are defined in the
Forest Plan (p. 4.27). All areas proposed for artificial reforestation have been reviewed by a certified
silviculturist and a soil scientist to ensure adequate soils for planting and growth of conifer seedlings.
3. Protection is provided for streams, streambanks, shorelines, lakes, wetlands and other bodies of
water from detrimental changes in water temperatures, blockages of water courses and deposits of
sediment, where harvests are likely to seriously and adversely affect water conditions or fish habitat
- Hydrologic function, water quality and fish habitat will not be adversely affected. See Resource
Protection Measures Common to all Action Alternatives, Chapter 2 (starting p. 81) and the hydrology
effects section (starting p. 201).
4. The harvesting system to be used is not selected primarily because it will give the greatest dollar
return or the greatest unit output of timber - Harvesting systems were selected based on a variety of
factors. The systems used to accomplish the purpose and need were proposed to most efficiently achieve
project objectives, minimize impacts to resources and took into account a variety of factors, including
reduced impacts to soils and reduced activity fuels, topography, cost and efficiency.
Additionally, the Project is consistent with 36 CFR 219.27c1 since all stands proposed for harvest treatment
under all alternatives are classified as suitable for timber harvest, and with 16USC 1604 (g)(3)(B) by
providing for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific
land area in order to meet overall multiple-use objectives. The project also provides diversity of tree species
similar to that existing in the region because species such as quaking aspen, black oak, ponderosa pine,
incense cedar, white fir and sugar pine will be retained, and a variety of treatments are proposed. Also, see
Executive Order 13186 on page I-9.

Forest Plan Consistency

H-12

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

In addition to the discussions of Forest Plan consistency previously presented in the individual resource
effects discussions, the incorporated resource reports, and in the compliance topics listed above, the project
meets the Forest Plan for the following presented in alphabetical order:

Aquatic Conservation Strategy Objectives 140
This section describes how the Elk Flat LSR Vegetation Project meets the objectives under the Aquatic
Conservation Strategy of the NWFP. 141
In summary, all action alternatives meet and do not prevent attainment of the ACS objectives. Differences to
the degree that the action alternatives meet these objectives varies with how well a) overstocked stands and
fuels are reduced over the project area; b) how well treatment within Riparian Reserves improves openings
for sunlight for riparian vegetation and c) how well floodplain processes and functions are restored. Although
Alternatives 2 and 3 do not optimize Riparian Reserve objectives as well as Alternative 1, they still meet and
do not prevent attainment of ACSO objectives.
The nine Aquatic Conservation Strategy (ACS) objectives follow with a description of likely effects from
each alternative.
1. Maintain and restore the distribution, diversity, and complexity of watershed and landscape-scale features
to ensure protection of the aquatic systems to which species, populations and communities are uniquely
adapted.
Alternative 1: The proposed treatment promotes stand health, open meadow and riparian plant
species distribution, diversity and complexity adding to a positive contribution towards watershed and
landscape-scale features.
Alternatives 2 and 3: Less ground disturbance from these alternatives would result in less slight soil
displacement to the ground surface. However, fewer stand and riparian health objectives will be met
by reducing access as fewer acres will be treated that would meet the purpose and need of the project.
2. Maintain and restore spatial and temporal connectivity within and between watersheds. Lateral,
longitudinal, and drainage network connections include floodplains, wetlands, upslope areas, headwater
tributaries, and intact refugia. These network connections must provide chemically and physically
unobstructed routes to areas critical for fulfilling life history requirements of aquatic and riparian-dependent
species.
Alternative 1: All treatments proposed in and surrounding floodplains are designed to benefit spatial
and temporal connectivity of streams. Some road closures and a ¼ mile of road decommissioning will
reduce road and stream interaction. Routes in Elk Flat cross the Swamp Creek intermittent channel
and will be decommissioned and floodplains restored.

Alternatives 2 and 3: Spatial and temporal connectivity may be slightly beneficial under Alternative
2 if no new temporary roads are constructed. However, the scale of new construction is so small that
likely there would be no measurable results.
3. Maintain and restore the physical integrity of the aquatic system, including shorelines, banks, and bottom
configurations.
Alternative 1: The aquatic system will be maintained and restored to increase the physical integrity
of instream structure and floodplain interaction. With the exception of restoration activity, there will
be no direct entry or effect upon channel banks or beds from harvest activity. Improvements to
aquatic system features are expected from restoring riparian plant vegetation and increasing bank
strength.
Alternatives 2 and 3: These alternatives will provide the same benefits to the aquatic system as
Alternative 1 for this objective.
4. Maintain and restore water quality necessary to support healthy riparian, aquatic, and wetland ecosystems.
Water quality must remain within the range that maintains the biological, physical, and chemical integrity of
the system and benefits survival, growth, reproduction, and migration of individuals composing aquatic and
riparian communities.
Alternative 1: Negligible effects to water quality are expected from project implementation with
BMP’s in place. Water quality should remain unaltered by harvest or fuel reduction activities, falling
within the known range of natural variability, as all activities are guided by BMPs designed to avoid
water quality impacts.
Alternatives 2 and 3: Some areas along Ash Creek would not benefit from the reduced surface
runoff resulting from reduced temporary road length under Alternative 2, as skid trail length would
increase. The No Action Alternative would show no improvements to water quality, as the current
condition is not supporting riparian vegetation productivity.
5. Maintain and restore the sediment regime under which aquatic ecosystems evolved. Elements of the
sediment regime include the timing, volume, rate, and character of sediment input, storage, and transport.
Alternative 1: Aside from increase in fine sediments likely to occur from increased traffic, no other
significant source of sediment from the proposed action alternatives is expected. The current regime
will continue.
Alternatives 2 and 3: Some areas along channels would not be accessed by temporary roads,
however, because of the small road area and proximity to creeks there would be relatively small
benefits from reduced surface runoff potentially carrying sediment under Alternative 2 as compared to
Alternative 1.
6. Maintain and restore instream flows sufficient to create and sustain riparian, aquatic, and wetland habitats
and to retain patterns of sediment, nutrient, and wood routing. The timing, magnitude, duration, and spatial
distribution of peak, high and low flows must be protected.
Alternative 1: The project is designed to improve riparian and floodplain function, however, effects
on flow regime will probably be neutral due to the larger watershed-scale influences being so much
greater than project results. Project disturbances, particularly road actions, are expected to be
insufficient to affect peak flow yield or timing.
Alternatives 2 and 3: Similar to Alternative 1, with slightly less ground disturbance, but due to the
scale, any benefits to instream flow would not be measurable.

7. Maintain and restore the timing, variability, and duration of floodplain inundation and water table elevation
in meadows and wetlands.
Alternative 1: Flow timing and yield will not be measurably altered, as stated under ACSO 6.
Floodplain processes and function should improve on a site-specific basis. A detectable change in
floodplain inundation should result from this alternative, and should benefit water table elevation
adjacent to the floodplain and channel.
Alternatives 2 and 3: Without temporary road construction, some slight benefit from treating a small
portion of the stands adjacent to channels would not be realized under this alternative; however, no
measurable difference in floodplain inundation or water table elevation would be detectable at this
small difference in lack of treatment resulting in shade retention inhibiting riparian plant growth.
8. Maintain and restore the species composition and structural diversity of plant communities in riparian areas
and wetlands to provide adequate summer and winter thermal regulation, nutrient filtering, appropriate rates
of surface erosion, bank erosion, and channel migration and to supply amounts and distributions of coarse
woody debris sufficient to sustain physical complexity and stability.
Alternative 1: This alternative proposes to treat the Riparian Reserves to improve stand health, create
openings to increase sunlight and restore floodplains. These efforts should result in many benefits to
ACSO 8. Channel bank integrity should improve with an increase in riparian root strength. Plant
diversity is expected to increase and eventually plant community should be improved in those riparian
areas treated, because of increased sunlight reaching the forest floor.
Alternatives 2 and 3: Similar to Alternative 1 with negligible differences from no temporary road
construction.
9. Maintain and restore habitat to support well-distributed populations of native plant, invertebrate and
vertebrate riparian-dependent species.
Alternative 1: Restoration of meadow, floodplains and stand health should maintain and restore
habitat as described under this ACSO objective. Most dense stands will be treated to improve
understory conditions and increase habitat for native plant, invertebrate and vertebrate ripariandependent species.
Alternatives 2 and 3: Similar to Alternative 1, there would be slightly more short-term benefit to
leaving the existing ground without temporary road construction to treat stand-health, however, these
are not the alternatives that would optimize the objectives that would meet the purpose and need of
the project and therefore would not optimize maintaining or restoring habitat under ACSO 9.

Ethnobotanical Resources/Special Forest Products
A Forest Plan Goal (p. 4.4) is to integrate multiple resource management on a landscape level to provide and
maintain diversity and quality of habitats that support viable populations of plants, fish and wildlife. The need
to promote community stability is addressed through the integration of multiple resource standards and
guidelines. Forest-wide Standards and Guidelines, Management Prescriptions and Management Area direction
help provide for safe use and enjoyment of various resources and production of goods and services (Forest
Plan p. 2.3). Additionally, the Forest has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Pit
River Tribe regarding communication and consultation protocol. The Forest has agreed to integrate cultural
resource considerations and traditional ecological knowledge into land and resource management decisions to
promote sustainable ecosystems (USDA-FS & Pit River Tribe, 2007). Ethnobotanical species/Special Forest
Products and unique habitats are considered at the project level in relation to the Forest Plan and in the spirit
of this agreement. The compliance Report (Posey, 2015) provides the analysis for Ethnobotanical

Resources/Special Forest Products and Unique Habitats. Information relevant to this decision is summarized
here.
Historically, Native Americans and settlers collected edible fruit such as strawberries, serviceberries, wild
plums, currents, gooseberries and mushrooms. Manzanita flowers and berries are edible and a tincture made
from the leaves used medicinally. Crushed, dried manzanita berries make a sweetener. Edible and medicinal
plants collected by Native Americans and others are mostly common throughout the project area, and
continue to be collected. Black oaks provide acorns, which are culturally important to Native Americans.
Most of these plants, except for black oak, are common throughout the project area. Effects of the project on
black oak are discussed in the Botany section starting on page 186.
Fungi are an important commercial special forest product. Spring collection permits are available late spring
or early summer depending on the weather and continue until the summer heat arrives and mushrooms are no
longer available. Fall collection permits are available in mid-October depending on the weather and continue
until it freezes or snows. Spring mushrooms include boletes and morels. Analysis for Boletus mushrooms in
Elk Flat begins on page 186. Morels (Morchella species) known to occur on the McCloud District include
Morchella sextelata and M. septimelata (black, black burn, pink and green morels). Habitat is solitary to
scattered, gregarious, or clustered, on burned soil in lightly to moderately burned montane coniferous forests;
common, sometimes fruiting in abundance in spring following a forest fire the previous year, in smaller
quantities in subsequent years, widely distributed (Desjardin, et al., 2015). 142 Morels are saprophytic
mushrooms meaning they decompose dead and dying material.
The design criteria to protect northern spotted owl (NSO) and goshawk habitat will also retain habitat for
many fungi species by using a variable density thinning prescription designed to retain tree and shrub species,
down woody debris, snags and overstory cover. The meadow prescription for Elk Flat will contain unthinned
patches and retain predominant conifer species. Prescriptions designs for underburning will produce a mosaic
pattern. This means that areas will burn in a way that produces a variety of burn intensities. These intensities
will range from areas that do not burn at all to areas that burn very hot. Some habitat for ectomycorrhizal
fungi will be degraded while other habitat may be improved. In either case, it will take time to reestablish the
mycorrhizal associations destroyed or disrupted. Morels benefit from disturbance especially fire.
Special forest products collected, besides mushrooms, include firewood, fence posts, tepee poles, cedar
boughs, collecting of plants for scientific study, wild-crafting of herbs, roots etc. for the health supplement
industry, cones and other plant parts for craft and floral industries. Cones are also collected for seeds. Permits
are required for the collection of special forest products. Collected species are mostly early seral, such as fruit
producing shrubs and Indian tobacco, and benefit from disturbance. More shade-loving species such as
Prince’s pine and wintergreen are more sensitive to the removal of overstory cover, ground disturbance and
underburning. Recovery time could take up to 20 years or longer depending on the treatment.
Thinning and burning will improve habitat for most species. Historically, all plant species coexisted with fire.
Most ethnobotanical plants have the ability to resprout after being damaged or have seeds in the soil that can
germinate. Effects to plants would be short lived (one to five years). The project design includes variable
silvicultural and fuels prescriptions, which would help maintain diverse stand characteristics. Resource
Protection Measures, SOPs and BMPs designed to provide protection for soils, maintain or improve
hydrological functions and improve and maintain wildlife habitat address ethnobotanical and special forest
products, consistent with the intent of the Forest Plan.

These are the most common mushrooms collected. There may be other species collected within the Elk project area.

Late Successional Reserve
Introduction
As described in Chapter 1, the NWFP describes that thinning or other silvicultural treatments 143 inside LSRs
may occur in stands up to 80 years of age if the treatments are beneficial to the creation and maintenance of
late-successional forest conditions. In reserves east of the Cascades and in Oregon and California Klamath
Provinces, additional management activities are allowed to reduce risks of largescale disturbance. Thinning or
other silvicultural activities must be reviewed by the Regional Ecosystem Office (REO) and the Regional
Interagency Executive Committee (RIEC). (NWFP page 8 and pages C-12, 13, and 26).
The NWFP describes that a management assessment should be prepared for each large LSR (or group of
smaller LSRs) before habitat manipulation activities are designed and implemented. In 1999, the Forest
prepared the Forestwide Late-Successional Reserve Assessment (LSRA), which met this requirement. The
LSRA activity design criteria identify specific objectives and criteria to ensure consistency with LSR
objectives. In their August 26, 1999 letter that documents review of the LSRA, the REO determined that the
silvicultural activities described in the LSRA were consistent with the standards and guidelines of the NWFP
and were exempted from further project-level REO review, which met the obligation of REO/RIEC review of
thinning or other silvicultural activities. In 2009, REO corrected and clarified portions of Activity Design
Criteria (ADC) #4 and #5.
The Elk LSR Enhancement project is designed to move the landscape toward the desired condition for the Elk
Flat LSR as guided by the visions, goals, strategies and design criteria embodied in the NWFP, the Forest
Plan, and the LSRA as described earlier in the EIS. The project is consistent with general objectives from the
LSRA, all of which fall under LSRA ADC 1 (Reforestation and revegetation), 4 (Thinning in early
successional pole and mid-successional stands - Hazard Related), 7, 9 and 10 (Fuel Reduction, Hazard
Reduction - Prescribed Burning and Manual and Mechanical Fuels Reduction) or Miscellaneous Activity 7
(Maintaining Hardwood Stands, forest openings, meadows, and glades). One of the proposed treatments in the
Elk LSR project requires REO review to ensure consistency with the NWFP due to Activity Design Criteria
#4 treatment standard “c”.
•

ADC #4 “c” calls for the treatment to increase diversity in relatively uniform stands by including
areas of variable spacing including up to 15% of the area to be in heavily thinned patches, or in
openings up to 1/4 acre in size. The Elk LSR Project proposes groups selects (“openings”) up to
about 2 acres 144 in six 40 to 50 year-old ponderosa pine plantations and two natural stands that
range from 80 to 120 years old.

In addition, some of the proposed treatments in the Elk LSR project will be evaluated against NWFP criteria
for risk reduction treatments in older stands.
•

The Elk LSR Project proposes to treat numerous stands 60-100 or 80-120 years old in order reduce
risks of large-scale disturbance. NWFP p. C-14 states that silvicultural activities aimed at reducing
risk shall focus on younger stands in LSR; younger stands are stands less than about 80 years old
(NWFP pp. C-12, 13). While risk-reduction efforts should generally be focused on young stands,
activities in older stands may be appropriate if: (1) the proposed management activities will clearly
result in greater assurance of long-term maintenance of habitat, (2) the activities are clearly needed

143

Stand and vegetation management of any kind, including prescribed burning, is considered a silvicultural treatment (NWFP S&G
p. C-12).

to reduce risks, and (3) the activities will not prevent the LSR from playing an effective role in the
objectives for which they were established (NWFP pp. C-12, 13).
The NWFP “Ecological Principles for Management of Late-Successional Forests” describes stand
management in LSRs: “Stand management in Late-Successional Reserves should focus on stands that have
been regenerated following timber harvest or stands that have been thinned. These include stands that will
acquire late-successional characteristics more rapidly with treatment, or are prone to fire, insects, diseases,
wind, or other disturbances that would jeopardize the reserve. Depending on stand conditions, treatments
could include, but should not be limited to: (1) thinning or managing the overstory to produce large trees;
release advanced regeneration of conifers, hardwoods, or other plants; or reduce risk from fire, insects,
diseases, or other environmental variables; (2) underplanting and limiting understory vegetation control to
begin development of multistory stands; (3) killing trees to make snags and coarse woody debris; (4)
reforestation; and (5) use of prescribed fire. Thinning prescriptions should encourage development of diverse
stands with large trees and a variety of species in the overstory and understory. Prescriptions should vary
within and among stands.” The LSRA identifies criteria, objectives, stand attributes and/or treatment stands to
meet these goals.

Openings Greater Than ¼ Acre within Thinned Stands
LSRA activity design criteria (ADC) #4 identifies objectives, stand attributes and treatment stands to meet the
NWFP goals and principles. ADC #4 treatment standard “c” calls for treatment to increase diversity in
relatively uniform stands by including areas of variable spacing including up to 15% of the area to be in
heavily thinned patches, or in openings up to 1/4 acre in size. The Revised Recovery Plan for the Northern
Spotted Owl (USDI-FWS, 2011) and the Revised Critical Habitat Rule for the Northern Spotted Owl (USDIFWS, 2012) both discuss utilizing ecological forestry techniques in the dry forest ecosystems to increase
stand resilience to stressors and potential influences from a changing climate. These techniques include
retaining and/or restoring spatial heterogeneity, species and structural diversity, and ecological processes
(Recovery Plan p. III-14, Final Rule, p. 71910). Other recent scientific research and literature science
describes the ecological forestry concept (Franklin, et al., 2007; Churchill, 2013; Franklin, et al., 2013; North,
et al., 2012). In line with the overall management direction contained in the LSRA and NWFP and
recommendations from recent science, the Elk LSR Project proposes various ecological forestry-based
treatments including variable density thinning (Carey, 2003; Franklin, et al., 2013; Franklin, et al., 2012;
Franklin, et al., 2013; Carey, 2003; North, et al., 2009; North, et al., 2012; Franklin, et al., 2012). Variable
density thinning does not include a singular density target, rather it retains a range of densities by including
unthinned patches (“ skips”), areas of heavy thinning or small openings or “gaps” (radial release of legacy
trees, structures or minor species, or group selections), and thinning within a target basal area range elsewhere
in the stand. Group selection treatments are proposed with the Elk LSR project that would create openings up
to about 2 acres within several of the stands proposed for thinning, which is larger than the ¼ acre openings
identified in the LSRA ADC 4 treatment standard “c”.
Two types of stands are proposed for thinning with group selection treatments: 40-50 year old ponderosa pine
plantations that primarily function as capable habitat for the northern spotted owl, and 80-120 year old natural
stands. The plantations consist of dense homogeneous stands of medium- and small-sized ponderosa pine
trees and in the natural stands, groups are proposed in dense homogeneous stands of white fir. 145 The six
plantation units have a minor amount of residual mixed-conifer that would either are placed in unthinned
patches. Units 152-1 and 160 contain areas of dense, homogenous white fir infected with Heterobasidion root
disease.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

This Purpose and Need section discusses why treatment activities are needed now to improve stand
composition, structure, density (in particular to develop species and age/size diversity in stands that lack
heterogeneity), and resilience with supporting analysis in the Chapter 3 Silviculture and Forest Health, Fire
and Fuels and Wildlife sections. Permitting the no action alternative to continue clearly results in further risk
to and loss of developing and existing late-successional stands in the Elk Flat LSR.
The group selections will allow the stands to develop and contribute a diversity component of species and to
increase vertical and horizontal complexity. Stand structure, tree size, layering and species composition,
presence of edges and small openings, and landscape position are all influential in habitat selection for the
northern spotted owl (Zabel, et al., 1995; Irwin, et al., 2012). The group selections would also help break up
the spread of Heterobasidion by reducing root-to-root contact and introducing other non-host species to the
stand (application of borate compound is also expected to reduce the overland infection of Heterobasidion).
The gaps and heterogeneity created by the groups will also help the stands better sustain natural disturbances
through higher resilience while increasing wildlife habitat heterogeneity and ecosystem function (North, et al.,
2012; Churchill, 2013). It is documented that irregular tree patterns, large openings, and resulting variation in
surface fuels can also reduce the potential for the spread of crown fire and help perpetuate variable post-fire
patterns (Churchill, 2013). Heterogeneous stand structures typically impede the buildup of epidemic insect
outbreaks (Churchill, 2013) and the variable density thinning treatments should also improve prey base and
foraging habitat for northern spotted owl, fisher and northern goshawk associated with various forest
conditions (North, et al., 2009).

Risk Reduction in Stands Older Than 80 Years Old
Introduction
The NWFP states that silvicultural activities aimed at reducing risk shall focus on younger stands in LSR and
younger stands are stands less than about 80 years old (NWFP pp. C-12, 13). While generally focused on
young stands, risk-reduction activities in older stands may be appropriate if they meet the three criteria listed
above and examined below. The Elk LSR Project proposes risk reduction treatments in stands ranging from
about 60 to 120 years of age.

Activities Are Clearly Needed To Reduce Risks and Clearly Result in Greater Assurance of
Long-Term Maintenance of Habitat
The EIS discusses how the activities are clearly needed to reduce risk and how proposed activities will result
in greater assurance of long term maintenance of habitat, particularly in the Purpose and Need, Silviculture
and Forest Health, Fire and Fuels and Wildlife sections; but also in the Hydrology and other areas. For
example, the Elk LSR has already experienced loss of overstory ponderosa pine trees ranging from 80 to 120
years old in the extensive mortality area and other smaller mortality patches and units, which has
continuously expanded since 2009. A fire start in the extensive mortality area and certain units in the
southeastern portion of the LSR (units 162, 176) would be of high intensity. Without action, further stand and
structural composition loss will result from the combination of continued overstocking and density-related
mortality, root disease, insect attacks and the predicted lethal fire effects with a resulting loss or decline in
habitat and failure to maintain or meet objectives for the LSR and surrounding stands. The same conditions
affecting successional development are also reducing the value of these stands as connectivity between and
within existing late-successional forest.
Based on the stand and fire effects modeling of no action vs. action, monitoring and results of similar
treatments in dry forest ecosystems and available research, the proposed project activities clearly result in
greater assurance of (short and) long-term protection and maintenance of late-successional habitat. Treatments
are expected to produce variable short-term reductions in tree density, canopy cover and layering, shrub cover,
snags down logs and coarse wood. However, the range of conditions that would provide utility for late
successional-associated species would be retained and enhanced post-treatment.

Stand-level spatial pattern exerts an influence on key aspects of resilience and ecosystem function, such as
disturbance behavior, regeneration, snow retention, and habitat quality in frequent-fire pine and mixed-conifer
forests (Churchill, 2013). After treatment, the plantations and natural stands in the LSR would have a greater
capacity to adapt and thrive in the face of natural disturbances and large scale threats to sustainability (North,
et al., 2012; Churchill, 2013). The specific kinds of treatment, and their placement, in these early and midsuccessional stands are intended to help develop late successional habitat and mid-to-late successional stands
persist and mature into late successional/old growth.
Under Alternative 1, thinning, underburning, key group selections (described above) and radial thinning
would occur in the LSR, intermixed with areas that will not be mechanically treated (unthinned patches or
high quality habitats set aside, with exception of underburning). Treated stands would emphasize retention
and promotion of under-represented species such as Douglas fir, sugar pine, black oak and aspen. Douglas fir
and black oak are known to provide high habitat utility for northern spotted owl (Irwin et. al 2013) and are
considered important for fisher denning, resting and prey base; “with their often broken tops or large cavities,
oaks are used by small mammals, forest carnivores, and raptors for resting, denning and nesting” (North, et
al., 2009).
Fisher, northern goshawk and spotted owls depend on a forest structure and setting usually dominated by
large trees, snags, and down logs that provide suitable substrate for nesting, roosting, denning and rest sites.
Snags and large tree-fall that create canopy gaps enable establishment of multiple tree layers and diverse
species composition. Trees with physical imperfections such as cavities, broken tops and large deformed
limbs are also desired for late-successional characteristics (NWFP p. B-5) and specific species reproductive
and rearing needs (North, et al., 2009). The thinning prescriptions in the Elk LSR project emphasize leaving
all predominant and most dominant trees; healthy large overstory dominant trees of all species; healthy pine
of any size where pine is underrepresented; a component of healthy small understory and midstory trees; a
component of heavily damaged or diseased trees that provide habitat; and all hardwood trees as operationally
feasible. Large snags and down logs and multiple canopy layers (where conditions allow) will be retained
consistent with the project’s design and resource protection measures, which were specifically tailored to meet
the desired future condition in the LSR, and based on LSRA guidance and best available science regarding
species’ habitat requirements. Variable density thinning will retain a range of densities by including skips,
gaps, and thinning within a range of basal areas, promoting resilience and heterogeneity. As displayed in
Table 36 (p. 132) and described in the Silvicultural and Forest Health and Wildlife sections of this EIS,
thinning will accelerate individual tree growth and increase crown width and depth, 146 as well as foliage
density and needle length. This will contribute to desirable wildlife tree characteristics by providing
conditions such as fuller crowns, larger boles and branches, and over time, larger trees with cavities or that
contribute to larger snags and down wood. Combined, these components will provide important decadence
and late-successional/old-growth habitat characteristics in the LSR.
Within the LSR thinning units, the unthinned patches, larger high-quality foraging areas, and rest/roost
clumps would retain thermal and visual cover, natural suppression and mortality, small trees, natural size
differentiation, and undisturbed debris, as well as large trees, decadent trees, large snags, large downed logs,
and dense and/or multilayered forest attributes. Other larger areas of no-mechanical thinning have been
prioritized for retention, though would be underburned in accordance with the design criteria (e.g. units 150,
154, 156, 182 and others, and areas in the Ash Creek riparian reserve.). Retention of these areas will help
146 “

Width and Depth” - Increased light or space among trees enables the lower branches on the crown to remain alive and not be
shaded out by adjacent trees. Thus, tree crowns expand in width as branches grow longer and thicker. Tree crown length increases
as low branches remain alive and height growth continues. Growth in the stem and branches of trees is also accelerated by thinning
because foliage density or leaf area within the crown increases and crown length is maintained or increased. This increase in leaf
area enables trees to increase their photosynthesis; consequently, they have the resources to increase stem and branch diameter or
volumes.

retain diverse forest structure and functioning at the stand and landscape scale. This is one element of an
overall spatial and temporal strategy to retain high quality habitat function on the LSR landscape and address
forest change over time in other portions of the LSR in the advent of disturbance events.
For example, in most thinned foraging habitat for the northern spotted owl, when combined with the roost/rest
clump retention and unthinned patches, basal areas of 125-200+ sqft/acre, conifer and hardwood species
diversity, large trees and snags, down wood, 40-60 percent or more canopy cover, mid and understory
layering and vertical and horizontal heterogeneity will be well within the range of stand conditions frequently
used by owls (Irwin, et al., 2012; Irwin, et al., 2007). In 27 acres of black oak release in foraging habitat, basal
area would be lower with a short-term adverse effect to foraging habitat elements of critical habitat (PCE3),
and a long-term benefit to species diversity and stand complexity. The project design and resource protection
measures retain the largest oldest trees (predominants and dominants) that exhibit old-growth characteristics
such as large boles, decadent branching, cavities and flattened tops, safety permitting. In treated and untreated
areas of stands, large decadent trees, snags, and down logs (including those that may be used for denning
and/or resting furbearers, nesting northern spotted owl or northern goshawk); large and small down wood that
contributes to subnivean areas for fisher and Pacific marten in the winter to find prey and cover, plucking
posts for northern goshawk and prey species habitat; and shrub and ground cover for prey species would be
maintained and promoted.

Activities Will Not Prevent the LSR from Playing an Effective Role in Established Objectives
The Elk Flat LSR was identified as an area of important late-successional habitat during the mapping efforts
undertaken for the Northwest Forest Plan (Johnson, 1991; LSRA, 1999). The LSR’s origins are as a habitat
conservation area under the Interagency Scientific Committee’s northern spotted owl management strategy
(LSRA, p. 124). At the time the LSR was established, it was occupied by one pair of northern spotted owls in
the ST-215 activity center. This activity center has not been occupied by a single territorial individual or pair,
or a reproducing pair since 1990 (see the Wildlife section for a summary, and the project wildlife Biological
Assessment in the online project record for a detailed survey account).
The project treatments will affect 100 percent of the suitable (nesting, roosting, foraging) and capable habitat
in the home range and core of the ST-215 activity center. These effects are a combination of: habitat benefit in
nesting/roosting from the reintroduction of low-intensity prescribed fire and transitioning capable stands
toward more resilient dispersal and foraging habitat; maintaining foraging habitat function with a reduced
quality over an approximate 10-20 year timespan; and downgrading foraging habitat to dispersal quality over
a 10-30 year timespan in a minor percentage of the home range to increase hardwood diversity and retain
predominant legacy pine.
Prioritization for treatment types and locations within the home range of this ‘historic unoccupied’ activity
center closely followed the prioritization criteria recommended under Recovery Action 10 in the Revised
Recovery Plan USDI-FWS pp. III-44 to III-47. The Forest also consulted with the FWS on more specific
prioritization for this Project to meet the intent of Recovery Action 10, as well as Recovery Action 32 (in
accordance with the Forest Plan standards and guidelines at p. 4-30). Similarly, prioritization of treatment
types and location (or designating no-treatment areas) was done for the northern goshawk and the fisher, two
species known to occur and reproduce in the Elk Flat LSR. Though not stated in the LSRA, the Elk Flat LSR
is expected to only provide for one pair of northern spotted owls in the future, or more likely, to provide an
important area for dispersing young northern spotted owls to reside in temporarily. This is largely driven by
the fact that 60 percent of the home range is situated in private land ownership managed for timber production
and the overall ponderosa-pine dominated stands in the LSR.
The ability to move across the landscape is important to the long-term persistence and viability of some
wildlife species, and is particularly important to these late-successional habitat-associated species. As
described in the NWFP, movement or dispersal across the landscape is provided by large blocks of lateShasta-McCloud Management Unit

successional habitat in the LSR/MLSA network, and through management objectives and various land
allocations between them. Those management objectives and land allocations include riparian reserves,
administratively withdrawn areas, and management prescriptions for retention of old-growth fragments in
Matrix allocation and 100-acre LSRs. Connectivity is a measure of the extent of which the landscape pattern
of the late-successional and old-growth ecosystem provides for biological and ecological flows that sustain
late-successional and old-growth associated animal and plant species. It does not necessarily mean that latesuccessional and old-growth areas have to be physically joined in space, because many late-successional
associated species can move across areas that are not in late-successional ecosystem conditions. Within the
Elk Flat LSR, the treatments are expected to protect and enhance connectivity within and between stands. The
surrounding private lands and large areas of pine-dominated forests (plantations and natural stands) on NFS
lands do not provide highly suitable connective habitat for the northern spotted owl, though individual
dispersing young from other LSRs or activity centers may be able to access the LSR (map 4 in the Biological
Assessment displays habitat in the action area, including dispersal and connective habitat on private and NFS
lands). Conversely, the northern goshawk and fisher are less dependent on species composition and cover
requirements for dispersing (and foraging), and the areas within and outside the LSR; forest stands, shrub
habitats, riparian reserves and streamside protection zones on private lands are expected to continue
contributing to connectivity.
Late-successional habitat in the Elk Flat LSR in 1999 comprised a relative large proportion of the capable
land base, 46 percent (LSRA p. 125). Again as described in Chapter 1, and the relevant resource sections of
Chapter 3, delaying or taking no action in the project area leaves the LSR at continued risk of substantial
habitat loss. The project’s thinning and fuels treatment designs, areas delineated for no mechanical treatment
and measures to maintain and protect important habitat components will contribute to: 1) continued function
for late-successional associated species use occurring now or in the future, 2) increased diversity and
resilience of existing and developing early and mid-successional habitat, and 3) reduced risk of loss and
increased connectivity within and between stands.
As such, the project activities will not prevent the Elk Flat LSR from playing an effective role for which it
was established. The proposed actions in the LSR will help accelerate development of late-successional
characteristics, will contribute to increased connectivity and resilience of late-successional habitat in the LSR,
and will help reduce the risk of large scale habitat loss while maintaining important current habitat areas,
attributes, and functions. This will be achieved by not treating current high quality late-successional habitat
stands and patches within stands that provide cover, layering and density; retaining important legacy
components such as roosting and resting structures, large snags, large down wood, and large trees with
cavities and decadence; retaining multiple canopy layers (where these conditions currently exist); and varying
the thinning prescriptions within and between stands based on species composition to increase individual tree
and stand resilience and to promote spatial heterogeneity through openings contrasted with dense forest areas.
These treatments are expected to protect and enhance the current habitat function and quality for the northern
spotted owl, fisher and northern goshawk in approximately 70 percent of the LSR, and 100 percent of the
areas where habitat for these species currently exists. Actions taken under the preferred alternative will
increase the probability that large-scale habitat loss will not continue, but also retain stand elements and
conditions more representative of endemic insects, disease and mortality.

Management Indicator Assemblage
The Forest Plan directs resource managers to monitor assemblage habitat trends at the National Forest scale
(Forest level; Forest Plan 1995 page 5-16). The Forest Plan identifies management indicator assemblages for
monitoring; it does not identify management indicator species but does list examples of representative species
for each assemblage. The Forest has selected specific species to represent the management indicator
assemblages. These species were selected based on research concerning their habitat preferences (California
Wildlife Habitat Relationship system and Birds of North America online), the range of the species, and the
H-22

Shasta-Trinity National Forest

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

availability of good quality data on the Forest. These three factors had to be met for the Forest area in order
for a species to be selected.
A project-level Management Indicator Assemblage (MIA) Report was completed and is incorporated by
reference (Jordan, 2015e). Information relevant to the decision to be made is summarized here. The projectlevel analysis reviews the Forest Plan requirements for monitoring management indicators and analyzes
project effects on management indicator assemblages for a representative species of each assemblage affected.
The analysis addressed Alternative 1 in detail, which is the modified proposed action and preferred
alternative, as it affects the most assemblage habitat.
The project-level report determined that Alternative 1 (and all action alternatives considered in detail) would
affect five assemblage habitats: openings and early seral, late seral, snag and down log, hardwood, and
riparian (defined in Table 1 of the MIA Report). The Nashville warbler was analyzed as a representative
species of the openings and early seral assemblage because it is found in all of the openings and early seral
assemblage CWHR types and is strongly associated with specific habitat components that define the
assemblage. The brown creeper was analyzed as a representative species of the late seral assemblage because
it is found in all of the late seral assemblage CWHR types and is strongly associated with specific habitat
components that define the assemblage. The red-breasted nuthatch was analyzed as a representative species of
the snag and down log assemblage because it is strongly associated with specific habitat components that
define the assemblage (i.e., snags). The white-breasted nuthatch was analyzed as a representative species of
the hardwood assemblage because it is strongly associated with specific habitat components that define the
assemblage. The yellow warbler was analyzed as a representative species of the riparian assemblage because
it is strongly associated with specific habitat components that define the assemblage. All of these species
occur in the project area 147and additional population data of high reliability are available for these species,
which is tracked and compiled at the Forest level.148
The other three wildlife management indicator assemblages would not be affected by the project because it
either does not occur within project units or the project contains measures to not treat elements of the
assemblage (chaparral; cliffs, caves, talus, and rock outcrops) or there would be no effect to the proportion of
assemblage habitats available (multi-habitat). There are no aquatic management indicator assemblages or
species (MIS) that would be affected by the project, as there is no suitable habitat and the project area is
outside the Forest’s fish MIS range (Forest Plan, 1995 p. 3.11).
While treatments would result in changes to five management indicator assemblage habitats by reducing
canopy closure and cover, tree densities and snag/down log density (notably in the Extensive Mortality Area
and Hazard Reduction Zones on approximately 166 acres), treated areas would continue to provide the same
quantity and distribution of each assemblage type after the project is completed. Hardwood quantity and
quality (approximately 78 acres of California black oak and aspen) and riparian vegetation within the riparian
assemblage component along Ash Creek (approximately 30 acres) are currently found intermixed within the
late seral and openings and early seral assemblages. While the quality of these assemblages would be
increased over the short-term, the quantity would not change. Even with the short-term reduction in snag and
down log assemblage, and slight increase in hardwood and riparian quality, the project is not likely to result in

Point count surveys for migratory and resident bird species were conducted in the project area in 2013 and 2014. These surveys
will be continued in 2016 and after implementation.

The Forest compiles Breeding Bird Survey data (BBS) for the representative species, and reports them at the regional
(BBS strata), California, and range-wide scales. Four BBS strata occur on the Forest. BBS data have varying degrees of
reliability based upon sample size. Representative species selected for Forest level tracking have data with the highest
reliability in at least one of the four strata that occur on the Forest.

any meaningful change to population trends or habitat availability for the red-breasted nuthatch or whitebreasted nuthatch at the project or Forest scale.
As described in the existing condition section of Chapter 1, and the MIA report, the 3,519-acre project area
contains abundant snag and down log assemblage habitat due to overstocking, ongoing root disease and insect
outbreaks. Reducing the current snag and down log assemblage on 166 acres in the short-term is considered
discountable when compared to the existing snag and down log assemblage habitat within the project area that
would not be treated. The short-term reduction of this habitat in the specific areas of the project will also not
limit the availability of the snag and down log assemblage in the project area for the red-breasted nuthatch.
Over the short- and long-term, additional snags are expected to remain and develop in this area and will
remain on the landscape until they fall, contributing to the down log assemblage. Over the short-term, habitat
suitability is expected to increase for the white-breasted nuthatch and yellow warbler as the thinning, release
and riparian vegetation planting treatments increase the quality and quantity of hardwood components of
black oak and aspen, and riparian assemblage habitat along Ash Creek.
The affected assemblages will not be modified such that there is an immediate shift to another assemblage
(e.g., late seral will not be treated such that it becomes openings and early seral post-treatment, snag and
down log assemblage will not be wholly eliminated, and while hardwood and riparian assemblages will
increase, they will not replace another assemblage). As there will be no conversion from one assemblage to
another, there are no cumulative effects. Even if potential indirect effects are realized, they are not expected to
meaningfully influence project-level habitat trends for the assemblages. Considering the best available
population data and Forest-level habitat trends, as well as ongoing habitat influences from wildfire and private
timber harvest, the project is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends or habitat
availability for the Nashville warbler, brown creeper, red-breasted nuthatch, white-breasted nuthatch, or
yellow warbler at the Forest-wide scale (Jordan 2015e).

Survey and Manage (S&M)
Guidance under the Northwest Forest Plan and Forest Plan require the Forest Service to analyze projects for
potential impacts to Survey and Manage species. Survey and Manage requirements were originally
established to address little-known species believed to be associated with old-growth and late-successional
forest microsite habitats, and for which species experts were unsure that the Late-Successional Reserve (LSR)
network would be sufficient to provide for the conservation of the species.
All project activities are compliant with direction regarding the Survey and Manage standards and guidelines
issued by Regional Foresters’ Connaughton and Moore (Connaughton, et al., 2014). This direction was issued
pursuant the district court’s remedy order issued on February 18, 2014 (Conservation Northwest v. Bonnie,
W.WA No. C08-1067-and other Mitigation Measure Standards and Guidelines (USDA-FS & USDI-BLM,
2001) [or 2001 ROD].
Certain project activities are exempt from the May 13, 2014 direction, as stipulated by Judge Pechman
(Pechman, 2006). These include activities that: (a) thin stands younger than 80 years old; (b) replace culverts
on roads that are in use and part of the road system, or remove culverts if the road is temporary or to be
decommissioned; (c) riparian and stream improvements where the riparian work is riparian planting,
obtaining material for placing in-stream, and road or trail decommissioning, and where the stream
improvement work is the placement large wood, channel and floodplain reconstruction, or removal of channel
diversions; and (d) the portions of a project involving hazardous fuel treatments where prescribed fire is
applied. Any portion of a hazardous fuel treatment project involving commercial logging will remain subject
to the survey and management requirements except for thinning of stands younger than 80 years old under
subparagraph (a) above.

Survey and Manage Fauna
A Survey and Manage Report for terrestrial wildlife and aquatic species was completed for the project and is
incorporated by reference (Jordan, 2015d). Information relevant to the decision to be made is summarized
here. The project area falls outside the range, or contains no suitable habitat for, all Survey and Manage fauna
species listed on the 2003 Annual Species Review list except for the Shasta hesperian, Chace sideband snail
and great gray owl (Burke, et al., 1999; Duncan, 2005; Quintana-Coyer, et al., 2004).
Based on extensive protocol surveys for terrestrial and aquatic mollusks (Furnish, et al., 1997; Duncan, et al.,
2003) conducted on 33,000 acres between 1999 and 2010 on the Management Unit, the Shasta hesperian was
only found within riparian habitat and the chace sideband snail was only observed within the Shasta and Little
Shasta River Drainages (Crumpton, et al., 2011). Surveys completed in the Elk Flat LSR Enhancement
Project area for these two species between 2007 and 2010 did not detect either species and there are no known
sites in the project area.
The project area lacks perennial streams and the preferred riparian vegetation for the Shasta hesperian, though
the intermittent channel of Ash Creek may provide some level of potential suitable habitat. There will be
treatments in Riparian Reserves under all action alternatives. The project includes design features and
protection measures that limit disturbance to potential habitat and maintain microsite habitat conditions for
this species (e.g., riparian canopy cover and large coarse wood will be maintained, water quality BMPs,
limited disturbance to riparian areas/riparian vegetation during thinning and burning operations, and
equipment exclusion within 20 or more feet of Ash Creek). This is consistent with the species management
recommendations (Burke, et al., 1999).
The project area contains potential suitable habitat for the Chace sideband of dry conifer and mixed conifer
with oak. There are limited talus piles and outcrops within Elk Flat that may provide refugia. The project
includes protection measures that either prohibit equipment use on talus slopes or maintain microsite habitat
conditions such as large coarse wood and uncompacted forest litter. This is consistent with the species
management recommendations (Duncan, 2005).
Pre-disturbance surveys are not required for the great gray owl (GGO) in the California Cascades (QuintanaCoyer, et al., 2004) and no project-level surveys have been completed. There have been no aural or visual
detections of this species in the project area during the 14 years of active survey efforts between 1990-2015
for the northern spotted owl or other fieldwork done for the project. There are no verifiable observations
recorded in or near the project area ( (NRIS, 2014; CDFW, 2015). While transient GGOs may utilize the Elk
Flat area for foraging or potential nesting, on average, deep snows likely limit use and access to prey. The
project includes provisions for nest site protections in the event of a new discovery and this is consistent with
management recommendations for this species.
Within the project area, there are no known sites of any Survey and Manage wildlife species on the 2003
Annual Species Review list. The project design and resource protection measures include management
guidelines for the two terrestrial mollusks with suitable habitat, and the project contains measures for any new
discoveries of great gray owl. These measures are consistent with the May 13, 2014 direction and these
species’ management recommendations.

Survey and Manage Vascular Plants, Bryophytes, Lichens and Fungi
A Supplemental Botany Report was completed for project (Posey, 2015) and is incorporated by reference.
Surveys were completed for S&M bryophytes including Ptilidium californicum (Pacific fuzzwort), a Category
A bryophyte. There are seven known tree sites for Pacific fuzzwort in units 150, 157 and 159. Pacific
fuzzwort sites will be buffered to protect them from underburning. RPMs in place for maintaining and
improving wildlife habitat, protecting soils and maintaining or improving hydrological function will also help
to maintain and improve habitat for survey and manage fungi species.
Shasta-McCloud Management Unit

H-25

Elk Flat LSR Enhancement Project

Predisturbance Surveys for Category B fungi are not required because old growth stands will not be affected
by this project. Random grid S&M fungi surveys were done in the NW Forest Plan national forests, including
the Shasta-Trinity, in 2001 and 2002. Fungi known site revisits were completed for permanent plots in the
California NWFP area from 2005-2010. Additional purposive surveys for Category B S&M fungi were done
in the California Cascades physiographic province, which includes the Shasta-McCloud Management Unit,
from 2011-2013 (Hoover, et al., 2015).
There is one known site for Mycena overholtsii, a Category B fungi in unit 150 and one site for Cantharellus
subalbidus (white chanterelle), a Category D fungi, in unit 165. The site in unit 150 is protected from all
activities including underburning and the site in unit 165 is within an unthinned patch and will have a cool,
light underburn. Individual legacy old growth trees and large woody debris will be retained.
Should new S&M bryophyte, fungi, lichen or vascular plant species be found before or during project
implementation, protection measures will be put into place to protect the species and its habitat. Generally,
this will involve the “flag and avoid” approach. If monitoring after burning shows damage to a Pacific
fuzzwort population, the buffer distance for other populations will increase depending on the type and extent
of the damage.

Vegetation Diversity
The Forest Plan (p. 4.14) directs provision for and maintenance of at least five percent of each timber/type
seral stage combination shown in the Forest Plan on Table 4-3. The Forest Plan also has special direction for
Matrix Lands for fifth field watersheds in which federal forest lands are currently comprised of 15 percent or
less of late-successional forest (p. 4.63). The Elk project area is located within the Ash Creek 5th-order
watersheds. The Silviculture Report (Payne, 2015b) provides a vegetation diversity analysis. Information
relevant to this decision is summarized here.

Seral Stage Diversity
As Table Appendix I-2 illustrates, there is less than five percent vegetation in seral stage: 1 - grass/forb, 4a Large tree, less than 40 percent canopy closure, and 4c – large tree, older, greater than 40 percent canopy
closure. Silviculture treatments in the project will not appreciably change the current seral distribution in the
Ash Creek watershed under any action alternatives. Thinning will shift some stands from seral stage 4b to 4a
for approximately one to two decades until residual tree canopies reoccupy thinning space. Treatments will
promote stand resiliency and accelerate development of larger overstory trees, promoting the development of
4c/older stands over time.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement

Acreages and percentages reflect all Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land within the Ash Creek watershed. Other ownerships in the
watershed (including 8,207 acres on the Klamath National Forest) are not reflected.

Silviculture treatments in the Elk LSR Enhancement project will not appreciably change the current seral
distribution in the Ash Creek watershed. Thinning will shift some stands from seral stage 4b to 4a for
approximately one to two decades until residual tree canopies reoccupy thinning space. Treatments will
promote stand resiliency and accelerate development of larger overstory trees, promoting the development of
4c/older stands over time.
Thinning from below would not change the vegetation type in Alternatives 1 through 3. The majority of
dominant and co-dominate trees would be retained and average tree diameter would increase with the removal
of smaller diameter trees from the understory. Thinning treatments would reduce canopy cover sufficient to
warrant a change in the density classification for some stands.
Radial thinning around large predominant pine would reduce canopy cover in small areas and create more
variable density within treatment units, but would not change stand seral class.
Oak release treatment in Alternatives 1 through 3 would occur in seral stage 4b. Given the limited removal to
overstory conifer and retention of predominant and some dominant conifers within the oak release radius, the
successional or seral stage classification would not be changed.
Aspen release would occur on approximately 18 acres in seral stage 4a stand in Alternatives 1 through 3.
Removal of most conifers within the aspen release would reduce canopy cover in the short term but not
change the seral stage or vegetation type.
Recent pine mortality from insects and disease in the project area in all age classes is reverting areas up to
several acres in size to a seral stage 1. Most mortality is occurring in seral stage 4b stands. Larger mortality
pockets (generally 5 acres or larger) and group selections in Alternatives 1 through 3 would be reforested.
Because they are few, scattered and small (2 acres or less), group selections do not cause a change in seral
stage at the stand level. Reforestation would occur on approximately 228 acres in Alternatives 1 and 2, and on
219 acres in Alternative 3.
Table Appendix B-1 summarizes the effects to seral stages as a result of treatments in Alternative 1 (the
Alternative with the most amount of treatments) as identified in the seral stage analysis of existing conditions.

Watershed Level Late Successional Forest
This section provides an assessment of the current condition of late-successional forest on Shasta-Trinity
National Forest land within the Ash Creek watersheds.
There are 5,555 acres (7%) of National Forest land within the watershed that have been identified as not
capable of supporting late-successional forest (see table A4). These areas are mostly occupied by lava flows
and rocky areas that support few to none scattered conifers. Meadows and sagebrush vegetation are included
in this category.
There are 73,650 acres (93%) of Shasta-Trinity National Forest land within the watershed that have been
identified as capable of supporting late-successional forest (see table A4). Of this acreage of capable land, a
total of 41,959 acres (57%) are currently occupied by forest types that meet the criteria of late-successional
forest.
For purposes of this assessment, the determination of late-successional forest follows definitions used in the
FEMAT report 149. Late-successional forest status was assigned into two subsets by correlating CalVeg forest
typing with the following descriptions and criteria:
•

Mature forest – those forest stands generally greater than 80 years of age but not meeting the old-growth
definition. For this assessment, all current 3N and 3G stands not planted after 1940 as well as 4N and 4G
stands were classified as mature forest.

•

Old-growth forest – Forest stands 5N and 5G (overstory tree class 40). Large overstory diameter and
high canopy cover correlated to old-growth characteristics including: large trees, multi-layered canopies,
decadence, large snags and down logs.

Table Appendix I-4 summarizes the categorization of the watershed into capable and non-capable lands in
terms of ability to support late-successional forest. The table further separates late-successional forest into
mature and old-growth forest subsets.

Mature Forest
Mature late-successional forest occurs on 41,862 acres or 53 percent of Shasta-Trinity National Forest land
within the watershed. This represents 57 percent of all lands capable of supporting late-successional forest.
Left unmanaged and in light of roughly 100 years of active fire suppression, mature late-successional forest
conditions within the watershed tend to develop dense, overstocked forest conditions. Under these conditions,
trees grow increasingly stressed for resources and high fuel loads develop making forests increasingly
susceptible to catastrophic events such as wildfire and insect attack. Present day active timber management is
used to reduce stand densities to healthy, more sustainable levels and to reduce fuel loads. As a result, most
forest stands classified as mature late-successional forest have had some form of timber harvest in the past.
Old-Growth Forest
Old-growth forests are estimated to occur on 97 acres or less than 0.2 percent of Shasta-Trinity National
Forest land within the watershed. Field surveys within the project area indicated that some mature stands
contain isolated elements of older late-successional forest (for example, few scattered “remnant” trees over
150 years old) and it’s inferred there may be some older successional components in other mature stands in
the watershed however these stands do not meet overall criteria as old-growth.
Most existing old-growth late-successional forest in the watershed occurs on rough or steep terrain that was
difficult to access or harvest in the past. Due to the lack of past management activities, existing old-growth
forest stands are typically overstocked with dense understory vegetation and heavy fuel loads. These stands
are susceptible to catastrophic events such as wildfire, insect attack and disease.
Compliance
Thinning in dense mid and late successional natural stands would reduce canopy cover and increase average
stand diameters at the project level. While there is a minor component of distinct older trees with old-growth
characteristics within some treatment stands, overstory trees are generally between 60 – 120 years old with
most trees being less than 100 years old. Canopy reduction from thinning would shift approximately 400
acres of stands currently typed as a density 4N to 4P for the near term. Many of these stands are near the
division between density class 4N and 4P; thinning would drop the density to 4P in these stands for
approximately 10 to 20 years until residual tree canopies expand.
Treatments would increase the percent of mature (and old growth) late-successional forest faster over the long
term by promoting the growth of large diameter overstory trees within a mosaic of variable density and
structural diversity. Additionally, treatments would increase stand resiliency to natural disturbances,
increasing the likelihood that residual overstory trees would persist and develop into late successional stands.
Thinning treatments would retain all of the predominant trees as well as the majority of the dominant trees.
While trees would be retained in all size classes to retain and promote structural diversity, removal would be
focused on suppressed and intermediate trees as well as codominant trees adjacent and subsidiary to retained
overstory trees. Thinning would increase average stand diameters but not change the age classes on the
landscape.

Overall, for Alternatives 1 through 3 the percent of capable land occupied by forest types that meet the criteria
of late-successional forest will remain at approximately 53 percent in the Ash Creek watershed.

Visual Quality Objectives
The Forest Plan provides standards and guidelines for the visual (scenery) resource utilizing the Visual
Management System (VMS) to reduce impacts to visual resources (scenery) caused by management activities.
Visual Quality Objectives (VQO’s) were established for areas seen from travel routes and management areas
indicate allowable changes to scenery resulting from management activities.
A Scenery Analysis Report (Joyce, 2014) was prepared for the project and is incorporated by reference. The
proposed silviculture treatments and fuel activities were analyzed as seen from Pilgrim Creek Road [Forest
Road 13 (41N13)] and Forest Road 19 (41N19). The routes are not sensitive for scenery per the Forest Plan,
but both routes may be socially sensitive since they are used by winter recreationists and visitors accessing
some of the Mt. Shasta trailheads. The VQO indicator for Pilgrim Creek Road is “Modification” and the VQO
indicator for Forest Road 19 is “Modification to Maximum Modification.” To reduce visual impacts of the
proposed project in the foreground views of Pilgrim Creek Road due to the high number of people who use
the route, a RPM will be implemented:
The following design features are prescribed within a 150-foot visual corridor adjacent to Pilgrim Creek
Road. This visual corridor would apply to units 16-115, 106, 107, 123, 125, 157, 159, 180, 162, 176, 179,
347, and 401.
•

Use existing landings and locate new landings out of view as seen from the roads where feasible.

•

Stump height will be 6 inches or less (if a landscape feature obstructs the view between the road and
the cut trees, stump height maybe higher).

•

Cut and/or leave trees will be marked on the sides facing away from the roads. Prior to treatment,
further measures such as flagging of individual leave trees may be implemented to assure operators
can clearly identify leave trees.

•

The goal within the visual corridor is to have a clean look by removing the majority of the slash and
woody debris with the least amount of ground disturbance. This may be accomplished by: lopping
and scattering if there are not large amounts of residual slash, as generally occurs with whole treeyarding; hand piling and burning excess slash and scattering the burn pile residue that is not fully
consumed and/or machine piling the slash outside of the visual corridor.

The proposed treatments for Alternatives 1, 2 and 3 are very similar from a scenery perspective; differences
are comparatively negligible. All action alternatives would be consistent with the Forest Plan VQO map.
