Corpus Christi Liquefaction, LLC and
Cheniere Corpus Christi Pipeline, LP
Docket Nos. CP12-507-000
CP12-508-000
TO THE PARTY ADDRESSED:
The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission)
has prepared a draft environmental impact statement (EIS)for the Corpus Christi LNG
Proj
ect (Proj
ect), proposed by Corpus Christi Liquefaction, LLC and Cheniere Corpus
Christ Pipeline, LP (collectively Cheniere)in the above-referenced dockets. Cheniere
requests authorization to construct and operate the facilities necessary to import, export,
store, vaporize, and liquefy natural gas and deliver the resulting product either into
existing interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines in the Corpus Christi area, or export
liquefied natural gas (LNG)elsewhere.
The draft EIS assesses the potential environmental effects of the construction and
operation of the Proj
ect in accordance with the requirements of the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The FERC staff concludes that approval of the
proposed Proj
ect, with the mitigation measures recommended in the EIS, would ensure
that impacts in the Proj
ect area would be avoided or minimized and would not be
significant. Construction and operation of the Proj
ect would result in mostly temporary
and short-term environmental impacts;however, some long-term and permanent
environmental impacts would occur.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE), U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT)participated as cooperating agencies in the preparation of the EIS.
Cooperating agencies have j
urisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to
resources potentially affected by the proposal and participate in the NEPA analysis. The
U.S. Coast Guard, EPA, and DOT cooperated in the preparation of this EIS because of
their special expertise with respect to resources potentially affected by the proposal.
Although the cooperating agencies provide input to the conclusions and
recommendations presented in the draft EIS, the agencies will present their own
conclusions and recommendations in their respective Records of Decision or
determinations for the Proj
ect.

The draft EIS addresses the potential environmental effects of the construction and
operation of the following Proj
ect facilities:
 liquefaction facilities, including three liquefaction trains capable of
producing 782 million British thermal units (MMBtu)per year of LNG;
 vaporization facilities, including two trains of ambient air vaporizers and
send out pumps capable of vaporizing sufficient LNG volume for each to
send out 200 MMBtu per day of natural gas;
 LNG storage facilities, including three LNG storage tanks each capable of
storing 160,000 cubic meters of LNG;
 marine terminal with two LNG carrier berths;
 23 miles of 48-inch-diameter pipeline;
 one 41,000 horsepower compressor station and one 12,260 horsepower
compressor station;and
 ancillary facilities.
The FERC staff mailed copies of the draft EIS to federal, state, and local
government representatives and agencies;elected officials;environmental and public
interest groups;Native American tribes;potentially affected landowners and other
interested individuals and groups;newspapers and libraries in the Proj
ect area;and
parties to this proceeding. Everyone on our environmental mailing list will receive a CD
version of the draft EIS. In addition, the draft EIS is available for public viewing on the
FERC’s website (www.ferc.gov)using the eLibrary link. A limited number of copies are
available for distribution and public inspection at:
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
Public Reference Room
888 First Street NE, Room 2A
Washington, DC 20426
(202)502-8371
If you would like a hard copy of the draft EIS, please contact the Public Reference
Room.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission)
prepared this draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)to assess the environmental issues
associated with the construction of facilities proposed by Corpus Christi Liquefaction, LLC and
Cheniere Corpus Christi Pipeline, LP, which are collectively referred to as Cheniere. The draft
EIS was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act
of 1969 (NEPA)and its implementing regulations under Title 18 of the Code of Federal
Regulations, Part 380 (18 CFR 380). On August 31, 2012, Cheniere filed an application with the
FERC in Docket Numbers CP12-507-000 and CP12-508-000 pursuant to Section 3(a)and
Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA)and Parts 153, 157, and 284 of the Commission’s
regulations. This proj
ect is referred to as the Corpus Christi LNG Proj
ect (Proj
ect)and consists
of both a liquefied natural gas (LNG)terminal and natural gas pipeline facilities.
The purpose of this EIS is to inform the FERC decision-makers, the public, and the
permitting agencies about the potential adverse and beneficial environmental impacts of the
proposed Proj
ect and its alternatives, and recommend mitigation measures that would reduce
adverse impacts to the extent practicable. We2 prepared our analysis based on information
provided by Cheniere and further developed from data requests, field investigations, scoping,
literature research, and contacts with or comments from federal, state, and local agencies, Native
American tribes, and individual members of the public.
The FERC is the federal agency responsible for authorizing interstate natural gas
transmission facilities under the NGA, and is the lead federal agency for the preparation of this
EIS in compliance with the requirements of NEPA. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE),
U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), and U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) are cooperating
agencies for the development of this EIS consistent with 40 CFR 1501.6(b). A cooperating
agency has j
urisdiction by law or has special expertise with respect to environmental resource
issues associated with the Proj
ect.
PROPOSED ACTION
According to Cheniere, the Proj
ect would provide facilities necessary to import, export,
store, vaporize, and liquefy natural gas and deliver the resulting product either into existing
interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines in the Corpus Christi area, or export LNG
elsewhere.
Terminal
Cheniere would construct the LNG import and export terminal (Terminal)on a 991-acre
site located along the northern shore of Corpus Christi Bay at the north end of the La Quinta
Channel in San Patricio and Nueces Counties, Texas. The Terminal would include the following
key facilities:
 liquefaction facilities, including three liquefaction trains capable of producing 782
million British thermal units (MMBtu)per year of LNG;

 vaporization facilities, including two trains of ambient air vaporizers (AAV)and
send out pumps capable of vaporizing sufficient LNG volume for each to send out
200 MMBtu per day of natural gas;
 LNG storage facilities, including three LNG storage tanks each capable of storing
160,000 cubic meters of LNG;and
 marine terminal facilities with two LNG carrier berths.
Pipeline
Cheniere proposes to construct and operate about 23 miles of 48-inch-diameter natural
gas pipeline (Pipeline) and two compressor stations, the Taft Compressor Station (12,260
horsepower)and the Sinton Compressor Station (41,000 horsepower). Additional ancillary
facilities include six meter and regulator stations installed at the Terminal as well as
interconnects with Texas Eastern Transmission, L.P.;Kinder Morgan Tej
as Pipeline, LLC;
Natural Gas Pipeline Company, LLC;Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC;and
Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, LLC. Cheniere would install five mainline valves along the
pipeline route, including a pig3 launcher and receiver at the beginning and end of the pipeline,
respectively.
PUBLIC INVOLVMENT
On December 22, 2011, the FERC began its pre-filing review of Cheniere’s Proj
ect and
established the pre-filing Docket Number PF12-3-000 to place information related to the Proj
ect
into the public record. As part of the pre-filing process, Cheniere sponsored a public open house
in Portland, Texas on February 28, 2012. The purpose of the open house was to provide affected
landowners, government and agency officials, and the general public with information about the
Proj
ect and to give them an opportunity to ask questions and express their concerns. We
participated in the open house and provided information regarding the Commission’s
environmental review process to interested stakeholders.
On June 1, 2012, the FERC issued a Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact
Statement for the Planned Corpus Christi LNG Terminal and Pipeline Project, Request for
Comments on Environmental Issues, and Notice of Public Scoping Meeting. This notice was sent
to about 500 interested parties including federal, state, and local officials;agency representatives;
conservation organizations;Native American tribes;local libraries and newspapers in the Proj
ect
area;and property owners in the vicinity of the proposed Proj
ect facilities. On June 26, 2012, we
conducted a site visit and held a public scoping meeting in Portland, Texas to provide an
opportunity for the public to learn more about the Proj
ect and to provide oral comments on
environmental issues to be addressed in the EIS.
Additionally, we initiated consultations with federal and state agencies to identify issues
that should be addressed in the EIS. We conducted an interagency meeting for the Proj
ect on
June 27, 2012 in Corpus Christi, Texas.
Through the scoping and agency comment process, we received comments on a variety of
environmental issues. We continued to receive and consider public comments during the entire
pre-filing period and throughout development of this EIS. Substantive environmental issues

public scoping meeting and all written comments are part of the FERC’s public record for the
Proj
ect and are available for viewing under the Proj
ect docket numbers. 4,5
PROJECT IMPACTS
We evaluated the potential impacts of construction and operation of the Proj
ect on
geology;soils;water use and quality;wetlands;vegetation;wildlife, aquatic resources, and
essential fish habitat (EFH);threatened, endangered, and special status species;land use,
recreation, and visual resources;socioeconomics;cultural resources;air quality and noise;
reliability and safety;and cumulative impacts. Where necessary, we are recommending
additional mitigation to minimize or avoid these impacts. Section 5.3 of the EIS contains a
compilation of our recommendations.
Overall, construction of the Proj
ect facilities would temporarily disturb approximately
1,412 acres for construction, including extra temporary workspaces, contractor yards, access
roads, and aboveground facilities. About 647 acres would be retained as permanent easements
for operation of the facilities. Cheniere would allow the remaining 765 acres to return to
preconstruction uses.
Construction of the Terminal would result in permanent impacts on about 469acres of
open land and open water. All affected land areas would be permanently converted to industrial
land. The 23-mile pipeline right-of-way would be collocated with existing right-of-way
corridors to the extent practicable (about 86 percent of the total length. Construction of the
pipeline would impact about 421 acres of agricultural, open, and industrial land, but we have
determined that impacts would not be significant as the maj
ority of the area disturbed by the
pipeline is within agricultural areas and would return to preconstruction conditions soon after
construction is complete.
Regarding federally listed threatened and endangered species, on October 29, 2012,
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Marine Fisheries Service notified
Cheniere that initiation of Section 7 consultation would not be required;and in letters dated
August 8, 2013 and November 5, 2013, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)concurred
with determinations that the Proj
ect is not likely to adversely affect species under its
j
urisdiction. Additionally, no traditional cultural resources, burials, or sites of religious
significance to Indian tribes were identified and no historic properties would be affected in areas
that have been inventoried. The State Historic Preservation Office concurred with this
determination in a letter dated July 3, 2012. Furthermore, to ensure our responsibilities under
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act are met, we are recommending that
Cheniere should not begin construction of facilities until all cultural resource surveys have been
completed and filed. Based on our analysis, scoping, and agency consultations, the maj
or issues
are impacts on aquatic resources, including EFH and wetlands;air quality and noise;safety and
reliability;and cumulative impacts.

Corpus Christi LNG

Wetlands and Aquatic Resources
Based on consultations with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and
COE we determined that the proposed Terminal would impact wetlands and EFH. Although
construction of the marine berths at the Terminal would result in the loss and permanent
conversion of estuarine submerged aquatic seagrass beds, cordgrass salt marsh, emergent marsh,
vegetated sand flats, unvegetated sand flats, and unvegetated shallow water EFH, to deep water
habitat, the deep water habitat would recolonize with soft-bottom benthic organisms after
completion of dredging and would continue to provide a prey base for EFH species. To minimize
impacts on wetlands, EFH, and EFH species, Cheniere has reduced its work space requirements
and would user a hydraulic cutterhead dredge that would reduce sedimentation and turbidity.
Cheniere would further mitigate impacts on EFH by implementing its Aquatic Resources
Mitigation Plan. However, because the ARMP has not been approved by the COE we are
recommending that Cheniere file the final ARMP with the Secretary of the Commission prior to
construction
Air Quality and Noise
Most Proj
ect-related air emissions would be produced by operation of the Terminal and
the Sinton and Taft Compressor Stations. Cheniere would comply with all applicable air permit
requirements for those facilities. Multiple air dispersion modeling analyses, which included
LNG carriers and other nearby emission sources, demonstrated that operation of these facilities
would not result in an exceedance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards at any location,
with the exception of nitrogen dioxide for the Terminal. An expanded analysis determined that
operation of the Terminal would not contribute significantly to exceedances of the 1-hour
nitrogen dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standard. As a result, we conclude that the
Proj
ect would not result in a significant adverse impact on either the regional or local air quality.
Cheniere performed detailed noise assessments for each of the proposed horizontal
directional drilling locations. To mitigate significant noise impacts at several noise sensitive
areas, Cheniere has committed to performing all horizontal directional drilling activities, except
the pipe pullback, during daylight hours. During operation of the Proj
ect, potential noise impacts
would be limited to the vicinity of the Terminal and Sinton and Taft Compressor Stations. These
facilities would include design measures to minimize sound generation. The proposed facilities
with noise mitigation measures implemented are proj
ected to comply with the FERC day-night
sound level criterion of 55 decibels on the A-weighted scale at the nearest noise sensitive areas.
We are also recommending that Cheniere conduct noise surveys during operation of each facility
to ensure that noise levels meet our criterion.
Safety and Reliability
We evaluated the safety of the proposed Terminal facility, the related LNG carrier transit,
and the sendout pipeline. As part of our evaluation of the Terminal, we performed a technical
review of the preliminary engineering design to ensure sufficient layers of protection would be
included in the facility designs to mitigate the potential for an incident that could impact the
safety of the public. The DOT reviewed the data and methodology Cheniere used to determine
the design spills from various leakage sources, including piping, containers, and equipment
containing hazardous liquids, and stated it has no obj
ection to Cheniere’s methodology for
determining the candidate design spills used to establish the required siting for its proposed
Terminal. The Coast Guard reviewed the suitability of the Corpus Christi Ship Channel from the
Environmental Impact Statement

entrance approach at Port Aransas to the La Quinta Junction and the entire length of La Quinta
Channel, and issued a letter of recommendation (LOR) indicating the waterway would be
suitable for the type and frequency of the marine traffic associated with the proposed proj
ect. In
addition, Cheniere would be required to comply with all regulations in 49 CFR 192 for its
pipeline and 33 CFR 105, 33 CFR 127, and 49CFR 193 for its Terminal facilities. Based on our
engineering design analysis and recommendations presented in section 4.12 for the Terminal, the
design spill methodology reviewed by DOT for the Terminal, the LOR issued by the Coast
Guard for the LNG carrier transit, and the regulatory requirements for the pipeline and Terminal,
we conclude that the Proj
ect would not result in significantly increased public safety risks.
Cumulative Impacts
We also conclude that the potential impact of the Proj
ect, when combined with the
impacts from the other proj
ects considered, would not result in a significant impact on resources
within the cumulative impact areas. Although we recognize concurrent construction of the
proposed Proj
ect and other proj
ects in the vicinity of the Terminal site would result in increased
workers in the area, periods of increased traffic, and impacts on public services, we are not
recommending additional mitigation at this time. Therefore, we have determined that with the
implementation of Cheniere’s mitigation measures, the impacts of the Proj
ect when added with
other proj
ects’impacts would not result in significant cumulative impacts.
More detailed discussions of impacts on all resources affected by the Proj
ect, Cheniere’s
proposed mitigation, and our recommendations to avoid or further reduce impacts, are presented
in sections 4.0 and 5.0 of this EIS.
ALTERNATIVESCONSIDERED
We assessed alternatives that could achieve the Proj
ect obj
ectives. The range of
alternatives analyzed included the No-Action Alternative, alternative energy sources, system
alternatives, alternative Terminal sites, alternative Pipeline routes, and alternative compressor
station sites. Alternatives were evaluated and compared to the Proj
ect to determine if these
alternatives were environmentally preferable to the proposed Proj
ect.
While the No-Action Alternative would avoid the environmental impacts identified in
this EIS, adoption of this alternative would also preclude meeting the Proj
ect obj
ectives. If the
Proj
ect is not approved and built, the need could potentially be met by other LNG export and
import proj
ects developed elsewhere in the Gulf Coast region or in other areas of the U.S.
Implementation of other LNG export/import proj
ects would likely result in impacts similar to or
greater than those of the proposed Proj
ect.
We evaluated 12 system alternatives for the Terminal, including 6 operating LNG import
terminals in the Gulf of Mexico area, and 6 proposed or planned export proj
ects along the Gulf
Coast. All of the systems were eliminated from further consideration for reasons that include the
need for substantial construction beyond that currently proposed, production volume limitations,
in-service dates scheduled significantly beyond Cheniere’s schedule, including any customer
commitments, and environmental impacts that were considered comparable to or greater than
those of the proposed Proj
ect.
We also evaluated three alternative Terminal sites, two in proximity to the proposed site
and one near Brownsville, Texas. Construction of the Terminal at each of the alternative sites

would have comparable or greater impacts when compared to the proposed Terminal site;
therefore, none of the three sites evaluated were determined to be environmentally preferable.
Approximately 86 percent of the pipeline would be collocated, overlap, or parallel
existing rights-of-way. As a result, many types of environmental impacts have been lessened.
Two route alternatives were evaluated; however, we did not identify any site-specific
environmental concerns along the proposed route that would drive the need to recommend the
alternative pipeline routes.
We evaluated a total of five alternative sites for the proposed compressor stations, but
determined that none of these sites were environmentally preferable to the proposed sites.
CONCLUSIONS
We conclude that if the Proj
ect is constructed and operated in accordance with applicable
laws and regulations, Cheniere’s proposed mitigation, and our recommendations presented in
section 5.3 of this EIS, it would result in some adverse environmental impacts;however, those
impacts would not be significant. The principal reasons for our decision include:
 the Terminal facilities are sited in an existing industrialized area;
 dredge material would be disposed of beneficially to cap bauxite disposal beds;
 impacts on wetlands and aquatic habitat, including EFH, would be mitigated per
Cheniere’s Aquatic Resources Mitigation Plan;
 adequate safety features would be incorporated into the design and operation of the
Terminal facilities;
 the proposed pipeline route would be collocated, overlap, or parallel existing rights-ofway;
 Cheniere would implement the FERC Upland Erosion Control, Revegetation, and
Maintenance Plan and Wetland and Waterbody Construction and Mitigation Procedures
to minimize construction impacts on soils, wetlands, and waterbodies;
 the use of the horizontal directional drilling method for crossing maj
or waterbodies
would avoid disturbances to the beds and banks of these waterbodies;
 the Proj
ect would have no effect or would be not likely to adversely affect any federally
or state listed threatened or endangered species;
 the Proj
ect would have no effect on cultural resources;
 all appropriate consultations with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Texas Department
of Wildlife and Fisheries, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,

INTRODUCTION

The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission)
prepared this draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)to describe our assessment of the
potential environmental impacts that may occur from constructing and operating the Corpus
Christi Liquefaction, LLC’s and Cheniere Corpus Christi Pipeline, L.P.’s liquefied natural gas
(LNG)import and export terminal and associated natural gas pipeline in Nueces and San Patricio
Counties, Texas (collectively referred to as the Corpus Christi LNG Proj
ect or Proj
ect).
On August 31, 2012, Corpus Christi Liquefaction, LLC filed an application with the
FERC, in Docket No. CP12-507-000, under Section 3(a)of the Natural Gas Act (NGA)and
under Title 18 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 153 and 380 of the
Commission’s regulations to construct and operate LNG import and export facilities. On the
same day, Cheniere Corpus Christi Pipeline, L.P. also filed an application with the FERC in
Docket No. CP12-508-000, under Section 7(c)of the NGA and 18 CFR Parts 157, 284, and 380
of the Commission’s regulations. These applications were noticed in the Federal Register (FR)
on September 14, 2012.
Corpus Christi Liquefaction, LLC and Cheniere Corpus Christi Pipeline, L.P. are both
subsidiaries of Cheniere Inc. (hereafter collectively referred to as Cheniere). As part of the
Commission’s consideration of these applications, we6 prepared this EIS to assess the potential
environmental impacts resulting from construction and operation of the proposed Proj
ect in
accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969(NEPA).
1.1

REGULATORY BACKGROUND

Cheniere initially filed an application with the FERC in Docket Nos. CP04-37-000,
CP04-44-000, CP04-45-000, and CP04-46-000 on December 22, 2003, seeking Commission
approvals under Sections 3 and 7 of the NGA to construct and operate a LNG import terminal
and associated natural gas pipeline at the Proj
ect site. The Commission issued a final EIS on
March 3, 2005. Cheniere received an authorization under Docket No. CP04-37-000 on April 18,
2005. On June 8, 2012, the Commission issued an Order vacating the authorization to construct
the facilities since Cheniere did not construct the facilities in its authorized timeframe.
In this revised proposed Proj
ect, Docket Nos. CP12-507-000 and CP12-508-000,
Cheniere seeks authorization to construct and operate an LNG export and import facility
(Terminal)at the site of the previously authorized Corpus Christi import terminal. In addition,
Cheniere seeks authority for: a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (Certificate), to
authorize the construction and operation of a new bi-directional natural gas pipeline (Pipeline), to
be located along the same route as was previously authorized;a blanket certificate authorizing
Cheniere to engage in certain self-implementing routine activities under 18 CFR Part 157,
Subpart F, of the Commission’s regulations;and a blanket certificate authorizing Cheniere to
transport natural gas, on an open access and self-implementing basis, under 18 CFR Part 284,
Subpart G of the Commission’s regulations. The new Pipeline would extend from the Terminal
to north of Sinton, Texas, and be capable of transporting up to a maximum of 2.25 billion cubic
feet per day (Bcf/d)of natural gas to markets throughout the United States or to the Terminal, via
interconnections with a number of existing interstate pipeline systems.

PROJECT PURPOSE AND NEED

Cheniere states that the purpose of the Proj
ect is to provide facilities necessary to import,
export, store, vaporize, and liquefy natural gas and deliver the resulting product either into
existing interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines in the Corpus Christi area, or export LNG
elsewhere. Depending on market dynamics, the Proj
ect would enable LNG to be imported,
vaporized, and sent out for delivery to U.S. consumers, or the liquefaction facilities would allow
the export of natural gas as LNG to other countries for consumption.
Section 3 of the NGA, as amended, requires that authorization be obtained from the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE)prior to importing or exporting natural gas, including LNG, from
or to a foreign country. For applicants that have, or intend to have, a signed gas purchase or
sales agreement/contract for a period of time longer than two years, long-term authorization is
required. Under Section 3 of the NGA, the FERC considers, as part of its decision to authorize
natural gas facilities, all factors bearing on the public interest. Specifically, regarding whether to
authorize natural gas facilities for importation or exportation, the FERC shall authorize the
proposal unless it finds that the proposed facilities will not be consistent with the public interest.
Under Section 7(c)of the NGA, the Commission determines whether interstate natural
gas transportation facilities are in the public convenience and necessity, and if so, grants a
Certificate to construct and operate them. The Commission bases its decisions on technical
competence, financing, rates, market demand, gas supply, environmental impact, long-term
feasibility, and other issues concerning the proposed Proj
ect.
1.3

PURPOSE AND SCOPE OFTHE EIS

The EIS describes the affected environment as it currently exists, the environmental
consequences of the Proj
ect, and compares the Proj
ect’s potential impact with various
alternatives. The EIS also presents our conclusions and recommended mitigation measures. The
FERC would use the EIS as an element in its review of Cheniere’s applications to determine
whether to authorize the Proj
ect.
Our principal purposes in preparing this EIS are to:
 identify and assess potential impacts on the human environment that would result from
the implementation of the proposed action;
 identify and assess reasonable alternatives to the proposed action that would avoid or
minimize adverse impacts on the human environment;
 identify and recommend specific mitigation measures to minimize environmental
impacts;and
 facilitate public involvement in identifying significant environmental impacts on specific
resources.
Topics addressed in this EIS include alternatives;geology;soils and sediments;water
resources;wetlands;vegetation;wildlife and aquatic resources;threatened, endangered, and
other special status species; land use, recreation, and visual resources; socioeconomics;
transportation and traffic;cultural resources;air quality and noise;reliability and safety;and
cumulative impacts. Our analysis in this EIS focuses on facilities that are under the
Commission’s j
urisdiction (i.e., the proposed Terminal and Pipeline). Minor non-j
urisdictional
Environmental Impact Statement

1-6

Corpus Christi LNG

facilities would also be constructed and abandoned in association with the Proj
ect (see section
1.5).
When considering the environmental consequences of constructing and operating the
Proj
ect, the duration and significance of any potential impacts are described according to the
following four levels:
 Temporary impacts generally occur during construction, with the resources returning to
preconstruction conditions almost immediately after construction;
 Short-term impacts could continue for approximately 3 years following construction;
 Long-term impacts would require more than 3 years to recover, but eventually would
recover to preconstruction conditions;and
 Permanent impacts could occur as a result of activities that modify resources to the
extent that they may not return to preconstruction conditions during the life of the Proj
ect
such as with the construction of an aboveground facility.
1.3.1

Federal EnergyRegulatoryCommission Purpose and Role

The FERC is the federal agency responsible for authorizing onshore LNG facilities. As
such, the FERC is the lead federal agency for the preparation of this EIS in compliance with the
requirements of the NEPA, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations for
implementing the NEPA (40 CFR 1500-1508), and the FERC regulations for implementing the
NEPA (18 CFR 380).
Several agencies are cooperating agencies for the development of this EIS. A
cooperating federal agency has j
urisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to
environmental impacts associated with the proposal, and is involved in the NEPA analysis.
Cooperating agencies for the Proj
ect include: the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE), U.S.
Coast Guard (Coast Guard), U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), and DOE.
FERC consulted with the cooperating agencies throughout the pre-filing and the
application phases of the Proj
ect. The cooperating agencies provided input on the Proj
ect during
several conference calls and an interagency scoping meeting held on June 27, 2012 in order to
solicit comments and concerns regarding the Proj
ect. Agency representatives also participated in
the public scoping meeting held on June 26, 2012. The cooperating agencies had the opportunity
to comment on the preliminary draft EIS. FERC consulted with those agencies about their
comments and incorporated them into this EIS.
1.3.2

U.S. ArmyCorps of Engineers Purpose and Role

The COE has j
urisdictional authority pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act
(CWA)(Title 33 of the United States Code [USC], Section 1344 [33 USC 1344]), which governs
the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S., and Section 10 of the Rivers and
Harbors Act (RHA)(33 USC 403), which regulates any work or structures that potentially affect
the navigable capacity of a waterbody. Because the COE would need to evaluate and approve
several aspects of the Proj
ect and must comply with the requirements of NEPA before issuing
permits under the above statutes, it has elected to participate as a cooperating agency in the
preparation of this EIS. The COE would adopt the EIS per 40 CFR 1506.3 if, after an
Environmental Impact Statement

1-7

Corpus Christi LNG

independent review of the document, it concludes that the EIS satisfies the COE’s comments and
suggestions. The Proj
ect occurs within the Galveston District of the COE. Staff from this COE
district participated in the NEPA review and would evaluate COE authorizations, as applicable.
The primary decisions to be addressed by the COE include:
 issuance of a Section 404 Permit for wetland impacts associated with construction of the
Pipeline and Terminal;and
 issuance of Section 10 Permit for construction activities within navigable waters of the
U.S.
This EIS contains information needed by the COE to reach decisions on these issues.
Through the coordination of this document, the COE would obtain the views of the public and
natural resource agencies prior to reaching the COE’s decisions on the Proj
ect.
As an element of its review, the COE must consider whether a proposed proj
ect avoids,
minimizes, and compensates for impacts on existing aquatic resources, including wetlands, to
strive to achieve a goal of no overall net loss of values and functions. Based on its participation
as a cooperating agency and its consideration of the EIS (including responses to public
comments), the COE would issue a Record of Decision to formally document its decision on the
proposed action, including Section 404 (b)(1)analysis and required environmental mitigation
commitments.
1.3.3

U.S. Coast Guard Purpose and Role

The Coast Guard is the federal agency responsible for determining the suitability of
waterways for LNG marine traffic. The Coast Guard exercises regulatory authority over LNG
facilities that affect the safety and security of port areas and navigable waterways under
Executive Order 10173, the Magnuson Act (50 USC 191), the Ports and Waterways Safety Act
of 1972, as amended (33 USC 1221, et seq.), and the Maritime Transportation Security Act of
2002 (MTSA)(46 USC 701). The Coast Guard is responsible for matters related to navigation
safety, vessel engineering and safety standards, and all matters pertaining to the safety of
facilities or equipment in or adj
acent to navigable waters up to the last valve immediately before
the receiving tanks. The Coast Guard also has authority for LNG facility security plan reviews,
approval and compliance verification as provided in 33 CFR 105, and siting as it pertains to the
management of vessel traffic in and around LNG facilities to a point 12 nautical miles (nm)
seaward from the coastline (to the territorial seas).
As required by its regulations, the Coast Guard is responsible for issuing a Letter of
Recommendation (LOR)as to the suitability of the waterway for LNG marine traffic following a
Waterway Suitability Assessment (WSA). In a letter dated March 21, 2013, the Coast Guard
issued a LOR for the Proj
ect. In the LOR the Coast Guard stated that after reviewing the WSA,
they recommend that the Corpus Christi Ship Channel from the entrance approach at Port
Aransas to the La Quinta Junction and the entire length of the La Quinta Channel be considered
suitable for LNG marine traffic.
1.3.4

U.S. Department of Transportation Purpose and Role

The DOT has prescribed the minimum federal safety standards for LNG facilities in
compliance with 49USC 60101. Those standards are codified in 49CFR Part 193 and apply to
Environmental Impact Statement

1-8

Corpus Christi LNG

the siting, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and security of LNG facilities. The
National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 59A, Standard for the Production,
Storage, and Handling of Liquefied Natural Gas, is incorporated into these requirements by
reference, with regulatory preemption in the event of conflict. In accordance with the 1985
Memorandum of Understanding on LNG facilities and the 2004 Interagency Agreement on the
safety and security review of waterfront import/export LNG facilities, the DOT participates as a
cooperating agency and assists in assessing any mitigation measures that may become conditions
of approval for any proj
ect. DOT staff is reviewing our analysis and would provide comments
on our conclusions regarding compliance with Part 193 regulations.
1.3.5

U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyPurpose and Role

The EPA has delegated water quality certification, under Section 401 of the CWA, to the
j
urisdiction of individual state agencies. The EPA may assume Section 401 authority if no state
program exists, if the state program is not functioning adequately, or at the request of the state.
The EPA also oversees the issuance of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES)permit by the state agency, under Section 402 of the CWA, for point-source discharge
of used water into waterbodies. In addition to its authority under the CWA, the EPA also has
j
urisdictional authority under the Clean Air Act of 1970 (CAA)to control air pollution by
developing and enforcing rules and regulations for all entities that emit toxic substances into the
air. Under this authority, the EPA has developed regulations for maj
or sources of air pollution,
and has delegated the authority to implement these regulations to state and local agencies. State
and local agencies are allowed to develop and implement their own regulations for non-maj
or
sources of air pollutants.
In addition to its permitting responsibilities, the EPA is required under Section 309of the
CAA to review and publicly comment on the environmental impacts of maj
or federal actions
including actions that are the subj
ect of draft and final EISs, and responsible for implementing
certain procedural provisions of NEPA (e.g., publishing Notices of Availability of the draft and
final EISs)to establish statutory timeframes for the environmental review process.
1.3.6

U.S. Department of EnergyPurpose and Role

The DOE, Office of Fossil Energy must meet its obligation under Section 3 of the NGA
to authorize the import and export of natural gas, including LNG, unless it finds that the import
or export is not consistent with the public interest. The purpose and need for DOE action for the
current proposal is to respond to the August 31, 2012 application for authority to export LNG
from the Proj
ect filed by Cheniere with the Office of Fossil Energy (FE Docket No. 12-97LNG).
The DOE is conducting its review under Section 3 of the NGA to evaluate the Cheniere
application for long-term, multi-contract authorization to export up to 767 billion cubic feet per
year of domestic natural gas as LNG for a 25-year period, commencing the earlier of either the
date of first export or 10 years from the date of issuance of the requested authorization. Cheniere
seeks to export LNG from the Terminal to any country (1)with which the U.S. does not have a
free trade agreement requiring the national treatment for trade in natural gas and LNG;(2)that
has, or in the future develops, the capacity to import LNG;and (3)with which trade is not
prohibited by U.S. law or policy. In accordance with 40 CFR 1506.3, after an independent
review of the EIS, DOE may adopt the EIS prior to issuing a Record of Decision.
Environmental Impact Statement

1-9

Corpus Christi LNG

On October 16, 2012, in FE Docket No. 12-99-LNG, DOE issued DOE/FE Order No.
3164 granting Cheniere the authorization to export LNG by vessel from the Terminal to any
country which has or in the future develops the capacity to import LNG via ocean-going carrier
and with which the U.S. has, or in the future enters into, a free trade agreement requiring the
national treatment for trade in natural gas.
DOE has exclusive j
urisdiction over the export of natural gas as a commodity. DOE has
delegated to the Commission authority to approve or disapprove the construction and operation
of particular facilities. The facilities are considered the site at which such facilities would be
located, and with respect to natural gas that involves the construction of new domestic facilities,
the place of entry for imports or exit for exports. However, the DOE Secretary has not delegated
to the Commission any authority to approve or disapprove the import or export of the commodity
itself as part of the Commission’s public interest determination. The Commission’s
authorization alone would not enable the export of any additional volumes of LNG.
1.4

PUBLIC REVIEW AND COMMENT

Cheniere initiated the FERC pre-filing process for the Proj
ect on December 13, 2011. On
December 22, 2011, the Commission staff granted Cheniere’s request to utilize the pre-filing
process and assigned Docket No. PF11-3-000 to staff activities involved with the Proj
ect. The
pre-filing process ended on August 31, 2012 when Cheniere submitted its applications to the
FERC. The pre-filing process allows the FERC staff to become involved with scoping of
environmental issues before the applicant files its application, thus overlapping the applicant’s
planning process with the FERC process.
During the pre-filing process, we conducted biweekly conference calls with Cheniere to
discuss Proj
ect progress and identify and address issues and concerns that had been raised.
Interested agencies were invited to participate on these calls. Summaries of biweekly conference
calls and written scoping comments are part of the public record for the Proj
ect and are available
for viewing on the FERC website (http://www.ferc.gov).
On February 28, 2012, the FERC staff participated in a visit to the proposed facility site.
Cheniere hosted an open house information session for landowners, agencies, and other
interested stakeholders on February 28, 2012 in Portland, Texas, which FERC staff also
participated in. The open house provided stakeholders the opportunity to learn about the Proj
ect
and ask questions in an informal setting. Notification of the open house was mailed to
stakeholders and published in local newspapers. Approximately 120 interested parties attended
the open house. On June 1, 2012, the FERC issued a Notice of Intent to Prepare an
Environmental Assessment for the Planned Corpus Christi LNG Terminal and Pipeline Project,
Request for Comments on Environmental Issues, and Notice of Public Scoping Meeting (NOI)7.
The NOI was sent to over 500 interested parties including federal, state, and local officials;
agency representatives;conservation organizations;local libraries and newspapers;property
owners along the proposed pipeline route, and interveners in the proceeding. There was a 30-day
comment period on the NOI which ended on July 2, 2012. We received 25 comments in
response to the NOI.
Of the 25 comments filed during the public scoping period, four were from state or
federal agencies, one was from a non-profit environmental group, and the remaining 20 were
7

Based on comments during scoping and Proj
ect impacts, we determined that an EIS would be more appropriate.

Environmental Impact Statement

1-10

Corpus Christi LNG

from adj
acent landowners or individuals. The maj
ority of comments indicated concerns
regarding water contamination, air quality, safety, outdoor recreation, fish and wildlife, visual
resources, and noise and light pollution. Commenters also expressed a preference that the FERC
prepare an EIS in lieu of an Environmental Assessment. Cheniere addressed all comments filed
during the public scoping period on July 16, 2012.
On June 26, 2012, the FERC conducted another site visit of the Terminal site and the
Pipeline route. That same day, the FERC conducted a public scoping meeting in Portland, Texas
to provide an opportunity for the public to learn more about the Proj
ect and provide comments
on environmental issues addressed in the EIS. Nine people provided verbal comments at the
scoping meeting and three individuals submitted written comments. A transcript of the scoping
meeting and all written comments provided at the meeting has been entered into the public
record for the Proj
ect, under Docket No. PF11-3-000.
On June 27, 2012, the FERC held an interagency scoping meeting to solicit comments
and concerns regarding the Proj
ect from other j
urisdictional agencies. Representatives from
eight state and federal agencies were present including the COE, DOT, Coast Guard, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National
Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries), Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC), Texas
General Land Office (TGLO), and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD).
On April 26, 2012, FERC staff issued a letter to the U.S. Department of Defense
requesting comments on whether the Proj
ect could potentially have an impact on the test,
training, or operational activities of any active military installation.
To date, no military
installations have been identified as being potentially impacted.
Table 1.5-1 lists the environmental issues that were identified during the scoping process
described above, as well as comments received in response to our Notice of Application issued
September 14, 2012. Table 1.5-1 also indicates the section of this EIS in which each issue is
addressed. Additional issues that we independently identified are also addressed.
On October 16, 2012, April 30, 2013, and October 30, 2013, the FERC issued a Proj
ect
update to inform the public and agencies of the status of the FERC review process. This
document, as well as all documents and comments submitted as a part of the Proj
ect pre-filing
and application processes, are publically available online at www.ferc.gov/docsfiling/elibrary.asp.

NON-JURISDICTIONAL FACILITIES

Under Section 7 of the NGA, the FERC is required to consider, as part of a decision to
authorize j
urisdictional facilities, all facilities that are directly related to a proposed proj
ect where
there is sufficient federal control and responsibility to warrant environmental analysis as part of
the NEPA environmental review for the proposed proj
ect. Some proposed proj
ects have
associated facilities that do not come under the j
urisdiction of the Commission. These “nonj
urisdictional”facilities may be integral to the need for the proposed facilities, or they may be
merely associated as minor components of j
urisdictional facilities that would be constructed and
operated as a result of authorization of the proposed facilities.

Environmental Impact Statement

1-13

Corpus Christi LNG

The j
urisdictional facilities for the Proj
ect include the Terminal and the Pipeline and are
discussed extensively throughout this EIS. Two non-j
urisdictional facilities were identified in
association with the proposed Proj
ect: an electrical powerline and substations and a potable
waterline. These facilities are addressed below and are also addressed in our cumulative impacts
analysis in section 4.13 of this EIS. Figure 1.6-1 shows the locations of the non-j
urisdictional
facilities to be constructed concurrent with the Terminal facilities. Both the electrical powerline
and the potable waterline would be constructed within the Utility/Access Easement. These nonj
urisdictional facilities would be constructed in compliance with all applicable federal and state
regulations.

1.5.1

Electrical Power Lines and Substations

An electrical power line extension and a substation would be required for construction
and operation power supply. An overhead power line would be extended from the j
unction of
State Highway (SH)35 and SH 361 to a new facilities substation located on approximately 11.6
acres of previously disturbed industrial, road, and utility corridor. The electrical substation
would be placed on a 4.8-acre lease at the south end of the power line easement. The overhead
power line and electrical substation would be designed, built, owned, and operated by American
Electric Power, Inc. (AEP), the local power transmission provider.
Cheniere would also design, build, own, and operate an underground power line that
would extend from the AEP substation to the facilities substation at the Terminal. The
underground power would be constructed within previously disturbed areas adj
acent to La
Quinta Road and/or within the Terminal property. Environmental impacts associated with the
installation of the power lines and substations would be confined to existing, previously
disturbed industrial areas and would be negligible.
1.5.2

Waterline

The Proj
ect would require a pipeline connection to the San Patricio Municipal Water
District potable water system at the north end of La Quinta Road for site personnel and the
supply by pipeline of raw or semi-processed water to be used for Terminal operations. Examples
of use include: use as a feed source to the demineralized water system for inj
ection into the gas
turbines for nitrogen dioxide control and for make-up of the amine unit;for humidification
equipment at the inlet to the gas turbine drivers;and potable water for the additional operation
and maintenance activities. Water use associated with the Proj
ect is further discussed in section
4.3 of this EIS. The waterline would be constructed within the same corridor as the power lines
discussed above and would be located entirely within previously disturbed areas, resulting in
negligible environmental impacts.
1.6

PERMITS,APPROVALS,AND REGULATORY REVIEWS

As the lead federal agency for the Proj
ect, the FERC is required to comply with various
federal environmental laws and regulations, including but not limited to, the Endangered Species
Act of 1973 (ESA), the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976
(MSA), the RHA, the CWA, the CAA, the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, the NGA, the MTSA,
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), the Coastal Zone Management Act of
1972 (CZMA), and the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (NFIA). Each of these statutes has
been taken into account in the preparation of this document.
Maj
or permits, approvals, and consultations for the Proj
ect are identified in table 1.6-1
and discussed below. The FERC encourages cooperation between applicants and state and local
authorities, but this does not mean that state and local agencies, through applications of state and
local laws, may prohibit or unreasonably delay the construction or operation of facilities
approved by the FERC. Any state or local permits issued with respect to j
urisdictional facilities
must be consistent with the conditions of any authorization issued by the FERC.

Endangered Species Act

Section 7 of the ESA, as amended, states that any proj
ect authorized, funded, or
conducted by any federal agency (e.g., FERC)should not “… j
eopardize the continued existence
of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse
modification of habitat of such species which is determined… to be critical… ”(16 USC Section
1536(a)(2)(1988)). The FERC, or Cheniere as a non-federal party, is required to consult with the
FWS and NOAA Fisheries to determine whether any federally listed or proposed endangered or
threatened species or their designated critical habitat occur in the vicinity of the Proj
ect. If the
FERC determines that these species or habitats may be impacted by the Proj
ect, the FERC is
required to prepare a biological assessment (BA)to identify the nature and extent of adverse
impact, and to recommend measures to avoid or reduce potential impacts on habitat and/or
species. If, however, the FERC determines that no federally listed or proposed endangered or
threatened species or their designated critical habitat would be impacted by the Proj
ect, no
further action is necessary under the ESA (see section 4.7 of this EIS for the status of our
compliance with Section 7 of the ESA).
1.6.2

Magnuson-Stevens FisheryConservation Management Act

The MSA, as amended by the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-267),
established procedures designed to identify, conserve, and enhance essential fish habitat (EFH)
for those species regulated under a federal fisheries management plan. The MSA requires
federal agencies to consult with NOAA Fisheries on all actions or proposed actions authorized,
funded, or undertaken by the agency that may adversely impact EFH (MSA Section 305(b)(2)).
Although absolute criteria have not been established for conducting EFH consultations, NOAA
Fisheries recommends consolidating EFH consultations with interagency coordination
procedures required by other statutes such as NEPA, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, or
the ESA (50 CFR 600.920(e))in order to reduce duplication and improve efficiency. As part of
the consultation process, the FERC has prepared an EFH Assessment included in appendix B of
this EIS.
1.6.3

Rivers and Harbors Act

The RHA pertains to activities in navigable waters as well as harbor and river
improvements. Section 10 of the RHA prohibits the unauthorized obstruction or alteration of
any navigable water of the U.S. Construction of any structure or the accomplishment of any
other work affecting course, location, condition, or physical capacity of waters of the U.S. must
be authorized by the COE (see section 4.3 for the status of our compliance with the RHA).
1.6.4

Clean Water Act

The CWA, as amended, regulates the discharges of pollutants into waters of the U.S. and
regulates quality standards for surface waters. To enact this goal both the EPA and the COE
have regulatory authority under the CWA. The EPA has implemented pollution control
programs including setting wastewater standards for industry and creating water quality
standards for all contaminants in surface waters. Under the CWA, it is unlawful to discharge any
pollutant from a point source into waters of the U.S. without a permit. The EPA operates the
NPDES permit program which regulates discharges by industrial, municipal, and other facilities,
that directly enter surface waters. Section 404 of the CWA regulates the discharge of dredged or
Environmental Impact Statement

1-17

Corpus Christi LNG

fill material into waters of the U.S. and is under j
urisdiction of the COE. The status of NPDES
and Section 404 permitting requirements are further addressed in section 4.3 of this EIS.
Section 401 of the CWA requires that an applicant for a federal permit to conduct any
activity that may result in a discharge to waters of the U.S. must provide the federal regulatory
agency with a Section 401 certification. Section 401 certifications are made by the state in
which the discharge originates and declares that the discharge would comply with applicable
provisions of the act, including the state water quality standards. The RRC is the regulatory
authority delegated with Section 401 certification for the state of Texas for oil and gas
operations. The RRC also permits nonpoint discharges associated with oil and gas activities
from stormwater to waters of the U.S. under the Texas Administrative Code (TAC)Title 16 Part
1 Chapter 3.
1.6.5

Clean Air Act

The CAA, as amended, defines the EPA’s responsibilities for protecting and improving
the nation’s air quality and the stratospheric ozone layer. Under the CAA, the EPA sets limits on
certain air pollutants and limits emissions of air pollutants coming from sources such as
industrial facilities. The EPA has delegated the authority to implement these regulations to state
and local agencies. In Texas, the Texas Council on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) is
responsible for enforcement of air quality standards at a state level as well as implementation of
federal air programs, with the exception of issuing permits for greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions.
However, on February 18, 2014, EPA issued a proposed rulemaking approving Texas' GHG
permitting program. In anticipation of a final rulemaking, EPA has offered applicants who are
currently in the permitting process with EPA the choice of continuing the permitting process
with EPA, or moving their applications to the TCEQ. The EPA also issued a rule in 2010
finalizing GHG reporting requirements for the petroleum and natural gas industry (40 CFR Part
98).
1.6.6

Federal Aviation Act

The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (as amended) created the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA)and delegates their authority “to provide for the regulation and promotion
of civil aviation in such manner as to best foster its development and safety, and to provide for
the safe and efficient use of the airspace by both civil and military aircraft, and for other
purposes.” Title 14 of the USC, Section 44718, Structures Interfering with Air Commerce,
outlines the regulations associated with “the construction, alteration, establishment, or expansion,
or the proposed construction, alteration, establishment, or expansion of a structure or sanitary
landfill when notice would promote safety in air commerce and the efficient use and preservation
of the navigable airspace and of airport traffic capacity at public-use airports.”
Any construction or alteration of structures meeting the requirements outlined in
49CFR 77, Safe, Efficient Use, and Preservation of the Navigable Airspace, requires that
adequate notice is provided to the FAA of that construction or alteration. Subsequent to the
receipt of that notice the FAA would issue a public notice of their intent to perform an
aeronautical study of the obstruction to air navigational facilities and would determine the effect
the obstruction would have on the safe and efficient use of navigable airspace. Following the
completion of the study, the FAA would issue a determination stating whether the proposed
construction or alteration would be a hazard to air navigation. The FAA issued a public notice in
Environmental Impact Statement

1-18

Corpus Christi LNG

regards to the proposed flare stacks associated with the Terminal on September 14, 2012.
Additional information regarding safety associated with the flare stacks is provided in section
4.12 of this EIS.
1.6.7

Maritime Transportation SecurityAct

The MTSA is designed to protect the nation’s ports and waterways from a terrorist attack.
It requires vessels and port facilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and develop security
plans. The MTSA also requires the establishment of Area Maritime Security Committees at all
of the nation’s ports. These committees are tasked with coordinating activities of all port
stakeholders including the Maritime Industry, the boating public, and other federal, state, and
local agencies. As a cooperating agency with the FERC, the Coast Guard prepared a LOR to
analyze the potential navigation safety and maritime security risks associated with the Proj
ect.
The Coast Guard also has responsibilities relating to LNG waterfront facilities at 33 CFR 127.
1.6.8

National Historic Preservation Act

Section 106 of the NHPA, as amended, requires the FERC to take into account the
impacts of its undertakings on historic properties, and afford the Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation (ACHP)an opportunity to comment. Historic properties include prehistoric or
historic sites, districts, buildings, structures, obj
ects, or properties of traditional religious or
cultural importance listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). In accordance with the ACHP’s regulations for implementing Section 106, at 36 CFR
800.2(a)(3), the FERC staff is using the services of the applicant and its consultants to prepare
information, analyses, and recommendations. However, we remain responsible for all findings
and determinations. We will follow the process of complying with Section 106 outlined in Part
800 by consulting with the Texas State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), identifying historic
properties in the area of potential effect (APE), and assessing potential proj
ect effects. In Texas,
the Texas Historical Commission (THC)houses the SHPO. Section 4.10 of this EIS summarizes
the status of our compliance with the NHPA.
1.6.9

Coastal Zone Management Act

The CZMA calls for the “effective management, beneficial use, protection, and
development”of the nation’s coastal zone and promotes active state involvement in achieving
those goals. As a means to reach those goals, the CZMA requires participating states to develop
management programs that demonstrate how these states would meet their obligations and
responsibilities in managing their coastal areas. In the state of Texas, the TGLO is the agency
responsible for administering its Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP). Because Section
307 of the CZMA requires federal agency activities to be consistent to the maximum extent
practicable with the enforceable policies of a management program, the FERC has requested that
Cheniere seek a determination of consistency with Texas’s CZMP. Sections 4.8.1.5 and 4.8.2.5
of this EIS summarize our compliance with the CZMA.
1.6.10

National Flood Insurance Act

The NFIA created the National Flood Insurance Program and delegated the authority to
manage the program to the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA). The
purpose of the NFIA was to make flood insurance available, improve floodplain management,
and develop maps of flood hazard zones. State and local governments must implement
Environmental Impact Statement

1-19

Corpus Christi LNG

floodplain management regulations consistent with the federal criteria outlined in 44 CFR 60,
Criteria for Land Management and Use. Participating local governments in flood-prone areas,
as designated by FEMA, agree to adopt and enforce ordinances that meet or exceed FEMA
requirements to reduce the risk of flooding. Additional information regarding flood risks and our
compliance with the NFIA is provided in section 4.1.1.5 of this EIS.

PROPOSED ACTION
SECTION 2

2.0

DESCRIPTION OFPROPOSED ACTION

The Proj
ect consists of a new natural gas liquefaction and export plant, as well as LNG
import facilities with regasification capabilities (Terminal)all located along the northern shore of
Corpus Christi Bay at the north end of the La Quinta Channel in San Patricio and Nueces
Counties, Texas. The Terminal includes two marine berths each containing a maneuvering area
as well as a protected marine berth area capable of accommodating one LNG carrier at a time for
import/export activities.
Additionally, the Proj
ect involves the construction and operation of a new 48-inchdiameter, 23-mile, bi-directional natural gas pipeline (Pipeline)extending from the proposed
Terminal to north of Sinton in San Patricio County. The new Pipeline would transfer the
imported natural gas to markets throughout Texas and the U.S. via interconnections with a
number of existing intrastate and interstate pipeline systems, and to transfer natural gas to the
Terminal for liquefaction and export.
A general map of the Terminal facilities is provided as figure 1.1-1 and the proposed site
boundary is provided as figure 1.1-3. The following sections describe the proposed facilities
associated with the Proj
ect, construction procedures and schedule, environmental compliance
and inspection monitoring, operation and maintenance procedures, safety controls, and land
requirements.
2.1

TERMINAL (IMPORT AND EXPORT)FACILITIES

The Terminal would include liquefaction facilities, marine terminal and LNG transfer
lines, LNG storage facilities, LNG vaporization facilities, flare facilities, and other infrastructure.
2.1.1

Liquefaction Facilities –Export

The Terminal would include three LNG liquefaction trains, necessary to liquefy natural
gas, capable of producing approximately 782 million British thermal units (MMBtu)per year of
LNG. Each liquefaction train consists of multiple facilities which include:
 facilities which remove carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and sulfur
compounds from feed gas;
 facilities to remove water and mercury from the feed gas;
 facilities to remove heavy hydrocarbons (such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and
xylene [BTEX])from the feed gas to avoid freezing in the liquefaction unit;
 standard annular combustor aero-derivative LM2500 G4+ gas turbine-driven refrigerant
compressors – each gas turbine would have water inj
ection for emissions control, and
Inlet Air Humidification Systems to be operated when the ambient temperature is at or
above 60 degrees Fahrenheit (°F);
 waste heat recovery systems for regenerating the gas driers and amine system;
 induced draft air coolers;
 associated control systems and electrical infrastructure;
 utility connections and distribution systems;and
Environmental Impact Statement

2-1

Corpus Christi LNG

 piping, piperacks, foundations, and structures within the LNG train battery limits.
BTEX and acid gas impurities removed from the natural gas stream prior to liquefaction
would be disposed of by passing through a triazine scavenger bed which absorbs any H2S. The
remaining waste gas contains CO2 and would be mixed with a small amount of fuel gas and sent
to a thermal oxidizer. Cheniere would then send the spent solvent to a licensed disposal facility.
While the feed gas contains no mercury, as a precaution, Cheniere would provide mercury
removal beds and any mercury collected would be sent to a licensed disposal facility.
2.1.2

LNG Vaporization Facilities –Import

Cheniere would install two trains of ambient air vaporizers (AAVs)and send out pumps
capable of vaporizing sufficient LNG volume for each to send out 200 MMBtu per day of natural
gas. Each AAV train would be comprised of approximately 18 to 20 AAV cells and associated
piping, valves, and one high-pressure LNG send-out pump. Each AAV train would cycle the
AAV cells between operation and defrost, with some cells vaporizing and some cells in defrost
mode at any one time, depending on ambient conditions. Cheniere selected the AAV
vaporization system because they provide the most fuel efficient method for regasifying LNG.
The AAVs do not require combustion to regasify as opposed to traditional Submerged
Combustion Vaporizers.
2.1.3

LNG Storage Facilities

The LNG would be stored in three, full containment storage tanks. The tanks would be
oriented in a straight line, separated by 50 meters. Each tank would be 194 feet above grade and
258.5 feet in diameter. The tanks would be designed to store a nominal volume of 160,000 cubic
meters (m3)(1,006,400 barrels)of LNG at a temperature of -270°F and a maximum internal
pressure of 3.5 pounds per square inch gauge (psig)(though the normal operating conditions
would be -260°F and 1.5 psig). The tank system would meet the requirements of the NFPA 59A,
49CFR Part 193, and American Petroleum Institute (API)Standard 620 Appendix Q.
There would be several maj
or components to the LNG storage tanks:
 A 9percent nickel steel open top inner container, designed to withstand the hydrostatic
pressures and cryogenic temperatures of the LNG, as well as the predicted seismic,
insulation, and thermal gradient loads. The space between the inner container and the
outer container would be insulated with expanded perlite to maintain the outer container
at near ambient temperature. The insulation beneath the inner container would be cellular
glass load-bearing insulation that would support the weight of the inner container and the
LNG.
 An outer tank comprised of reinforced concrete with a domed concrete roof. The outer
tank would be designed for the specified internal pressure of 3.5 psig, and a sustained
wind speed of 150 miles per hour (mph). In addition, the tank would be designed for
seismic loads in accordance with NFPA 59A and the site specific seismic reports, internal
pressure imposed by insulation loads, and roof and platform dead loads.
 An insulated aluminum deck over the inner container, suspended from the roof. The
aluminum support deck would be insulated with fiberglass blankets so that the outer tank
roof and vapor space above the suspended deck would be at ambient temperature. The

Environmental Impact Statement

2-2

Corpus Christi LNG

vapor pressure from the LNG would be equalized through ports in the suspended deck
and would be contained by the outer container.
The tanks would be supported on a reinforced concrete mat with electric base heating to
prevent frost heave. Each tank would also have five in-tank pump well columns, four of which
would be fully installed with foot valve, electrical components, structural supports,
instrumentation, piping, etc. The fifth pump well column would be equipped with a foot valve
only for use as a future spare pump. All LNG piping would enter the tank through the concrete
tank roof. All piping systems would be in accordance with American Society of Mechanical
Engineers (ASME)B31.3 and NFPA 59A Chapter 6. Each LNG tank would also be equipped
with a cool down temperature detection system to monitor the inner tank bottom plate and inner
tank shell continuously during cool-down procedures;foundation temperature sensors located at
strategic locations under the tank;instrumentation to monitor the quality and level of LNG in the
tank and to monitor tank contents for stratification;a safety-rated control system to monitor the
LNG level and control the fill line shutoff valves;pressure and vacuum relief systems;platforms,
elevators, and stairways with intermediate landings attached to the outer tank;spill protection of
the tank roof over the edge of the roof dome;lighting and aircraft warning lights;electrical
grounding system;electrical base heating;a settlement monitoring system to measure and record
inner and outer container movements during construction, hydrostatic testing, and operation;and
seismic monitors.
2.1.4

Marine Terminal and LNG Transfer Lines

Access to the proposed marine terminal associated with the Terminal facilities from the
Gulf of Mexico would be through a series of channels. The navigation channels that would be
used to reach the marine terminal include the Aransas Pass Safety Fairway, Aransas Pass Outer
Bar Channel, Jetty Channel, Corpus Christi Ship Channel (including the Inner Basins at Harbor
Island and the j
unction with the La Quinta Channel), and the La Quinta Channel. The marine
terminal would be located on the north end of the La Quinta Channel. Land-based facilities
associated with the Terminal would be located in San Patricio County, while marine facilities
would be in Nueces County.
2.1.4.1

LNG Carriers and Marine Berths

The proposed marine terminal would include two LNG carrier berths. Both berths would
consist of a maneuvering area and a protected marine berth area. Cheniere estimates that
approximately 200 to 300 LNG carrier transits through the Corpus Christi Bay would occur
annually. To facilitate maneuvering of the LNG carriers, Cheniere would keep tug boats
available. When not in use, the tug boats would be docked at the marine facilities.
Each marine berth would consist of at least four breasting dolphins, consisting of
reinforced concrete structures on piles. The dolphins would be equipped with fenders suitable to
safely berth and moor the full-size range of ships anticipated at the Terminal. The breasting
dolphins would also be equipped with quick-release mooring hooks for spring lines to provide
the necessary mooring lines arrangement flexibility for various sizes of vessels. In addition to
the breasting dolphins, six mooring dolphins would be provided, each consisting of reinforced
concrete structures on piles and equipped with quick release mooring hooks.
The LNG cargo transfer docks would be single-level concrete structures supported on
piles. Each dock would consist of a reinforced concrete beam and slab structure, approximately
Environmental Impact Statement

2-3

Corpus Christi LNG

90 feet wide by approximately 116 feet long. The piles to support the dock and dolphins would
be driven during daylight hours only and operations would observe the procedures necessary to
minimize impacts on aquatic life and marine mammals (see sections 4.6 and 4.7). The
procedures would include exclusion zones, sound attenuation, soft start procedures, visual
monitoring, and shut down and delay procedures. Each dock would be curbed to confine
potential LNG spillage and its surface would be sloped to a collection point. Drainage from the
collection point would be via the LNG spill collecting trough to a spill impoundment basin.
Shipboard LNG cargo pumps would deliver the LNG from each marine berth to the LNG
storage tanks at a design rate no more than 12,000 m3 per hour via two parallel LNG transfer
lines for the unloading/vaporizing (import)mode. During the liquefaction (export)mode, in-tank
pumps would deliver LNG to ships from the storage tanks at a design rate no more than 12,000
m3 per hour. Three 20-inch-diameter marine cryogenic cargo transfer arms would be installed
for liquid delivery to/from the storage tanks, and one 20-inch-diameter arm would provide vapor
return flow between the ship and the Terminal. The cargo transfer arms would be designed with
swivel j
oints and equipped with sensors to provide the required range of movement between the
ship and the shore connections. Each arm would be fitted with a powered emergency release
coupling and associated valves to protect the arm and ship’s manifold while also avoid spillage
of its liquid contents in the case of unusual movement of the ship continuing beyond the normal
operating envelope. Each arm would be operated by a hydraulic system with a counterbalance
weight to reduce the weight of the arm bearing on the shipside connection and to reduce the
power required to maneuver the arm into position.
The LNG cargo transfer docks would also allow access for a mobile crane that Cheniere
anticipates would be required to facilitate maintenance service on the cargo transfer arms. A
boat launch ramp would also be constructed to facilitate seaside inspection of the berths in the
channel.
The facilities would be designed to provide safe berthing for receipt and mooring of LNG
carriers and to ensure the safe transfer of LNG cargoes between the ships and the onshore storage
facilities. Design of the marine facilities would be in accordance with applicable codes and
standards, including but not limited to, Oil Companies International Marine Forum, Society of
International Gas Tanker and Terminal Operators, API, and American Society of Civil Engineers
(ASCE).
Cheniere indicated that they confirmed its proposed facility design with simulations
which demonstrated maneuvering and docking of all modeled LNG carriers would be
accomplished with no more than three Z-drive tractor tugs (each having approximately 70 metric
tons shallow water bollard pull capability)under most anticipated environmental conditions of
weather, current, tide, etc. However, Cheniere plans to have four tugs boats in reserve at the
Terminal site to assist in LNG carrier maneuvering. Cheniere also had the berth layout reviewed
by experienced pilots, and changes were made based on their recommendations. Computer
simulations of the maneuvering and berthing evolutions were then conducted at the COE
Engineering Research and Development Center’s (ERDC)Ship and Tow Simulator located in
Vicksburg, Mississippi. Additional computer simulations were conducted using updated LNG
carrier computer models on a Transas full-mission bridge simulator at the Maritime Institute of
Training and Graduate Studies located in Linthicum, Maryland.

Environmental Impact Statement

2-4

Corpus Christi LNG

The LNG carrier berths would be protected as much as practicable from other ship traffic,
particularly in the unlikely case of a ship becoming disabled while passing the Terminal. The
location and configuration of the berths would be such that the LNG carrier berths would be
recessed and at enough of an angle to avoid this, while maintaining sufficient maneuvering area
in case a docked LNG carrier needs to make an emergency departure. Cheniere’s final berth
layout was confirmed to meet these criteria at the ERDC.
LNG carriers would load/discharge LNG cargoes at the berths via the bidirectional cargo
transfer arms. LNG would flow via the stainless steel insulated LNG transfer lines for delivery
to the LNG storage tanks or to the LNG carrier. During berth idle periods when no cargo
transfer operations are being conducted, the contents of the LNG transfer lines would be
recirculated from one LNG storage tank to the j
etty and back to another LNG tank to keep the
LNG lines cold.
Ballast is a necessary safety feature of commercial shipping that provides control of
longitudinal trim and transverse stability during voyages and while in port. Controlling ballast
weight and placement also ensures adequate submergence of the propeller, reduces stresses on
the ship’s hull, and controls both the longitudinal and vertical locations of the center of gravity as
required for safe navigation and operation of ships. Impacts resulting from ballast water are
discussed in sections 4.3 and 4.6.
2.1.4.2

Barges

Barges would be necessary for transportation of equipment to the Terminal site during
construction. A roll-on/roll-off area would be sited to the west of the LNG carrier berths for
unloading equipment from barges. The primary materials that would be used in construction of
the marine berth include steel-pipe pilings, concrete, and reinforcing steel for the concrete.
Cheniere anticipates that the reinforcing steel would be fabricated off site and trucked to the
Terminal site or delivered by barge to the construction dock. The concrete would be produced in
a batch located at the main Proj
ect site or purchased from a local supplier, depending on local
availability at the time of construction.
2.1.4.3

Dredge Disposal

To accommodate the deepest draft LNG carriers, Cheniere would dredge the berth areas
to a minimum depth of -46 feet, plus 2 feet paid allowed overdredge to ensure the minimum
depth is met, and 2 feet advanced maintenance dredge. Cheniere anticipates that 2 feet of
maintenance dredging would be required approximately every three years to ensure minimum
depth is maintained. A 3:1 side slope would form the sides of the slip, portions of which would
be protected using articulated block mats or other suitable means of stabilization, where required.
Cheniere would also expand the existing maneuvering area to the same parameters described for
the berths.
Initial dredging of the berths would result in the dredging of approximately 4.4 million
cubic yards (mcy)of material, while maintenance dredging is anticipated to occur every three
years and produce approximately 200,000 cubic yards of material. Dredge materials would be
disposed of in two ways. Some of the dredged material would be used to fill a portion of a
former 90-acre clay borrow pit northeast of the Proj
ect site. The remainder of the dredged
material would be used to cap old bauxite disposal beds located in a 385-acre area immediately
north of the Proj
ect site. This area is known as dredge material placement area (DMPA)2. The
Environmental Impact Statement

2-5

Corpus Christi LNG

dredge material would be transferred to DMPA 2 via an approximately 11,000-foot-long, 30inch-diameter slurry pipe. The dredge material would be evenly distributed across the bauxite
beds and the water would be decanted and monitored as it leaves the DMPA to permitted
outfalls. The resulting soil would be a cap over the old bauxite beds which would allow
revegetation to occur, reducing the red dust in the area. Figure 2.1-1 shows the location of the
90-acre clay pit disposal area as well as DMPA 2, in relation to the Terminal site.
A portion of the marine terminal’s berth approach area was recently dredged by the COE
as part of an extension of the La Quinta Channel. The two marine berths associated with
Terminal would be designed to accommodate a broad range of present and future LNG carrier
size and type classes, including the largest presently existing (Q-max class)LNG carriers with
cargo capacities of up to approximately 267,000 m3.

Flare Facilities

All liquefaction plant hydrocarbon emergency relief loads would go to a closed flare
system. The flares are the control technology for volatile organic compounds (VOCs)and
organic hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), and achieve 98 percent combustion efficiency over all
conditions including plant start-up, shut-down, continuous operation and emergency flaring at all
rates.
The Proj
ect would include flares to protect the process and the LNG loading and
unloading system during upset or emergency cases. Five flares consisting of three types would
be installed for the Proj
ect, including two wet gas flares, two dry gas flares, and one marine flare.
Two identical wet/dry flare systems would be provided, with each system size, for loads
from two LNG trains. The first wet/dry system would be exclusively for Train 1 with the second
for Train 3. Relief from Train 2 would be routed to either of the two flare systems, allowing
both systems to provide relief for two trains. The marine flare would be utilized for both docks
and the three LNG storage tanks. The wet and dry flares would be located on the common
derrick structure approximately 500 feet tall. This arrangement would incorporate demountable
flares to facilitate ease of flare tip maintenance. Critical Proj
ect structures and equipment,
including ships at the marine berths would be outside the high heat flux zones.
Each flare would be ignited by a pilot and the flame would be monitored by dual
thermocouples. The flare pilot would be operated in a continuous mode and is re-lit
automatically if the flame goes out for the wet and dry flares. The marine flare pilot would only
be operated during ship loading.
2.1.6

Other Terminal Infrastructure

In addition to the facilities described above, the Terminal would also require additional
facilities and infrastructure including:
 miscellaneous buildings and other structures to accommodate equipment, utilities, and
support services infrastructure;
 warehouse to store spare parts and consumables for the liquefaction, regasification, and
utility facilities;
 storage area for chemicals, lubricants, and hazardous substances;
 operation and maintenance building, including the control room;
 remote input/output buildings and substations;
 storage vessels for propane and ethylene refrigerants;
 storage tanks for amine make up;
 storage tanks for heavy hydrocarbons removed from the feed gas;
 spill containment facilities;
 emergency shutdown (ESD)systems;
 firewater system, including diesel driven pumps and storage tank;
 instrument air compressor packages;

 storage tanks for condensate, liquid nitrogen, diesel, and gasoline;
 potable water, service water, and demineralized water systems;
 pipeline interconnect for the receipt of natural gas from and export to the Pipeline;and
 electric facilities, switchgear, transformers, and other electrical accessories.
2.2

PIPELINE FACILITIES

2.2.1

Pipeline

The Pipeline operating facilities would be designed for a maximum allowable operating
pressure (MAOP)of 1,440 psig and a capacity of 2.25 Bcf/d. The Pipeline facilities would be
located entirely within San Patricio County, Texas. A summary of facilities associated with the
Pipeline are discussed below.
Cheniere would construct approximately 23 miles of new 48-inch-diameter natural gas
pipeline, originating at the Terminal and routed primarily along an existing collocated electric
transmission and gas pipeline in San Patricio County, Texas. The Pipeline would terminate north
of Sinton at an interconnect with Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, LLC (Tennessee Gas).
Six meter and regulator (M&R)stations would be installed at interconnects along the
Pipeline. The Liquefaction M&R Station would be located at milepost (MP)0.0 and would be
remotely operated to feed gas to/from the Terminal. This station would include one
bi-directional M&R system with a 2.6 Bcf/d capacity, filter separators, liquid handling tanks, gas
chromatograph building, one pig trap on the 48-inch mainline, and pressure/flow control. The

In addition to the facilities listed above, Cheniere would also install five mainline valves
(MLV), as well as a pig launcher and receiver.8 MLVs would be installed at the Liquefaction
M&R Station, Taft Compressor Station, MP 14.5, Sinton Compressor Station, and the Tennessee
Gas M&R Station. A pig launcher would be installed at the Liquefaction M&R Station with a
pig receiver installed at the Tennessee Gas M&R Station.
2.2.2

Compressor Stations

Cheniere would construct two new compressor stations associated with the Pipeline. The
Taft Compressor Station would be constructed at approximate MP 7.5 and would be remotely
operated. The station would be located at an interconnect with a Texas Eastern and would
include two Solar Centaur 50 turbine/compressor units (6,387 horsepower [hp]each);one
compressor building to house both turbine/compressor units and to include suitable noise
abatement and overhead hoists;one auxiliary building with office space, bathrooms, and storage
for incidental spare parts for the compressor station;emergency power generator capabilities for
operation of the entire station;two suction headers (one mainline header and one for connection
to the Texas Eastern pipeline);filter separators;liquid handling tanks;and discharge gas coolers
associated with the Centaur 50 units.
The Sinton Compressor Station would be constructed at approximate MP 21.5. The
Sinton Compressor Station would be remotely operated and would include two Solar Titan 130
turbine/compressor units (20,387 hp each), one compressor building to house both
turbine/compressor units and to include suitable noise abatement and overhead hoists, one
auxiliary building with office space and storage for incidental spare parts for the station,
emergency power generator capabilities for operation of the entire station, two suction headers
(one mainline header and one for connection to the Tej
as system), filter separators, liquid
handling tanks, and discharge gas coolers associated with the Titan 130 units.
2.3

LAND AND WATER REQUIREMENTS

2.3.1

Terminal Facilities

Cheniere estimates that approximately 991 acres would be affected by construction of the
Terminal including the marine basin and berths. Following construction, 349 acres would
continue to be impacted by operation and maintenance dredging and another 120 acres would be
part of an exclusion zone. Table 2.3-1 lists the land and water requirements for the Terminal
facilities. The maj
ority of the land at the Terminal site is previously disturbed and includes areas
that were used for stockpiling bauxite. Water requirements associated with the Terminal include
part of the marine berths and basin, a tug dock, a boat launch, and part of the exclusion zone.

The 48-inch-diameter Pipeline would be installed adj
acent to a high voltage overhead
powerline and existing natural gas pipelines along approximately 86 percent of the route.
Construction of the Pipeline would require the use of a 120-foot-wide construction right-of-way
consisting of 50 feet of permanent and 70 feet of temporary right-of-way in uplands. In
wetlands, the construction right-of-way would be 75 feet (consisting of 50 feet permanent and
Environmental Impact Statement

Corpus Christi LNG

25 feet temporary right-of-way). The construction right-of-way would be collocated in some
areas and may overlap with other existing rights-of-way.
The 120-foot-wide construction right-of-way would be necessary to accommodate both
the increased trench depth and width necessary to install a 48-inch-diameter pipe. Due to the
depth of the soils in the area, additional space would be required to store trench spoil and
segregated topsoil. The right-of-way would also provide heavy equipment operators the
necessary area to maintain safe and efficient separation distances between the potentially
unstable trench sidewalls and their equipment. The increased construction right-of-way would
also ensure adequate separation between adj
acent foreign pipelines or high voltage overhead
power lines and the construction activities.
Although Cheniere has routed its pipeline to be adj
acent to existing utility or road
rights-of-way for about 86 percent of the proposed route, it has not provided site-specific
configurations for its construction right-of-way by milepost since the pipeline design has not
been finalized. Cheniere would provide this information once the pipeline easement negotiation
process is complete. Cheniere indicates that it may be able to collocate or overlap its
construction right-of-way with other utility or road rights-of-way. Collocation of the pipeline
and/or overlapping construction right-of-way would further minimize the construction footprint
on properties crossed, thus minimizing impacts on affected resources. Table 2.3-3 below
provides the milepost locations where pipeline construction may be adj
acent to existing utilities
or road rights-of-way, and the direction. Because the final pipeline design has not been
provided, and to further reduce construction footprint of the pipeline construction workspace, we
recommend that:
 Prior to construction of the pipeline,Cheniere should update table 2.3-3of the draft
EISto identifythe existing utilities/road locations and the milepost ranges of where
its construction right-of-waywould overlap or collocate other utility/road rights-ofway; and revise its final alignment sheets to reflect the actual right-of-way
configurations and workspace needs at these locations.

Additional temporary workspace (ATWS)would also be utilized in areas requiring
specialized construction techniques such as road and waterbody crossings. Following the
completion of construction, the temporary construction right-of-way and ATWS areas would be
restored to preconstruction conditions and a 50-foot permanent easement would be required for
operation and maintenance of the Pipeline.
The Taft Compressor Station would require approximately 6.9 acres of land for
construction and 5.8 acres of land for operation. The Sinton Compressor Station would require
approximately 17.2 acres of land for construction and 7.3 acres for operation. Construction of all
of the M&R stations would require less than 2.5 acres for construction and operation. The
specific land requirements associated with each M&R station is provided in table 2.3-2.
Cheniere would also install a permanent pig launcher within the Liquefaction M&R Station and a
permanent pig receiver within the Tennessee Gas M&R Station. The launcher and receiver
would be entirely contained within the respective M&R station and would not require additional
land.
A total of five MLVs would be placed along the Pipeline including one at MP 0.0, one at
the Taft Compressor Station (MP 7.5), one at MP 14.5, one at the Sinton Compressor Station
(MP 21.5), and one at MP 23.0. All of the MLVs would be contained within a proposed M&R
facility or compressor station and would not require any additional temporary or permanent
workspace, with the exception of the MLV at MP 14.5. This MLV would be located within the
permanent easement of the Pipeline and would require a construction and operation area of 0.2
acre.
The maj
ority of the access roads that would be used during construction and operation of
the Proj
ect are existing roads that would require minor improvements, including maintenance
and adding rock. Two new permanent roads would be constructed comprising approximately 0.2
acre. In total, access roads used during construction would utilize approximately 20.1 acres of
land, including the approximately 12.7 acres that would be utilized during operation.
2.4

CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES

The Proj
ect facilities would be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in
accordance with federal standards which are intended to adequately protect the public by
preventing or mitigating LNG and natural gas pipeline failures or accidents, and ensure safe
operation of the facilities. The Terminal would be constructed according to the standards
outlined by the DOT Federal Safety Standards for Liquefied Natural Gas Facilities at
49CFR 193, and the NFPA’s Standards for the Production, Storage, and Handling of LNG
(NFPA 59A). The marine areas associated with the Terminal would comply with the applicable
sections of the Coast Guard regulations for Waterfront Facilities Handling LNG at 33 CFR 127
and Executive Order 10173.
The Pipeline facilities would comply with DOT regulations at 49 CFR 192,
Transportation of Natural or Other Gas by Pipeline: Minimum Federal Safety Standards. These
regulations specify material selection, design criteria, corrosion protection, and qualifications for
welders and operation personnel. Additionally, Cheniere would comply with the Commission’s
regulations at 18 CFR 380.15, regarding the siting and maintenance of pipeline rights-of-way.
Cheniere indicated that the Proj
ect would implement and adhere to our Upland Erosion
Control, Revegetation, and Maintenance Plan (Plan)and Wetland and Waterbody Construction
Environmental Impact Statement

2-17

Corpus Christi LNG

and Mitigation Procedures (Procedures) 2013 version with no alternative measures.
Additionally, Cheniere has developed a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC)
Plan for both the Terminal and the Pipeline. We have reviewed this plan and find it acceptable.
Prior to the commencement of construction, affected landowners would be notified of the
start of construction and would be provided with the contact information for Cheniere in the
event that they have a construction‐related concern (see section 2.5.1 for additional information
on Cheniere’s complaint resolution procedures).
2.4.1

Construction Schedule

On September 16, 2013, Cheniere filed a revised construction schedule stating that
Cheniere anticipates construction of the Terminal would take approximately 60 months (5 years)
from the onset of site preparation activities until the startup of Train 3, with substantial
completion of Train 1 planned for late 2017. Construction of the Pipeline and aboveground
facilities is anticipated to take approximately one year to complete. The Pipeline is currently
planned for construction in 2016.
2.4.2

Terminal Facilities

2.4.2.1

Construction of Liquefaction Facilities

During the site-works phase of construction, Cheniere would cut necessary drainage
ditches in laydown areas to allow proper surface water runoff, place gravel surfaces for
temporary construction facilities (i.e., parking lots, office areas, and laydown areas), install
temporary construction fencing, and construct roads within the Terminal site boundaries.
Activities associated with the site-works phase of construction may occur concurrently with
other construction activities at the Terminal.
Cheniere would install the foundations for equipment, buildings, and pipe racks on spread
footings. Following installation of the pipe racks, the pipe would be installed from multiple
directions. Fabrication of pipe spools would be conducted in a covered area and structural steel
members would be prefabricated off-site and erected upon arrival. The maj
ority of the straight
run pipe would be fabricated on or near the site prior to placement on the pipe racks. Pipe
expansion loops would be prefabricated, transported to the site, and erected with the straight run
piping. Pipe would be painted to the maximum extent practicable at the fabrication shops
off-site, after all welds have been tested in accordance with applicable codes.
When practicable, large equipment would arrive at site in preassembled packages to
facilitate final hook-up and testing. All equipment would be designed, fabricated, and tested by
highly qualified specialist suppliers at their respective facilities. Equipment would only be
shipped to the site after the necessary inspections and testing are complete. Larger equipment,
such as cold boxes, acid gas absorber, and the refrigerant compressors, would be offloaded at the
roll on/roll off construction dock on a multi-wheel transport crawler, and transported to their
foundations. Other materials and equipment would be delivered to the site by truck.
Installation of the equipment would occur concurrently with the installation of the pipe
on the pipe rack to allow for a more seamless tie-in at the main process areas. Construction of
other buildings, including warehouse and control buildings, would also occur concurrently with
pipe rack installation. Cheniere would coordinate the arrival of the maj
or equipment with the
completion and curing of the respective foundation so that the equipment can be placed on its
Environmental Impact Statement

2-18

Corpus Christi LNG

foundation when it arrives, minimizing handling and the potential for intermediate storage on
site.
Painting and insulation work would be completed as the piping installation, hydrostatic
testing, pneumatic testing, and equipment erection is completed. After all equipment and piping
has been installed, Cheniere would begin the final road paving, site grading, landscaping, and
cleanup. The temporary construction facilities would be demobilized on a progressive basis as
they are no longer necessary
2.4.2.2

Construction of LNG Vaporization Facilities

LNG vaporization and natural gas send-out facilities would be constructed in the same
manner as the liquefaction facilities described above.
2.4.2.3

Construction of Marine Terminal and LNG Transfer Lines

The LNG berths would be dredged to a depth of -46 feet North American Vertical Datum
of 1988 (NAVD 88)with an additional 2 feet for advanced maintenance and 2 feet paid allowed
overdredge to ensure minimum depth and 3:1 side slopes are met. Hydraulically dredged
materials would be used to fill a portion of a former clay borrow pit and to assist in the
facilitation of capping bauxite residue beds.
The primary materials that would be used in the marine berth construction are steel-pipe
pilings, concrete, and reinforcing steel for concrete. Cheniere anticipates that the steel-pipe piles
would be fabricated offsite and delivered to the site by barge. The concrete would either be
produced in a batch at the main Terminal site or purchased from a local supplier.
Each of the two LNG carrier berths would contain at least four breasting dolphins and six
mooring structures that would be constructed to provide flexibility in berthing the full size range
of design vessels. One j
etty platform would be constructed in each berthing area and would
consist of a single level, pile-supported concrete platform with a design elevation of 37 feet. The
surface of the platforms would slope towards the shore in order to drain rainwater and potential
LNG discharges. Curbs would also be constructed to separate the LNG areas from the remainder
of the j
etty surfaces and at the perimeter of the j
etty platform, where necessary, to adhere to
Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements.
The j
etty platforms would each support fixed equipment including a j
etty substation
building, marine cryogenic liquid cargo transfer and vapor return arms, gangway tower/crane,
LNG and utility piping, fire suppression equipment, elevated access platforms, elected firewater
monitors, and a j
etty control building. The approach and pipe trestles would link the rear of the
j
etty platforms and the shore. Additionally, 4-foot catwalks would be installed to provide access
to mooring and breasting dolphins and to the shore.
Work on the marine berth platforms, approach, and pipe trestles would begin first to
allow installation of equipment and piping. All steel pilings would be coated with coal tar epoxy
from a point 15 feet below the mudline or groundline, to the soffit of the pile cap. Pile driving
would last approximately 4 to 6 months. Concrete filled high-density polyethylene pipe sleeves
would be required for all piling under the pipe trestle to provide splash zone corrosion resistance.
During construction, the dredging operations around the Terminal berth that would occur
over a period of months would accommodate passing commercial vessel traffic. A moving
exclusion zone around the LNG carrier would be expected to limit the movements of other
Environmental Impact Statement

2-19

Corpus Christi LNG

vessels for the relatively brief period while an LNG carrier is transiting to or from the Terminal’s
berth. In other ports with LNG terminals and comparable levels of vessel traffic, such moving
exclusion zones have caused inconvenience at times but have not had sustained significant
impacts on other commercial users of the channel. A stationary exclusion zone around the berth,
likely up to the edge of the La Quinta Channel, would limit the ability of other vessels to
approach the LNG carrier but would not restrict their ability to proceed past the Terminal within
the La Quinta Channel.
2.4.2.4

TemporaryConstruction Facilities

Main construction offices would be located on-site or in a nearby construction laydown
or parking area. This area would provide common office areas for all contractors and parking
areas outside the boundaries of the main construction areas. Other temporary construction
facilities that would be constructed as needed include support/satellite offices, warehousing,
lunchrooms, temporary access roads, parking lots, and material laydown storage. These facilities
can be mobilized without significant preparation work. Additional temporary facilities, primary
laydown areas, parking, and dredge disposal would be located on site or in close proximity to the
site.
The permanent site grading for drainage would be directed to an outfall on the western
perimeter of the Terminal site to ensure proper drainage during construction and operation. To
facilitate this, a system of drainage ditches would be constructed and would connect to a larger
existing drainage ditch that runs along the western edge of the site and flows into the La Quinta
Ship Channel. A Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP)to control sediment and silt
would be implemented during construction. Site preparation and laydown areas would be
located in an area northwest of the Terminal and would include the installation of construction
power, communications, and water. The primary employee parking area for construction
personnel would be located north of the Terminal site.
Cheniere would have maj
or construction equipment delivered primarily by barge. To
accommodate these deliveries, Cheniere would construct a new roll-on/roll-off area for
unloading equipment from barges to the west of the LNG carrier berths.
2.4.3

Pipeline Facilities

Prior to the start of construction, Cheniere would complete all surveys, locate the
centerline and construction workspaces, and complete land or easement acquisition as needed. If
the necessary easements cannot be obtained through good faith negotiations with property
owners, and the Commission has issued a Certificate for the Proj
ect, Cheniere may use the right
of eminent domain granted under Section 7(h)of the NGA and the Rules of Civil Procedure to
obtain easements. Cheniere would site, construct, operate, and maintain all Pipeline facilities in
accordance with all applicable federal and state regulations and industry standards. Figure 2.4-1
shows the typical construction sequence used for an overland pipeline construction spread as
summarized below.

Standard Construction and Restoration Techniques

Clearing and Grading
Clearing operations would include removal of vegetation within the construction right-ofway and the temporary construction workspace either by mechanical means or by hand-cutting.
The right-of-way limits would be identified and flagged in the field prior to clearing. Following
clearing, the construction right-of-way and ATWS would be graded as necessary to allow for
safe passage of equipment and to prepare a relatively level work surface for pipeline
construction. Bulldozers would typically perform grading activities.
Trenching
The pipeline ditch would be excavated to the appropriate depth to allow for burial of the
pipe with at least 3 feet of cover as required by 49CFR Part 192 of the DOT regulations. The
trench would be dug with an excavator or ditching machine and the excavated material would be
placed on the spoil side of the trench within the construction right-of-way. Based on available
data, shallow bedrock would not be encountered within the trench depth and blasting would not
be necessary. If water needs to be removed from the trench, the water would be pumped to a
well-vegetated upland area off the right-of-way and/or filtered through a filter bag or siltation
barrier.
Pipe Stringing, Coating, Bending, and Welding
Following excavation of the trench, the pipe would be strung along the trench. The pipe
would be hauled in sections to the right-of-way via a truck from the pipe storage yard. The pipe
would be off loaded and placed next to the trench using a side-boom tractor or vacuum hoe.
Following stringing the pipe sections would be bent as necessary to fit the vertical and
horizontal contours of the trench. A bending engineer would survey the trench to determine the
location and extent of each field bend. Appropriate bends would be made with a hydraulic pipebending machine. The pipe j
oints would then be lined up end-to-end to allow for welding into
continuous lengths (strings).
All welding would be performed in accordance with API Standard No. 1104. Individual
pipe sections would be welded in two steps. A front-end welding crew would perform the first
step, which would be to clean and align the pipe bevels in preparation for welding and to place at
least the first two passes in the welding process. Back-end welders would perform the section
step, which would be to complete the welds started by the front-end crew. The pipe would be
welded into long strings to minimize the number of welds that have to be made in the trench (tiein welds). Gaps in the welding process would often be left at waterbody/wetland crossings, road
crossings, and other locations where access across the work area is required.
The pipe lengths would be coated (typically with a heat applied epoxy)at a coating mill
prior to being delivered to the Proj
ect site. The ends of each pipe section would be left bare to
allow for welding. After welds have been inspected and approved, the weld areas would be field
coated by a coating crew. The pipe coating would be inspected using equipment that emits an
electrical charge, since pipeline coatings are electrically insulating.
Following welding, each weld would be inspected to ensure the structural integrity is
consistent with 49 CFR Part 192 of the DOT regulations. Radiographs or ultrasonic images

2-22

Corpus Christi LNG

would be taken and processed on site for real-time results. Those welds that do not meet the
requirements established by the API Standard 1104 would be marked for repair or replacement.
Lowering-In and Backfilling
The trench would be dewatered and cleared of any debris, as necessary before the pipe is
lowered into the trench by side-boom tractors. Once the pipe strings have been lowered in, a tiein crew would make the final welds in the trench. The final welds would then be inspected and
coated. All suitable material excavated from the trench would be replaced during backfilling. In
areas where excavated material is unsuitable for backfilling, additional fill may be brought in
from offsite. In areas where topsoil was separated, the subsoil would be placed into the trench
first and the topsoil would be spread over top. In non-wetland areas the top of the trench may be
slightly crowned to compensate for potential settling. The soil would be inspected for
compaction and scarified as necessary. After backfilling is complete, the pipe would be cleaned
of any internal dirt, water, or debris by pipeline pigs that are propelled through the pipeline by air
pressure.
Hydrostatic Testing
Following the completion of backfilling and cleaning, the pipeline would be pressure
tested to ensure its integrity for the intended service and operating pressure. Water would be
used to hydrostatically test the pipe and the water is normally obtained from water sources
crossed by the pipeline, including available municipal supply lines. The water would be pumped
from the water source into the pipe and would propel a pig through the pipe in a manner that fills
it with water. A high pressure pump would be used to add water to the test section and to
increase the test pressure. At the completion of the hydrostatic test, the pressure would be
removed from the test section by propelling the pig with air and dewatering the pipe. Additional
“drying”pig runs would be made, as necessary, to remove any residual water from the pipe.
Hydrostatic testing is also addressed in section 4.3 of this EIS.
Cleanup and Restoration
All work areas would be final-graded and restored as closely to preconstruction
conditions as possible. Prior to final grading, all construction debris would be picked up along
the right-of-way. Permanent erosion control structures, such as slope breakers, would be
installed during final grading in accordance with our Plan. Our Plan requires that restoration be
completed within 20 days of backfilling, unless prevented by inclement weather conditions.
Private property such as fences, field roads, and driveways would be restored or repaired as
necessary.
Revegetation would be accomplished by seeding disturbed areas in accordance with the
recommendations of the local office of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Natural
Resource Conservation Service (NRCS)or as requested by the landowner. Seeding would not be
required in actively cultivated croplands, unless specifically requested by the landowner.
Revegetation is further discussed in section 4.5 of this EIS.
2.4.3.2

Specialized Construction Techniques

Waterbody Construction Methods
To minimize potential impacts, waterbodies would be crossed in accordance with our
Procedures and the crossings would be implemented as quickly and safely as possible. With the
Environmental Impact Statement

2-23

Corpus Christi LNG

exception of the waterbodies that would be crossed by horizontal directional drill (HDD),
waterbodies would be crossed using conventional excavator-type equipment and wet-crossing
techniques, or by horizontal bore. Upland and agricultural swales, ditches, or other such
conveyances would be crossed using either a wet-crossing technique if water is flowing at the
time of crossing, or best management practices (BMPs)as determined by the Environmental
Inspector (EI)if there is no flow at the time of crossing. Additional information regarding
waterbody crossing methods is provided in section 4.3 of this EIS.
Except where reasonable alternative access is available, temporary construction
equipment crossings would be installed across waterbodies to gain access along the right-of-way
for construction. After equipment crossings are established, construction equipment would not
be permitted to drive through a waterbody for access and the equipment crossing would be
removed once access in the area is no longer needed. Only the equipment necessary to construct
the crossing and install the pipe would be allowed to work in the waterbody.
To facilitate pipeline construction across waterbodies, ATWS may be needed adj
acent to
waterbodies to assemble and fabricate the pipe as necessary to complete the crossings. The
ATWS would be located at least 50 feet away from the waterbody, except in actively cultivated
croplands or other disturbed areas, as required by our Procedures. In areas where ATWS is
required to be set back from the waterbody, vegetation would not be cleared between the ATWS
and the waterbody.
Following installation, a minimum of 3 feet of cover would be placed over the pipe.
Waterbody bed and bank contours would be restored to preconstruction conditions and the banks
would be stabilized as soon as possible following construction activities. Permanent erosion
control structures would be maintained to minimize erosion. Following construction,
waterbodies would be inspected regularly to ensure that temporary erosion controls are
functioning properly and that revegetation is progressing satisfactorily.
Horizontal Directional Drill
HDD is a pipeline construction method that minimizes surface impacts by drilling a hole
and pulling the pipe through it rather than digging a trench. HDD requires drilling of a small
diameter hole, or pilot hole, along a predetermined design path that originates and terminates on
the surface. The pilot hole is then enlarged sufficiently to accommodate the pipe to be installed.
The pipe may or may not be installed concurrently with the hole enlargement depending upon
the final diameter of the enlarged hole and the soil conditions encountered.
Active Croplands
In accordance with our Plan, topsoil would be segregated in actively cultivated or rotated
agricultural lands, pastures, and hayfields, unless otherwise approved in writing by the
landowner prior to the commencement of grading activities. After the pipe has been lowered
into the trench, the subsoil would be used for backfilling and the topsoil would be spread across
the graded right-of-way. In active croplands, the depth of cover would be 4 feet unless otherwise
specified. Soil compaction would be treated, as necessary, in accordance with our Plan.
Prior to construction, Cheniere would work with affected landowners to identify any
drain tiles within the construction workspace. Any drain tiles damaged during construction
would be repaired to landowner specifications or to preconstruction conditions. At this time
Cheniere has not identified any existing drain tiles along the route.
Environmental Impact Statement

2-24

Corpus Christi LNG

Road Crossings
The crossing method used for a particular road would be dependent upon site-specific
conditions and state and local statutes. Prior to construction, Cheniere would contact the “One
Call”or “Call Before You Dig”system to verify and mark all utilities along the construction
workspaces. Generally, Cheniere would bore under paved roadways. Boring entails drilling a
hole below the roadway through which the pipe would pass. First, a bore pit is dug on one side
of the roadway and a receiving pit is dug on the other side. The bore pit is excavated to a depth
equal to the depth of the trench and is graded such that the bore would follow the grade of the
pipe. A boring machine is lowered into the bore pit and placed on supports. The machine cuts a
shaft under the roadway using a cutting head mounted on an auger. The auger rotates in a
casing, both of which are pushed forward as the hole is cut. The pipe is then pushed through the
casing.
During the open cut method of crossing a roadway, at least one lane of traffic would be
kept open when constructing on or across residential streets. During the brief period when the
road is completely cut, steel plates would be available on-site to cover the trench to permit travel
by emergency vehicles. Traffic lanes and home access would be maintained except for the
temporary periods necessary for installing the pipe.
2.4.3.3

Aboveground Facilities

Aboveground facilities associated with the Proj
ect would include M&R stations, MLVs,
pig launchers and receivers, and compressor stations. Sites for the aboveground facilities would
be cleared and graded as described above for the pipeline installation. The area would be cleared
of trees, brush, and debris, and would be graded and compacted to surveyed elevations.
Where foundations are required for the aboveground facilities, the ground would be
excavated and improved as needed for the installation of building foundations and pipe supports.
Forms and reinforcing bars would be installed in the excavated areas, as necessary, and high
strength concrete would be poured to the appropriate levels for the maj
or equipment. Concrete
pours would be randomly sampled and tested to verify compliance with specifications. All
concrete would then be properly cured to the desired strength.
After the foundations have sufficiently cured, installation of buildings and machinery
would begin. At compressor station sites, installation of the machinery, buildings, and piping
would be concurrent. The steel frames of the buildings would be erected first, followed by
interior walls, insulation, exterior walls, and the roof. Cut-outs that allow for protrusion for inlet
and exhaust vents through the siding would be flashed to ensure that the buildings are weather
tight. Each building would be acoustically insulated and silencers would be installed on the
engine exhaust stacks and the air intakes to abate noise.
Installation of aboveground piping systems would begin concurrently with the foundation
work. Piping would require welding except where the piping is connected to flanged or threaded
components. Aboveground piping would be installed on concrete or metal pipe supports and
would be painted. Electrical conduit systems would also be installed. Once the structures and
equipment are set on foundations, they would be connected to the piping and electrical conduit
systems. Electrical wiring would be installed to provide power and connect instrumentation to
control systems.

Environmental Impact Statement

2-25

Corpus Christi LNG

As each system is completed, they would be tested and calibrated to ensure proper
operation. Aboveground piping would be hydrostatically tested. Controls and safety devices
such as the emergency shutdown system, relief valves, gas and fire detection facilities, and other
safety devices would be checked and tested. The compressor units would be operated on a trial
basis following completion of the piping and mechanical work to ensure proper operation of the
safety and protective devices. The trial operation would involve several short duration runs
conducted over the course of several days. Start-up of the compressor units would commence
once all testing is complete.
2.5

OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE

The Terminal would employ approximately 175 full-time staff. All permanent personnel
would be trained in LNG safety, cryogenic operations, and proper operation of all equipment.
Operators would meet all of the training requirements of the DOT minimum federal safety
standards specified in 49CFR Parts 192 and 193. The standards imposed are in accordance with
the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1969, as amended.
The Terminal would be a bidirectional facility capable of loading and unloading LNG
cargoes to/from the LNG carriers, liquefying natural gas from the Pipeline to produce LNG, and
vaporizing stored LNG and sending the resultant natural gas into the Pipeline. Once Cheniere
decides on its customers, it would be determined whether the facility would be in liquefaction or
vaporization mode.
Operating procedures would be developed for the facilities, and extensive training would
be provided for operational personnel to ensure that they are familiar with and understand the
importance of adherence to safety procedures. These procedures would provide functional
requirements for the control and safeguarding systems, to include addressing safe start-up,
normal shutdowns, emergency shutdowns, fire, gas, and spills, as well as routine operation and
monitoring.
The LNG carriers would enter Corpus Christi Bay from the Gulf and transit between the
Terminal and the Gulf under the command of the ship’s master with local pilots to provide
specialized navigational-related advice. Together, they would decide whether the existing and
anticipated environmental conditions allow safe entry and transit between the Gulf and the
Terminal via the Aransas Pass Channel, Corpus Christi Channel, and the La Quinta Channel.
The pilots would be assigned by the ship’s master to direct the maneuvering of the LNG carrier
in the harbor with the assistance of accompanying tugboats as necessary. The pilots would
continue to advise the ship’s master during the berthing and securing of the ship’s mooring lines
until the LNG carrier is securely moored at the Terminal’s berth.
The cargo transfer arms would be coupled to the LNG carrier’s manifold by the
Terminal’s personnel. A communications and linked ESD system umbilical cable deployed
between the ship and the Terminal would connect these critical functions between cargo control
systems during the period that the cargo transfer arms remain connected. The emergency
shutdown system would be tested from both the ship and Terminal control rooms before cargo
transfer operations begin.
The ship and Terminal operators would prepare and align their respective side’s cargo
systems and valves after performing the required safety checks and procedures so that LNG
cargo transfer between the ship and the Terminal can begin. During all cargo transfer operations,

Corpus Christi LNG

the LNG carrier’s manifold would be continuously visually monitored by the ship duty personnel
and also remotely by video cameras mounted on the j
etty platform which transmit real-time
video to display monitors located in both the j
etty and main control rooms. Additionally, a
security guard would be located at the facility entrance and continuously staffed 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.
Facility maintenance would be conducted in accordance with 49 CFR 193 Subpart G.
The full-time maintenance staff would conduct routine maintenance and minor overhauls. Maj
or
overhauls and other maj
or maintenance would be handled by soliciting the services of trained
contract personnel to perform the maintenance. All scheduled and unscheduled maintenance
would be entered into a computerized maintenance management system. All personnel would be
trained on the use of this system.
Scheduled maintenance, such as preventive and predictive maintenance of equipment
would be input into the system to automatically print out work orders either on a time basis or on
hours of operation, depending on the requirement. Scheduled maintenance would be performed
on safety and environmental equipment, instrumentation, and any other equipment that requires
maintenance on a routine basis. When a problem is detected that requires unscheduled
maintenance attention, the person that detects the problem would enter it into the computerized
maintenance management system. If a problem requires immediate attention, the appropriate
person would be notified.
The Pipeline would be patrolled on a routine basis and personnel qualified to perform
both emergency and routine maintenance on interstate natural gas pipeline facilities would
handle all maintenance.
The Pipeline and associated facilities would be operated and maintained in a manner such
that pipeline integrity is maintained in the interest of assuring that a safe, continuous supply of
natural gas reaches its ultimate destination. Maintenance activities would include regularly
scheduled gas leak surveys and measures necessary to repair any potential leaks. The latter may
include repair or replacement of pipe segments. All fence posts, signs, marker posts, aerial
markers, and decals would be painted or replaced to ensure that the pipeline locations would be
visible from the air and ground. All valves would be periodically inspected and greased.
Additionally, the Pipeline would be patrolled from the air periodically which would
provide information on possible leaks, construction activities, erosion, exposed pipe, population
density, possible encroachment, and other potential problems that may affect the safety or
integrity of the Pipeline. Cathodic protection units installed along the Pipeline would be
regularly maintained.
Other maintenance functions would include periodic seasonal mowing of the permanent
easement in accordance with our Plan and Procedures, terrace repair, backfill replacement, and
periodic inspection of water crossings. During pipeline easement maintenance, Cheniere would
not use herbicides or pesticides within 100 feet of a wetland or waterbody unless approved by the
appropriate state and local agencies.
2.5.1

Environmental Compliance and Monitoring

Cheniere would implement environmental compliance and monitoring requirements from
our Plan and Procedures during construction of the Terminal and Pipeline. They would also
incorporate compliance and monitoring requirements from federal, state, and local permits
Environmental Impact Statement

2-27

Corpus Christi LNG

obtained for the Proj
ect. To ensure environmental compliance, Cheniere would provide all
contractors with copies of all construction procedures, plans and specifications, a construction
drawing package, and all environmental permits, certificates, and/or clearances associated with
the Proj
ect prior to construction.
Additionally, Cheniere would conduct environmental training for its field personnel and
contractors. This training would focus on the implementation of Cheniere’s construction
procedures, techniques and plans, other Proj
ect-specific permit conditions, and impact
minimization measures. Cheniere would ensure that training personnel provide thorough
training sessions regarding the environmental requirements, all individuals receive
environmental training prior to starting work, adequate training records are kept, and refresher
training is provided as needed to maintain high awareness of environmental requirements.
Cheniere would employ one or more EI(s)to ensure that environmental conditions
associated with permits or authorizations are satisfied. The EI(s)would be onsite daily to
monitor and document environmental compliance and report to the Commission on a weekly
basis regarding Proj
ect activities. The EI(s)duties would include, but not be limited to, ensuring
compliance with all environmental commitments, construction procedures, techniques and plans,
and all permit conditions and requirements. The EI(s) would also verify construction
workspaces prior to use, confirm that all sensitive resources are properly marked, and ensure
proper installation and maintenance of all erosion control devices. The EI(s)would have peer
status with all other inspectors, would have the authority to enforce permit and FERC
environmental conditions, to issue stop-activity orders, and impose corrective actions to maintain
environmental compliance.
In addition to the EI(s), contractors and construction work areas would be subj
ect to
periodic inspections throughout construction and restoration phases of the Proj
ect, by federal,
state, and local agencies including the Commission. Representatives of these agencies could
require the implementation of additional and/or corrective environmental measures. These
representatives could also issue work stoppages, impose fines, and recommend additional actions
in response to environmental compliance failures. Inspection reports prepared by us would be
entered into the Commission’s public record. Inspection reports prepared by other agencies
would be made available per their respective policies and guidelines.
Cheniere has developed protocols, in complaint resolution procedures, to handle
complaints received from landowners. Cheniere would designate one Issues Resolution
Coordinator, who would be responsible for making sure that all reported complaints and issues
are communicated internally and that timely responses are provided to the callers. In addition,
right‐of‐way agents or other staff of Cheniere receiving phone calls from landowners identifying
complaints or other issues would log the calls into a file that contains the specific information
about the complaint. The Proj
ect personnel would notify the Issues Resolution Coordinator with
the details of the call. The Issues Resolution Coordinator would then contact the construction
field office and discuss the issue with the appropriate individual, (e.g., Right‐of‐Way
Representative, Chief Inspector, or Lead EI)and determine the necessary steps and timeframe to
resolve the issue. In addition, landowners would be supplied with a copy of the FERC’s helpline
information in the event they need to contact FERC. The Issues Resolution Coordinator would
then contact the original caller as soon as practicable, but no later than 48 hours after the initial
call, to explain how the issue is to be resolved and the expected timeframe for the resolution to
occur. The Issues Resolution Coordinator would then follow up with the appropriate
Environmental Impact Statement

2-28

Corpus Christi LNG

construction representative to ensure that the resolution has been or is scheduled to be
implemented as indicated to the caller. The Issues Resolution Coordinator would notify the
Proj
ect Director, Right‐of‐Way Manager, and Environmental Manager of the issue and the
agreed upon resolution and anticipated timeframe. The Issues Resolution Coordinator would
record the resolution plan and would track and report all calls received and the resolution plans
on a regular basis to coincide with the construction reporting schedule for the FERC. A final
phone call would be made to the caller within 24 hours after completion of the resolution plan.
Parties concerned with environmental compliance may contact the Commission’s Dispute
Resolution Service (DRS). The DRS is a professional team that promotes timely and high
quality resolution of disputes. DRS specialists are highly trained in mediation, negotiation, and
facilitation and are able to assist parties with the resolution of environmental compliance matters.

ALTERNATIVES
SECTION 3

3.0

ALTERNATIVES

As required by NEPA and Commission policy, we evaluated a number of alternatives to
the Proj
ect to determine if any would be reasonable and environmentally preferable to the
proposed action. Below, we discuss alternative actions for the Terminal facilities and Pipeline
facilities. The alternative actions include the no-action alternative, energy alternatives, systems
alternatives, and alternatives sites and pipeline routes for the Proj
ect.
The evaluation criteria for selecting potentially reasonable and environmentally
preferable alternatives include the following:
 technical and economic feasibility;
 significant environmental advantages over the proposed Proj
ect or segments of it;and
 ability to meet the Proj
ect obj
ectives for providing facilities necessary to import and
export LNG and deliver natural gas into the existing interstate and intrastate natural gas
pipeline system in the Corpus Christi, Texas area.
With respect to the first criterion, it is important to recognize that not all conceivable
alternatives are technically and economically feasible. Some alternatives may be impracticable
because of the cost, existing technologies, constraints of existing system capacities, and logistics
in light of the overall proj
ect obj
ectives. In conducting an alternatives analysis, it is also
important to consider the environmental advantages and disadvantages of the proposed action
and to focus the analysis on those alternatives that reduce impacts or offer a significant
environmental advantage.
Through the application of the evaluation criteria and subsequent environmental
comparisons, each alternative was considered until it was clear that the alternative was not
preferable to the proposed action because it would result in significantly greater environmental
or social impacts that could not be readily mitigated. Alternatives that appear to be the most
reasonable with similar levels of environmental impact are reviewed below.
3.1

TERMINAL FACILITIES

3.1.1

No-Action Alternative

Under the No-Action Alternative, the obj
ectives of the Proj
ect would not be met and
Cheniere would not provide the proposed natural gas transportation capacity for import or
export. In addition, the potential adverse and beneficial environmental impacts identified in
section 4.0 of this EIS would not occur.
Development of and production from conventional and unconventional gas formations
are occurring throughout many of areas of the U.S. and are proj
ected to continue for many years.
Cheniere indicated it could provide LNG to foreign countries at a competitive price and,
therefore, replace higher-cost shipments from other sources. Additionally, should market
demands shift in the future, the Proj
ect would have vaporization capabilities to allow LNG to be
imported, vaporized, and sent out for delivery to U.S. customers.
With or without the No-Action Alternative, other LNG export/import proj
ects could also
be developed elsewhere in the Gulf Coast region or in other areas of the U.S. resulting in both
adverse and beneficial environmental impacts to those of the proposed Proj
ect. Development of
Environmental Impact Statement

3-1

Corpus Christi LNG

any new LNG export terminals on previously undeveloped sites would likely result in similar or
greater environmental impacts, in both magnitude and duration, than those of the proposed
Proj
ect.
The No-Action Alternative could also require that potential end users make other
arrangements to obtain natural gas service, make use of alternative fossil fuel energy sources
(e.g., coal or fuel oil), or possibly make use of other traditional long-term fuel source alternatives
(e.g., nuclear power)and/or renewable energy sources (e.g., solar power)to compensate for the
reduced availability of natural gas that would otherwise be supplied by the proposed Proj
ect.
Although international energy conservation could also result from the No-Action Alternative,
that option is beyond the scope of this analysis.
3.1.2

Alternative EnergySources

It is important to consider alternative energy sources as part of the alternative selection
process. As noted above, implementing the No-Action Alternative could force potential natural
gas customers to seek other forms of energy. Traditional energy alternatives to natural gas
include coal, oil, hydroelectric, and nuclear power. Renewable energy resources such as solar,
ocean energy, biomass, wind, landfill gas, and municipal solid waste represent new, advanced
energy alternatives. Conceivably, each of these energy alternatives could support the generation
of new electric power, which is a maj
or consumer of natural gas along with residential heating,
commercial, and industrial uses.
The International Energy Agency (IEA)(2012b)reported that coal exports are increasing
and in the United States several new coal export proj
ects were recently proposed, suggesting that
in many international markets coal will remain competitive with natural gas in spite of coal’s
greater air emissions. EPA (2013)stated that compared to the average air emissions from coalfired generation, natural gas produces half as much CO2, less than a third as much nitrogen
oxides, and 1 percent as much sulfur oxides at power plants. Similarly, fuel oil is commonly
used for power generation in many countries and will continue to compete with natural gas as a
fuel source in spite of greater emissions. As a result, if the No-Action Alternative is selected, it
could result in a greater use of other fossil fuels and a potentially substantial increase of
environmental impacts as compared to the use of natural gas. However, many countries are
cognizant of the greater environmental impact of coal and fuel oil and prefer to use natural gas as
a fuel source.
There has been a recent renewed interest in electric power generation by nuclear energy.
However, because of the increasing demand in electricity consumption worldwide, the U.S.
Energy Information Administration (2012)estimates that the proportion of electricity generated
by nuclear power will decrease from 19percent to 15 percent. In addition, regulatory hurdles,
public concern over nuclear power and nuclear waste disposal, construction costs, and plant
construction lead times make it unlikely that nuclear generating capacity could be available to
serve all the markets targeted by the Proj
ect on a similar timeline. Further, plans for nuclear
power generation have been scaled back as countries reconsidered policies after the accident at
the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant near Fukushima, Japan, but capacity is still proj
ected
to rise, led by China, Korea, India, and Russia (IEA, 2012a).
Renewable energy may become an increasingly significant factor in meeting future
energy demands worldwide. As reported by IEA (2012a;2012b), renewables are proj
ected to
become the world’s second largest source of power generation by 2015, and are expected to
Environmental Impact Statement

3-2

Corpus Christi LNG

close in on coal as the primary source by 2035. However, this rapid increase hinges critically on
continued subsidies. In 2011, these subsidies (including for biofuels)amounted to $88 billion,
but to reach the proj
ection noted above, the subsidies would need to increase to $4.8 trillion by
2035 (IEA 2012a).
Hydropower is currently the largest source of renewable electric power generation
worldwide, and IEA expects this trend to continue through 2030. However, as with nuclear
power generation, there are high costs associated with developing substantial hydropower
proj
ects and long time periods between proj
ect conception and the production of electric power.
Other compromising renewable energy resources include solar, ocean energy, and
biomass. However, the cost of these types of renewable energy proj
ects is currently high per
energy output unit in comparison to natural gas-fired power generation. Photovoltaic production
in support of solar energy is increasing, and the cost of photovoltaic systems is decreasing, with
photovoltaic cells potentially able to greatly supplement electrical generation resources.
Ocean energy is a largely unexplored renewable resource. Technologies to capture ocean
energy are in their infancy, and environmental and engineering considerations are being studied
to better understand the implications of placement of power generating facilities in the ocean.
Entrepreneurs and scientists are exploring the emerging use of algae for biofuels and
other renewable energy applications, and are working to accelerate the development of
applications to use algal biomass. IEA (2012b) proj
ected electric power generation from
biomass technology to increase four-fold through 2035, but that time frame is well beyond the
planned startup and the currently requested authorization lifetime of proposed Proj
ect.
Further generation of electrical power by wind would require construction of new wind
turbines and additional electric transmission lines. Although this is likely to occur in many parts
of the world, it is also likely that such development will be slow-paced in most countries due to
the high cost of construction. In addition, wind power cannot be used for constant and reliable
energy production because of the variability in winds, and other power generation facilities are
commonly in place as backup facilities.
Electric generation from municipal waste and landfill methane are growing trends in
developed countries. Again, the cost of these facilities, including operating costs, is beyond the
means of many countries.
With regard to these renewable sources of energy, natural gas is often considered a
“bridge fuel”;a fuel that bridges the time between the dominant use of fossil fuels today and the
greater use of renewable energy sources in the future. Natural gas is cleaner burning than other
fossil fuels and can also reliably serve as backup fuel to renewable energy facilities, which often
provide power intermittently.
There is currently considerable momentum behind advancing renewable energy
technologies and moving toward more diversified energy sources. These advanced technologies,
either individually or in combination, will likely be important in addressing future energy
demands. Presumably, new energy technologies will continue to offset an increasing amount of
fossil fuels to meet growing energy demands, and that situation is not expected to change in the
next decade.
Although it is speculative and beyond the scope of this analysis to predict what action
might be taken by policy makers or end users in response to the No-Action Alternative, it is
Environmental Impact Statement

3-3

Corpus Christi LNG

possible that without the proposed Proj
ect, the energy needs may be met by alternative energy
sources, likely resulting in impacts on the environment. Alternative energy forms such as coal
and oil are available and could be used to meet increased demands for energy;however, natural
gas is a much cleaner-burning fuel. These other fossil fuels emit greater amounts of particulate
matter, sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), CO2, hydrocarbons, and non-criteria
pollutants. The use of nuclear energy as replacement of other fuel sources also carries
undesirable consequences, such as negative public perception of the safety of electric generation
through nuclear plants and the disposal of waste products created. Renewable energies, such as
solar, hydroelectric, and wind are not always reliable or available in sufficient quantities to
support most market requirements and would not necessarily be an appropriate substitute for
natural gas in all applications. Therefore, we have dismissed alternative energy sources as a
reasonable alternative to meet the Proj
ect obj
ectives.
3.1.3

System Alternatives

System alternatives are alternatives to the proposed action which would make use of
other existing, modified, or proposed facilities that would meet the stated purpose and need of
the proposed action. By definition, implementation of a system alternative would make it
unnecessary to construct part or all of the proposed action. However, additions or modifications
to the system alternatives may be required to increase capacity or provide receipt and delivery
capability consistent with that of the proposed Proj
ect. These additions or modifications could
result in environmental impacts that are less than, similar to, or greater than the environmental
impacts of the proposed facility.
Our analysis of system alternatives considers existing, or recently authorized or
proposed9 LNG import, export, and storage facilities located in the continental U.S. to replace all
or part of the Proj
ect. We considered whether any of the existing, recently authorized, proposed,
or planned LNG import and export terminal proj
ects could be viable system alternatives to the
Proj
ect. To be considered a viable system alternative, the existing or proposed proj
ect would
need to provide LNG carrier unloading, storage, and send-out capacities similar to Cheniere’s
proposal, in addition to current or planned expansion capacities for the terminals. Facilities
outside of the Gulf Region were not considered, because they do not meet the purpose and need
of the Terminal (due to the geographic region from which they are sourced).
For a system alternative to be viable, it must be technically and economically feasible. It
must also be compatible with any contractual agreements Cheniere may have relating to the
export of LNG. In addition, a viable system alternative would offer a significant environmental
advantage over the Proj
ect. The system alternatives considered in this analysis are depicted on
figure 3.1-1 and described below. Although we have considered each of the planned, proposed,
or recently authorized proj
ects below as potential system alternatives, the market would
ultimately decide which and how many of these facilities are built.

Proposed projects are proj
ects for which the proponent has submitted a formal application with the FERC;planned
proj
ects are proj
ects that have been announced but for which no formal application has been submitted.

Existing LNG Import Terminals with Planned, Proposed, or Authorized
Liquefaction Projects

There are six existing LNG import terminals in the southeastern United States along the
Gulf of Mexico:
 Cameron LNG, LLC (Cameron LNG)Terminal;
 Freeport LNG Development, LP (Freeport LNG)Terminal;
 Golden Pass Products, LLC (Golden Pass)Terminal
 Gulf LNG Energy, LLC (Gulf LNG)Terminal;
 Sabine Pass LNG, LP (Sabine Pass LNG)Terminal;and
 Trunkline LNG Company, LLC (Trunkline LNG)Lake Charles LNG Terminal.
The Sabine Pass Liquefaction Proj
ect is under construction and the other import terminals
are in regulatory review and permitting process for adding liquefaction and export capabilities.
Each of these facilities was considered as a system alternative to Cheniere’s proposed Proj
ect.
Cameron LNG Terminal
Cameron LNG is proposing to construct and operate a LNG liquefaction and export
facility adj
acent to the existing Cameron LNG Import Terminal in Cameron Parish, Louisiana
approximately 240 miles northeast of the proposed Terminal site (see figure 3.1-1). The
Cameron LNG Liquefaction Proj
ect would include three liquefaction trains and related facilities
and would be capable of exporting 12 million metric tons per year (mtpy)of LNG. Cameron
LNG entered the pre-filing process on May 9, 201210 and filed an application with the FERC on
December 7, 201211 (Docket No. CP13-25). Cameron LNG expects to begin delivering LNG to
international markets in 2017. A final EIS was issued for the Cameron LNG Liquefaction
Proj
ect on April 30, 2014.
Although the Cameron LNG Liquefaction Proj
ect is estimated to start operations around
the same time as Cheniere’s Proj
ect, it would require additional capacity to meet Cheniere’s
obj
ectives and any customer commitments. Cameron has not requested authorization for the
increased capacity and receipt of permits and approvals for the additional facilities that would be
needed to meet Cheniere’s obj
ectives. The increased time to acquire the necessary permits
would not meet Cheniere’s timeline of initial export in 2017. Cameron LNG’s application states
that Cameron LNG has executed long-term agreements for all of the proposed facility capacity,
which would make it a nonviable alternative for the planned capacity at the Terminal. In
addition, as proposed, the natural gas feedstock for the Proj
ect would be sourced from the south
Texas region and transporting this gas to Cameron LNG would require far greater transportation
costs, potential additional facilities, and the associated additional environmental impacts.
Therefore, the Cameron LNG Liquefaction Proj
ect was not considered to be a reasonable
alternative to the proposed Proj
ect and was removed from further consideration.

Freeport LNG Terminal
The Freeport LNG Terminal is on Quintana Island in Brazoria County, Texas. The
import terminal, which started operations in 2008, includes two 160,000 m3 LNG storage tanks
and a single berth capable of handling LNG carriers in excess of 200,000 m3. It has a peak send
out capability of approximately 1.5 Bcf of natural gas.
Freeport LNG Expansion, LP and FLNG Liquefaction, LLC (collectively, FLEX)
propose to add liquefaction facilities to its existing terminal to provide export capacity of
approximately 13.2 mtpy of LNG. The existing Freeport LNG Terminal is about 150 miles
northeast of the proposed Terminal site (see figure 3.1-1). This proj
ect would require
approximately 86 acres for three proposed trains, each with a capacity of 4.4 mtpy. FLEX filed
two separate applications to the DOE/FE to export LNG to Free Trade Agreement countries,
each for export of 511 Bcf per year. The DOE/FE approved the applications in February 2011
and 2012. On December 17 2010, FLEX submitted an application to the DOE/FE to export LNG
to non-Free Trade Agreement nations, and the DOE/FE authorized such export on May 17, 2013.
FLEX filed its application with the FERC in August 201212. A draft EIS for the Freeport LNG
Expansion Proj
ect was issued on March 14, 2014.
On July 31, 2012, Freeport LNG Expansion signed a 20-year agreement with Osaka Gas
and Chubu Electric for 100 percent of the first train (4.4 mtpy), and in February 2013 signed a
20-year agreement with BP for all of the second train (4.4 mtpy). In September 2013, FLEX
signed separate liquefaction tolling contracts with Japan’s Toshiba Corp and South Korea’s SK
E&S for all of the third train (4.4 mtpy).
FLEX anticipates start-up for the first liquefaction train in November 2016, with full
service anticipated 48 to 54 months after initiation of construction, or 2020 to 2021. Although
the Freeport LNG Expansion is estimated to start operations prior to Cheniere’s Proj
ect, it would
not produce at full capacity until after the planned full capacity date of the Terminal. In addition,
the full capacity of the Freeport LNG Expansion is contracted and use of the Freeport LNG
Terminal as a system alternative to meet Cheniere’s obj
ectives and any customer commitments
would require that FLEX construct and operate three additional liquefaction trains and associated
facilities, as well as additional import facilities, similar to those of the Proj
ect which would likely
result in similar environmental impacts. However, FLEX has not requested authorization for the
increased capacity and receipt of permits and approvals for the additional facilities that would be
needed to meet Cheniere’s obj
ectives. The increased time to acquire the necessary permits
would not meet Cheniere’s timeline of initial export in 2017. Therefore, the Freeport
Liquefaction Proj
ect was not considered to be significantly environmentally preferable or a
reasonable alternative to the proposed Proj
ect and was removed from further consideration.
Golden Pass Terminal
The Golden Pass Terminal is near the town of Sabine Pass, Texas, on the western shore
of Sabine Pass Channel, about 240 miles northeast of the proposed Terminal site (see
figure 3.1-1). Operations started in 2010 on the approximately 477-acre site. The import
terminal includes five 155,000 m3 LNG storage tanks and two LNG carrier berths. It has a
maximum send-out capacity of 2.5 Bcf/d of natural gas. The planned export facility would use

12

Docket Nos. CP12-509and CP12-29

Environmental Impact Statement

3-7

Corpus Christi LNG

the existing storage tanks, berthing facilities, and pipeline infrastructure of the import terminal
and would have a send-out capacity of 15.6 mtpy of LNG.
Golden Pass received approval from DOE/FE to export LNG to Free Trade Agreement
countries on October 7, 2012. On October 26, 2012, Golden Pass submitted an application to
export LNG to non-Free Trade Agreement nations.
On May 16, 2013, Golden Pass requested that the FERC initiate the pre-filing process for
the proj
ect13. At the time this EIS was prepared, Golden Pass was still early in our pre-filing
process. As a result, the Golden Pass LNG Terminal is substantially behind Cheniere in the
permitting and review schedule and therefore, would likely not be permitted for service in time
to meet any customer commitments of the Proj
ect, beginning in 2017. In addition, the
environmental impacts of constructing and operating the facilities needed to expand beyond the
planned capacity would likely be similar to those of the Proj
ect. Therefore, this proj
ect would
not provide a significant environmental advantage to the proposed Proj
ect and was not
considered further.
Gulf LNG Terminal
The Gulf LNG Terminal is on a 40-acre site in Pascagoula, Mississippi, about 550 miles
northeast of the proposed Terminal site (see figure 3.1-1). The terminal started operations in
October 2011 and has a send-out capacity of 1.3 Bcf/d of natural gas. The import terminal
includes two 160,000 m3 LNG storage tanks and a single LNG carrier berth designed to receive
LNG carriers up to 250,000 m3 in capacity. On June 15, 2012, Gulf LNG received authorization
from DOE/FE to export to Free Trade Agreement countries.
Gulf LNG would construct its export facilities at its existing terminal to export up to 11.5
mtpy of LNG. On May 9, 2014, Gulf LNG requested to use the FERC pre-filing process14, and
on May 21, 2014, the FERC approved the request and initiated the pre-filing process.
The Gulf LNG Terminal is substantially behind the Proj
ect in the permitting and review
schedule and therefore, could not be permitted for service in time to meet any customer
commitments of the Proj
ect beginning in 2017. As a result, the planned Gulf LNG Liquefaction
Proj
ect does not meet the Proj
ect obj
ective and was not further evaluated.
Sabine Pass LNG Terminal
The Sabine Pass LNG Terminal is in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, on the eastern shore of
the Sabine Pass Channel, approximately 240 miles northeast of the proposed Terminal site (see
figure 3.1-1). The terminal is on approximately 853 acres and includes five LNG storage tanks
with a total storage capacity of 16.9Bcf and two LNG carrier berths. The facility has a send-out
capacity of 4 Bcf/d of natural gas.
On April 16, 2012, the FERC authorized Sabine Pass LNG to receive, process, and export
16 mtpy of domestically produced natural gas as part of its liquefaction proj
ect15. The Sabine
Pass Liquefaction Proj
ect is permitted for up to four liquefaction trains, each with an average
liquefaction capacity of approximately 4 mtpy, and in August 2013, Sabine Pass LNG applied to
the FERC to construct and operate two additional trains. The proj
ect is under construction and

will involve the permanent use of about 191 acres as well as temporary disturbance of about 97
acres within the existing Sabine Pass LNG Terminal site. All 16 mtpy of LNG of the first four
trains is fully committed to Sabine Pass LNG customers. In early 2013, Sabine Pass LNG
announced that Total Gas and Power North America had signed up to take gas volumes
equivalent to 2 mtpy from the fifth train and United Kingdom-based Centrica had contracted for
an additional 1.75 mtpy. Therefore, additional import and export facilities would be needed to
meet Cheniere’s obj
ectives, likely resulting in similar environmental impacts to the proposed
Proj
ect. The permitting and authorization processes from constructing these additional facilities
would preclude Sabine Pass LNG from meeting Cheniere’s schedule, including any customer
commitments. As a result, the Sabine Pass Liquefaction Proj
ect was not considered to provide a
significant environmental advantage or be a reasonable system alternative to the Proj
ect and was
not evaluated further.
Lake Charles LNG Terminal
The Lake Charles LNG Terminal is in Lake Charles, Louisiana, and started operations in
1977. The import terminal is situated on approximately 125 acres about 280 miles northeast of
the proposed Terminal site (see figure 3.1-1)and has a peak send-out capacity of 2.1 Bcf/d of
natural gas. Two LNG carrier berths provide loading and unloading capacity.
On July 22, 2011, Lake Charles Exports, LLC received authorization from DOE/FE to
export LNG to Free Trade Agreement countries from the Lake Charles LNG Terminal. On
March 25, 2014, Trunkline LNG filed an application with the FERC for authorization to
construct and operate the Lake Charles Liquefaction Proj
ect16. Trunkline LNG would construct
the proj
ect on an approximately 400-acre parcel, about 0.5 mile west of the existing Lake
Charles LNG Terminal. The facility would include three liquefaction trains, each capable of
producing 5 mtpy for a total output capacity of 15 mtpy. Trunkline LNG anticipates an inservice date of August 2018.
Although the Lake Charles Liquefaction Proj
ect would provide approximately 1.5 mtpy
more LNG send-out capacity than the Proj
ect, its export capacity is solely contracted to one
customer, BG LNG. Additional import and export facilities would be necessary to meet
Cheniere’s obj
ectives. Trunkline LNG has not requested authorization for the increased
capacity, and receipt of permits and approvals for the additional facilities required to meet
Cheniere’s schedule, including any customer commitments. Therefore, this alternative was not
further evaluated.
3.1.3.2

Proposed and Planned Stand-Alone LNG Export Terminals

In addition to the six existing LNG import facilities described above, are six planned or
proposed stand-alone liquefaction proj
ects along the Texas Gulf Coast:
 planned Gulf Coast LNG Exports, LLC (Gulf Coast)Liquefaction Proj
ect;
 proposed Excelerate Liquefaction Solutions, LLC (ELS)Lavaca Bay LNG Proj
ect;
 proposed Magnolia LNG Proj
ect;
 planned Gasfin Development USA, LLC (Gasfin)LNG Proj

 planned Waller Point LNG (Waller Point)Proj
ect;and
 planned CE FLNG, LLC (CE FLNG)LNG Proj
ect.
These proj
ects are new or “greenfield”proj
ects that are not associated with existing LNG
Import terminals that were considered as potential system alternatives.
Gulf Coast Liquefaction Project
The Gulf Coast Liquefaction Proj
ect would export LNG from a planned export terminal
at the Port of Brownsville in Brownsville, Texas, about 130 miles south of the proposed
Terminal site (see figure 3.1-1). On October 16, 2012, Gulf Coast received authorization from
DOE/FE to export LNG to Free Trade Agreement countries. At the time this EIS was prepared,
Gulf Coast had not requested that the FERC initiate the pre-filing process.
The proj
ect, as proposed to the DOE/FE, would include a new terminal on about
500 acres, four liquefaction trains capable of liquefying a total of 2.8 Bcf/d of natural gas, an
unspecified number of LNG storage tanks, a marine berth, and a pipeline connecting the terminal
to existing natural gas transportation lines. Rather than enter into long-term natural gas supply or
LNG export contracts, Gulf Coast would set up liquefaction tolling agreements allowing
individual gas customers to deliver gas and receive LNG from the terminal. Gulf Coast
anticipates in service in 2018.
As a greenfield facility, the environmental impacts associated with development on an
undisturbed site would likely be comparable in both magnitude and duration to the proposed
Proj
ect. Therefore, the Gulf Coast Liquefaction Proj
ect would not provide a significant
environmental advantage over the proposed Terminal. In addition, the Gulf Coast Liquefaction
Proj
ect would not be completed in Cheniere’s schedule, including any customer commitments.
Therefore, this system alternative was not considered further.
Lavaca BayLNG Project
The proposed Lavaca Bay LNG Proj
ect includes two floating liquefaction, storage, and
offloading (FLSO)units that produce LNG from North American natural gas. The proj
ect would
also include onshore pre-treatment facilities and infrastructure associated with the FLSOs. LNG
would be stored, as needed, prior to transferring the LNG to carriers for export. The FLSOs
would be permanently moored at a proposed shore-side dock in Port Lavaca in Calhoun County,
Texas, approximately 60 miles north of the proposed Terminal site (see figure 3.1-1).
The Lavaca Bay LNG Proj
ect would include a total of eight liquefaction trains, storage of
up to 500,000 m3 of LNG, and a send-out capacity of 10 mtpy of LNG. On October 23, 2012,
ELS submitted a Letter of Intent and a preliminary WSA to the Coast Guard for consideration in
its assessment of the waterway and issuance of a LOR regarding the suitability of the waterway
for LNG carrier marine traffic. On February 6, 2014, ELS filed an application with the FERC,
with a planned in service date of December 31, 201717. Additional facilities would be needed to
meet Cheniere’s export obj
ectives, including the creation of two new berthing areas and turning
basins as well as additional other onshore facilities, resulting in similar or greater environmental
impacts. Therefore, the Lavaca Bay LNG Proj
ect would not provide a significant environmental
advantage to the Proj
ect. Additionally, receipt of permits and approvals for the additional

Corpus Christi LNG

facilities necessary to meet Cheniere’s obj
ectives, which ELS has not requested, would likely not
meet Cheniere’s schedule. Therefore, this system alternative was not considered further.
Magnolia LNG Project
Magnolia LNG would construct its liquefaction and LNG export proj
ect at the Port of
Lake Charles in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, at the port’s Industrial Canal, off the Calcasieu Ship
Channel, about 280 miles northeast of the proposed Terminal site (see figure 3.1-1). The
Magnolia LNG Proj
ect would be a stand-alone LNG export facility, not associated with an
existing LNG terminal, and constructed on a 90-acre site. At full capacity, the proj
ect would
export 8 mtpy of LNG using four liquefaction trains, each with a capacity of 2 mtpy of LNG.
In December 2012, Magnolia LNG filed an application with DOE/FE requesting longterm authorization to export LNG to foreign countries with which the U.S. has existing Free
Trade Agreements. On April 30, 2014, Magnolia LNG filed its application at FERC with
planned commercial operations beginning with the first train in 2017 and the second train in
2018. The third and fourth trains would be constructed and operated if market conditions are
favorable.18
To meet Cheniere’s obj
ectives, Magnolia LNG would need to commit all of the capacity
of the four trains to Cheniere and construct additional trains. Magnolia LNG has not requested
authorization for the increased capacity and receipt of permits and approvals for the additional
facilities that would be needed to meet Cheniere’s obj
ectives, and would likely not meet
Cheniere’s schedule, including any customer commitments. Additionally, as proposed, the
natural gas feedstock for Cheniere’s Terminal would be sourced from the south Texas region.
Transporting gas to the Magnolia LNG terminal, located significantly further from the south
Texas region, would require greater transportation costs, potential facilities, and associated
additional environmental impacts, as compared to the Cheniere Terminal. Therefore, this system
alternative was not considered further.
Gasfin LNG Project
The planned Gasfin LNG Proj
ect is a liquefaction and LNG export proj
ect in Cameron
Parish, Louisiana on the east side of the Calcasieu Ship Channel, approximately 280 miles
northeast of the proposed Terminal site (see figure 3.1-1). The proj
ect would be a stand-alone
LNG export facility that is not associated with an existing LNG terminal and would have an
export capacity of 1.5 mtpy.
On March 7, 2013, DOE/FE granted Gasfin long-term authorization to export LNG to
countries with which the U.S. has existing Free Trade Agreements. The Gasfin LNG Proj
ect is
in the initial development phase and an anticipated schedule has not yet been released. At the
time this EIS was prepared, Gasfin had not requested that the FERC initiate the pre-filing
process. We do not consider the Gasfin LNG Proj
ect to be a reasonable alternative to the Proj
ect
because it would not be completed in time to meet Cheniere’s schedule, including any customer
commitments, and as a greenfield proj
ect, would likely not provide a significant environmental
advantage to the Proj
ect. Therefore, this system alternative was not considered further.

Waller Point LNG Project
The planned Waller Point LNG Proj
ect is a stand-alone liquefaction and LNG export
facility in Cameron Parish, Louisiana on the western shore of the Calcasieu Ship Channel from
the Gulf of Mexico, approximately 280 miles northeast of the proposed Terminal site (see figure
3.1-1). The proj
ect would have an LNG export capacity of about 1.25 mtpy. On December 20,
2012, DOE/FE granted long-term authorization to Waller Point LNG for LNG export to
countries with which the U.S. has existing Free Trade Agreements.
The proj
ect is in the initial development phase and Waller Point LNG has not announced
a planned schedule. Further, at the time this EIS was prepared, Waller Point LNG has not
requested that the FERC initiate the pre-filing process. We do not consider the Waller Point
LNG Proj
ect to be a reasonable system alternative to the Proj
ect because it would not be
completed in time to meet Cheniere’s schedule, including any customer commitments, and as a
greenfield proj
ect, would likely not provide a significant environmental advantage to the Proj
ect.
Therefore, this system alternative was not considered further.
CE FLNG LNG Project
CE FLNG announced plans for developing a floating LNG liquefaction and export
terminal on the east bank of the Mississippi River north of the confluence of Baptiste Collette
Bayou in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, approximately 490 miles east of the proposed Terminal
site. Proj
ect facilities include two FLSO vessels, each capable of producing up to 4 mtpy of
LNG. The FLSOs would have an LNG storage capacity of 250,000 m3. LNG carriers would
berth next to the units to load LNG. The proj
ect would include a 45-mile-long pipeline to
connect the terminal with two sources of natural gas: (1)the existing Enterprise Products natural
gas processing plant in Bernard Parish, (2)and the existing Targa Venice natural gas processing
plant in Plaquemines Parish. CE Pipeline, LLC plans to construct and operate the pipeline.
The proj
ect would be a stand-alone liquefaction and LNG export facility that is not
associated with an existing terminal. On November 21, 2012, DOE/FE granted long-term export
authorization to CE FLNG for LNG export to countries with which the U.S. has existing Free
Trade Agreements. At the time this EIS was prepared, CE FLNG was in the early phases of the
FERC pre-filing process19. CE FLNG anticipates that the first FLSO vessel would be in service
in March 2018, with the second FLSO starting up in October 2018.
To meet Cheniere’s obj
ectives, CE FLNG would need to commit its entire capacity of the
proj
ect to Cheniere and install two additional FLSO vessels which would require establishing
additional berthing facilities, turning basins, and associated onshore facilities. We do not
consider the CE FLNG LNG Proj
ect to be a reasonable system alternative to the Proj
ect because
would not be completed in time or have the send out capacity to meet Cheniere’s schedule,
including any customer commitments, and as a greenfield proj
ect, would likely not provide a
significant environmental advantage to the Proj
ect. Therefore, this system alternative was not
considered further.
3.1.4

We performed a thorough site alternative evaluation for the Terminal facilities. An analysis and
conclusion of the alternative sites is presented below.
A large number of alternative sites were evaluated along the Gulf Coast. A total of 17
potential port alternative sites were evaluated for channel depth (greater than 40 feet)and
proximity to existing natural gas pipeline systems, which are the primary criteria applicable to
the Terminal. Three sites were selected for further evaluation based on access to a channel
greater than 40 feet deep, access to maj
or natural gas pipelines, industrial zoning, and availability
of sufficient open land for construction and operation of the facility. These sites were previously
proposed or planned for three LNG import proj
ects that have not been built: Vista del Sol LNG,
Eos FLNG, and Ingleside Energy Center LNG proj
ects. Figure 3.1-2 shows the sites which are
further discussed below.

In order to assess the suitability of each site, we developed a set of four maj
or obj
ectives
including site-specific criteria, marine operations, access to existing pipeline systems, and
permitting, which were then subdivided into site selection criteria.
1. The site-specific criteria are as follows:
 the ease of acquisition, with preference given to parcels of land in industrial areas or
dredge disposal areas;
 sufficient space for the land-based and marine components of the Terminal, including
the required spacing between equipment and tanks, as specified by the NFPA 59A;
and
 existing infrastructures capable of providing reliable sources of power as well as
suitable roads and barge access for delivery of materials during construction.
2. The criteria of the marine operations obj
ective include:
 vessel traffic volume must comply with potential restrictions that a LNG carrier in
transit may pose on traffic in conj
unction with other vessels;
 ease and efficiency of channel access, as the more expeditiously a vessel is able to
reach the terminal, unload, and depart on its ballast voyage, the better the economics
of the terminal;
 availability of a channel with sufficient depth, width, and air draft for the operation of
a typical LNG carrier is essential;and
 adequate maneuvering area amplitude and proximity (a minimum diameter of 1,200
feet and greater than 40 foot depth is required for a typical LNG carrier maneuvering
area.).
3. The criteria for access to existing pipeline systems include:
 proximity of existing pipeline systems for importation (it is assumed that the routing
issues and construction techniques would be similar for all onshore sites.);and
 adequate supply/send-out capacity with sufficient available capacity, and ability to
maintain consistent demand for the pipeline system.
4. Criteria of the permitting obj
ective include:
 avoidance of impacts on residential areas including noise and light impacts;
 environmental consequences, including maximizing the use of previously disturbed
areas in order to reduce potential impacts;
 compatibility with region/port development plans and those of adj
acent properties;
 land use zoning to support the above two criteria (zoning does not preclude industrial
development);and
 avoidance of populated areas to ensure compliance with the siting requirements of
NFPA 59A and 49CFR Part 193. The sites were evaluated by comparison of their
distance to populated areas. Scores are relative to these distances.

a/ Environmental factors were determined based on information provided in Vista del Sol LNG and Ingleside
Energy Center LNG EISs, that were issued on April 15, 2005 and June 10, 2005, respectively. These acreages are
based on constructing import facilities only, not taking into consideration liquefaction facilities required for export.
No acreages are calculated for the Eos FLNG as no data is available.

The Vista del Sol LNG and the Ingleside Energy Center LNG site locations are both on
the La Quinta Ship Channel and are nearby to the proposed Terminal site. Infrastructure and
environmental impacts at these sites would be similar to the proposed Terminal site but would
require additional investigation as to whether liquefaction facilities can be accommodated at the
site. Environmental impacts associated with developing either alternative site would likely result
in impacts either similar or greater than those of the proposed site. In addition, the properties are
now owned by Occidental Petroleum Corporation and are no longer available to Cheniere.
Occidental Petroleum Corporation has also recently acquired the Naval Station Ingleside site
from the Port of Corpus Christi Authority (POCCA) and thus, it is no longer available.
Therefore, these alternative sites were dismissed and not considered further.
Environmental Impact Statement

Corpus Christi LNG

The Eos FLNG site is more than 40 miles from an existing pipeline system which has
limited available capacity and lacks access to interstate pipeline networks. Construction of
additional pipeline to reach the Eos site would likely result in greater environmental impacts than
those of the proposed proj
ect. Therefore, this alternative was dismissed and not considered
further.
The proposed site for the Terminal is selected because it offered the following advantages
over the other alternative sites:
 the Terminal is compatible with the existing industrial land use;
 the channel has a history of accommodating international vessels delivering liquid
products;
 the site has potential for barge access for the delivery of construction materials;
 the site is isolated from residential communities;
 the distance from the Terminal required to reach open water is short;
 existing pipeline systems with available take-away capacity are proximal to the site;and
 the property is owned/leased and available for development by Cheniere.
Significant site preparation earthwork was conducted at the Terminal site from 2006 to
2008 to prepare the proposed site for construction of the previously approved Import Terminal.
Furthermore, some environmental permits, such as the COE Section 404/10 Permit, are valid for
the Terminal but are being amended to include additional impacts from the proposed layout.
There has been industrial development in the vicinity surrounding the Terminal site. Two
wind power proj
ects as well as the Copano Pipeline Proj
ect occur within the vicinity of the
Terminal;however, they do not impact the site. The ongoing construction of the La Quinta
Channel Extension Proj
ect, being conducted by the COE and the POCCA, could potentially
impact the Terminal site or surrounding resources. This proj
ect involves an extension of the La
Quinta Channel by approximately 7,400 feet to the area directly south of the POCCA’s property,
located west of the Terminal. The collective effects from construction of these proj
ects in
conj
unction with the Terminal could be significant;however, it is anticipated that cumulative
impacts would be temporary or minor, as the listed proj
ects would not be constructed
concurrently with the Terminal. Cumulative impacts associated with the proposed Proj
ect and
proj
ects in the regional geographic area are further discussed in section 4.13.
The proposed Terminal site is the most environmentally preferable and practical
alternative, as it is the only considered site that fully satisfies the Proj
ect’s purpose and need,
while minimizing impacts on agricultural land and would not adversely impact other existing
land uses or protected resources (see sections 4.0 and 5.0).
3.1.5

Alternative Dredge Disposal Locations

As currently proposed, dredged materials would be utilized to fill a portion of a former
90-acre clay borrow pit northeast of the Terminal site. The remainder of the dredged material
would be deposited in a 385-acre area, known as DMPA 2 (old bauxite disposal beds), located
immediately north of the Terminal site in order to assist in the capping of those beds (see
figure 2.1-1). The dredge material would be transported by a slurry pipe approximately

Corpus Christi LNG

11,000 feet long and would be evenly distributed across the large bauxite beds north of the
Terminal. The water would be decanted and monitored as it leaves the DMPA to permitted
outfalls. The resulting soil would provide a cap over the old bauxite beds, which would allow
vegetation to occur and reduce the red dust in the area.
There are two alternative locations for the placement of dredged materials from the
marine facilities that were evaluated. These locations, referred to as DMPA 13 and DMPA 14,
(see figure 3.1-3)are located on property owned by the POCCA to the west and south of the
Terminal. DMPA 13 is located south of the Terminal and La Quinta Channel and is an existing
spoil island created from dredging and maintenance activities along the Channel. Environmental
impacts from the placement of additional dredge material on DMPA 13 would be minimal.
DMPA 14 is located to the west of the Terminal at an area where the POCCA has created a berm
for dredge material placement;therefore, environmental impacts from placement of dredge
material within DMPA 14 would be minimal. However, DMPAs 13 and 14 would not allow
capping of former bauxite disposal beds or revegetation in the area. Therefore, the proposed
location of DMPA 2 would be preferred, because it provides minimal environmental impact as
well as providing minor beneficial environmental restoration.

PIPELINE FACILITIES

3.2.1

No-Action Alternative

Under the No-Action Alternative, the obj
ectives of the Proj
ect would not be met and
Cheniere would not provide the proposed natural gas transportation capacity for import or
export. In addition, the potential adverse and beneficial environmental impacts identified in
section 4.0 of this EIS would not occur.
3.2.2

System Alternatives

We considered whether any of the existing, recently authorized, or currently proposed
pipeline routes in the U.S. could be reasonable system alternatives to the proposed Pipeline. To
be considered a viable system alternative, the existing or approved pipeline facilities would need
to: 1)transport all or part of the volume of gas required for liquefaction at the Terminal;and 2)
cause significantly less impact on the environment than the proposed Pipeline.
3.2.2.1

Pipeline System Alternatives

Numerous natural gas pipelines operate in San Patricio County, Texas. The pipeline
infrastructure in the county dates to the mid-20th century and is comprised of gathering and
midstream pipelines, upstream processing, and transmission or distribution pipelines downstream
of processing. Several interstate pipelines transport south Texas production to the east, feeding
long-haul transmission systems that serve the Midwest and Northeast U.S. Alternatively,
intrastate pipelines aggregate and deliver supplies for local consumption within Texas. Over the
years, certain pipelines have switched from transmission and distribution to gathering or
midstream service. Many have done so recently, given high production volumes. Regardless,
only processed, pipeline quality gas is considered for liquefaction.
Our analysis of pipeline system alternatives includes evaluation of existing interstate
pipeline systems to meet the obj
ectives of the proposed Pipeline. Table 3.2-1 lists the natural gas
pipelines identified in San Patricio County and their relative distances from the Terminal. The
table also indicates which pipelines, to date, have been considered commercially for connection
to the proposed Pipeline and the character of service. Five pipelines in table 3.2-1 have planned
connections to the proposed Cheniere Pipeline. However, these pipelines would not serve as
suitable alternatives to the Cheniere Pipeline, as additional construction of pipeline to connect to
the Terminal would be required, resulting in similar or greater environmental impacts than the
proposal. In addition, interconnections would also be required and it is not known whether
additional pipeline length would be required by those companies at proposed pipeline
interconnects.

The overall purpose of the Proj
ect is to provide facilities that would allow imported LNG
to be vaporized and transferred to U.S. markets via existing interstate and intrastate natural gas
pipeline systems. The Proj
ect would also liquefy natural gas and deliver the resulting product
either into existing interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines in the Corpus Christi area, or
export LNG elsewhere. Under present conditions, no existing pipelines would satisfy the
purpose and need of the Proj
ect because these lines have gas volumes committed to existing
customers. Any additional volumes would require construction of additional loop, compression,
or new greenfield facilities. The closest interstate pipeline that would connect with the proposed
pipeline is Texas Eastern at 7.5 miles away, as depicted in table 3.2-1. Therefore, expansion of
an existing interstate or intrastate pipeline to connect with the proposed Terminal would result in
environmental impacts similar to or greater than those associated with the proposed Pipeline.
Because a pipeline alternative using another system would provide no environmental advantage
over the proposed Pipeline, we have dismissed these from consideration.

Pipeline Route Alternatives

In evaluating Pipeline route alternatives, we examined variations that could minimize or
avoid impacts on environmentally sensitive resources such as population centers, special use
areas, waterbodies, wetlands, existing or planned residences, or specific landowner concerns.
We looked for a suitable Pipeline route that would result in minimal environmental and social
impacts.
Paramount in the development of the alternative pipeline route analysis was the presence
of existing infrastructure (utility rights-of-way, corridors, or previously developed areas).
Significant emphasis was placed on the incorporation of guidelines set forth in 18 CFR Part
380.15.
The routing criteria used to develop the proposed Pipeline route included:
 utilization of existing corridors;
 minimal creation of new corridors;
 potential impacts on sensitive resources;
 land use issues;
 proximity to residential/congested areas;
 engineering/construction issues;
 operation and maintenance considerations;and
 supporting infrastructure.
Existing utility corridors generally provide opportunities to minimize impacts on the
environment. Constructing new pipelines along existing corridors reduces the need for
establishment of new corridors and thus, the involvement of additional landowners, clearing of
new rights-of-way, and potential environmental impacts.
When establishing the final proposed route, the only substantial development has been
the construction of the Papalote Creek Wind Farm, located in agricultural lands east of Taft,
Texas. There are several wind turbines that have been constructed and would operate in close
proximity to the Pipeline route;however, none these turbines are expected to directly impact the
Pipeline or associated aboveground facilities.
3.2.3.1

Major Route Alternative

The proposed Pipeline route was primarily based on the approved route of Cheniere’s
initial filing, which received an Order (FERC Docket No. CP04-37-000) but was never
constructed. Three maj
or alternative routes as well as the proposed Pipeline route were
evaluated to determine which would produce minimal environmental impacts while meeting the
Pipeline’s obj
ective. The proposed Pipeline route, at a length of approximately 23.0 miles,
provides the shortest distance from the proposed Terminal to existing high pressure natural gas
pipeline systems in the South Texas region. The Pipeline would be installed adj
acent to a high
voltage overhead power line as well as existing natural gas pipelines along portions of the
proposed route. As such, the proposed route minimizes environmental impacts by maximizing
the use of existing corridors in the area. The evaluations of the three maj
or route alternatives are

Route Alternative A
Route Alternative A (see figure 3.2-1)would begin at the proposed Terminal and proceed
west for approximately 1 mile across open land owned by the POCCA. It would then turn
northwest, cross the Southern Pacific Railroad and SH 35, skirt the west side of the city of
Gregory, and cross CR 2986. Alternative A would then parallel Boykin Road between MPs 4.0
and 11.0, skirting the west of the city of Taft. It would follow local farm roads between MPs
14.0 and 15.0, then turn northeast, parallel to CR 1074, crossing U.S. Highway (US)181, to MP
17.0, where it would turn northwest again. Following an existing pipeline corridor, Alternative
Route A would cross Oliver Creek at MP 18.0, Chiltipin Creek at MP 19.0, and US 77 at MP 21,
before terminating at MP 24.0.
This route would be 1.0 mile longer than the proposed route, and would be 4.5 miles less
collocated with existing rights-of-way. It would affect 29.5 acres more land including 4.5 acres
more wetlands and would be within 50 feet of 23 residences. The proposed route does not
impact residential lands. The primary disadvantage of the alternative is that it would cross a
greater portion of the POCCA property located west of La Quinta Road. The POCCA property
is the proposed site for both the La Quinta Trade Gateway Terminal as well as the Voestalpine
DRI Plant, both of which are further discussed in section 4.13. Alternative Route A also crosses
a residential area that had not been constructed when the route alternative was originally
proposed and evaluated under FERC Docket No. CP04-37-000.
Therefore, Route Alternative A would not offer an environmental advantage over the
proposed route and we do not recommend the use of this alternative.
Route Alternative B
Route Alternative B (see figure 3.2-1) would begin at ExxonMobil’s previously
approved, but never constructed, Vista del Sol LNG terminal, located south of the DuPont
Environmental Impact Statement

chemical plant approximately 2 miles southeast of the proposed Terminal. It would then proceed
northward past the DuPont plant, crossing Edwards Road and a railroad, avoiding an existing
pond, and crossing SH 361 and the Southern Pacific Railroad at MP 2.3. It would then follow
existing ExxonMobil and Koch pipelines heading northwest across agricultural land, crossing
SH 35 at MP 5.5. At MP 17.7 Route Alternative B would leave the existing pipeline corridor
and become a greenfield route, crossing Chiltipin Creek at MP 19.0 and proceeding over open
scrubland to MP 20.8, where it would follow another existing pipeline. It would cross US 77 at
MP 24.8 and terminate at MP 27.4.
This route would be 4.4 miles longer than the proposed route, would impact 2.8 acres
more wetlands, and would cross 15 more roadways than the proposed route. Thus, Route
Alternative B would not offer a significant environmental advantage over the proposed route and
therefore we do not recommend the use of this alternative.
Route Alternative C
Route Alternative C (see figure 3.2-1)would begin at the previously approved, but never
constructed, Ingleside Energy Center LNG terminal and would proceed northward, past the
Occidental chemical plant, crossing SH 361 and the Southern Pacific Railroad at MP 1.5. It
would continue northwesterly, crossing SH 35 at about MP 4.0, skirting the east side of the city
of Gregory near MP 6.5, and the east side of the city of Taft near MP 14.5. This route would
cross Chiltipin Creek at MP 21.5, and terminate at MP 26.4.
Route Alternative C would be 3.4 miles longer than the proposed route and would
include four more road crossings thus resulting in greater land impacts. All other environmental
factors evaluated would be similar to the proposed route, thus, Route Alternative C would not
offer an environmental advantage over the proposed route and therefore we do not recommend
the use of this alternative.

Other Appurtenant Aboveground Facilities

Proposed aboveground facilities for the Pipeline would include MLVs, one pig launcher
and receiver, and six M&R stations. These facilities all occur on agricultural land along the
Pipeline right-of-way. These facilities are small, would not impact environmentally sensitive
areas, are not located near residences, and their locations are tied to the locations of other foreign
pipeline facilities, with the exception of the MLV at MP 14.5. As noted throughout section 4.0,
the potential impacts of construction and operation of the aboveground facilities would be
adequately minimized, and therefore we did not identify alternative sites that would provide a
significant environmental advantage to the proposed aboveground facility sites.
3.2.3.3

Compressor Stations Site Alternatives

The Pipeline would require compression at two locations along the proposed route. In
order to meet the natural gas supply throughput requirements for the Pipeline, compressor
stations would be required at locations southeast of the city of Taft and northeast of the city of
Sinton. Additional information on the location of the proposed compressor stations and
alternative sites, are provided in the following sections.
Taft Compressor Station
The proposed Taft Compressor Station would be located on an approximately 30-acre
land parcel along the north side of County Road 78 at approximate MP 7.5. An alternative 30acre parcel is located on an adj
acent tract to the southeast of the proposed site. Cheniere owns
the land of the proposed location of the Taft Compressor Station. Both sites are located on
agricultural land and neither site would have impacts on environmentally-sensitive resources
such as waterbodies, wetlands, public roads, and utility crosses (see table 3.2-3). However, the
proposed site is 474 feet further away from noise sensitive areas (NSAs)than the alternative site.
Additionally, the existing Texas Eastern pipeline crosses the property of the proposed site
obviating the need for construction of a lateral pipeline thus eliminating associated
environmental impacts. Therefore, the alternative site is not recommended since it has no
environmental advantage over the proposed site. The proposed and alternative Taft Compressor
Station sites are depicted in figure 3.2-2.

The proposed Sinton Compressor Station is located on an approximately 30-acre parcel
north of US 77 and northeast of the City of Sinton at approximate MP 21.5. Cheniere is in
negotiations with the landowner to acquire the land for the proposed Sinton Compressor Station.
The proposed site provides easy access to US 77 and the site is located in scrub/shrub habitat that
is devoid of sensitive environmental resources, such as waterbodies, wetlands, public roads, and
utility crossings. Table 3.2-4 compares significant environmental factors of the proposed Sinton
Compressor Station site as well as the evaluated alternative sites.
All four alternative sites would be located in scrub/shrub habitat and would have the
same acreages as the proposed site. Three alternative sites east of US 77 (Alternative Sites 1, 2,
and 3)would require a new access road that crosses a railroad track along US 77, resulting in a
potential safety concern for vehicular traffic. Alternative Sites 1, 2, and 3 were eliminated from
further consideration for the Sinton Compressor Station since they provided no environmental
advantage over the proposed site.
Alternative 4 is located west of US 77 on property owned by the same landowner who
owns the property of the proposed site. Alternative 4 was not selected because it is closer to the
nearest NSA by 828 feet, and also offers no environmental advantages. The proposed and
alternative Sinton Compressor Station sites are depicted in figure 3.2-3.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS
SECTION 4

4.0

ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

This section describes the affected environment as it currently exists and discusses the
environmental consequences of the Proj
ect. The discussion is organized by the following maj
or
resource topics: geology, including foundation conditions, and natural hazards;soils;water
resources;vegetation;wetlands;fisheries and wildlife resources;threatened, endangered, and
other special status species;land use, recreation, and visual resources;socioeconomics;cultural
resources;air and noise;safety and reliability;and cumulative impacts.
The environmental consequences of constructing and operating the Proj
ect would vary in
duration and significance. Four levels of impact duration were considered: temporary, shortterm, long-term, and permanent. Temporary impacts generally occur during construction with
the resource returning to preconstruction condition almost immediately afterward. Short-term
impacts could continue for up to 3 years following construction. Impacts were considered longterm if the resource would require more than 3 years to recover. A permanent impact could
occur as a result of any activity that modifies a resource to the extent that it would not return to
preconstruction conditions during the life of the Proj
ect. We considered an impact to be
significant if it would result in a substantial adverse change in the physical environment and the
relationship of people with the environment.
As part of its proposal, Cheniere developed certain mitigation measures to reduce the
impact of the Proj
ect.
In some cases, we determined that additional mitigation
measures/recommendations could further reduce the Proj
ect’s impacts. Our additional
mitigation measures/recommendations appear as bulleted, boldfaced paragraphs in the text of
this section and are also included in section 5.0. We will recommend to the Commission that
these measures be included as specific conditions in any Authorization the Commission may
issue to Cheniere for this Proj
ect.
The conclusions in the EIS are based on our analysis of the environmental impact and the
following assumptions:
 Cheniere would comply with all applicable laws and regulations;
 the proposed facilities would be constructed as described in section 2.0 of this EIS;and
 Cheniere would implement the mitigation measures/conditions included in its application
and supplemental submittals to the FERC and cooperating agencies, and in other
applicable permits and approvals.
4.1

GEOLOGIC RESOURCES

4.1.1

Terminal Facilities

4.1.1.1

Geologic Setting

The Terminal would be located within the Coastal Prairie region of the Gulf Coastal Plain
physiographic province. Holocene-aged deposits are characteristic of this region and primarily
consist of alluvial, deltaic, beach, bay-estuary, and marsh deposits. These deposits are underlain
by deep Pleistocene-aged deltaic and alluvial deposits interlayered with clays and sands. The
topography in the area is nearly flat, with subsurface sediments gently dipping toward the Gulf,
and is dissected by highly sinuous streams. The minimum elevation at the Terminal is sea level,
and the maximum elevation is approximately 36 feet above mean sea level (AMSL).
Environmental Impact Statement

4-1

Corpus Christi LNG

The Terminal would be located within a modern bay-estuary system that formed upon the
Nueces River fluvial-deltaic system. The depositional environment in the Terminal area has
been significantly impacted by Pleistocene–aged glacial and interglacial events which resulted in
sea level changes. Broad deltas with meandering distributary channels of fluvial sands and
interdistributary floodplains with overbank mud deposits were formed during interglacial periods
when rivers carried large sediment loads towards the coast. The modern estuary system was
formed approximately 2,500 years before present, when sea levels rose and filled the Nueces
River valley with fluvial sediments and tidally transported Gulf sediments as the shoreline
receded to its current position. The upper Corpus Christi Bay is a shallow estuarine delta
characterized by prodelta muds and sandy channel-mouth bars.
The Terminal would be located within Holocene-aged alluvial and floodplain deposits
underlain by the Pleistocene-aged Beaumont Formation. The Beaumont Formation consists of
sands, silty sands, and clayey sands deposited in a tidally influenced back-bay environment in the
upper layers and interbedded sands and clays deposited in a barrier bar setting in the lower
section. The Beaumont Formation is underlain by the Pleistocene-aged Lissie Formation
consisting of alluvial clay and lenticular sandstone deposits.
4.1.1.2

Mineral Resources

There are five abandoned oil and gas wells located on or within the Terminal site. The
La Prade well, located in the northwest section of the site was a non-producing well that was
abandoned in 1945. The Reynolds, Green, and State Tract No. 1 wells are located in the southsoutheast section of the site and were all abandoned in 1972. The State Tract No. 15 well, also
located in the south-southeast section, was abandoned in 2011. All five abandoned wells were
plugged with cement and mud.
A review of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Mineral Resource Data System
indicated that there are no active or potential surface mines located within the vicinity of the
Terminal. According to the oil and gas well database maintained by the RRC, the five
abandoned oil and gas wells located on or near the Terminal site are wells that were plugged and
abandoned in accordance with applicable RRC requirements. There is no surface evidence to
visually verify locations of the well casings, and there is no indication of the presence of other oil
and gas wells at the Terminal site.
In the event an unidentified oil and gas well is unexpectedly encountered during
construction, Cheniere would stop all work in the area, contain any spillage of product, secure
the area, and notify the EI, the RRC, and the FERC. Cheniere would consult with the RRC to
determine the operator or owner on record for the subj
ect well. RRC Statewide Rule 14 (TAC
Title 16, Part 1, Chapter 3)requires operators of record to plug abandoned oil and gas wells in
accordance with specifications set forth within. If the well operator cannot be identified, the
RRC maintains and administers an Oil Field Cleanup Fund which may be utilized to properly
plug wells. Cheniere would likely request a variance from the FERC, if necessary, and adj
ust
equipment location to avoid the well.
Although the Proj
ect is not anticipated to affect any active or abandoned oil or gas wells
and active or potential surface mines, if an unidentified well is encountered, Cheniere would
implement the measures outlined above. Therefore, construction and operation of the Terminal
facilities would not significantly affect mineral resources.

4.1.1.3

Paleontological Resources

No sensitive paleontological resources have been identified within the Terminal area.
Therefore, no impacts are anticipated by constructing and operating the Terminal facilities.
4.1.1.4

Foundation Conditions

Cheniere has performed a geotechnical investigation of the site. The soils profiles at the
LNG tank locations reveal a layered stratigraphy of sands and clays extending to a depth of
approximately 180 feet. Below this lies a massive sand layer reaching a depth of approximately
300 feet. The sand and clay layers above the massive sand layer vary in thickness from
approximately 10 to 30 feet. Consistency of the clay layers was generally very stiff to hard,
while the upper most sand stratum had a variable density but was mostly medium dense. The
eastern half of the proposed liquefaction facility process area has a similar layer soil profile as
the proposed LNG tank locations, but the massive sand layer underlying the western facilities
occurs at elevations of approximately -40 to -80 feet. The clay layers in this process area above
elevation -40 feet are generally thicker than the sand layers, ranging between 10 to 40 feet for the
clay layers and 10 to 20 feet for the sand layers. As in the proposed LNG tank locations, the
upper sand is medium dense and the lower sands are very dense. The groundwater table ranges
between elevation 6 and 12 feet.
Site preparation would result in the high point of finished surface at an elevation of
approximately 25 feet AMSL. The foundations are planned to be reinforced concrete spread
footing and mats. The net allowable recommended soil bearing ranges between 4,000 and 6,000
pounds per square foot (psf).
During the period between 1965 and 2000, most of the liquefaction plant site was
covered with bauxite up to a depth of 60 feet and imposing area loads of as much as 7,500 psf.
Removal of this overburden started in 2000 and was completed in 2005. In areas of the proposed
liquefaction plant site covered by the bauxite stockpile, the shapes of the stockpile and the
current condition of the soils generally would have a beneficial effect on foundation conditions.
The LNG tanks, however, would be located in areas within and outside the previously stockpiled
area causing concerns of differential surcharge conditions on the middle tank foundation, which
could result in detrimental differential foundation settlements. Therefore, the tank design will
include settlement analyses of the LNG tank foundation for three bounding conditions: tank area
full preloaded, partially loaded, and outside of preload. Cheniere may also elect to remove and
re-compact the low blow count layer near the bottom of the LNG storage tank foundations as
part of the site grading and compaction.
Terminal must be constructed to satisfy the design requirements of 49CFR 193, NFPA
59A-2001, 2006 International Building Code, and ASCE 7-05. For seismic design, the facility
would also be designed to satisfy the requirements of NFPA 59A-2006 and ASCE 7-05.
The design of the facility is currently at the Front End Engineering Design (FEED)level
of completion. Cheniere has proposed a feasible design and it has committed to conducting a
significant amount of detailed design work for the Terminal if the Proj
ect is authorized by the
Commission. Information regarding the development of the final design, as detailed below
would need to be reviewed by FERC staff in order to ensure that the final design addresses the
requirements identified in the FEED. Further, the timing of the production of this information

Therefore, we are recommending that:
 Cheniere should file the following information,stamped and sealed by the
professional engineer-of-record,with the Secretaryof the Commission

c. LNG Liquefaction facilitystructures and foundation design drawings and
calculations;and
d. quality control procedures to be used for civil/structural design and
construction.
In addition,Cheniere should file,in its Implementation Plan,the schedule for
producing this information.
4.1.1.5

Natural Hazards

Geologic hazards that can potentially affect the Terminal facility include earthquake
ground motions and faulting, soil liquefaction and subsidence, and slope stability. Other natural
hazards of concern include hurricane winds as well as storm surge-related flooding.
Earthquake Ground Motions and Faulting
The Gulf Plains physiographic province is characterized by low seismic hazard potential.
Cheniere conducted a site-specific hazard evaluation to address this effect. The evaluation
determined that the peak ground acceleration, with consideration of site amplification effects,
would be 0.013 gravity (g)for a 10 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years and 0.052 g for
a 2 percent probability in 50 years. Results of this evaluation indicate very low level of ground
motion predicted at the Terminal area;therefore, earthquake hazards were not considered a
controlling factor in facility design.
Several hundred faults exist in the Gulf Coast region and are primarily Gulf-facing listric
normal faults that developed in thick sedimentary sequences over a rifted margin. These faults
developed as growth faults underlying thick sediment loads and in relation to salt movement. In
modern times, movement along these faults is primarily the result of petroleum production and
groundwater pumping. Although numerous Quaternary surface faults are present in the Gulf
Coast region, earthquakes with epicenters within the coastal areas of Texas are rare and typically
of low magnitude. Subsurface salt movement can also influence faulting;however, the Terminal
would not be located near any salt domes. The closest salt dome is located approximately 70
miles west of the Terminal. Stratigraphic units over 40,000 years old are found at relatively
Environmental Impact Statement

4-4

Corpus Christi LNG

common elevations in several soil borings. There was no identified evidence that the site occurs
within the zone of influence or within 0.5 mile of an active (Holocene-aged)fault. A low risk of
seismic activity and faulting effects can be reasonably anticipated for the Terminal area.
Therefore, the potential for large-magnitude seismic activity in the vicinity of the Terminal is
low and is not considered a significant hazard.
Soil Liquefaction
Soil liquefaction is the transformation of loosely packed sediment, or cohesionless soil,
from a solid to a liquid state as a result of increased pore pressure and reduced effective stress,
such as intense and prolonged ground shaking from seismic events. The Terminal area would
have underlying water-saturated sediments and could be susceptible to liquefaction under
sufficiently strong ground motion. However, due to the relatively low levels of seismic activity
and potential ground motion anticipated at the Terminal site, there is little risk for liquefaction of
soils to occur. Therefore, it is not anticipated that soil liquefaction would present a significant
hazard at the Terminal site.
Subsidence
Subsidence is the sudden sinking or gradual downward settling of land with little or no
horizontal motion, caused by movements on surface faults or by subsurface mining or pumping
of oil, natural gas, or groundwater. Subsidence in the Gulf Coast region primarily results from
groundwater extraction, oil and gas extraction, and slumping along growth faults. Various
degrees of subsidence have been documented along the Texas coast, with the greatest incidences
occurring in the Houston-Galveston area.
Groundwater extraction in San Patricio County is primarily for irrigation and the amount
pumped varies by season and year. There are no water wells in the vicinity of the Terminal, and
while there are several oil and gas fields in San Patricio County, there is no significant petroleum
extraction near the proposed Terminal. Compaction of soft sediments under load can also lead to
subsidence;however, the Terminal would be underlain by consolidated stiff to hard clays and
medium to dense sands, minimizing the risk of subsidence. The only incidence of significant
subsidence is located more than 20 miles southwest of the site. Therefore, it is not anticipated
that subsidence would present a significant hazard to the Terminal site.
Slope Stability
Cheniere analyzed slope stability at the Terminal site to evaluate the erosion potential of
sand layers which would be exposed after dredging in the berth areas. The analysis revealed that
although there is little wave action in the La Quinta Channel, scour from tugboat propeller wash
could cause eventual slumping or slope failure. To minimize potential scour from tugboat
propeller wash, Cheniere would require that tugboats pull LNG carriers off the dock from the
offshore side rather than push from the inshore side. This would minimize the potential for
sustained propeller wash directed towards the shoreline.
Cheniere would further protect the shoreline by installing articulated block revetments.
To prevent scouring of sand layers exposed during dredging of the marine berths, Cheniere
would stabilize the berth slopes using articulated mats or other suitable means of stabilization.
Upland slopes within the Terminal would be seeded and maintained in a grassy condition as a
part of regular facility operations.

Environmental Impact Statement

4-5

Corpus Christi LNG

Cheniere would implement several preventative measures in order to avoid or minimize
the potential for slumping and slope failure. Therefore, adverse impacts on the slope stability at
the Terminal site after dredging would not be anticipated as a result of tugboat propeller wash.
Hurricane Winds
The Terminal site would be subj
ect to hurricane winds. The LNG tanks and associated
safety systems would be designed for a sustained wind speed of 150 mph.
The Terminal would be susceptible to hurricanes and tropical storms which could
produce storm surges, high winds, and flooding. The most recent FEMA Flood Insurance Rate
Map indicate that the maj
ority of the Terminal would be located within Zone C, while shoreline
areas would be located in Zones V22, A16, and B. The marine berth and LNG transfer lines
would be constructed within Zones V, A, or B. Table 4.1-1 includes definitions of FEMA flood
hazard zones for the Proj
ect area.
Table 4.1-1
Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood Hazard Zone Designations Within the Terminal
Zone Designation

Description

Zone A

Zone A is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to the 100-year floodplains that are determined
in the Flood Insurance Study by approximate methods. Because detailed hydraulic analyses are not
performed for such areas, no Base Flood (100-year flood)Elevations (the computed elevation to which
floodwater is anticipated to rise during the base flood)or depths are shown within this zone. Mandatory
flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

Zone A1 to A30

Zones A1 to A30 are the flood insurance rate zones that correspond to the 100-year floodplains that are
determined in the Flood Insurance Study by detailed methods. In most instances, Base Flood Elevations
derived from the detailed hydraulic analyses are shown at selected intervals within this zone. Mandatory
flood insurance purchase requirements apply.

Zones B and C

Zones B and C are the flood insurance rate zones that correspond to areas outside the 100-year
floodplains, including areas of 100-year sheet flow flooding where average depths are less than 1 foot,
areas of 100-year stream flooding where the contributing drainage area is less than 1 square mile, or
areas protected from the 100-year flood by levees. No Base Flood Elevations or depths are shown
within this zone.

Zone V

Zone V is the flood insurance rate zone that corresponds to the 100-year coastal floodplains that have
additional hazards associated with storm waves. Base Flood Elevations derived from the detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown at selected intervals within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply.

The Digital Storm Atlas of Texas predicts that a Category 5 hurricane striking Corpus
Christi Bay area could produce a storm surge of up to 21 feet AMSL. As a result, Cheniere
would construct the main processing equipment, storage tanks, and administration buildings in
upland areas at elevations greater than 25 feet AMSL. Additionally, the j
etty platforms would be
at a design elevation of 36 feet AMSL, and Cheniere would install all critical and LNGcontaining equipment at or above 25 feet AMSL. The shoreline would be protected through the
installation of articulated block revetments.
In the event of a Category 5 or lower hurricane, significant impacts on the Terminal
facilities would not be anticipated. Cheniere would implement design measures during
construction that would minimize or avoid potential damages that could occur during a
hurricane.

Corpus Christi LNG

The Proj
ect is located in an area that could present potential challenges relative to natural
hazards;however, these conditions can be effectively managed through sound engineering
design or shown to be minimal through additional evaluation. The overall effect of construction
and operation of the Terminal on topography and geology would be minor.
The
recommendation included in this section ensures that impacts on geologic resources would be
adequately minimized.
4.1.2

Pipeline Facilities

4.1.2.1

Geologic Setting

The Pipeline would be located in the same physiographic province as the Terminal,
described above in section 4.1.1. The topography crossed by the Pipeline increases in elevation
from 25 feet AMSL at MP 0.0 to 80 feet AMSL near MP 23.0. The Pipeline would also cross
recent Holocene-aged alluvial deposits that are underlain by deep Pleistocene-aged deltaic and
alluvial deposits. The Pipeline would be underlain by the Beaumont Formation from MP 0.0 to
MP 18.9, and the Lissie Formation from MP 18.9to MP 23.0.
4.1.2.2

Mineral Resources

Four known oil and gas fields and one sand and clay pit would be located within 0.25
mile of the Pipeline. An unnamed oil field would be crossed between MP 5.5 and MP 6.5, the
Midway Oil Field would be crossed between MP 7.5 and MP 8.5, the Taft Oil and Gas Field
would be crossed between MP 15.9and MP 19.0, and the Portilla Oil and Gas Field would be
crossed between MP 19.0 and MP 23.0. Oil and gas deposits contained within these fields would
be significantly below the proposed depth of the Pipeline trench, at approximately 5,350 to
14,000 feet below the ground surface, and should not be disturbed during the construction and
operations of the Pipeline.
The sand and clay pit is intermittently active and would be located approximately 200
feet from the Pipeline construction right-of-way between MP 1.7 and MP 1.8. Cheniere would
avoid impacts from mining operations in this parcel through pit mining monitoring and terms of
agreement resulting from discussions with the operator to allow an adequate easement for the
Pipeline.
A total of 43 foreign pipelines would be crossed by, or in close proximity to the Pipeline
or associated facilities. In order to ensure foreign pipeline integrity, Cheniere indicated that it
would: 1)use databases and line locaters to identify and mark foreign pipeline locations and
burial depth;2)notify foreign pipeline operators of crossing and execute any mandatory crossing
agreements;3)obtain as-built drawings from the foreign pipeline operators where available;4)
perform a “One Call”before excavating;5)employ best operating practices to both Cheniere’s
and the foreign pipeline operator’s standards when excavating near an existing line, which may
include prohibition of mechanical equipment within a specified distance of the line;6)require
hand digging to expose a foreign pipeline at certain critical locations;and 7)have foreign
pipeline operators provide an on-site field representative as oversight to the Pipeline construction
activities.
Cheniere also identified seven oil and gas wells that would be located within 150 feet of
the Pipeline. One of these wells would be located within the construction right-of-way and four
would be located within 50 feet of the construction right-of-way. Cheniere indicated that it
Environmental Impact Statement

4-7

Corpus Christi LNG

would consult with the RRC prior to Pipeline construction to obtain additional information
regarding oil and gas wells within 150 feet of the construction right-of-way. Additionally, field
verification surveys would be conducted to confirm the location of each well prior to Pipeline
construction. If an oil and gas well is unexpectedly encountered during construction Cheniere
would stop work immediately, contain any spillage of product, secure the area, and notify the EI,
RRC, and the FERC. The owner or operator of the well would be notified and Cheniere would
route around the well if necessary. Cheniere would request a route variance from the FERC, if
necessary, and adj
ust the centerline to avoid the well.
Although some mineral resources have been identified within close proximity to the
Pipeline or may be crossed by the Pipeline, Cheniere would implement the appropriate
preventative measures or mitigation to minimize or avoid impacts on these resources. Therefore,
the Pipeline would not significantly impact extractive resources in the form of oil and gas fields,
sand and clay pits, buried foreign pipelines, or oil and gas wells.
4.1.2.3

Paleontological Resources

No identified sensitive paleontological resources would be crossed by the Pipeline.
Therefore, no impacts are anticipated by constructing and operating the Pipeline.
4.1.2.4

Natural Hazards

Geologic hazards that could potentially affect the Pipeline facilities include earthquake
ground motions and faulting, soil liquefaction, subsidence, slope stability, and flooding.
Earthquake Ground Motion and Faulting
As previously discussed in section 4.1.1, impacts on the Pipeline from seismic activity
and faulting are not anticipated. The nearest mapped fault is 42 miles from the northern terminus
of the Pipeline and thus, the potential for large-magnitude seismic activity in the vicinity of the
Pipeline is low.
Soil Liquefaction
Due to the low levels of seismic activity and potential for ground motion in the Pipeline
area, there is little risk for liquefaction of soils to occur. Soil liquefaction would not be a
significant hazard for the Pipeline.
Subsidence
As discussed in section 4.1.1 above, subsidence in the Gulf Coast region is primarily
caused by groundwater extraction, oil and gas extraction, and slumping along growth faults. In
addition, soft sediments under load can also result in subsidence. Groundwater extraction in San
Patricio County is primarily for irrigation, and the amount varies by season and year. Although
the nearest significant subsidence event occurred more than 20 miles southwest of the Proj
ect
area, typically potential for subsidence is greatest to the northeast. San Patricio County does not
experience the degree of subsidence found elsewhere along the Gulf Coast. Subsidence would
not be a significant hazard for the Pipeline.

Environmental Impact Statement

4-8

Corpus Christi LNG

Slope Stability
The Pipeline route crosses topography that is relatively flat, with elevations gradually
increasing from 25 feet AMSL to 80 feet AMSL over 23 miles. Slope stability would not be a
significant hazard for the Pipeline.
Flooding
The Pipeline would be susceptible to hurricanes and tropical storms which could produce
storm surges, high winds, and flooding. The most recent FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map
indicates that the Pipeline would be located within Zones A, B, and C, with both of the
compressor stations located within Zone C (outside of the 100-year floodplain). Table 4.1-1
includes definitions of FEMA flood hazard zones for the Proj
ect area.
The segments of Pipeline that would be located in Zone A (100-year floodplain)would
have a higher susceptibility to flooding. To offset this risk Cheniere would use concrete coated
pipe at waterbody crossings and areas subj
ect to flooding to compensate for negative buoyancy.
Flooding would not be a significant hazard for the Pipeline, as Cheniere would implement
measures to combat buoyancy in the event of flood or storm surge.
Overall, impacts on geologic resources resulting from the installation of the Pipeline
would be minor. While flooding is a potential hazard for the area, Cheniere has adequately
mitigated for this through the implementation of measures to combat pipe buoyancy in floodprone areas. With the implementation of BMPs and our Plan and Procedures, impacts on
geological resources would be adequately minimized for constructing and operating the Pipeline.

Soils Types and Limitations

Soil types that occur within the proposed Proj
ect area and general limitations of these
soils were compiled from information presented in the USDA soil survey of San Patricio and
Aransas Counties, Texas (USDA, 1979)and USDA NRCS Soil Survey Geographic Database
(USDA, 2003). Soil types, general limitations, and the potential impacts on these soils from the
proposed Proj
ect, are presented in this section.
4.2.1.2

Terminal Facility

Construction of the Terminal would impact each of the nine soil types mapped by the
NRCS (including wasteland and urban land soil types). In total, approximately 646 acres would
be temporarily impacted by construction workspace and approximately 281 acres would be
permanently impacted by aboveground facility placement and operation. Table 4.2-1
summarizes the acreage impacts for each soil type.

a/ Soils are designated as prime farmland.
b/ Impact acreages do not include open water impacts and are not comparable to table 2.3-1 and table 4.8-1 because the NRCS
does not map soils in tidally influenced areas. NRCS soils mapping does not accurately follow the current shoreline where as
impacts in table 2.3-1 and table 4.8-1were calculated based on a more precise, current shoreline.

Publically available information was evaluated to identify and evaluate the soils that
would be most susceptible to impacts from construction of the Terminal. Maj
or soil limitations
within the Terminal are discussed below.
Hydric Soils
Hydric soils are defined as soils that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or
ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper
part. Soils that are artificially drained or protected from flooding (e.g., by levees)are still
considered hydric if the soil in its undistributed state would meet the definition of a hydric soil.
Cheniere would construct the Terminal in accordance with our Plan and Procedures. The
Environmental Impact Statement

4-10

Corpus Christi LNG

Procedures include provisions for wetland crossings and special construction measures in areas
of saturated soils. Cheniere’s implementation of these measures, as well as use of other BMPs
during construction, would minimize impacts on hydric soils and would not result in significant
long-term adverse impacts.
Compaction Potential
Soil compaction reduces the porosity and moisture-holding capability of soil. The degree
of compaction is dependent on moisture content and soil texture. Fine-textured soils with poor
internal drainage are most susceptible to compaction. Construction equipment travelling over
wet soils can disrupt soil structure, reduce pore space, increase runoff potential, and cause
rutting.
Approximately 288 acres of soils that would be impacted during construction and
operation of the Terminal have a high potential for severe compaction (Edroy clay;Orelia sandy
clay loam;Papalote fine sandy loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes;Raymondville clay loam, 0 to 1
percent slopes;and Victoria clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes)(see table 4.2-1). The potential impacts
on soils from compaction would be minimal due to the existing disturbed conditions at the
Terminal site. Cheniere would test soils for compaction and mitigate per our Plan in areas
temporarily impacted during construction of the Terminal.
Compacted soils have the potential to increase stormwater runoff at the site. Cheniere
would minimize the potential for stormwater runoff by developing and constructing systems
designed to manage stormwater runoff at the Terminal. Environmental impacts resulting from
compacted soils would be minimal and temporary or short-term through site design and the
implementation of mitigation measures outlined in our Plan and Procedures. Potential impacts
associated with stormwater runoff are further discussed in section 4.3.
Revegetation Potential
Physical properties and characteristics of soils contribute to the likelihood and duration of
successful revegetation in disturbed areas. Edroy clay and Monteola clay, 5 to 8 percent slopes
were identified as having low revegetation potential. Permanent aboveground facilities
associated with the Terminal would not be permitted to revegetate;however, areas temporarily
impacted during construction would be restored to preconstruction conditions. In order to ensure
successful revegetation in these areas, Cheniere would implement measures in our Plan as well
as recommendations of the local NRCS. Significant short- or long-term impacts on the
revegetation potential of soils are not anticipated given the implementation of these mitigation
measures.
Erosion Potential
Factors that influence soil erosion include soil texture, structure, length and percent of
slope, vegetative cover, and rainfall or wind intensity. Soils most susceptible to erosion by water
are typified by bare or sparse vegetative cover, noncohesive soil particles with low infiltration
rates, and moderate to steep slopes. Wind erosion processes are less affected by slope angles.
Clearing, grading, and equipment movement could accelerate the erosion process and, without
adequate protection, could result in discharge of sediment to waterbodies and wetlands. Soil loss
due to erosion could also reduce soil fertility and impair revegetation.
Soils within the Terminal site with high erosion potential are limited to Monteola clay, 5
to 8 percent slopes and those within the area labeled by the NRCS as “wasteland”, which have
Environmental Impact Statement

4-11

Corpus Christi LNG

been disturbed due to previous industrial activity. Impacts on these soils would result from
constructing the LNG storage tanks, marine basin and berth, as well as vaporization and related
processing equipment.
While the remaining soil types that would be impacted by constructing the Terminal are
designated as having low erosion potential, areas such as stream banks and the banks of drainage
ditches could also be susceptible to erosion resulting from construction activities. Cheniere
would implement our Procedures and incorporate the erosion and sediment control practices
specified in our Plan. Implementation of these erosion control measures while constructing and
operating the Terminal would minimize the potential for soil erosion and associated impacts.
The shoreline between Aransas Pass and the north boundary of the Padre Island National
Seashore changes at variable rates due to engineering modifications, which impact sediment
deposits by trapping sand in the littoral drift system. The shoreline at the Terminal site has been
stable from about 1937 to 1982, with no net change from erosion. However, wave action has
caused the shoreline west and east of the Terminal to retreat at an average rate of 1 to 3 feet per
year. Dredging of the marine basin, loading dock, and maneuvering area would modify a portion
of the shoreline within the Terminal site. Articulated block mats or rock breakwaters would
protect the shoreline within the maneuvering area from erosion.
The soils on the 20-foot high bluff overlooking the Corpus Christi Bay shoreline could
experience some erosion and slumping, but only minimal construction activities would occur in
this area;therefore, significant erosion of the bluff soils is not anticipated.
All ships passing through the Corpus Christi and La Quinta channels have the potential to
contribute to shoreline erosion. The severity of potential shoreline erosion bordering ship
channels is dependent on the number of ships;ship size, hull shape, speed, and draft;propeller
action;and channel proximity to shore, shoreline shape, and the type of material of the shoreline.
LNG carriers tend to have relatively shallower drafts than some other ships that currently use the
channels and are likely to have less wash effect than those other ships. For a variety of safety
reasons, LNG carriers calling on the Terminal would travel at slow speeds, with the
accompaniment of ship-assist tug boats, thereby minimizing the generated wave energy.
Additionally, the tugs would pull the LNG carriers off the dock to avoid scour from tugboat
propeller wash against the shore.
Historical shore stability at the Terminal site, use of articulated block mats or rock
breakwaters along the shoreline, as well as operation practices designed to minimize shoreline
scour would effectively mitigate for shoreline erosion, thus minimizing impacts.
Prime Farmland Soils
Prime farmland is land that has the best combination of physical and chemical
characteristics for producing food, feed, forage, fiber, oilseed, and other agricultural crops with
minimum inputs of fuel, fertilizer, pesticides, and labor, and without intolerable soil erosion, as
determined by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. In addition, prime farmland includes land that
possesses the above characteristics but is being used currently to produce livestock and timber.
Urbanized land and open water are excluded from prime farmland. Prime farmland typically
contains few or no rocks, is permeable to water and air, is not excessively erodible or saturated
with water for long periods, and is not subj
ect to frequent, prolonged flooding during the

Environmental Impact Statement

4-12

Corpus Christi LNG

growing season. Soils that do not meet the above criteria may be considered prime farmland if
the limiting factor is mitigated (e.g., artificial drainage).
Construction and operation of the Terminal would impact approximately 22 acres of soils
classified as prime farmland soil. Approximately 5 acres would be restored to preconstruction
conditions, and operation of the Terminal would permanently impact 17 acres (see table 4.2-1).
These soils were previously in industrial use and are already impacted;therefore, loss of this
acreage would not significantly impact prime farmland in the local area.
4.2.1.3

Sediments

Sediments that would be impacted by construction of the Terminal are located within the
proposed marine berth, loading dock, and maneuvering area. Dredging to an elevation of -46
feet with an additional 2 feet paid allowed overdredge and 2 feet advanced maintenance dredge
would remove approximately 4.4 mcy of sediments. The sediment types that would be dredged
are described as stiff clays with interbedded sand and silt layers.
Soils located in tidally influenced areas of Corpus Christi Bay have not been mapped by
the NRCS. However, in 2003, four borings were drilled near the proposed ship berths (CB-47,
CB-48, CB-52, and CB-54). The sediment types observed in the borings are summarized below:
 CB-47. Lean Clay or Fat Clay from the mudline at elevation -6 feet (National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929[NGVD 29])to the depth of dredging at elevation -42 feet.
 CB-48. Predominantly Lean Clay or Fat Clay from the mudline at elevation -7 feet to the
depth of dredging at elevation -42 feet;3-foot-thick layer of silty sand at elevation -23
feet;and a 4-foot-thick layer of clayey sand at elevation -36 feet.
 CB-52. Predominantly Silty Clay or Fat Clay from elevation -7 feet to the depth of
dredging at elevation -42 feet;a 5-foot-thick layer of silty sand layer at the ground
surface at elevation -2 feet;and a 4-foot-thick silty sand layer at elevation -30 feet.
 CB-54. Predominantly Lean Clay, Fat Clay, or Sandy Lean Clay from elevation -6 feet to
the depth of dredging at elevation -42 feet;a 5-foot-thick layer of silty sand at the ground
surface at elevation -1 foot;and a 3-foot-thick clayey sand layer at elevation -18 feet.
4.2.1.4

Contaminated Soils and Sediments

The Terminal site has been used to store bauxite ore since the 1950s. From 1957 to 1984,
the U.S. government arranged to have approximately 5,685,195 tons of bauxite ore from British
Guyana and Jamaica stockpiled on the northern portion of the Terminal site. In addition,
Sherwin and its predecessor, the Reynolds Metal Company, deposited approximately 1.6 mcy of
alumina processing waste materials into two former solid waste management units designated as
Beds 22 and 24 from 1954 to 1969. The EPA has determined that bauxite residue, or red mud,
does not exhibit any of the characteristics of hazardous waste, and that these deposits have a low
potential for danger to health and the environment. Three constituents of concern were identified
in red mud (arsenic, chromium, and radium-226), but at soil concentrations which were not
designated by TCEQ to be a risk. Arsenic concentrations were, however, found to exceed the
TCEQ Protective Concentration Level (PCL)in groundwater within and downgradient of Bed 22
(section 4.3). A clay cap was constructed over Bed 22 in 2007 to 2008 to prevent the further
infiltration of stormwater and leaching of contaminants into groundwater.
Environmental Impact Statement

4-13

Corpus Christi LNG

Contamination from spills or leaks of fuels, lubricants, and coolant from construction
equipment can have an adverse impact on soils. The effects of contamination would typically be
minor because of the low frequency and volumes of potential spills and leaks. Cheniere has
developed an acceptable SPCC Plan for construction that specifies cleanup procedures in the
event of soil contamination from spills or leaks of fuel, lubricants, coolants, or solvents.
Implementation of the measures in the SPCC Plan, revised to include certain Proj
ect-specific
measures, would adequately minimize the potential for soil contamination. Therefore, any
impacts resulting from soil contamination would be minor and temporary.
Sediments near the surface in urban environments may be contaminated by release of
various chemicals from human activities along the shoreline. In 2003, the COE reported the
results for the analysis of sediments that were sampled in 2000 as part of the Corpus Christi Ship
Channel Improvement Proj
ect. Three samples were analyzed for organic and metallic chemicals,
as well as metals, and then compared to the Effects Range Low (ERL)values, which are used by
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)as screening levels for assessing
sediment quality. These are conservative levels used to identify sediment that may require
additional evaluations before decisions on disposal or beneficial re-use are made. The samples
were all identified as below the ERL levels.
Three samples were also compared to the TCEQ PCL for Tier 1 commercial/industrial
soil protective of Class 3 groundwater for metals. All concentrations were below the PCL levels.
Samples were also collected from the La Quinta Channel in 2000 and analyzed for
polychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. All detections
were below ERL levels. We are not aware of more recent data than that presented in the 2003
COE report.
Additional impacts on soils as a result of the Terminal would include historic soil
contamination at the site, as discussed above, as well as the potential for import of contaminated
soils. In order to minimize the potential for the import of contaminated soils, Cheniere would
follow the guidelines outlined in Specification for Site Preparation and Earthwork (Document
No. 25744-200-3PS-CG00-F0001)to fulfill the requirements for soils imported to the site.
Specification for Site Preparation and Earthwork describes the measures that would be
implemented to ensure these soils are not contaminated. See below for an excerpt of the fill
material requirements.
General fill shall be an inorganic, non-expansive cohesive material meeting the following
requirements:

Soils

The Pipeline would cross two soil associations (Victoria-Raymondville-Orelia and
Orelia-Papalote)including five soil types: Orelia sandy clay loam, Papalote fine sandy loam
(0 to 1 percent slopes), Papalote fine sandy loam (1 to 3 percent slopes), Raymondville clay loam
(0 to 1 percent slopes), and Victoria clay (0 to 1 percent slopes). Characteristics of these soil
associations are provided in table 4.2-4.

Soil Limitations

Publicly available data was evaluated to determine the most susceptible soils crossed by
the Pipeline. Limitations for soils crossed by the Pipeline are summarized in table 4.2-4.
Hydric Soils
No hydric soils have been identified along the Pipeline route, except where wetlands are
crossed and in isolated areas where soils with high clay content have been subj
ected to periods of
heavy saturation. As described above, Cheniere would construct the Pipeline in accordance with
the measures contained in our Procedures to minimize impacts on hydric soils. Therefore, any
impacts on hydric soils would be minor and temporary.
Compaction Potential
The Victoria-Raymondville-Orelia soil association has a high potential for compaction.
Mitigation for soil compaction in agricultural areas would include topsoil segregation,
postponing soil disturbances when soils are wet, and using deep tillage prior to replacement of
the topsoil. Therefore, impacts on soils from compaction would be temporary and minor given
the implementation of these mitigation measures and those described in our Plan.
Revegetation Potential
The aboveground facilities along the Pipeline would cover approximately 21.5 acres of
land and would be permanently maintained as fenced and graveled sites. Additionally,
approximately 4.1 acres of soils crossed by the Pipeline (MP 18.9to MP 23)were identified as
having a low potential for revegetation. Cheniere would implement measures in our Plan as well
as recommendations of the local NRCS to ensure successful revegetation in these areas. Some of
these measures include the addition of soil additives, and seeding requirements. Therefore, shortor long-term impacts on the revegetation potential of soils are not anticipated given the
implementation of these mitigation measures, which includes monitoring of the right-of-way.

Environmental Impact Statement

4-16

Corpus Christi LNG

Prime Farmland
There are seven aboveground facilities associated with the proposed pipeline that would
be located on prime farmland (see table 4.2-5)which would result in the removal of 21.5 acres of
prime farmland. The impact would be permanent since each site would be graveled and fenced.
However, given the amount of available prime farmland in the area, the impact is not considered
significant.
Construction of the Pipeline could also impact prime farmland. These impacts could
include interference with agricultural drainage, mixing of topsoil and subsoil, and soil rutting and
compaction. These impacts would result primarily from excavating and backfilling the pipeline
trench and vehicular traffic along the construction right-of-way.
Impacts on soils from the Pipeline would be minor. Most impacts during construction
would be short-term and would not impact the potential use of prime farmland for agricultural
purposes. Cheniere has consulted with the NRCS regarding potential impacts on prime farmland
soils and has agreed to segregate topsoil to a depth of 12 inches. The NRCS indicated in a letter
dated December 9, 2003 (regarding the previously proposed pipeline under Docket Nos. CP0437-000 and CP04-44-000)that it did not consider the construction of the Pipeline to represent a
permanent conversion of Important Farmland, because the land could still be used for
agricultural production after the Pipeline is installed and the right-of-way reclaimed. We concur
with the NRCS letter.

Overall, adhering to the measures in our Plan would minimize impact on agricultural

4.2.2.3

Contaminated Soils

The Pipeline would not cross any areas with known contaminated sediments. Cheniere
performed a search of environmental databases to determine if contaminated soils were present
along the proposed Pipeline. No known areas of contamination were identified along the
Pipeline route.
Contamination from spills or leaks of fuels, lubricants, and coolant from construction
equipment can adversely impact soils. The effects of contamination would typically be minor
because of the low frequency and volumes of potential spills and leaks. Cheniere has developed
an acceptable SPCC Plan for construction that specifies cleanup procedures in the event of soil
contamination from spills or leaks of fuel, lubricants, coolants, or solvents. Implementation of
the measures in the SPCC Plan, revised to include certain Proj
ect-specific measures, would
adequately minimize the potential for soil contamination.
4.2.2.4

Erosion Control

During construction of the pipeline, Cheniere would implement some of the erosion
control measures presented in our Plan such as installing temporary slope breakers, such as silt
fence or staked hay or straw bales to reduce the runoff velocity and divert water off the
construction right-of-way. In addition, Cheniere would use sediment barriers to stop the flow of
sediments and prevent the deposition of sediments beyond approved workspaces or into sensitive
resources.
None of the soils crossed by the Pipeline would have high erosion potential;therefore,
impacts on soils resulting from erosion would be negligible.
4.3

WATER RESOURCES

4.3.1

Terminal Facilities

4.3.1.1

Groundwater

The proposed Terminal is located in the Coastal Lowlands aquifer system within San
Patricio and Nueces Counties. In Texas, the Coastal Lowlands aquifer system underlies about
35,000 square miles of level, low-lying coastal plain and is comprised of Miocene-age and
younger unconsolidated sediments of sand, silt, and clay. These sediments were deposited in
three depositional environments: continental (alluvial plain), transitional (delta, lagoon, and
beach), and marine (continental shelf)(Ryder, 1996). In San Patricio and Nueces Counties, the
primary water-bearing stratigraphic units are Pliocene-age Goliad sand, Pleistocene-age Lissie
and Beaumont formations, and Holocene-age alluvial and beach sands in the Nueces River valley
(Shafer, 1968). Within Texas, the coastal lowlands aquifer system is commonly referred to as
the Gulf Coast aquifer which is separated into five permeable zones and two confining units
(Ryder, 1996).
Along the Gulf Coast, the upper part of the aquifer system is unconfined. The Chicot and
Evangeline aquifers are commonly used hydrogeologic-unit designations for subdivisions of the
upper, mostly sandy part of the aquifer system. Water supply wells in southeastern San Patricio
County are screened in the Chicot aquifer at depths typically less than 50 feet. Groundwater in
the county is primarily used for irrigation;however, its use is limited by high concentrations of
chloride, salinity, and alkalinity. There are no fresh-water bearing sands within the Terminal
Environmental Impact Statement

4-18

Corpus Christi LNG

site. Saltwater intrusion in the permeable sands extends further inland along the northern shore
of Corpus Christi Bay. The nearest freshwater sands are located east of the Terminal site, in the
vicinity of Aransas Pass and Ingleside.
The Terminal site is not underlain by a sole-source aquifer, as designated by the EPA,
and there are no locally zoned aquifer protection areas within the Terminal site. There is very
little groundwater use in the county and almost no pumping in the area. Most municipal water
systems in San Patricio and Nueces Counties obtain water from Lake Corpus Christi, Lake
Texana, or the Nueces River.
According to Texas Water Development Board data there are no public or private water
supply wells located within 150 feet of the Terminal and thus, there are no wellhead protection
areas (also known as source water protection areas)crossed by the Terminal. The nearest public
and private supply wells are located about 3.2 miles and 2.3 miles from the Terminal site,
respectively.
As discussed in section 4.2, groundwater monitoring showed that arsenic concentrations
in shallow groundwater exceeded the TCEQ PCL, within and slightly downgradient of Bed 22.
Groundwater quality monitoring is the responsibility of the Reynolds Metals Company under a
TCEQ-approved Remedial Action Plan which established a plume management zone for the
natural attenuation monitoring of arsenic concentrations in groundwater downgradient of Bed 22.
The depth to groundwater over the maj
ority of the Terminal site is approximately 11 feet
and most excavations for construction would generally be in the range of 3 to 5 feet below
ground surface. It may be necessary to dewater trenches during construction if shallow
groundwater is encountered during excavations. Because of the relatively small amount of water
removed, the short duration of the activity, and the local discharge of the water, groundwater
levels would quickly recover after pumping stops. Cheniere would follow the measures in our
Procedures, which require that dewatering structures be located so that there would be no
discharge of sediments into wetlands and waterbodies.
Hammer-driven pilings would be used during the construction of the berthing docks. A
potential impact associated with driven pilings is the cross contamination of lower permeable
aquifer zones through downward vertical seepage from one layer to another. The anticipated
maximum depth of pilings is at an elevation of approximately -80 feet. At this depth, the pilings
would stay within the upper (shallow)permeable zone of the Chicot aquifer. Keeping the pilings
within one layer of the Chicot aquifer system and not crossing aquifer confining layers reduces
the potential for cross-contamination.
The greatest potential for an impact on groundwater would be an accidental release of
hazardous substances, such as fuels, lubricants, and coolants, while constructing and operating
the Terminal facilities. Cheniere has agreed to implement our Procedures, including the
preparation and implementation of Spill Prevention and Response Procedures that meet state and
federal requirements. Cheniere filed a SPCC Plan that provides measures to minimize the
potential impacts of spills of hazardous materials. Cheniere’s SPCC Plan describes general
preventative BMPs, including personnel training, equipment inspection, and refueling procedures
to reduce the likelihood of a spill. It also describes the mitigation measures, including
containment and cleanup, to minimize potential impacts should a spill occur.

Environmental Impact Statement

4-19

Corpus Christi LNG

Substantial impacts on the groundwater resources underlying the Terminal facilities are
not anticipated due to: the non-potable saline groundwater conditions that naturally occurs at the
site, lack of water supply wells in the area, depth of groundwater below land surface in relation
to anticipated excavation depths, construction of the proposed pilings within the permeable zone
of the Chicot aquifer and not crossing aquifer confining layers, and surficial mitigation measures
that would be implemented by Cheniere in the event of a hazardous material spill.
4.3.1.2

Surface Water

The Terminal would be located on the north shore of Corpus Christi Bay, situated at the
northwestern end of the La Quinta Channel. Corpus Christi Bay is designated in the National
Estuary Program as an estuary of “national significance”. Corpus Christi Bay is typically
shallow, with an average depth of 8 feet;however, there are two shipping channels through the
bay that are dredged to -45 feet mean low tide to allow passage of large cargo and tanker ships.
As described previously, Cheniere would dredge a maneuvering area to a depth of -46 feet (plus
two feet overdredge and 2 feet advanced maintenance dredge)to allow LNG carriers access to
the Terminal. These activities were previously permitted by the COE. Following construction,
dredged material would be disposed of in the designated DMPAs. Specifically, dredged material
would be put to beneficial use as fill for a portion of a former 90-acre clay borrow pit and to
facilitate the capping of 385 acres of bauxite residue beds that have laid open since 1968 (DMPA
2). Post-construction maintenance dredging would be conducted on an as-needed basis;
however, is not anticipated to be more than once every three years. A portion of the marine
facilities approach was recently dredged by the COE as part of an extension of the La Quinta
Channel.
Based on the TCEQ Draft 305(b)Water Quality Inventory, designated uses for Corpus
Christi Bay are Contact Recreation, Aquatic Life, Fish Consumption, Oyster Waters, and
General Use. All designated uses that were assessed in the 305(b)inventory are fully supported
(TCEQ, 2010a). Corpus Christi Bay is considered a warmwater, saline fishery.
Water quality issues currently affecting Corpus Christi Bay include reduced inflow of
fresh water;wetland habitat loss;chemical, heavy metal, and nutrient increases;brown tide;and
floating debris (American Oceans Campaign, 1996). Freshwater inflow to the bay has been
reduced by increasing demands from upstream communities that rely on surface water for their
water supply. The Corpus Christi Bay watershed supports the petrochemical, agriculture, and
shipping industries, which have the potential to degrade water quality through chemical and oil
spills, pesticide and fertilizer runoff, and heavy metal contamination. Corpus Christi Bay is
generally considered turbid, with a long-term average of total suspended solids ranging from 20
to 100 milligrams per liter (mg/L)or higher (Corpus Christi Bay National Estuary Program,
1997). This turbidity can be attributed to the natural characteristics of the bay as well as ongoing
shipping and periodic dredging activities.
As described below, construction and operation of the Terminal facilities would
temporarily and permanently impact Corpus Christi Bay.
Turbidity and Sedimentation
To facilitate the construction of the terminal facilities, marine basin, and maneuvering
area, Cheniere would use mechanical and hydraulic cutterhead-suction dredges to excavate
nearshore waters. These dredging activities would require approximately six months to
Environmental Impact Statement

4-20

Corpus Christi LNG

complete. Hydraulic suction dredges cut and pull dredged material into the dredge device
minimizing turbidity in the water column. Although hydraulic cutterhead dredges capture the
maj
ority of sediment loosened, some sediment would become suspended in the water. Studies of
cutterhead dredges indicate that elevated turbidity is limited to the lower portion of the water
column and turbidity levels are at background within several hundred feet of the cutterhead.
Therefore, the dispersion of sediments that would occur during dredging would be minimal. To
further minimize turbidity and sedimentation impacts, Cheniere would adj
ust cutterhead speeds.
In addition to the use of a hydraulic cutterhead dredge to minimize turbidity and
sedimentation impacts, the natural characteristics of Corpus Christi Bay would also work to
minimize these impacts. Ward (1997)describes the tidal flushing in Corpus Christi Bay as a
restricted flow, tidal regime switching from semi-diurnal to diurnal. The tides are wind
dominated which results in relatively higher tides in summer and spring with lower tides in
winter and fall because of the prevailing wind. Because of the change in the width to depth ratio
of the La Quinta Channel, overall currents would be expected to be relatively low, particularly at
or near the bottom where dredging would occur.
We have determined that dredging activities would result in levels of turbidity consistent
with ambient total suspended solids concentrations, up to the approximately 80 mg/L that TCEQ
has reported as normal within 1 foot of the water surface. Therefore, based on the general
hydrologic characteristics of the site and the proposed dredging activities, we expect that most of
the turbidity and sedimentation would be localized, would return to background levels a short
distance from the point of disturbance, and would not significantly affect surface water quality.
In addition, proper disposal of dredged materials and implementation of the measures outlined in
our Plan and Procedures would further reduce or avoid significant increases in background
turbidity levels in the La Quinta Channel.
Dredging activities would also result in and potential runoff from the
construction/dredging equipment. Runoff impacts would be minimized through use of BMPs
and active maintenance of equipment.
Maintenance dredging would only occur in areas that have been previously dredged
during the initial construction of the Terminal. Maintenance dredging is presently expected to
occur no more frequently than once every three years and each event is anticipated to last for no
more than 30 days. Hydraulic cutterhead dredges would also be used to limit resuspension, and
sediments would be sampled and tested for priority pollutants prior to each maintenance
dredging event according to the methodology described in the Inland Testing Manual
(EPA/COE, 1998).
Cheniere is required to obtain several permits that would address dredging and dredged
material management, including permits from the COE under Section 404 of the CWA and
Section 10 of the RHA. Permits for water discharges into the bay from the Terminal would be
obtained from the EPA and/or the TCEQ under Section 401 of the CWA. A NPDES permit
under Section 402 of the CWA issued by the RRC would be necessary to regulate return water
flowing from the DMPA. The issuance of these permits takes into consideration impacts on
environmental resources;therefore, the permits may contain operational limitations designed to
minimize or avoid environmental impacts.
Several permit applications were submitted to the COE including the Section 404/10
Individual Permit application, as well as a Request for State Water Quality Certification and
Environmental Impact Statement

4-21

Corpus Christi LNG

Request for Coastal Zone Management Consistency Determination submitted to the RRC. At the
time of this EIS, the COE has not yet issued the Section 404/10 Individual Permit.
Ship and Boat Traffic
Ship and boat traffic associated with constructing and operating the Terminal could
impact surface water resources as a result of ship movements, including propeller use, and ballast
water exchanges. Increased wave action from ship and boat movements could increase turbidity
and sedimentation. Additional impacts on surface water resources would result from LNG
carrier operations requiring ballast water discharge at the Terminal. Discharge of ballast water at
the Terminal site could also increase turbidity in the immediate area, as well as alter the salinity
levels and water temperature. Impacts on water resources resulting from ballast water would be
temporary and minor, only affecting a relatively small area. Additional information regarding
impacts associated with ballast water is provided in section 4.6.2.
Ship and boat traffic has the potential to adversely impact water quality in the event of an
accidental release of a hazardous substance such as fuel, lubricants, coolants, or other materials
on board the vessel. Cheniere would implement the measures outlined in their SPCC in the
event of a spill, as well as measures outlined in our Procedures. Cheniere would minimize the
risk of a spill by implementing general preventative BMPs, including personnel training,
equipment inspection, and refueling procedures.
Stormwater Runoff
Stormwater run-off collecting at the Terminal would be discharged into Corpus Christi
Bay directly or, via the La Quinta Ditch which runs alongside La Quinta Road. Stormwater
removal from within the LNG storage tank dikes must conform to 49CFR 193.2173, requiring
water to be pumped out at 25 percent of the maximum predictable collection rate from a storm of
ten-year frequency and one-hour duration. Cheniere would follow our Procedures which require
that prior to construction Cheniere must prepare a SWPPP that complies with the EPA’s National
Stormwater Program General Permit requirements.
Water Use
The potable water supply for the Terminal facilities would be obtained from a San
Patricio Municipal Water District 24-inch-diameter main water line at the j
unction of SH 35 and
SH 361. The San Patricio Municipal Water District obtains its water from the Nueces River and
Lake Texana (TCEQ, 2010b). The water supply for the compressor stations would also be
procured from the San Patricio Municipal Water District. The volumes of water required to
construct and operate the Terminal are provided in tables 4.3-1 and 4.3-2.

Hydrostatic Testing
Prior to being placed into service, the LNG storage tanks would be tested to ensure
structural integrity. The LNG piping would be pneumatically tested and therefore, would not
require hydrostatic testing. Other piping and equipment associated with the Terminal would
require hydrostatic testing. The total cumulative volume of water required for construction and
hydrostatic testing of this equipment would be approximately 167 million gallons.
Upon completion of construction, the inner tank of each of the LNG storage tanks would
be tested hydrostatically, in accordance with API Standard 620, Q.8.3. Hydrostatic testing would
involve filling each of the inner tanks with approximately 42,270,000 gallons of fresh water.
Test water would be purchased from the San Patricio Municipal Water District, and discharged
to a drainage ditch that flows into Corpus Christi Bay or the Sherwin Alumina raw water
reservoir (j
ust north of the Terminal)for use in their facilities.
Pumps in each tank would control the discharge rate of the test water from the LNG
storage tanks while discharge structures, such as a splash plate or hay bale structures, would be
used to dissipate energy during discharge of the hydrostatic test water. These energy dissipation
devices aid in preventing scouring and erosion. No chemicals would be added to the hydrostatic

test water before or after testing. All test waters would be analyzed for chemical composition
prior to discharge.
Conclusion
Construction and operation of the Terminal would temporarily decrease water quality
within the vicinity of the site as a result of dredging, maintenance dredging, and stormwater
runoff. As described previously, impacts on water quality from dredging activities would be
short-term and localized to within a few hundred feet of the activity. Through implementation of
Cheniere’s BMPs, NPDES permitting, our Procedures, and Cheniere’s SPCC Plan, potential
impacts resulting from stormwater runoff or the discharge of hydrostatic test water would be
adequately minimized or avoided.
4.3.2

Pipeline

4.3.2.1

Groundwater

As discussed above for the Terminal, the Pipeline area is underlain by the Gulf Coast
aquifer, characterized as an unconfined aquifer with unconsolidated sand, silt, and clay (Ryder,
1996). There are no locally protected aquifers, public or private water supplies, or wellheads in
the vicinity of the Pipeline.
The greatest potential for impacts on groundwater would be an accidental release of a
hazardous substance, such as fuels, lubricants, and coolants while constructing and operating the
Pipeline. Cheniere would implement the measures contained in our Procedures, as well as its
SPCC Plan which provides measures to minimize the potential impacts associated with spills of
hazardous materials.
4.3.2.2

Surface Water

The Pipeline would cross nine waterbodies. There are no potable water intakes within
3 miles downstream of any waterbody crossing. No waterbody segments crossed by the Pipeline
are included on the list of impaired waterbodies under Section 303(d)of the CWA nor do they
contain contaminated sediments. Table 4.3-3 provides a list of the waterbodies that would be
crossed by the Pipeline, including location by MP, waterbody name, type, crossing width, water
quality classification, fishery type, and proposed crossing method. The pipeline would cross
only two natural, permanently flowing waterbodies;Oliver Creek (MP 16.6)and Chiltipin Creek
(MP 17.9).

d/ HDD=horizontal directional drill

Cheniere would use the HDD method to cross Oliver and Chiltipin Creeks. Crossing
these waterbodies via HDD would avoid direct impacts on them as the Pipeline would be
installed underneath the stream bed. With the exception of one drainage ditch, the remaining
waterbodies are typically dry with little or no flow.
Waterbodies crossed via the open cut method could experience a decrease in water
quality due to increased turbidity and sedimentation. However, due to the duration of
disturbance, these impacts would be short-term. In addition, we anticipate that most drainage
ditches would not be flowing during construction of the Pipeline and thus a decrease in water
quality due to excess turbidity would not occur. Furthermore, impacts on the water quality of
crossed waterbodies as a result of increased turbidity or sedimentation during Pipeline
construction and operation would short-term and minor because in stream construction activities
would occur within 48 hours.
To minimize impacts on waterbodies, Cheniere would implement measures described in
our Procedures. These measures would include:
 restoring stream banks and natural contours to preconstruction conditions to the
maximum extent practicable using the measures contained in our Plan and Procedures;
 stabilizing banks and installing temporary erosion sediment barriers within 24 hours;and

Environmental Impact Statement

 vegetating disturbed riparian areas with conservation grasses and legumes or native plant
species.
Additionally, lubricant, hydraulic fluid, and fuel spills from refueling construction
equipment, fuel storage, or equipment failure in or near a waterbody could flow or migrate to the
waterbody and impact water quality and other aquatic resources. Cheniere would implement the
measures outlined in its SPCC Plan to minimize the potential impacts of spills and hazardous
materials in waterbodies.
An adverse impact on waterbodies as a result of a hazardous materials spill would not be
anticipated, as Cheniere would implement preventative and mitigation measures as outlined in its
SPCC Plan and our Procedures.
Prior to being placed into service, the Pipeline would be hydrostatically tested to ensure
structural integrity. The Pipeline would be filled with approximately 11,400,000 gallons of
water for hydrostatic testing. Cheniere would likely obtain the water from an existing 30-inchdiameter raw water line owned and operated by the San Patricio Municipal Water District.
After testing is complete, water would be discharged at an average rate of approximately
4,000 gallons per minute into the Sherwin Alumina raw water reservoir located approximately
400 feet north of the south end of the Pipeline. Alternatively, the water may be discharged into
the drainage ditch along La Quinta Road where it would flow into the La Quinta Channel.
Cheniere would use appropriate energy dissipation and erosion control measures to prevent
scouring during dewatering. No chemicals would be added to the test water. As described for the
Terminal in Section 4.3.1 the raw water reservoir would have enough volume to accommodate
the one time discharge of hydrostatic test water from the Pipeline.
Conclusion
Waterbodies crossed by the Pipeline via the open cut method would experience shortterm decreases in water quality resulting from increased turbidity, sedimentation, and overall
stream bed and bank disturbance. However, we have determined that implementation of
Cheniere’s SPCC Plan as well as use of the measures outlined in our Procedures would
adequately minimize impacts on surface water resources.
4.4

WETLANDS

As defined by the COE, wetlands are areas inundated or saturated by surface water or
groundwater. Under normal circumstances these areas support a prevalence of vegetation
typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.
Cheniere identified wetlands within the Proj
ect area by field delineation. Delineations
followed the Routine On-Site Determination Methodology presented in the COE Wetland
Delineation Manual (Technical Report Y-B7-1)and the Regional Supplement to the Corps of
Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual: Atlantic Gulf Coastal Plain, Version 2.0 released in
November 2010 (ERDC/EL TR-10-20).
4.4.1

Terminal Facilities

Five wetland types were identified at the Terminal site;cordgrass salt marsh (estuarine
intertidal emergent [E2EM]wetland), black mangrove (estuarine intertidal scrub/shrub [E2SS]
wetland), unvegetated sand flat (estuarine intertidal flat [E2FL]), vegetated sand flat/high marsh
Environmental Impact Statement

Corpus Christi LNG

(E2FL), and seagrass (estuarine submerged aquatic bed [E1AB]). Table 4.4-1 provides the
approximate acreages of each wetland type located at the Terminal site. Typically, smooth
cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora)is the only species found within this wetland type, however in
the low marshes other species often include: saltmarsh bulrush (Scirpus maritimes var.
macrostachyus), perennial glasswort (Salicornia virginica), and sea lavender (Limonium
carolinianum). Black mangrove (Avicennia germinans)is the dominant species in the black
mangrove wetland type, but buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus), leather fern (Acrostichum
aureum), perennial glasswort, and bay marigold (Borrichia arborescens)may also be found.
The dominant species among sparsely vegetated sand flat often includes various glasswort
species (Salicornia spp.), saltwort (Batis maritima), mud plantain (Heteranthera reniformis), and
false pimpernel (Lindernia dubia). Seagrass consists predominantly of shoal grass (Halodule
wrightii), manatee grass (Syringodium filiforme), turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum), clover
grass (Halophila engelmanni), and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima).

Total

Construction and operation of the Terminal facilities would temporarily and permanently
impact wetlands. As identified in table 4.4-1, approximately 6.19and 5.91 acres of cordgrass
salt marsh, 7.35 and 6.72 acres of black mangrove, 4.62 and 3.87 acres of unvegetated and
vegetated sand flats, and 9.29and 9.17 acres of seagrass would be impacted by construction and
operation, respectively. A total of approximately 27.45 and 25.67 acres of wetlands would be
temporarily and permanently impacted by the construction and operation of the Terminal
facilities, respectively.
Temporary wetland impacts would be those associated exclusively with construction
activities. Once construction is complete, wetlands which were temporarily disturbed by
construction activities would be restored to preconstruction contours and allowed to naturally
revegetate. Unlike temporary impacts, permanently impacted wetlands would not be restored to
preconstruction conditions following the completion of construction activities, but would be
maintained as part of the Proj
ect.
To avoid and minimize impacts on wetlands, the Terminal facilities were sited in a
manner that would result in less wetland impact. To mitigate unavoidable impacts on wetlands,
Cheniere submitted an Aquatic Resources Mitigation Plan (ARMP)for the Proj
ect to the COE.
This plan was submitted to the COE as part of the CWA Section 404 permitting process and
Environmental Impact Statement

4-27

Corpus Christi LNG

approved in 2005 (DA Permit 23561). Since 2005, Cheniere has continued to work with the
COE to finalize the ARMP to account for additional wetland impacts associated with the
proposed Proj
ect.
Cheniere’s proposed conceptual wetland mitigation plan at Shamrock Island was
approved by the COE in 2005 to mitigate for impacts to waters of the U.S. associated with the
previous proposal to construct an LNG import terminal and associated pipeline (Docket Nos.
CP04-37-000, CP04-44-000, CP04-45-000, and CP04-46-000). Mitigation measures for the
previously permitted 12.88 acres of wetland impacts were completed in 2013 and included the
installation of 16 breakwaters bordering the north-western end of Shamrock Island. Construction
of these breakwaters would assist in the preservation of existing habitats including cordgrass,
mangroves, unvegetated sand flats, vegetated sand flats, hard substrates, and uplands.
The EPA expressed concern regarding Cheniere’s ARMP. The COE addressed this
concern and determined that 50 years to achieve an 8.9:1 preservation ratio, as proposed in
Cheniere’s ARMP, is not an appropriate period to evaluate preservation values. The COE
recommends evaluating the preservation values during a 10-year period, during which time,
conditions affecting the site would be relatively consistent and less likely to be influenced by
sudden episodic events, such as hurricanes. Use of a shorter time period would lower Cheniere’s
estimated preservation ratio and potentially change the habitat types preserved by the proposed
ARMP.
The COE determined that in order to quantitatively evaluate Proj
ect impacts on wetland
habitats, it is in the public’s best interest to perform a functional assessment of the Proj
ect. A
functional assessment would quantify, in a scientifically sound, reproducible and reasonably
rapid manner, the wetland functions lost and those that would be mitigated for by the Proj
ect.
This would allow the COE to verify if the Proj
ect is consistent with the COE-EPA Memorandum
of Understanding of Mitigation under the CWA Section 404(b)(1)Guidelines and 33 CFR
332.3(f)(1), and determine if the anticipated impacts would be adequately compensated by the
proposed mitigation. Pending the results of the functional assessment, increased compensation
in the mitigation area could be required.
Following construction, Cheniere would monitor all temporarily impacted wetlands and
adj
acent wetlands, in accordance with our Procedures. Post-construction monitoring would
include photographing, measuring and reporting the extent of aerial vegetative cover at six
months, one year, two years, and three years following their initial restoration attempt. At the
end of each yearly interval, if wetlands are not reestablishing as planned, monitoring would also
include notification of the COE and other appropriate resource agencies in order to develop
alternative mitigation or restoration plans.
Construction and operation of the Terminal would result in the loss of approximately
25.67 acres of wetland and would temporarily disturb 1.78 acres. Because Cheniere’s ARMP is
still under development, we recommend that:
 Prior to construction,Cheniere should file the ARMP developed in consultation
with the COE. The plan should include:
a. details regarding the amount,location,and types of mitigation proposed;and
b. specific performance standards to measure the success of the mitigation;and
remedial measures,as necessary,to ensure that mitigation is successful.
Environmental Impact Statement

4-28

Corpus Christi LNG

Based on Cheniere’s proposed impact mitigation measures as well as preparation of the
functional assessment and ARMP to be approved by the COE, we have determined that
constructing and operating the Terminal would not have a significant impact on wetlands.
4.4.2

Pipeline Facilities

The Pipeline would cross three palustrine emergent wetlands (PEM)as identified in table
4.4-2. PEM wetlands are characterized by a dominance of rooted herbaceous (non-woody)
emergent wetland plants such as grasses and short, shrubby vegetation. Typical herbaceous
species which occur in the PEM wetlands crossed by the Pipeline include: river birch (Betula
nigra), mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), deciduous holly (Ilex decidua), locust (Gleditsia
triacanthos), sedges (Carex spp.), softstem bulrush (Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani), curly
dock (Rumex crispus), common cattail (Typha latifolia), spikerushes (Eleocharis spp.), and red
fescue (Festuca rubra). Table 4.4-2 also provides the milepost location, wetland ID, temporary
and permanent areas of impact, and wetland classification for each wetland crossed by the
Pipeline facilities.

Temporary impacts based on 75-foot construction right-of-way
Permanent impacts based on 50-foot wide permanent right-of-way
Areas where no impacts would occur because area would be crossed via bore or HDD

Impacts on wetlands would include the temporary disturbance of wetland vegetation,
soils, and hydrology. Additionally, soil disturbance and removal of wetland vegetation would
temporarily impact wetland functions. Failure to properly segregate topsoil over the Pipeline
trenchline would result in the mixing of topsoil with subsoil. This mixing can affect the success
of post-construction reestablishment and the natural recruitment of native, wetland vegetation.
To avoid and minimize impacts on wetlands crossed by the Pipeline, Cheniere has reduced
workspaces wherever possible. Cheniere has also routed the proposed Pipeline in several
locations to avoid crossing wetlands entirely. Additionally, two of the three wetlands crossed by
the Pipeline would be bored or crossed via HDD, thus avoiding or minimizing impacts. Though
there is one PEM wetland that is located within the proposed permanent right-of-way, this
wetland would be restored following completion of construction activities. Cheniere would also
implement impact minimization measures identified in our Procedures. Maj
or components of
our Procedures which are applicable to wetland construction include:
 limiting construction equipment operating within the right-of-way to the equipment
necessary for clearing, excavating, pipe installation, backfilling, and restoration activities;

Environmental Impact Statement

4-29

Corpus Christi LNG

 using upland access roads for all non-essential equipment to the maximum extent
practicable;
 operating low-ground-weight equipment or operating from prefabricated construction
mats in saturated wetlands;
 installing temporary erosion and sediment control measures immediately after the initial
disturbance of wetland soils, and inspecting and maintaining the temporary erosion and
sediment control measures until final stabilization;
 refueling and parking equipment at least 100 feet from a wetland boundary;
 installing sediment controls across the construction right-of-way, as needed, to contain
trench spoil within wetlands;and
 segregating the uppermost foot of wetland topsoil from the underlying subsoil in areas
disturbed by trenching, except in areas with standing water or saturated soils, or where no
topsoil layer is evident.
Following construction, Cheniere would also monitor all temporarily impacted wetlands
and adj
acent wetlands, in accordance with the ARMP and our Procedures. Based on the amount
and type of wetlands impacted along the Pipeline route and Cheniere's proposed impact
minimization measures, we have determined that constructing and operating the Pipeline would
not significantly impact wetlands.
4.5

VEGETATION

4.5.1

Terminal Facilities

The Terminal would be located within the southeastern portion of the Gulf Prairies and
Marshes Ecoregion (Gould, 1975). The TPWD has defined area-specific vegetation types that
characterize the state by vegetative cover and habitat types (McMahan et al., 1984). The
Terminal would be located within an area TPWD has characterized as crops (McMahan et al.,
1984). However, due to past disturbances, we have characterized the vegetation at the Terminal
site as industrial/disturbed (grasslands and scrub/shrub). The marine component of the Terminal
site also contains submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV).
4.5.1.1

Industrial/Disturbed Vegetation

Much of the Terminal site would be located on highly disturbed land that supports little
or no vegetation. A significant portion of the site has been previously graveled, paved,
compacted or used for storage of bauxite and bauxite tailings. Grasslands and scrub/shrub
uplands have been identified along the edges of the disturbed industrial areas. Coastal grasses
and forbs exist as a narrow band between the tidal flats and the scrub/shrub communities within
the Terminal site. Grass and forb species in these areas include: marshhay cordgrass (Spartina
patens), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon), camphor daisy
(Machaeranthera phyllocephalla), sea ox-eye (Borrichia frutescens), coastal dropseed
(Sporoblous virginicus), and sea oats (Uniola paniculata). Both woody and herbaceous
vegetation also exist within the minimal scrub/shrub communities at the Terminal site. Typical
species of the herbaceous undergrowth at the Terminal site include: western ragweed (Ambrosia
psilostachya), common sunflower (Helianthus annus), prickly pear (Optunis spp.), scarlet sage
Environmental Impact Statement

4-30

Corpus Christi LNG

(Salvia coccinca), silver-leaf night-shade (Solanum elegnifolium), Indian blanket-flower
(Gaillardia grandiflora), and various grasses. Species of the woody overstory include mesquite
(Prospis juliflora), saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima), sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), Carolina
holly (Ilex ambigua), Georgia holly (Ilex longipes), and various palm species.
4.5.1.2

Submerged Aquatic Vegetation

As identified in section 4.4.1, submerged seagrasses occur as discontinuous patchy
seagrass beds in shallow water at the Terminal site. Specifically, these seagrass beds are found
along the margin of Corpus Christi Bay and consist predominantly of shoal grass, manatee grass,
turtle grass, clover grass, and widgeon grass.
Construction and operation of the Terminal facilities would temporarily and permanently
impact industrial/disturbed vegetation and SAV. The construction and operation of Terminal
buildings and facilities would result in the permanent loss of vegetation. Additionally, the
construction of the marine facilities would result in the temporary and permanent loss of SAV
(see table 4.4-1). Additionally, SAV that occurs near the proposed marine facilities could be
impacted by turbidity and sedimentation resulting from dredging activities. We expect that
dredging turbidity and sedimentation impacts would be within several hundred feet of the
Terminal site.
To avoid and minimize impacts on vegetation at the Terminal, Cheniere would
implement measures described in our Plan and Procedures and its ARMP as described in section
4.4.1. Cheniere would also comply with all Proj
ect-specific recommendations and mitigation
requirements associated with their Section 10 permit when issued from the COE.
Based on the disturbed nature of the Terminal site, the amounts and types of vegetation
impacted, and Cheniere’s proposed impact minimization and mitigation measures, we have
determined that constructing and operating the Terminal facilities would not significantly impact
vegetation.
4.5.2

Pipeline Facilities

The Pipeline associated with the Terminal would also be located within the Gulf Prairies
and Marshes Ecoregion (Gould, 1975). It would be located within two distinct vegetation types
as characterized by TPWD; agricultural crops and Mesquite-Live Oak-Bluewood Parks
(McMahan et al., 1984). These vegetation types have been further characterized as agricultural,
herbaceous and scrub/shrub vegetation. Crops grown in the area that would be crossed by the
Pipeline include: cotton, sorghum, soybeans, and corn. Herbaceous vegetation includes: western
ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya), common sunflower (Helianthus annuus), Indian blanketflower (Gaillardia pulchella), prickly pear (Opuntia spp.), scarlet sage (Salvia splendens), silverleaf night-shade (Solanum elaeagnifolium), and a variety of grasses such as king ranch bluestem
(Bothriochloa ischaemum), Texas windmill grass (Chloris texensis), Bermuda grass (Cynodon
dactylon), Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense), and buffelgrass (Pennisetum ciliare). Scattered
scrub/shrub species such as huisache (Acacia smallii), retama (Parkinsonia aculeata), bluewood
condalia (Condalia hookeri), and honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa)also occur scattered
throughout the herbaceous vegetation.
Construction and operation of the pipeline would temporarily impact vegetation,
specifically, resulting in the temporary loss of vegetation. The right-of-way would be seeded in
Environmental Impact Statement

Corpus Christi LNG

accordance with local NRCS requirements and therefore, vegetation would be allowed to revert
to preconstruction conditions following construction.
To minimize impacts on vegetation, Cheniere would implement measures described in
our Plan which specifically addresses reseeding, revegetation, and monitoring of vegetation.
Vegetation would be considered successful if the right-of-way surface condition is similar to
adj
acent undisturbed land, and damage has been properly restored. Additionally, in order to
restore vegetative cover quickly in non-crop areas, Cheniere would reseed using the seed
mixtures identified in table 4.5-1

Construction of the Terminal on an upland site would not impact marine mammals.
However, operation of the Terminal, specifically the dredging and LNG carrier’s calling on the
Terminal, could impact marine mammals and reptiles. LNG carriers could strike marine
mammals and reptiles resulting in an increase in stress, inj
ury and/or mortality. The measures
that Cheniere would implement to minimize impacts on marine mammals are described in
section 4.7.1.
Based on the modest increase in LNG carrier traffic over current conditions resulting
from operation of the Terminal, the current commonality of such activities in the vicinity of the
Terminal, and vessel strike avoidance measures that would be communicated by Cheniere to
LNG carriers, we have determined that impacts on marine mammals would not be significant.
Aquatic Wildlife
The Terminal site contains open bay, seagrass, coastal marsh, sand flats, and black
mangrove habitats, as well as coastal grasses and forbs, and scrub/shrub habitats. Open Bay and
other aquatic habitat species are described in section 4.6.2.
Seagrass beds are inhabited by a variety of birds. Representative families include waders
(Ardeidae), sandpipers (Scolopacidae), plovers and allies (Charadriidae), gulls and terns
(Laridae), pelicans (Pelecanidae), cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), grebes (Podicipedidae),
loons (Gaviidae), rails and allies (Rallidae), eagles and ospreys (Accipitridae), and waterfowl
(Anatidae)(Tunnell et al., 1996).
Due to salinity stress, few species of reptiles and amphibians are likely to occur in the
coastal marshes at the Terminal site (Tunnell et al. 1996). However, some species, such as the
diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin littoralis)and Gulf salt marsh snake (Nerodia
fasciata clarki), are known to inhabit brackish marshes along the Gulf Coast (Carr, 1952;Garrett
and Barker, 1987). The American alligator (Alligator mississipiensis) utilizes low-salinity
coastal marshes as both feeding and nesting areas (Garrett and Barker, 1987). Many species of
wading and aquatic shorebirds feed on the emergent plants, benthic invertebrates, and small
fishes found in coastal marshes (Bellrose, 1976). Some of the common bird species likely to
inhabit coastal marshes near the Terminal include mottled ducks (Anas fulvigula), lesser snow
geese (Chen caerulescens), willets (Cataptrophorus semipalmatus), clapper rails (Rallus
longirostris), great blue herons (Ardea herodias), tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor), blackcrowned night herons (Nycticorax nycticorax), great egrets (Casmerodius albus), snowy egrets
(Egretta caerulea), lesser scaups (Aythya affinis), buffleheads (Bucephala albeola), white
pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos), and cormorants (Bent, 1929;Daiber, 1982;Stutzenbaker,
1988;Ruth, 1990;Tunnell et al., 1996). Herbivorous mammals, such as nutria (Coypus coypu)
and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)feed on marsh vegetation (White, 1973;Tunnell
et al., 1996). Few carnivorous rodents actually reside within coastal marshes. However, the rice
rat (Oryzomys palustris)is considered a predominantly carnivorous wetland species (Hamilton,
1976;Shard, 1967)that is common within the vicinity of the Terminal site. Other mammals that
occasionally forage in coastal marshes include the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), fulvous
harvest mouse (Reithrodonomys fulvescens), house mouse (Mus musculus), and raccoon
(Procyon lotor)(Linscombe and Kinler, 1985).
Sand flats provide excellent habitat for numerous invertebrate species, including benthic
invertebrates, brown shrimp (Penaeus aztecus), and grass shrimp (Paleaemonetes spp.).
Vertebrates include a variety of birds such as gulls, terns, herons, shorebirds, and wading birds.
Environmental Impact Statement

4-34

Corpus Christi LNG

Some common species known to occur in the vicinity of the Terminal site include the laughing
gull (Larus atnicilla), ring-billed gull (Larus delawarensis), royal tern (Sterna maxima),
sandwich tern (Sterna sandvicensis), great blue heron, snowy egret, sanderlings (Calidnis alba),
least sandpiper (Calidnis minutilla), roseate spoonbill (Ajaia ajaja), and white ibis (Eudocimus
albus)(Tunnell et al. 1996).
Species likely to occur within the areas characterized by coastal grasses, forbs, and
scrub/shrub at the Terminal site include the gray fox (Urocyon cineroargentatus), raccoon,
coyote (Canis latrans), white tailed deer, and eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus)(Tunnell
et al. 1996).
The Terminal would be located on a site that was used for industrial purposes for
50 years and has since been reclaimed. As described previously, the north shore of Corpus
Christi Bay is highly industrial and the properties adj
acent to the site are commercial and
industrial in nature. Construction and operation of the Terminal would result in the permanent
loss and conversion of disturbed coastal grasses and scrub/shrub habitats which would result in
the permanent relocation of wildlife and an increase in stress, inj
ury, and/or mortality. To avoid
and minimize impacts on wildlife, Cheniere has reduced the size of construction areas to the
maximum extent practicable and would implement measures described in our Plan and
Procedures.
Based on the disturbed nature of the Terminal site as well as the characteristics of the
wildlife known to occur or potentially occur in the Proj
ect area, and Cheniere’s implementation
of its proposed mitigation measures, we have determined that construction and operation of the
Terminal would not significantly impact wildlife.
4.6.1.2

Pipeline Facilities

The Pipeline route would cross four different general habitat types: industrial,
agricultural, open, and wetland. The Pipeline would not cross any areas that have been identified
as sensitive habitats. Most of the Pipeline-related construction activities would occur in
previously disturbed agricultural areas.
Industrial land consists of highly disturbed and modified areas at the south end of the
Pipeline near the Terminal and at road crossings. These areas do not support much vegetation,
and most wildlife would only occasionally be expected to use or traverse these areas.
Agricultural land consists of active cropland. Agricultural fields planted with a variety of
legumes and row crops provide food and cover for several species of commonly observed
wildlife. These areas provide an important food source in the form of seeds, foliage, and insects
for a variety of songbirds, waterfowl, and game birds. The northern mockingbird (Mimus
polyglottos)and mourning dove (Zenaida macroura)are common birds found in agricultural
habitats (Tveten, 1993;Kaufman, 2000). Small mammals such as the hispid cotton rat are
common in this agricultural habitat as well (Davis and Schmidly, 1994). Reptiles such as the
Great Plains rat snake (Elaphe guttata emoryi)can also be found in this cover type (Dixon,
2000).
Wildlife species found within open land habitats include reptiles such as the western
glass lizard (Ophisaurus atenuatus), six-lined racerunner (Cnemidophorus sexlineatus), keeled
earless lizard (Holbrookia propinqua), Texas spotted whiptail (Cnemidophonus gulanis), western
coachwhip (Masticophis flagellum tesaceus), ground snake (Sonora semiannulata), and western

diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox)(Dixon, 2000). Bird species associated with this
habitat type would include Nelson’s sharp-tailed sparrow (Ammodramus nelsoni), prairie warbler
(Dendroica discolor), buff-breasted sandpiper (Tryngites subruficollis), loggerhead shrike
(Lanius ludovicianus), and short-eared owl (Asio flammeus). Mammals likely to occur within
this habitat type include the black-tailed j
ackrabbit (Lepus californicus), Gulf Coast kangaroo rat
(Dipodomys compactus), marsh rice rat (Orozomys palustris), fulvous harvest mouse
(Reithrodontomys fulvescens), raccoon, striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), and coyote (Davis and
Schmidly, 1994).
As described previously, the Pipeline would cross PEM wetlands at three locations.
Typical wildlife species found within PEM wetlands include the Woodhouse’s toad (Bufo
woodhousii), eastern narrow-mouth toad (Gastrophryne carolinensis), bronze frog (Rana
clamitans), Missouri slider (Chrysemys floridana), speckled king snake (Lampropeltis getulus),
diamondback water snake (Nerodia rhombifer), red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus),
American widgeon (Anas americana), American bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), common snipe
(Capella gallinago), great egret (Casmerodius albus), marsh hawk (Circus cyaneus), North
American mink (Mustela vison), rice rat, and swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus)(Gosselink et
al., 1979).
Construction and operation of the Pipeline facilities would result in minimal and shortterm impacts on wildlife because no sensitive habitats would be impacted, and much of the area
affected by construction would be allowed to revert to preconstruction conditions following
construction. Some smaller, less mobile wildlife, such as small mammals, amphibians and
reptiles, would likely be taken during clearing and grading activities. Other wildlife, such as
birds and larger mammals, would leave the immediate construction area when construction
activities approach, and would move to similar habitats nearby. Areas adj
acent to the Pipeline
area provide similar and ample habitats for wildlife displaced temporarily during construction of
the Pipeline. Wildlife would return to the maj
ority of the Proj
ect area following construction and
restoration. To minimize construction related impacts from Pipeline installation on wildlife
habitats, Cheniere would implement measures contained in our Plan and Procedures, including
the use of temporary erosion controls, restoration of all disturbed areas, and restricting vegetation
clearing between March 1 and August 31, as further discussed in section 4.6.3.
Based on the types of available habitat within the Proj
ect area and with the
implementation of the described mitigation measures, the Proj
ect would not have a significant
impact on terrestrial wildlife, and impacts would be short-term and minor.

Open Water and Intertidal Habitats
Corpus Christi Bay was designated as an “estuary of national significance”by the EPA in
1992 and it contains over 200 fish species. The Terminal would be located across five
aquatic/intertidal habitats: open bay, seagrass, coastal marsh, sand flats, and black mangroves.
Open Bay
Open bay communities provide habitat for a variety of benthic (living on or in bottom
substrate) invertebrates, including, but not limited to, nematodes, harpacticoid copepods,
gastrotrichs, clams, snails, polychaete worms, amphipods, and crabs. Epibenthos which typically
prefer protected areas such as seagrass beds and salt marshes also occur in the open bay
communities. Penaeid shrimp, roughback shrimp (Trachypenaeus similis), mantis shrimp
(Squilla empusa), and blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus and C. similis)are the most abundant
epifauna in these areas (Murray and Jinnette, 1976;Armstrong, 1987). Other epifaunal
crustaceans that occur in open bay habitats include amphipods (Gammarus mucronatus), mud
crabs (Rhithropanopeus spp.), hermit crabs (Pagurus annulipes), and grass shrimp
(Palaemonetes pugio) (Tunnell et al., 1996;Armstrong, 1987). The nektonic community
(occupying the water column above the substrate) of open bays includes a variety of
invertebrates and fishes. Common nektonic invertebrates include: zooplankton, a variety of
cnidarians (j
ellyfish, coral, and hydra)and the bay squid (Lolliguncula brevis)(Britton and
Morton, 1989). Fish species common in open bay habitats include the Atlantic croaker
(Micropogonias undulatus), spot (Leiostomus xanthurus), bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli),
hardhead catfish (Arius felis), pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides), sand seatrout (Cynoscion
arenarius), star drum (Stellifer lanceolatus), spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), red drum
(Sciaenops ocellatus), black drum (Pogonias cromis), southern flounder (Paralichthys
lethostigma), gafftopsail catfish (Bagre marinus), and striped mullet (Mugil cephalus).
Seagrass
Seagrasses provide habitat for a variety of invertebrates, including various annelids,
polychaetes, crustaceans, gastropods and bivalves. Seagrass habitats also support a number of
fish species including seatrout and red drum. Additionally, seagrasses provide habitat for
tidewater silversides (Menidia peninsulae), rainwater killifish (Lucania parva), pinfish, bay
anchovy, striped mullet, menhaden (Brevoortia spp.), silver perch (Bairdiella chrysura), dusky
pipefish (Syngnathus floridae), speckled worm eel (Myrophis punctatus), and other associated
species. Seagrass beds also serve as important feeding grounds for larger invertebrates and
predatory fish that are attracted to these areas in pursuit of smaller prey species (Gulf of Mexico
Fishery Management Council, 1998). Such predatory species include: hardhead catfish, spotted
seatrout, red drum, southern flounder, spot, and various sharks and rays.
Coastal Marsh and Vegetated Flats
Coastal marshes provide habitat for a variety of filter-feeding mollusks, oligochaetes,
polychaetes, nematodes, fiddler crabs (Uca spp.), mud crabs, grass shrimp, penaeid shrimp, and
amphipods (Orchestia spp.). The abundance of emergent and epiphytic vegetation (plants that
grow on other vegetation)found in coastal marshes supports a variety of grazing invertebrates,
such as snails and various insects. Invertebrate predators, including crustacean larvae, adult
copepods (Marshall and Orr, 1960), odonates, coleopterans, dipterans, and blue crabs (Tunnell et
al. 1996)also are common inhabitants of coastal marshes. Similar to seagrass, coastal marshes

4-37

Corpus Christi LNG

provide nursery habitat for a variety of marine and estuarine fishes. Additionally, coastal
marshes support several small, resident fish, including killifishes, menhaden, bay anchovy,
striped mullet, and mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis), and a variety of larger predatory fishes,
such as tarpon (Megalops atlanticus).
Tidal Flat
Tidal flats provide habitat for a variety of benthic invertebrates. Representative
organisms include polychaetes, gastropods, and crustaceans such as blue crabs (Withers, 1994).
Small fish often move into these areas to feed;common fish species include sheepshead minnow
(Cyprinodon variegatus), Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis), rough silversides (Membras
martinica), larval inshore lizard fish (Synodus foetens), southern flounder, red drum, and spotted
sea trout (Harrington and Harrington, 1972;Pfeifer and Wiegert, 1981;Pulich et al., 1982).
BlackMangrove
Black mangroves provide habitat to wildlife along protected shorelines, intertidal salt
marshes, and marshy barrier islands. Black mangrove also effectively stabilizes interior tidal
mudflats, dredge-fill, and other artificial sites commonly associated with wetland restoration
(NRCS, 2005). Species found in black mangroves include goliath grouper (Epinephelus itajara),
lane snapper (Lutjanus sunagris), and yellowmouth grouper (Mycteroperca interstitialis)(Gulf
of Mexico Fishery Management Council, 2004).
Fisheries of Special Concern
Fisheries of special concern in Corpus Christi Bay include federal and state listed
threatened and endangered species, fish with designated EFH, and those of commercial and
recreational value. Corpus Christi Bay is designated in the National Estuary Program as an
estuary of “national significance”.
Essential Fish Habitat
In the MSA, Congress defines EFH as consisting of “waters and substrate necessary to
fish for spawning, breeding, feeding or growth to maturity” (16 USC 1802[10]). Specific
habitats include all estuarine water and substrate (mud, sand, shell, and rock), and all associated
biological communities, such as sub-tidal vegetation (seagrasses and algae), and the adj
acent
inter-tidal vegetation (marshes and mangroves). In addition to ecological significance, EFH
represents areas of high economic importance due to the dependence of recreational and
commercial fisheries that are directly and indirectly associated with them.
The fish species known to occur in Corpus Christi Bay, most of which are temperate in
biogeographic distribution with a few tropical species (Tunnell et al., 1996), can be classified as
warmwater marine or estuarine.
Construction and operation of the Terminal would impact EFH for j
uvenile white and
brown shrimp;larval, post-larval, j
uvenile, and adult red drum;adult gray snapper (Lutjanus
griseus);post-larval and j
uvenile Goliath grouper;post-larval and j
uvenile lane snapper;and
j
uvenile yellowmouth grouper. These habitats have also been designated as EFH for highly
migratory species including neonate, j
uvenile, and adult blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus), bull
(Carcharhinus leucas), bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo), and Atlantic sharpnose (Rhizoprionodon
terranovae)sharks;neonate and j
uvenile scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini)and lemon

(Negaprion brevirostris)sharks;and neonate fine tooth (Carcharhinus isodon)sharks (NOAA
Fisheries, 2009a;Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Management Council, 2004).
A full EFH assessment has been performed for the Terminal site which outlines life
history information, and relative abundance of all species with EFH identified in the Terminal
area of impact. Potential impacts and conservation measures, as determined through
correspondence with NOAA Fisheries, to avoid and/or minimize impacts are also included in the
assessment. The EFH assessment has been included as appendix B of this EIS.

Impacts and Mitigation
Constructing and operating the Terminal would impact fisheries resources including EFH
and recreation and commercial fisheries. Specifically;dredging, dredge disposal, and pile
driving activities would impact fish and other aquatic organisms. These activities would also
impact recreational and commercial fisheries in a similar manner. Additionally, LNG carriers
calling on the Terminal and other ship-related marine traffic and operations could also impact
fisheries resources. Impacts on EFH resulting from construction and operation of the Proj
ect are
described in more detail in appendix B, and further described below in the appropriate impact
headings.
Environmental Impact Statement

4-39

Corpus Christi LNG

Dredge and Dredge Disposal
Dredging activities necessary for the construction of the Terminal would permanently
impact open bay, seagrass, salt marsh, sand flat, and black mangrove habitats. Maintenance
dredging required for operation of these facilities could periodically impact fisheries. As
described in section 2.3.1, a total of 124 acres of open water habitat would be impacted by
operation of the Terminal, including approximately 95.4 acres of aquatic/intertidal habitat that
would be permanently converted into deep water habitat (23.8 acres of the site is currently
classified as deep water and 5 acres of open land will be converted to deep water). Of the 95.4
acres of shallow, open water habitat that would be dredged, approximately 9.17 acres are
currently submerged aquatic seagrass beds, 5.91 acres are cordgrass salt marsh, 1.0 acre is
coastal marsh and vegetated sand flats, 2.9acres are unvegetated sand flats, 6.72 acres are black
mangrove, and the remaining 67.9acres are unvegetated shallow open water.
Dredging activities during construction of the Terminal, including the disturbance and
resuspension of sediments, would temporarily increase turbidity which could impact water
quality, fish, and other aquatic organisms. Turbidity resulting from dredging activities could
further be impacted by wind influenced tides. Increased turbidity could clog fish gills and irritate
epithelia tissue. Increased turbidity could also impact seagrasses and other aquatic vegetation
which could also impact fish and other aquatic organisms. Impacting fish habitat could impact
fish behavior (avoidance), foraging, breeding, and migration. Increased stress, inj
ury, and
mortality could result from dredging activities. Additionally, dredging equipment could also
entrain fish and other aquatic organisms.
Maintenance dredging would periodically increase turbidity;however, this impact would
be temporary. Impacts on fisheries would be similar to those described above, but the intensity
of these impacts would be significantly less. Additionally, the Proj
ect area is already subj
ect to
maintenance dredging and, as a result, fish in the area have become accustomed to this type of
disturbance.
Despite other highly variable physiochemical parameters (e.g., salinity, temperature,
oxygen)marine, coastal pelagic, and estuarine finfish and shellfish species are abundant in the
Proj
ect area and are well adapted to highly turbid conditions. Overall, motile organisms would
be capable of avoiding highly turbid areas (Hirsch et al., 1978). Under most conditions, fish and
other motile organisms are only exposed to localized suspended-sediment plumes for short
durations (minutes to hours)(Clarke and Wilber, 2000). COE studies have also demonstrated
that benthic organisms actively repopulate dredged areas quickly after completion of dredging
activities. Studies also show that many benthic organisms have capabilities to vertically migrate
through substantial overburdens caused by sedimentation and turbidity (Wilber et al., 2005;
Maurer et al., 1978, 1986).
As described previously, Cheniere proposes to dispose of all dredged material in an
upland DMPA immediately north of the Terminal site. Run-off and return water from the
DPMA would flow into an existing drainage canal along the western boundary of the Terminal
and back into Corpus Christi Bay. This run-off and return water would increase turbidity at the
point of entry into Corpus Christi Bay. Increased turbidity could impact fish and other aquatic
organisms as described above.
To minimize impacts on fish including EFH and other aquatic organisms, Cheniere
would adhere to measures outlined in our Plan and Procedures and implement its ARMP.
Environmental Impact Statement

4-40

Corpus Christi LNG

Cheniere would further minimize impacts from stormwater runoff through implementation of its
SPCC Plan, construction of drainage ditches on site, and adherence to measures contained in the
NPDES requirements.
In addition to the above measures, Cheniere would obtain state water quality certification
under Section 401 of the CWA from the RRC, and a Section 404 permit from the COE. The
certification and permit would contain measures to avoid, minimize, and mitigate impacts on
fisheries and aquatic resources.
Pile Driving
Pile driving activities would generate sound pressure waves and underwater noise levels
that could impact fish and other aquatic organisms. These impacts include stress, inj
ury,
avoidance, and/or other behavior changes.
Although the impacts of pile driving are poorly studied and there is substantial variation
in species response to sound, intense sound pressure waves can change fish behavior or
inj
ure/kill fish through rupturing swim bladders or causing internal hemorrhaging. The intensity
of the sound pressure levels produced during pile driving depends on a variety of factors
including, but not limited to, the type and size of the pile, the firmness of the substrate into which
the pile is being driven, the depth of water, and the type and size of the pile-driving hammer.
The degree to which an individual fish exposed to sound waves would be affected is dependent
upon variables such as the peak sound pressure level and frequency as well as the species, size,
and condition of the fish (e.g., small fish are more prone to inj
ury by intense sound waves than
are larger fish of the same species).
Depending on the specific conditions at the site, pile driving activities could generate
underwater sound levels great enough to inj
ure some fish or cause them to be more susceptible to
predation. Underwater noise levels are commonly referred to as a ratio of the underwater sound
pressure to a common reference pressure of 1 micropascal (μPa)root mean-square pressure,
which is expressed in decibels (dB)of sound intensity as dB re: 1 μPa. There are insufficient
peer reviewed reliable data available for the onset of behavior disturbance in fish;however, as a
conservative measure, NOAA Fisheries generally uses 150 dB re: 1 μPa as the threshold for
behavior effects to fish species of particular concern, citing that noise levels in excess of 150 dB
re: 1 μPa can cause temporary behavior changes (startle and stress)that could decrease a fish’s
ability to avoid predators. The current interim thresholds protective of inj
ury to fish are 206 dB
re: 1 μPa (peak)and 187 dB re: 1 μPa (cumulative)sound exposure level for fish 2 grams or
greater and 183 dB re: 1 μPa (cumulative)sound exposure level for fish of less than 2 grams
(ICF Jones and Stokes and Illingworth and Rodkin, Inc., 2009).
Driving tubular steel piles has been known to generate sound levels from 192 to 194 dB,
above the level that is thought to inj
ure some fish. Depending on the specific conditions at the
Terminal, these sounds can have a transmission loss rate of 0.021 to 0.046 dB per foot (Nedwell
and Edwards, 2002;Nedwell et al., 2003). Based on these values, the use of an impact hammer
at the Terminal could generate underwater sound levels great enough to inj
ure some fish and
otherwise affect some fish as far as 1,860 feet from a steel pile (i.e., 155 dB). Although the
sound waves of the greatest intensity would be limited to the immediate vicinity of the piles
within the slip, sound levels of 155 dB could extend to the far shore of the La Quinta Channel
while piles for some of the mooring dolphins are being driven. In a review of studies
documenting fish kills associated with pile driving, NOAA Fisheries (2003)reported that all
Environmental Impact Statement

4-41

Corpus Christi LNG

have occurred during use of an impact hammer on hollow steel piles. The type of hammer that
would be used to drive piles during construction of the Proj
ect has not yet been identified.
Measures implemented to minimize impacts on aquatic organisms from pile driving
activities are further discussed in section 4.7.1.
Ship and Boat Traffic
Ship and boat traffic associated with constructing and operating the Terminal would also
impact fish and other aquatic organisms. Specifically, ship movements, noise and resulting wave
actions could impact fisheries resources. Ship movements could directly impact fisheries and
other aquatic organisms. These movements could result in strikes and cause avoidance which
could result in increased rates of stress, inj
ury and/or mortality experienced. Although ship noise
would not generally be of the intensity produced from driving steel piles, vessels operating in the
La Quinta Channel could cause sounds that elicit responses in fish. Some research suggests that
fish exhibit avoidance behavior in response to engine noise (International Council for
Exploration of the Sea, 1995). At the same time, research conclusions tend to suggest that since
the impacts are transient (i.e., once the ship passes, behavior returns to normal), that the longterm impacts on fish populations are negligible (Stocker, 2001). Increased wave action resulting
from ship and boat traffic could increase turbidity which could impact fish and other aquatic
organisms.
Ship Operations –Ballast Water
LNG carrier operations at the Terminal site would require the discharge of ballast water.
As described previously in section 2.1.4, the Terminal has been designed to load approximately
200 to 300 LNG carriers per year. LNG carriers arriving at the Terminal could include the
largest presently existing LNG carriers with the capacity to discharge approximately 9million to
30 million gallons of ballast water at a rate up to 1.7 million gallons per hour. A 138,000 m3
capacity LNG carrier would discharge approximately 50,000 m3 of ballast water at the berth
during each LNG cargo loading operation. Approximately 12,000,000 m3 of ballast water would
be discharged at the Terminal per year.
Ballast discharge could impact water quality, fish, and other aquatic organisms. The
general characteristics of the discharged ballast water would be very similar to that of the water
pumped aboard each LNG carrier during the mandatory ballast water exchange operation. The
location, weather, and existing tidal/current conditions where this ballast water exchange would
take place would determine the unique characteristics of the ballast seawater aboard each LNG
carrier upon its arrival at the Terminal. Discharge of ballast water could result in temporary and
localized changes in salinity and temperature which could have minor impacts on aquatic species
in the vicinity. Ballast discharge could also result in the introduction of non-indigenous aquatic
species which could also impact fish and other aquatic organisms.
To minimize and avoid impacts on fish and other aquatic organisms resulting from ballast
water discharges, the Coast Guard, which has j
urisdiction over inspection and regulatory
enforcement for all shipping in U.S. waters, would require all LNG carriers calling on the
Terminal to adhere to all applicable ballast water management rules and regulations. Coast
Guard regulations require that all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks which enter or
operate in U.S. waters maintain a ballast water management plan that is specific for that vessel
and assigns responsibility to the master or appropriate official to understand and execute the
Environmental Impact Statement

4-42

Corpus Christi LNG

ballast water management strategy for that vessel. Under these requirements, vessels must
implement strategies to prevent the spread of exotic aquatic nuisance species in U.S. waters.
Examples of these strategies include retaining ballast water on board, minimizing discharge or
uptake at certain times and locations, and exchanging ballast water with mid-ocean seawater.
Ships that have operated outside of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)must either retain
their ballast water on board or undergo a mid-ocean (greater than 200 nm from shore/water depth
greater than 2,000 meters)ballast water exchange in accordance with applicable regulations.
Applicable U.S. laws, regulations, and policy documents related to ballast water include the
following:
 Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (NANPCA)that
established a broad federal program “to prevent introduction of and to control the spread
of introduced aquatic nuisance species… ”FWS, Coast Guard, EPA, COE, and NOAA
Fisheries all were assigned responsibilities.
 National Invasive Species Act of 1996 that reauthorized and amended the NANPCA
because “Nonindigenous invasive species have become established throughout the waters
of the U.S. and are causing economic and ecological degradation to the affected near
shore regions.” The Secretary of Transportation was charged with developing national
guidelines to prevent import of invasive species from ballast water of commercial
vessels, primarily through mid-ocean ballast water exchange, unless the exchange
threatens the safety or stability of the vessel, its crew, or its passengers.
 National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2003 (NAISA), amended in 2005 and again in
2007, established a mandatory National Ballast Water Management Program. The
primary requirements established under NAISA are: 1)all ships operating in U.S. waters
are required to have on board an Aquatic Invasive Species Management Plan;2)the
Coast Guard was made responsible for the development of standards for mid-ocean
ballast water exchange and ballast water treatment for vessels operating outside of the
EEZ;and 3)implementing the BMPs and available technology related to ballast water
treatment.
 National Ballast Water Management Program, originally established by NANPCA and
further amended by NISA 1996 and NAISA 2003, made the ballast water management
program mandatory, including ballast water exchange, with reporting to the Coast Guard.
 Shipboard Technology Evaluation Program, a program authorized under the Coast Guard
Ballast Water Management Program and designed to facilitate the development of
“effective ballast water treatment technologies, through experimental systems, thus
creating more options for vessel owners seeking alternatives to ballast water exchange.”
 Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular 07-04, Change 1, a program developed by the
Coast Guard for the management and enforcement of ballast water discharge into U.S.
ports and harbors.
 Vessels Carrying Oil, Noxious Liquid Substances, Garbage, Municipal or Commercial
Waste, and Ballast Water, implementing regulations for the Act to Prevent of Pollution
from Ships of 1980, which applies to all U.S.-flagged ships anywhere in the world and to
all foreign-flagged vessels operating in navigable waters of the U.S. or while at port
under U.S. j
urisdiction.
Environmental Impact Statement

Corpus Christi LNG

In addition to discharging ballast water, LNG carriers would require the intake of water
in order to operate the ship and cool the ship’s engines. Operation of the Terminal would also
require a water intake. Ship cooling water would be withdrawn and discharged below the water
line on the sides of the ship through screened water ports, known as “sea chests”. Water intakes
could result in the impingement and entrainment of fish. These actions could impact the rates of
stress, inj
ury and/or mortality experienced by fish. To minimize these impacts, water intakes
would be outfitted with screened sea chests that withdraw and discharge water at a relatively
slow velocity.
To address the potential impacts on fisheries associated with offshore spills of fuel,
lubricants, or other hazardous materials, Cheniere would implement measures contained in its
SPCC Plan.
Conclusion
Based on the characteristics of the Terminal site and the adj
acent waters, the fish and
other aquatic organisms including their habitats that would be impacted by the Proj
ect;the
dredging, dredge disposal, pile driving and shipping activities that would impact these resources;
and Cheniere’s implementation of measures to avoid, minimize and mitigate these impacts;we
have determined that construction and operation of the Terminal would impact fisheries,
including EFH resources, but that these impacts have been sufficiently minimized.
4.6.2.2

Pipeline Facilities

As identified in section 4.3.2, the pipeline facilities would cross nine waterbodies. Of the
nine waterbodies, two (Oliver Creek and Chiltipin Creek) are characterized as perennial,
freshwater, and containing warmwater fisheries. The remaining seven crossings have been
characterized as intermittent drainages, ditches, or canals that do not support sustainable fish
species. No EFH, fisheries of special concern, state or federally listed threatened and
endangered fish species, or fish of significant commercial and recreational value have been
identified as being crossed by the pipeline facilities. Representative freshwater fish species that
could occur in Oliver and Chiltipin Creeks include: central stoneroller (Campostoma anomalum),
cypress minnow (Hybognathus hayi), spotted sucker (Minytrema melanops), yellow bullhead
catfish (Ameiurus natalis), starhead minnow (Fundulus excambiaei), and green sunfish (Lepomis
cyanellus)(Garret and Klym, 2012). Additionally, table 4.6-3 provides a list of representative
game and commercial fish species with the potential to occur within Oliver and Chiltipin Creeks
(Texas Natural History Collections, 2003;TPWD, 2003).

Construction of the Pipeline would result in the temporary loss of aquatic habitat, disturb
the stream bed, and increase turbidity and sedimentation. The loss of habitat and localized
changes to water quality could increase the amount of stress, inj
ury and mortality experienced by
fish in Oliver and Chiltipin Creeks. To minimize impacts on fish, Cheniere would cross Oliver
and Chiltipin Creeks using HDDs. Because the remaining seven waterbodies do not support
sustainable fisheries, constructing the Pipeline across these waterbodies would not impact fish.
Additionally, Cheniere would complete all waterbody crossings in accordance with the
construction and mitigation measures described in our Procedures.
The use of HDDs to cross Oliver and Chiltipin Creeks would significantly minimize
impacts on fish. Therefore, based on the characteristics of the fisheries contained within the nine
waterbodies that would be crossed, Cheniere’s use of HDDs, and its implementation of impact
minimization measures as described in our Procedures, we have determined that constructing and
operating the Pipeline facilities would not significantly impact fisheries.
4.6.3

MigratoryBirds

Migratory birds are protected under the MBTA, originally passed in 1918. The MBTA
states that it is unlawful to pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, possess, sell, purchase, barter, import,
export, or transport any migratory bird, or any part, nest, or egg of any such bird, unless
authorized under a permit issued by the Secretary of the Interior. “Take” is defined in the
regulations as to “pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or attempt any of the
above”(50 CFR 10).
Executive Order 13186 (January 2001)was issued, in part, to ensure that environmental
analyses of federal actions assess the impacts on migratory birds. It also states that emphasis
Environmental Impact Statement

4-45

Corpus Christi LNG

should be placed on species of concern, priority habitats, and key risk factors and it prohibits the
take of any migratory bird without authorization from the FWS. On March 30, 2011, the FWS
and the Commission entered into a Memorandum of Understanding that focuses on avoiding or
minimizing the adverse impacts on migratory birds and strengthening migratory bird
conservation through enhanced collaboration between the Commission and the FWS by
identifying areas of cooperation. This voluntary Memorandum of Understanding does not waive
legal requirements under any other statutes and does not authorize the take of migratory birds.
Migratory birds follow broad routes called “flyways” between breeding grounds in
Canada and the U.S. and wintering grounds in Central and South America. The Terminal site is
within the Central Flyway. The Central Flyway runs through the central portion of the U.S. and
includes the states of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas,
Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota, and the Canadian provinces of Alberta,
Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories. Most birds that move along the Central Flyway
travel from Canada through the central states, eventually reaching the tropics of South America
via the Gulf of Mexico (FWS, 2011).
The FWS published the Birds of Conservation Concern 2008 to assess and prioritize bird
species for conservation purposes. The document identifies migratory and non-migratory birds
that are of conservation concern in order to stimulate conservation actions among government
agencies and private partners. According to the document, the Proj
ect lies within Bird
Conservation Region 37, the Gulf Coastal Prairie Region. Table 4.6-4 (see appendix C)provides
a list of the species of birds of conservation concern within region 37.
4.6.3.1

Terminal Facilities

A number of migratory birds, including shore and sea birds, have the potential to fly over
the Terminal. The Terminal would be located in a highly industrialized area, although several
locations on the site as well as the DMPA north of the Terminal, would provide some marginal
habitat. The highly industrial nature of the Terminal site and surrounding area make it an
unlikely stopover area for migrants. The high amounts of activity on the properties adj
acent to
the Terminal likely deter migratory birds from utilizing the marginal habitat within the site.
There are proposed structures within the Terminal that could pose a risk to migratory bird
species that may fly through the area. These structures include the LNG tanks, the process flare
tower, and the marine flare. The LNG tanks are large structures and would likely be avoided by
avian species. The process flare tower would be a self-supported structure, approximately 500
feet tall, and would have aircraft warning lights installed. The marine flare would be a guy wiresupported structure, and would have visual markers affixed to the wires to prevent collisions by
bird species. Though there is potential for minor impacts on migratory bird species, constructing
and operating the Terminal is not expected to an impact on the population-levels of the birds.
Moreover, there are several areas in the vicinity of the Terminal, including the Aransas National
Wildlife Refuge, Mustang Island State Park, Lake Corpus Christi State Park, and Padre Island
National Seashore that provide suitable, high quality habitat for a variety of species.
As a measure to protect any migratory birds that could be found within the Terminal site,
Cheniere would avoid clearing woody vegetation during the peak nesting period between
March 1 and August 31 of any year. If vegetation clearing must be conducted during this time,
Cheniere would survey for migratory bird nests no more than three weeks prior to commencing

work. If an active migratory bird nest is found, Cheniere would consult with the FWS to identify
the most appropriate measure to be taken to avoid or minimize impacts.
In addition, Cheniere would implement BMPs as described in consultation received from
the FWS on September 12, 2012. Some practices outlined by the FWS include:





using lighting systems with minimum intensity;
using maximum off-phased white strobe lighting as per FAA regulations;
down-shielding lights on the Terminal site as appropriate, and
marking guy wires with visual markers and bird diverters.
Cheniere would continue to consult with the FWS prior to constructing the facilities
regarding implementation of further avoidance or minimization measures to protect migratory
bird species. Because of the measures described above to reduce impacts on migratory birds,
including timing of activities, impacts on migratory birds would not be significant.
4.6.3.2

Pipeline Facilities

The largest impact on migratory birds from the Pipeline would be from construction
activities, primarily right-of-way clearing. Impacts would be the greatest if right-of-way clearing
occurred during the breeding season;however, because most habitats that would be crossed by
the Pipeline are active agricultural lands, these impacts are expected to be minor. If adult birds
must move from the right-of-way to avoid temporary construction, this impact would be of
limited duration and would not result in a substantial or long-term impact on migratory birds.
This would not constitute a population-level impact given the stability of local populations and
the abundance of available habitat outside of the Pipeline right-of-way.
The linear nature of the Pipeline and the use of previously and continually disturbed areas
would minimize impacts on migratory bird species. Construction noise and activities could
result in the temporary displacement of migratory birds. Due to the relatively short duration of
construction activities and the current use of the area, the Pipeline would not have a significant
impact on migratory birds. As discussed above for the Terminal, as a measure to protect any
migratory birds that may be found along the Pipeline route, Cheniere would avoid clearing
woody vegetation during the peak nesting period between March 1 and August 31 of any year. If
vegetation clearing must be conducted during this time, Cheniere would survey for migratory
bird nests no more than three weeks prior to commencing work.
If an active migratory bird nest is found, Cheniere would consult with the FWS to
identify the most appropriate measures to be taken to avoid or minimize impacts on migratory
birds. Because of the measures described above to reduce impacts on migratory birds, including
timing of pipeline construction activities, impacts on migratory birds would not be significant.

eopardize the continued existence of a
federally listed threatened or endangered species, or result in the destruction or adverse
modification of designated critical habitat of a federally listed species. The FERC is required to

consult with the FWS and NOAA Fisheries to determine whether any federally listed endangered
or threatened species or designated critical habitat are within the vicinity of the proposed Proj
ect,
and to determine the proposed action’s potential effects on those species or critical habitats. If
the proj
ect would affect a listed species, the agency must report its findings to the FWS and
NOAA Fisheries in a BA. If FERC determines that the proposed action may adversely affect a
listed species, the agency must submit a request for formal consultation to comply with Section 7
of the ESA. In response, the FWS and/or NOAA Fisheries would issue a Biological Opinion as
to whether or not the federal action would likely j
eopardize the continued existence of a listed
species, or result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat.
In order to comply with Section 7 of the ESA, Cheniere, acting as the FERC’s nonfederal representative for purposes of complying with the ESA, consulted with the FWS and
NOAA Fisheries regarding the presence of federally listed and proposed threatened and
endangered species and their critical or proposed critical habitats within the Proj
ect area. On
October 29, 2012 NOAA Fisheries notified Cheniere that it has determined that proj
ect impacts
are similar to the original proj
ect and reinitiating of ESA Section 7 consultation is not required.
The FWS provided concurrence with Cheniere’s “not likely to adversely affect”determinations
in letters dated August 8, 2013 and November 5, 2013.
Since construction of the proposed facilities may occur over several years, we and
Cheniere would be responsible to ensure that any additional surveys resulting from the
observation or listing of species would be conducted as appropriate and if necessary reinitiate
consultation prior to allowing construction activities to commence.
The FWS and NOAA Fisheries identified 17 federally listed species that occur or
potentially occur within the Proj
ect area. As identified in table 4.7-1 (see appendix C), these
species include two plants (south Texas ambrosia [Ambrosia cheiranthifolia]and slender rushpea [Hoffsmanseggia tenelle]), eight mammals (blue whale [Balaenoptera musculus], fin whale
[Balaenoptera physalus], humpback whale [Megaptera novaeangliae], sei whale [Balaenoptera
borealis], sperm whale [Physeter macrocephalus], ocelot [Leopardus pardalis], gulf coast
j
aguarundi [Herpailurus yagouaroundi], and West Indian manatee), two birds (whooping crane
[Grus americana]and piping plover [Charadrius melodus]), and five reptiles (loggerhead sea
turtle, green sea turtle, leatherback sea turtle, Atlantic hawksbill sea turtle, and Kemp’s ridley sea
turtle).
Cheniere conducted field surveys for marine and terrestrial threatened and endangered
species in June 2011 and March 2012.
Four species have been eliminated from further discussion in this EIS because suitable
habitat was not identified in the vicinity of the Proj
ect based on current or protected ranges. Gulf
Coast j
aguarundi and ocelot are not known to occur in the Proj
ect area. Slender rush pea and
south Texas ambrosia are both terrestrial species listed in Nueces County only, and terrestrial
impacts associated with the Proj
ect would be outside of their known ranges. Therefore, we have
determined that the Proj
ect would have no effect on these species and they are not further
discussed.

Marine Mammals

Whales
Blue whales occur in all oceans of the world. They inhabit sub-polar to sub-tropical
oceans and rarely occur in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Texas. There are only two records
of blue whales from the Gulf;one stranded near Sabine Pass, Louisiana in 1926 and one stranded
near Freeport, Texas in 1940 (Texas Tech University, 1997). Both identifications have been
questioned. The approximate worldwide population of blue whales is 11,000-12,000, with the
current North Atlantic population between 100-1,500 individuals.
Fin whales are found in the deep, off-shore waters of all maj
or oceans but primarily at
temperate to polar latitudes (NOAA Fisheries, 2011). While rare in Texas one young individual
was stranded on the beach at Gilchrist in Chambers County on February 21, 1951 (Texas Tech
University, 1997). A highly migratory species, these whales move to high latitude feeding
grounds during the spring and summer and return to southerly temperate waters for mating and
calving during fall and winter.
Humpback whales occur in all oceans of the world and are distributed in the western
north Atlantic from north of Iceland, Disko Bay and west of Greenland, south to Venezuela, and
the tropical islands of the West Indies (Texas Tech University, 1997). The worldwide population
estimate is between 5,200-5,600 individuals with approximately 800-1,000 individuals in the
western North Atlantic. Humpback whales have been captured in the Florida Keys and northern
Cuba with sightings occurring off the west coast of Florida and Alabama. There is only one
documented observation along the Texas Coast, occurring near the Bolivar Jetty near Galveston
on February 19, 1992 (Texas Tech University, 1997).
The sei whale is a medium sized baleen whale occurring primarily in offshore waters
from the Gulf and Caribbean Sea northward to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Sei whales, like
many other whales, are a migratory species that tend to occur in groups of two to five
individuals. There are no known occurrences of sei whales in Texas (Schmidly, 2004).
Sperm whales typically inhabit waters 600 meters or greater in depth, and are uncommon
in waters less than 300 meters deep (NOAA Fisheries, 2011). Sperm whales are found in all
oceans of the world in deep waters between approximately 60 degrees north and 60 degrees
south latitudes. Sperm whales are the most numerous of whales in the Gulf and sightings in
Texas near the coast are relatively common (Texas Tech University, 1997). Sightings of sperm
whales in the Gulf are common at depths of 655 feet or greater, along submarine canyons on the
edge of the continental shelf.
Although the whale species listed do not occur in relatively shallow waters such as those
found near the Proj
ect, they could potentially be impacted by collisions with LNG carriers that
are transiting to and from the Terminal in the open Gulf of Mexico. The probability of these
species encountering LNG carriers in the open ocean would be inherently low given their ability
to avoid on coming vessels coupled with their overall rarity.
Mitigation to minimize vessel strikes would be accomplished by maintaining a watch for,
and taking prudent measures to avoid, impacting listed species as described in NOAA Fisheries’
most recent Vessel Strike Avoidance Measures and Reporting for Mariners (revised
February 2008).

Environmental Impact Statement

4-49

Corpus Christi LNG

Due to the tendency for these species to remain far off-shore in very deep water, we have
determined that construction and operation of the Proj
ect is not likely to adversely affect these
species. NOAA Fisheries affirmed its previous concurrence with this determination in a letter
dated October 29, 2012.
West Indian Manatee
Manatees are found in rivers, estuaries, and coastal areas of the tropical and subtropical
New World. They may be found from the southeastern United States coast along Central
America and the West Indies to the northern coastline of South America. They occur mainly in
larger rivers and brackish water bays. Manatees are extremely rare in Texas and have been
sighted in Corpus Christi Bay, Laguna Madre, Cow Bayou near Sabine Lake, Copano Bay,
Bolivar Peninsula, and the mouth of the Rio Grande (Texas Tech University, 1997). Initial
decline of manatee populations was a result of over hunting;however, today population declines
may be attributed to collisions with power boats, entrapment in floodgates, navigation locks,
fishing nets, and water pipes. Loss of warm water habitat along with ingestion of marine debris
is also a threat to the continued survival of the West Indian Manatee.
Cheniere would further minimize the impact on the manatee by implementing additional
conservation measures recommended by the FWS which would include providing training on the
manatee to all personnel associated with constructing and operating the Proj
ect. Manatee
training information would advise contractors and staff that manatees may be found in the La
Quinta Channel and include a poster to assist in identifying the mammal and instruct personnel
not to feed or water the animal. Manatee training materials would include instruction to call the
FWS Corpus Christi Ecological Services Field Office in the event a manatee is sighted in or near
the Proj
ect area.
While manatees have been observed in the Proj
ect vicinity, sightings are very rare and
typically involve only a single animal that vacates the region relatively quickly. With Cheniere’s
implementation of additional conservation measures, we have determined that construction and
operation of the Proj
ect is not likely to adversely affect this species. The FWS concurred with
the proposed conservation measures and the may affect, not likely to adversely affect
determination in a letter dated November 5, 2013.
4.7.1.2

Sea Turtles

Five species of sea turtles inhabit the Gulf, nesting on beaches and occupying inlets and
shallow bays. However, nesting sea turtles are unlikely to occur in the Proj
ect area thus, impacts
on nesting turtles are unlikely. With this in mind, we determine that the Proj
ect would not
adversely affect sea turtles. The most likely impact on sea turtles would be LNG carrier strikes
with swimming turtles, although it would also be a rare event. Potential impacts are discussed
further below.
Loggerhead Sea Turtle
In the Atlantic, the loggerhead’s range extends from Newfoundland to as far south as
Argentina. The primary Atlantic nesting sites are along the east coast of Florida but additional
sites occur in Georgia, the Carolinas, and along the Gulf Coast of Florida. In the eastern Pacific,
loggerheads are reported from Alaska to Chile (NOAA Fisheries, 2004;COE, 2003). The
greatest threats to this sea turtle species are coastal development, commercial fisheries, and

Environmental Impact Statement

4-50

Corpus Christi LNG

pollution. Loggerhead sea turtles inhabit continental shelves, bays, estuaries, and lagoons in
temperate, subtropical, and tropical waters.
Mating takes place from late March to early June, and eggs are laid throughout the
summer. After hatching, loggerhead hatchlings move to the sea and often float on sargassum
masses for three to five years. Subadults occupy near-shore and estuarine habitats, whereas
adults occupy a variety of habitats that range from turbid bays to clear water. The young feed on
prey such as gastropods, crustacean fragments, and sargassum, while adults mainly forage on the
bottom, though they may also feed on j
ellyfish from the surface. Loggerhead sea turtles nest on
open, sandy beaches above the high tide mark and seaward of well-developed dunes. They
prefer steeply sloped beaches with gradually sloped offshore approaches (NOAA Fisheries,
2004;COE, 2003).
In Texas, loggerheads are considered to be the most abundant sea turtle, favoring
shallow, inner continental shelf waters and have been recorded in Corpus Christi Bay. They may
be present in Texas marine waters year-round;however, they are most noticeable during the
spring when Portuguese-Man-of-War are abundant (COE, 2003). Most loggerhead sightings
have been in the northern Gulf of Mexico near j
ettied passes and in open water and suitable
nesting habitat for this species is not available at the Proj
ect site.
Green Sea Turtle
Green sea turtles inhabit shallow waters with an abundance of marine algae and
seagrasses. They prefer lagoons, bays, inlets, shoals, and estuaries. They use coral reefs and
rocky outcrops near feeding areas to rest, and they feed on marine plants, mollusks, sponges,
crustaceans, and j
ellyfish. They tend to nest on their natal beach (NOAA Fisheries, 2004;
COE, 2003). Commercial harvest of eggs as food, collection of body parts to be used for leather
and j
ewelry, and stuffing of whole small turtles are the greatest threats to this species.
Population recovery is hindered further by the incidental take of green sea turtles during shrimp
harvests, and outbreaks of epidemic tumor infections have introduced a severe threat to the
population.
Green sea turtles are a circumtropical species occurring both in tropical and subtropical
waters. In the western Atlantic, they range from Massachusetts to the Virgin Islands and Puerto
Rico. Known nesting sites for the green sea turtle in the continental U.S. include North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. In Texas, small numbers of green sea turtles can been
found in Matagorda Bay, Aransas Bay, and the lower Laguna Madre. Preferred nesting and
foraging areas for this species are not found near the Proj
ect site.
Adult green sea turtles forage in bays that have extensive seagrass beds and could be
impacted by dredging activities when constructing the Terminal. With the exclusive use of
mechanical methods and hydraulic dredges (which are not known to take sea turtles), the
likelihood of a take would be significantly reduced (NOAA Fisheries, 2003).
Leatherback Sea Turtle
Leatherback sea turtles spend most of their time in the open ocean and come to land only
to nest. They may be found in coastal waters when nesting or following j
ellyfish concentrations.
They feed mainly on j
ellyfish and sea squirts as well as sea urchins, crustaceans, fish, and
floating seaweed. They prefer sandy beaches with a deepwater approach for nesting (NOAA
Fisheries, 2004;COE, 2003). Overexploitation by humans and incidental mortality due to
Environmental Impact Statement

4-51

Corpus Christi LNG

shrimping and fishing activities have contributed to a decline in the population, as has
degradation and disruption of nesting habitat and egg collection.
Leatherbacks are one of the widest-ranging sea turtles and are found in both the Pacific
and Atlantic oceans. To optimize foraging and nesting opportunities, they migrate between
boreal, temperate, and tropical waters. In the western Atlantic their range extends from Nova
Scotia to South America, and into the Gulf. While important nesting sites in the western Atlantic
include French Guiana and Columbia, they are also known to nest along the U.S. Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, and Florida. Although leatherback sea turtle sightings have been recorded in
Corpus Christi Bay, this species is rare along the Texas coast and no nest sites have been
recorded in over 60 years (NOAA Fisheries, 2004;COE, 2003). Suitable nesting habitat for this
species does not exist at the Proj
ect site. Of the five sea turtle species that occur in Texas waters,
the leatherback is the species least likely to occur in the Proj
ect area.
Atlantic Hawksbill Sea Turtle
This species inhabits coastal reefs, bays, rocky areas, estuaries, and lagoons at depths up
to 70 feet. Hatchlings may be found in the open sea floating on masses of marine plants while
j
uveniles, subadults, and adults may be found near coral reefs, their primary foraging area. They
prefer to feed on invertebrates such as sponges, mollusks, and sea urchins, although they are
omnivorous. Atlantic hawksbills come ashore to nest and prefer undisturbed, deep sand beaches.
Preferred beaches may range from high-energy to small pocket beaches bounded by crevices of
cliff walls with woody vegetation near the waterline (NOAA Fisheries, 2004;COE, 2003). The
greatest threat to this population has been the harvest of turtles to supply the tortoise shell market
and stuffed turtle curios. It is also used to manufacture leather, oil, perfume, and cosmetics.
Atlantic hawksbill sea turtles are circumtropical and occur in the tropical and subtropical
areas of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Nesting sites are known along the Yucatan
Peninsula of Mexico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Florida Keys. Post-hatchlings
and j
uveniles are seen with some regularity in Texas and Florida, in areas primarily associated
with stone j
etties (NOAA Fisheries, 2004). Although Atlantic hawksbill sightings have been
recorded in Corpus Christi Bay, they are unlikely to occur in the Proj
ect area because this species
prefers rocky outcroppings, coral reefs, and hard bottom areas.
The risk to hawksbill sea turtles in the Proj
ect area, while possible, would be considered
unlikely due to the lack of preferred habitat (rocky shores, reefs and passes)and preferred food.
With the exclusive use of mechanical methods and hydraulic dredges (which are not known to
take sea turtles), the likelihood of a take would be significantly reduced (NOAA Fisheries,
2003).
Kemp’s Ridley Sea Turtle
Kemp's ridley sea turtles inhabit shallow coastal and estuarine waters over sand or mud
bottoms. Juveniles feed on sargassum while adults are largely shallow water benthic feeders.
Food items include shrimp, snails, bivalves, j
ellyfish, and marine plants (NOAA Fisheries, 2004;
COE, 2003). Collection of eggs, capture for meat and other products, direct take for indigenous
use, ingestion of man-made materials, collision with boats, and disturbance or destruction of
nesting areas are all factors that have contributed to the decline of this species. Despite these
factors, the population appears to be in the early stages of recovery.

Environmental Impact Statement

4-52

Corpus Christi LNG

Kemp's ridley sea turtles inhabit primarily coastal waters in the northwestern Atlantic and
the Gulf. The maj
ority of this species nests at beaches near Rancho Nuevo, Tamanlipas, Mexico,
about 315 miles south of the Proj
ect area, with a secondary nesting area at Tuxpan, Vera Cruz.
This species could be a transient to the Proj
ect area between crustacean-rich feeding areas in the
northern Gulf and breeding grounds in Mexico (NOAA Fisheries, 2004;COE, 2003). Preferred
nesting and foraging areas for this species are not found at the Proj
ect site.
The risk to a Kemp’s ridley sea turtle in the Proj
ect area would be very limited. While
Kemp’s ridley sea turtles are present in the bays and could potentially be in the Terminal area,
the exclusive use of mechanical methods and hydraulic dredges (which are not known to take sea
turtles), would reduce the likelihood of a take significantly (NOAA Fisheries, 2003).
Sea Turtle Impacts
Due to the specific nesting habitat requirements, sea turtles would not be likely to be
present onshore within the Proj
ect area. In general, sea turtles would be a rare visitor to the
Proj
ect area. Many of the sea turtles discussed have feeding, swimming, or resting behaviors
that keep them near the surface, where they may be vulnerable to vessel strikes. To help reduce
the risk of strikes or other potential disturbances associated with the presence of LNG carriers,
Cheniere would adhere to the measures outlined in the NOAA Fisheries Vessel Strike Avoidance
Measures and Reporting for Mariners (revised February 2008).
NOAA Fisheries identified pile driving as having the potential to affect sea turtles.
Studies have shown that the sound waves from pile driving may result in inj
ury or trauma to fish,
sea turtles, or other animals with gas-filled cavities such as swim bladders, lungs, sinuses, and
hearing structures (Abbott et al., 2002). Although sea turtles would be expected to largely avoid
the Proj
ect area during pile driving activities, a potential exists for sea turtles to be inj
ured during
the first several strikes of the pile driving hammer. Cheniere would reduce impacts on listed
species from pile driving by implementing the following pile driving protocols:
 An observer would be dedicated to sea turtle and marine mammal observations,
responsible for monitoring species presence prior to pile driving activities;
 A 250-meter radius zone would be established and monitored for 60 minutes prior to
engaging the pile driver hammer during construction. If a sea turtle or marine mammal is
observed within the zone, pile driving would be delayed until the animal is observed to
have left or is heading away from the established zone. If an animal dives and cannot be
re-sighted, pile driving may not begin until 20 minutes after the last sighting, or until the
60-minute observation is complete, whichever is longer;
 If pile driving activity ceases for any reason, observations for sea turtles and marine
mammals would resume until pile driving begins, or the 60-minute survey would be
repeated;
 All animals must be allowed to exit the established zone of their own free will;
 Pile driving would not be started during nighttime hours;but if started prior to sunset, it
may continue until the hammer activity ceases;and

Environmental Impact Statement

4-53

Corpus Christi LNG

 Cheniere would keep records of all observations and pile driving protocols, and make
these records available upon request.
If the rare occurrence of the species were to overlap with the rare incidence of a spill, a
turtle could be at risk due to effects on respiration, skin, blood chemistry, and salt gland function.
To address the potential impacts associated with offshore spills of fuel, lubricants, or other
hazardous materials, Cheniere would implement its SPCC Plan.
Dredging activities could temporarily disrupt potential foraging grounds for turtles.
Cheniere proposes to dredge the marine basin and berth area using a hydraulic cutterhead dredge.
Hydraulic cutterhead dredging is not known to take sea turtles by direct mortality, as with hopper
dredging. Dredging activities during construction would be temporary and local in nature
because dredging would be confined to the proposed turning basin and marine berth and
maintenance dredging would only occur about once every three years. Dredging actions that
could potentially result in inj
ury to any sea turtles directly in the Proj
ect area would be
incidental. Activities at dredge spoil placement areas would similarly not affect sea turtles since
suitable nesting areas are not present in the placement areas.
With adherence to the mitigation measures identified above, we have determined that the
Proj
ect is not likely to adversely affect sea turtles. The FWS concurred with this determination
in a letter dated November 5, 2013 and NOAA Fisheries affirmed its previous concurrence with
this determination in a letter dated October 29, 2012.
4.7.1.3

Birds

Whooping Crane
The whooping crane winters in coastal Texas. Designated critical habitat for this species
is located within the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Aransas, Calhoun, and Refugio
Counties, approximately 25 miles north of the Proj
ect area. Some whooping cranes also winter
on Matagorda Island, which at its closest point is approximately 13 miles from the Proj
ect area.
Winter habitat consists of brackish bays, marshes, and salt flats that provide a variety of plant
and animal foods such as blue crabs, clams, and berries. Whooping cranes may also occasionally
use grassland swales and ponds that provide foods such as snails, crayfish, and insects. The
central and eastern Panhandle also provides a maj
or stopover area for birds migrating between
summer and winter habitats.
The whooping crane has been recorded in San Patricio County, and could potentially
access waters on the bay side and interior of Mustang and Padre Islands, which would be outside
the Proj
ect area. While the whooping crane has been recently sighted in San Patricio County,
such occurrences are rare. Given its rarity and suitable habitat in waters on the leeward side of
the nearby barrier islands, we have determined that the Proj
ect is not likely to adversely affect
the whooping crane. The FWS concurred with this determination in a letter dated November 5,
2013.
Piping Plover
Piping plovers inhabit shorelines along oceans, rivers, and inland lakes and nest on sandy
beaches, sandbars, dunes, and silty flats. During the winter, they utilize beaches, mud and sand
flats, and offshore spoil islands. The piping plover breeds on the northern Great Plains, in the
Great Lakes, and along the mid- to north-Atlantic coast, and winters on the Atlantic and Gulf
Environmental Impact Statement

Corpus Christi LNG

coasts from North Carolina to Mexico. They arrive at their Texas wintering grounds during midto late-July and spend a maj
ority of their time on sand and mud flats near sandy beaches. They
feed on tidal flats during low tide and Gulf beaches during high tide (COE, 2003). Decline in the
piping plover population has resulted from over-hunting during the early part of the twentieth
century, habitat loss or modification due to human development, alteration of river and wetland
systems, and predation.
San Patricio County is one of 12 counties in Texas where concentrations of piping plover
occur. Four sites in Corpus Christi Bay have been found to harbor wintering piping plover
populations: Port Aransas (15 miles east of the Proj
ect area), Fish Pass (13 miles southeast of the
Proj
ect area), Oso Bay (13 miles southwest of the Proj
ect area), and sites along the Gulf
Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW)(COE, 2003). Several areas along the Texas coast have been
identified by the FWS as essential wintering habitat for the piping plover. Essential wintering
habitat for the piping plover provides the space and requisite resources necessary for the
continued existence and growth of piping plover populations and consist of coastal beach, sand
flat, and mud flat habitats. Critical Habitat for the wintering grounds (as opposed to breeding
population Critical Habitat)has also been designated in Texas by the FWS (66 FR 36074—
36078). The closest critical habitat to the Proj
ect area is Unit TX13 Sunset Lake, located
approximately 4 miles southwest of the Proj
ect site.
This unit is triangle shaped, with SH 181 as the northwest boundary, and the limits of the
City of Portland as the northeast boundary. The shore on Corpus Christi Bay is the third side of
the triangle, with the actual boundary being mean lower low water off this shore. This unit is a
large basin with a series of tidal ponds, sand spits and wind tidal flats. This unit is owned and
managed by the City of Portland within a system of city parks. Some of the described area falls
within the j
urisdiction of the TGLO.
The piping plover habitat at the Proj
ect site would be relatively small when compared to
the abundance of suitable habitat adj
acent to the Terminal. Currently, piping plovers are not
known to inhabit the proposed Proj
ect area and construction activities would likely result in
piping plovers seeking refuge in nearby suitable habitats. To minimize impacts to piping
plovers, the FWS recommended that Cheniere have a qualified biologist survey the tidal flats
(piping plover habitat) at the Terminal before and after construction, submit photo
documentation to the FWS that the temporarily affected tidal flats were properly restored, and
have a biologist on site during construction in tidal flats to assist employees in avoiding impacts
to piping plovers during construction. Cheniere would comply with these measures and would
train workers through the use of a species “fact sheet” that would describe life history
information, habitat characteristics, and include a photograph to help with identification.
Due to Cheniere’s implementation of the above conservation measures, we have
determined that the Proj
ect is not likely to adversely affect the piping plover. The FWS
concurred with the proposed conservation measures and our determination in a letter dated
November 5, 2013.

State Listed Threatened and Endangered Species

The TPWD annotated county lists of rare species for San Patricio and Nueces Counties
include 24 state listed endangered or threatened species, in addition to those species that are also
federally listed and discussed above. Table 4.7-2 (see appendix C)identifies the state listed
species for San Patricio and Nueces Counties.
Environmental Impact Statement

4-55

Corpus Christi LNG

We have determined that 14 of these species would not be impacted by the Proj
ect
because the Proj
ect is not within the known range of the species, the species has been extirpated
in the Proj
ect area, there is no suitable habitat in the Proj
ect area, or the species would only occur
in the Proj
ect area as an occasional transient. These species are not discussed further in the EIS.
The remaining 10 state listed species could potentially occur in the vicinity of the Proj
ect. These
species are discussed in the following sections.
4.7.2.1

Mammals

Southern Yellow Bat
The southern yellow bat (Lasiurus ega)is a neotropical bat that has been recorded in
southern California, southern Arizona, and southern Texas in Cameron, Kleberg, and Nueces
Counties. Its range may be increasing in Texas due to the rising number of ornamental palm tree
plantings. This species utilizes palm trees as roosting sites and feeds on insects captured in
flight. In south Texas, the southern yellow bat breeds during late winter (Davis and Schmidly,
1997).
There is potential for southern yellow bats to roost in palm trees in the Proj
ect area and
forage for insects over the grasslands and coastal wetlands at night. However, due to the lack of
contiguous habitat and the mobility of this species, construction and operation of the Proj
ect
would not significantly impact this species.
4.7.2.2

Birds

Reddish Egret
The reddish egret (Egretta rufescens)is a common, permanent resident along the Texas
central lower coast and is uncommon along the upper coast. It breeds along Gulf State coasts
and it inhabits shallow tidal pools, saltwater bays, and marshes. Red egrets wade in shallow
waters and forages for small fishes and crustaceans and commonly nests in colonies with other
herons, egrets, and cormorants. Reddish egrets nest in brushy thickets of yucca and prickly pear
on dry coastal islands in Texas and among mangroves in Florida (TGLO, 2004).
The Proj
ect area would be located within the reddish egret's breeding range and, potential
nesting habitat does exist in the Proj
ect area. Additionally, the wetlands located in the Proj
ect
area could be used for foraging;however, other abundant foraging grounds near the Proj
ect area
could also be used by the species while constructing the Proj
ect. Reddish egrets were not
observed in the Proj
ect area during surveys in 2011 and 2012 and their mobility would allow
them to temporarily relocate to similar adj
acent habitats during construction. Therefore, the
Proj
ect would not significantly impact this species.
White-tailed Hawk
In Texas, population declines of white-tailed hawk (Buteo albicaudatus)are primarily
due to grassland habitat conversion to agriculture and an increase in brushy cover within
remaining open grasslands. Over the past four decades, brush removal efforts have produced
more favorable habitats for this species. In the southern and central counties of Texas, and north
towards Galveston, white-tailed hawk inhabit coastal grasslands. They prefer saltgrass flats near
the Gulf and dry grassy mesquite-live oak savannas inland (USGS, 2004). They perch on
bushes, dead trees, fence posts, and utility structures and prey on small mammals, lizards, and

insects. Their breeding season is from March to May, and their nest consists of grass-lined sticks
in low bushes, small trees, or cacti (National Wildlife Federation, 2004).
The white-tailed hawk is uncommon in the Proj
ect area and was not observed during field
surveys in 2011 and 2012. There is potential for this species to occur in the Proj
ect vicinity;
however, construction and operation of the Proj
ect would not significantly impact this species.
Wood Stork
Wood storks (Mycteria americana)are the largest wading birds that breed in North
America. This species prefers freshwater and brackish wetlands, and nests in cypress or
mangrove swamps. In Texas, the wood stork forages in prairie ponds, flooded pastures or fields,
ditches and other shallow standing water including saltwater. The birds move into the Gulf States
in search of mudflats and other wetlands. They formerly nested in Texas but there have been no
breeding records since 1960 (TPWD, 2005). The decline of wood storks is attributed to loss of
cypress swamps and also associated with a reduction in the food base (primarily small fish)
necessary to support breeding colonies (FWS, 2010).
While wood storks could occur in the Proj
ect vicinity, they were not observed during
field surveys conducted in 2011 and 2012. Therefore, the Proj
ect would not significantly impact
this species.
4.7.2.3

Reptiles and Amphibians

Texas Tortoise
The Texas tortoise (Gopherus berlandieri)is a primarily vegetarian reptile that relies
heavily on the fruit of the common prickly pear and other succulent plants. Its range extends
from south-central Texas southward into the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and
Tamaulipas. Collection of tortoises for pets led to its listing in 1977 as a protected non-game
species (TPWD, 2012). This species breeds from April to September and lays its eggs deep in a
hollow on the ground.
While there is marginal habitat for this species within the Proj
ect footprint, the
probability of occurrence is very low due to past land disturbance including industrial and
agricultural practices. Therefore, the Proj
ect would not significantly impact the Texas tortoise.
Texas Horned Lizard
The Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum)or “horny toad”is found in arid and
semiarid habitats in open areas with sparse vegetative cover. The horned lizard is common
among loose sands or loamy soils. They range from the south-central U.S. to northern Mexico,
and throughout most of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and New Mexico (TPWD, 2012c). They feed
primarily on harvest (red)ants. The decline of the Texas horned lizard is due to multiple factors
including collection for the pet trade, spread of invasive, red fire ants, changes in land use, and
environmental contaminants.
The Texas horned lizard could occur in the Proj
ect area;however, due to the small
amount of suitable habitat found in the Proj
ect vicinity and the large expanses of high quality
habitat in adj
acent areas, that the Proj
ect would not significantly impact this species.
Texas Indigo Snake

Environmental Impact Statement

4-57

Corpus Christi LNG

The Texas indigo snake (Drymarchon melanurus erebennus)is a large non-venomous
snake found from southern Texas to Mexico. This species prefers sparsely vegetated areas close
to permanent water sources, but is also found in mesquite savanna, open grassland area, and
coastal sand dunes. They den in burrows abandoned by other animals and will eat a wide range
of animals including mammals, birds, lizards, frogs, turtles, eggs, and other snakes
(NatureServe, 2012). The decline of the Texas indigo snake is due primarily to habitat loss
resulting from land development.
The Proj
ect area would be within the far northern range of the Texas indigo snake;
however, indigo snake sightings in San Patricio County are rare. The probability of an
occurrence onsite is very low and additionally, the snake is mobile, allowing it to temporarily
displace to similar, adj
acent habitat during Proj
ect construction. Therefore, the Proj
ect would
not significantly impact this species.
Black Spotted Newt
Black-spotted newts (Notophthalmus meridionalis)are found along the coastal plains of
south Texas and Mexico. They reside in the quiet waters of streams with abundant SAV, ponds,
and ditches. Breeding habits are dependent on the amount of water available. If a water source
dries up, young and adult black-spotted newts will seek shelter on land under rocks or rocky
ledges (National Wildlife Federation, 2004).
In general, amphibians are sensitive to climatic factors (such as drought), habitat changes,
and environmental pollutants including pesticides, petroleum hydrocarbons, and heavy metals.
These factors combined with the predatory influences of non-native fish species and bullfrogs
have contributed to population declines (TPWD, 2004).
The black spotted newt could occur in the Proj
ect area;however, due to the small amount
of suitable habitat found in the Proj
ect vicinity and with the implementation of best management
practices, as recommended by TPWD in a letter dated August 22, 2012, the Proj
ect would not
significantly impact this species.
South Texas Sirens
South Texas sirens (Siren spp.)inhabit areas that are similar to the black-spotted newt,
but require a year-round source of open water for aestivation (a state of dormancy)to assist in
water regulation during the hottest parts of the day.
South Texas sirens could occur in the Proj
ect area;however, due to the small amount of
suitable habitat found in the Proj
ect vicinity and with the implementation of best management
practices, as recommended by TPWD in a letter dated August 22, 2012, the Proj
ect would not
significantly impact this species.
4.7.2.4

Fish and Mollusks

Opossum Pipefish
The opossum pipefish (Microphis brachyurus)is an anadromous species, spending the
maj
ority of its time in the open ocean and returning to freshwater to spawn. The opossum
pipefish can be found in low gradient creeks and medium to large rivers with dense, emergent
vegetation (NatureServe, 2012). Causes of population decline include disease, poor water
quality, unnatural flow, and water control structures (NOAA Fisheries, 2009b). The only
Environmental Impact Statement

drainage that could provide suitable spawning and/or feeding habitat (low gradient with
emergent vegetation within 30 miles of the coast)is Chiltipin Creek. However, Chiltipin Creek
supports a population of longnose gar and the gars ability to thrive in turbid, warm water would
be an indicator that the water quality/dissolved oxygen levels of the drainage are too poor or low
to support the opossum pipefish. Additionally, downstream channel constrictions would prohibit
an upstream migration. Due to this, and the fact that the Pipeline would cross Chiltipin Creek
via the HDD method (avoiding direct impacts on the creek), construction and operation of the
Pipeline would not significantly impact the opossum pipefish.

LAND USE,RECREATION,AND VISUAL RESOURCES

4.8.1

Terminal Facilities

4.8.1.1

Land Use

Facilities associated with the Terminal would be constructed on property located on the
northern shore of Corpus Christi Bay, at the north end of the La Quinta Channel, north and east
of the city of Corpus Christi in San Patricio (land-based facilities)and Nueces (marine facilities)
Counties, Texas. The Terminal would be located west of the Sherwin Alumina plant on land
previously used for industrial purposes.
The Terminal would be located on property owned by Cheniere that was previously an
industrial site, but has since been reclaimed. Existing land uses at the site are open water and
open land. Approximately 991 acres would be affected by constructing the Terminal facilities,
including the marine basin and berths. Approximately 469 acres would be affected by the
operation of the Terminal, Marine basin and berth, plus exclusion zones. From the total impact
acreage, Terminal operations would impact approximately 225 acres and maintenance dredging
would impact approximately 124 acres. Details regarding acreage impacts on land use are
provided in table 4.8-1.

Wetland impacts associated with the Terminal are included in open water.
Construction area includes entire construction footprint, including all temporary and permanent construction areas
Operational area includes the permanent Terminal site, marine basing and berth, permanent easements and exclusion zone.
Acreage excludes Bauxite Disposal Bed 22 (52 acres)which is within the Proj
ect property boundary but would not be disturbed
by construction or operation.
e/ Bed 24 acreage is included in the Terminal site (area would be filled with structural fill and become part of the operating area).
f/ Area used during construction only and located outside of the Terminal site.

The LNG storage tanks associated with the Terminal would be located in an area that was
used for storage of bauxite ore as part of the U.S. government stockpile until 2003. Two bauxite
residue beds used for the disposal of alumina processing wastes, are located on the north side of
La Quinta Road for which Cheniere would have easements and lease agreements. Bauxite
residues from Bed 24 were removed and placed into Bed 22. Bed 22 has been capped with clay
as part of an agreement with TCEQ. There would be no direct land use impacts on Bed 22 to
construct and operate the Terminal. Bed 24 would be filled with clean structural fill, purchased
off-site, to planned grade and would be used as part of the Terminal facilities. The
operations/maintenance building, warehouse, LNG transfer lines, and access roads to the docks
would be located in a vegetated open area. Construction and operation impacts on this land
would be confined to a corridor surrounding the buildings, LNG transfer piperack, and access
road. The remainder of this area would remain open land. Open lands include scrub lands or
unimproved lands not in use for agriculture, industry, or residences.
While constructing the Terminal, Cheniere would utilize the adj
acent property to the west
of the Terminal site for laydown and staging of construction materials. Additionally, a
temporary employee parking area would be used to ease construction traffic congestion on La
Quinta Road.
Environmental Impact Statement

4-60

Corpus Christi LNG

Cheniere selected two DMPAs to dispose of materials dredged during construction of the
marine basin, as well as materials from maintenance dredging of the La Quinta Channel.
Cheniere has indicated that they selected a site known as DMPA 2 to beneficially utilize dredged
material to cap old bauxite beds which currently produce red dust under windy conditions.
Cheniere would also use dredge material to fill an existing excavation area on the Alcoa
property.
Construction of the Terminal would require 991 acres of land with 469acres permanently
impacted during operation. However, the maj
ority of the Terminal facilities would be located on
open land previously used for industrial purposes. The open water in the La Quinta Channel that
would be utilized for the LNG marine basin would remain open water, though it would be
dredged to a greater depth. The construction of the marine basin and berthing facilities would
result in the conversion of approximately 5 acres of open land to open water. The mitigation of
impacts on coastal marshes and wetlands as a result of the construction of the marine basin and
berthing facilities is discussed in section 4.4 of this EIS. Construction of the Terminal would
result in a conversion of the existing land use (open land)to industrial use. However, due to the
industrial use of adj
acent land and the previously disturbed nature of the area, impacts on land
use from the Terminal would be minor.
4.8.1.2

Existing and Planned Residences and Commercial Developments

The Terminal would be located in an industrialized area surrounded by industrial and
commercial development. There are currently no existing or planned residential developments
within 0.25 mile of the Terminal.
The LNG storage tanks would be surrounded by industrial properties, and there would be
no land within 0.25 mile of the Terminal site that would be available for residential development.
The site would be bounded by industrial land owned by the POCCA to the west, an operating
alumina facility owned by Sherwin Alumina to the east, and property owned by Alcoa to the
north. All property would be zoned as industrial.
The nearest residential areas to the Terminal site are in Portland (1.3 miles west),
Gregory (2.0 miles north), and Ingleside (2.9 miles east), all located in San Patricio County,
Texas. The land surrounding the Terminal to the north and east has been used for processing,
storage, and disposal of aluminum ore and related waste products for over 50 years. The nearest
residence to any temporary construction activities is located approximately 0.6 mile northwest of
the j
unction of La Quinta Road and SH 361. This j
unction is near the northwest corner of
DMPA 2 that would be filled using dredged material excavated during construction. This area is
not owned by Cheniere, and there would be no Proj
ect related activities at this location once the
initial dredging of the marine berths were completed. Construction traffic would also use La
Quinta Road to enter the Terminal site.
There are residences surrounding the Northshore Country Club in Portland,
approximately 1.3 miles west of the Terminal site. Voestalpine, an Austrian steel producer, is
planning to build a direct iron reduced (DRI)plant on the adj
acent 1,100-acre property to the
west of the Terminal site, currently owned by POCCA. The DRI plant would lie between the
Terminal site and the residences near the Northshore Country Club. Due to the siting of the
Terminal within an existing industrialized area and the absence of significant residential
development, impacts would be consistent with the surrounding land use.

Environmental Impact Statement

4-61

Corpus Christi LNG

To facilitate this Proj
ect, POCCA and the COE have initiated construction work on the
extension of the La Quinta Channel and began constructing a 126-acre dredge material
placement area in 2010. Per website inquiry, the channel extension was completed in February
2014.
4.8.1.3

Recreation and Special Interest Areas

All of the land that would be used for the Proj
ect is privately owned. No public lands,
Indian reservations, scenic areas, developed recreational facilities, parks, forests, wildlife
management areas, wilderness areas, trails, or registered national landmarks have been identified
in the vicinity of the proposed Terminal.
Corpus Christi Bay supports abundant marine life that drives the tourism industry in the
Corpus Christi area. Recreational fishing and boating occurs in the Corpus Christi Bay and in
the La Quinta Channel, and fishing takes place off piers along the shoreline in the Ingleside and
Portland areas. Numerous charter fishing boats operate in Corpus Christi Bay, originating out of
the communities of Corpus Christi, Ingleside, Port Aransas, Aransas Pass, and Rockport. The
recreational boating marinas closest to the Terminal include the Bahia Marina in Ingleside-onthe-Bay approximately 3 miles southeast, and the Port Aransas Municipal Marina, more than 10
miles east of the Terminal site. Common species sought by recreational anglers in the bay
include redfish, speckled trout, drum, and flounder.
The Corpus Christi and La Quinta Ship Channels are actively used by commercial ship
traffic, as the Port of Corpus Christi is the fifth largest commercial port in the U.S. Though total
port traffic would increase (section 4.9.10), the LNG carriers would be restricted to the dredged
deep water Corpus Christi and La Quinta Ship Channels while most recreational boaters utilize
shallower channels of the GIWW within Corpus Christi Bay. We have determined the Proj
ect
would not have any adverse impacts on recreation, including boating and fishing in Corpus
Christi Bay.
4.8.1.4

Visual Resources

The degree of visual impact that may result from a Proj
ect is typically determined by
considering the general character of the existing landscape and the visually prominent features of
the proposed facilities. The Terminal would be constructed in a historically industrial area along
the northeastern shore of Corpus Christi Bay, west of the Sherwin Alumina plant. The most
prominent visual feature at the Terminal site would be three LNG storage tanks, each 181.9feet
in height from the finished grade to the top of the dome. The height from the tank floor to the
top of the dome would be 177.5 feet. The outside tank diameter would be 258.5 feet. The
heights of each of the three LNG storage tanks are less than the tallest structure on the adj
acent
Sherwin plant, which measures at 197 feet above grade.
The flare stack would be visible when in use in both day and night conditions. When
flaring is not occurring, the 500-foot-high flare stack would be similar in appearance to a cell
tower. The flare would be installed to accommodate emergency reliefs and start-up flaring only
and would not be used during routine operation. Cheniere proj
ects using the flare stack two to
three days per year.
The Terminal would be consistent with the industrial land use and visual resources of the
area. In addition, the POCCA has plans to construct the La Quinta Trade Gateway Terminal on
Environmental Impact Statement

4-62

Corpus Christi LNG

the property immediately west of the Terminal. The La Quinta Trade Gateway Terminal would
block much or all of the visibility of the Terminal and provide a closer industrial visual feature
from residences and other publicly‐accessible locations. Given the existing industrial nature of
this area, the limited visibility of the Terminal and the plans to develop the property west of the
Terminal site, Cheniere is not proposing to implement any specific measures to further limit the
visibility of the Terminal.
Impacts on visual resources resulting from the storage tanks and flare stack would be
moderate and permanent;however, due to the proximity of the Terminal to other industrial
structures, the storage tanks and flare stack would be consistent with the surrounding land use.
There are no residences, schools, community parks, or public areas that would be
considered visually sensitive areas within 1 mile of the Terminal. The three storage tanks and
elevated flare stacks would be visible on the horizon from the nearby residential subdivisions and
the Northshore Country Club golf course. The current viewshed from the nearest residence is
presented in figure 4.8-1. An artist rendering of the anticipated viewshed following construction
of the Terminal is presented in figures 4.8-2 and 4.8-3.
The Terminal would use the minimum lighting necessary to allow personnel to safely
work and inspect the equipment at the Terminal. There would be lighting along the perimeter
fence as required by security regulations. Lighting on the marine j
etties would be the minimum
necessary for safe operation and positioned so as not to impede shipping in the channel. The
lighting at the Terminal would be consistent with lighting at other industrial facilities along the
La Quinta Channel and would not significantly increase light pollution in the area. Therefore,
lighting and nighttime flaring would not have a significant impact on the environment. The
maj
ority of the Pipeline would be constructed within agricultural land and/or adj
acent to existing
rights-of-way, which would not alter the landscape of the region. The Taft Compressor Station
would be located in an agricultural field with very few nearby residences. In addition, the Taft
Compressor Station would be located amongst the wind turbines associated with the Papalote
Creek Wind Farm and visual impacts from the station are expected to be minimal. The Sinton
Compressor Station would not be visible from residences or publicly-accessible locations and is
expected to have no visual impacts. Other aboveground facilities associated with the Pipeline,
such as valves and meter and regulation stations, would be fairly small and not expected to have
a significant impact on visual resources.

Coastal Zone Management

The Terminal would be located within the Texas CZMP. All activities or developments
that affect Texas’s coastal resources and require a federal permit or license are evaluated for
compliance with the CZMA through the “federal consistency”process. In addition to the RRC,
Cheniere has consulted with the TGLO’s Coastal Coordination Council which determined that
the Proj
ect exceeds their threshold for CZMA consistency review and deferred review to the
RRC. Cheniere has requested a CZMA determination for the Proj
ect in conj
unction with its
review and comments to the COE as part of the COE Section 10/404 permitting process (see
section 1.6.9).
Cheniere submitted its permit application to the COE on August 31, 2012. The
application is still undergoing review and a Section 10/404 permit has not been issued. As a
result, Cheniere has not received its consistency determination from the RRC. A determination
from the RRC that the Proj
ect is consistent with the Texas CZMP must be received before we
could issue a notice to proceed with constructing the Terminal or the Pipeline. Because Cheniere
has not yet obtained its authorization, we are recommending that:
 Prior to construction,Cheniere should file documentation of concurrence from the
RRC that the Project is consistent with the Texas CZMP.
The FERC would not approve construction until all federal authorizations, including a
consistency determination with the CZMA has been granted.

Pipeline Facilities

4.8.2.1

Land Use

The Pipeline would originate at the proposed Terminal and would run northwest for
approximately 23 miles towards the city of Sinton and would terminate at the Tennessee Gas
M&R Station. The entire Pipeline would be located within San Patricio County, Texas. The
Pipeline would be collocated, overlapped, or paralleled with existing rights-of-way for
approximately 19.73 miles, or 86 percent of the total route. Locations where the Pipeline would
be collocated with existing rights-of-way are provided in table 4.8-2.

There are no existing residences or buildings within 50 feet of the Pipeline construction
work area. A Southwestern Bell fenced facility lies within 60 feet outside the proposed Pipeline,
and a building within the Southwestern Bell facility lies within 75 feet of the proposed Pipeline.
This building does not house permanent employees.
Constructing the Pipeline and associated aboveground facilities would impact a total of
approximately 420.7 acres of land. Land use impacts associated with the Pipeline facilities
would include disturbance of existing land use, the creation of new easements, and the
conversion of some land to a different land use type. Construction of the Pipeline would require
a 120-foot-wide construction work area, which would be comprised of a 50-foot-wide permanent
easement for operation and a 70-foot-wide temporary easement for construction. ATWS would
be necessary in certain locations along the Pipeline route for setup and construction across
roadways, waterbodies, wetlands, and other features that require specialized construction
procedures (section 2.4.3.2). Pipeline construction and operational impacts on land use are listed
in table 4.8-3.
Construction of the Pipeline, including only the construction right-of-way and ATWS,
would impact 348.1 acres of land. Approximately 20.1 acres of access roads would be used
during construction. Details on temporary and permanent access roads to be used for the
Pipeline are listed in table 4.8-4. Constructing the two compressor stations would impact
Environmental Impact Statement

4-67

Corpus Christi LNG

approximately 24.1 acres (6.9acres for the Taft Compressor Station and 17.2 acres for the Sinton
Compressor Station). Constructing the six proposed M&R stations would impact approximately
10.8 acres of land. Cheniere would also utilize a 17.4-acre parcel of land previously used for
temporary construction support as a temporary pipe storage and contractor yard. This yard
would be located on the Pipeline route southeast of the City of Taft on County Road 78.
Agricultural lands would be the primary land use impacted by construction of the
Pipeline and associated facilities. To accommodate deep tilling in agricultural fields, Cheniere
would bury the approximately 18 miles of Pipeline that cross actively cultivated agricultural
fields to a minimum depth of 4 feet. In all other areas Cheniere would bury the Pipeline to a
minimum depth of 3 feet. Additional depth of cover would be provided where requested by
landowners during right-of-way negotiations. Final designed burial depth would be determined
during the detailed design phase based on land usage anticipated at the time of construction. The
remaining land uses that would be impacted by the Pipeline consist of open lands and industrial
lands.
Cheniere would obtain easements from landowners prior to constructing the Pipeline.
Easements would give Cheniere access to properties and the rights to construct, operate, and
maintain the Pipeline and establish a permanent right-of-way. Cheniere would compensate
landowners for use of their land. The easement agreements would specify compensation for the
loss of use during construction, loss of nonrenewable or other resources, and allowable uses and
restrictions on the permanent right-of-way after construction. These restrictions could include
prohibition of construction of aboveground structures including house additions, garages, patios,
pools, or any other obj
ects not easily removable;roads or driveways over the pipeline;or the
planting and cultivating of trees or orchards within the permanent easement. The areas used as
temporary construction right-of-way and ATWS would be allowed to revert to preconstruction
uses with no restrictions. Land uses, including agricultural and open land, would be allowed to
continue within the permanent easement and would not be permanently impacted. As discussed
in the Environmental Compliance and Monitoring Section landowners would typically be
notified three to five days prior to the start of construction activities, unless earlier notice is
requested during easement negotiations. Landowners would be provided with written
notification that would include information regarding how landowners can contact Cheniere in
the event that there are complaints or incidences that need to be addressed during construction.
The written notification to landowners would also provide the number for the FERC Hotline if
landowners do not get an adequate response from Cheniere.
Cheniere would construct and maintain the Pipeline according to measures contained in
our Plan and Procedures. Vegetation on the permanent right-of-way in non-agricultural areas
would be maintained by mowing, cutting, or trimming as necessary. Agricultural areas would
return to a preconstruction cultivated state, and would thus not result in a change in land use.
The Pipeline right-of-way would be allowed to revegetate;however, in wetlands and in the
required 25-foot vegetation maintenance buffer adj
acent to waterbodies, a 10-foot strip centered
on the Pipeline would be mowed. Additionally, trees within 15 feet of the pipeline with root
systems that could compromise the integrity of the pipe would be selectively removed. The
frequency of vegetation maintenance would depend upon the vegetative growth rate;however, it
would not exceed that prescribed in our Plan and Procedures.

Existing and Planned Residences and Commercial Developments

The Pipeline would be located primarily in agricultural areas. There are currently no
existing or planned residential developments within 0.25 mile of the Pipeline. Additionally,
there are no existing residences or occupied buildings within 50 feet of the Pipeline construction
work area. Therefore, the Pipeline would not adversely impact existing residences or planned
developments.
4.8.2.3

Recreation and Special Interest Areas

All of the land that would be used for the Pipeline is privately owned. No public lands,
Indian reservations, scenic areas, developed recreational facilities, parks, forests, wildlife
management areas, wilderness areas, trails, or registered national landmarks have been identified
in the vicinity of the proposed Pipeline;and would therefore, not be impacted.
4.8.2.4

Visual Resources

Constructing and operating the Pipeline may impact visual resources by altering the
terrain and vegetation patterns during construction or right-of-way maintenance and from the
presence of new aboveground facilities. The landscape setting along the proposed Pipeline route
is generally flat. No designated viewing locations are present in areas overlooking the route.
The maj
ority of the Pipeline would be located within agricultural land and/or adj
acent to existing
rights-of-way, which would not alter the landscape of the region.
Impacts on visual resources due to the Pipeline would be primarily temporary and shortterm, occurring during construction. The terrain over the maj
ority of the Proj
ect area is flat;
therefore, during construction, the cleared and graded right-of-way, as well as construction
equipment would be visible from surrounding residences and local roads. Following the
completion of construction activities, areas disturbed for construction would be restored and
agricultural activities that previously occurred in the area would be able to resume. Therefore,
the construction and operation of the Pipeline would not result in long-term visual impacts.
Cheniere would also install several aboveground facilities including M&R stations, as
well as two compressor stations. M&R stations are typically small and would be expected to
have only minor visual impacts. No sensitive visual resources such as schools, residential
subdivisions, or public land were identified within the Proj
ect area or in the vicinity of the
proposed aboveground facilities. Therefore, the visual impact of the aboveground facilities
would not have a significant impact on the aesthetics of the landscape along the Pipeline route.
Taft Compressor Station
The Taft Compressor Station would be located southeast of Taft, Texas, in a rural
agricultural area northwest of the intersection of County Road 78 and County Road 77. The
nearest residence to the Taft Compressor Station would be located about 0.7 mile away. The
compressor station would be located within the Papalote Creek Wind Farm, and the nearest wind
turbine would be approximately 200 feet east of the proposed compressor station. There are
several other wind turbines within 0.25 mile of the station. The wind turbines are visible from
several miles away. Other man‐made features on the landscape include high‐tension power lines
along County Road 78, grain silos, and both operating and abandoned oil and gas facility
structures. The Taft Compressor Station would be consistent with other infrastructure in the area
and would be less visible and noticeable than the nearby wind turbines. The compressor station
Environmental Impact Statement

4-71

Corpus Christi LNG

would be enclosed with chain link fencing. Because the station is sited within the windfarm,
visual screening measures would not be necessary.
Sinton Compressor Station
The Sinton Compressor Station would be located more than 1 mile from the nearest
public access point and would not be visible to the public. Therefore, no plans are proposed to
implement measures to visually screen the Sinton Compressor Station.
The maj
ority of the land impacted by the Pipeline would be allowed to revert back to
preconstruction conditions following completion of construction. Some areas, including those
used for aboveground facilities, would be permanently converted to an industrial use. The
implementation of the measures discussed above, including collocation of the maj
ority of the
Pipeline, would result in minimization of impacts on land use. Most impacts on visual resources
would be temporary and associated with the construction phase of the Pipeline.
Construction and operation of aboveground facilities would have a minor impact on
visual resources. The Taft Compressor Station would be sited in an area dominated by wind
turbines and the Sinton Compressor Station would not be visible from the nearest residence or
public access point. Overall, land use, recreation, and visual resource impacts associated with
the Pipeline would be minor.
4.8.2.5

Coastal Zone Management

The Pipeline would be located within the Texas CZMP. Details regarding permit
applications and j
urisdiction over construction activities in this zone are discussed in section
4.8.1.5 above.
4.9

SOCIOECONOMICS

Due to the regional extent of socioeconomic impacts, this section will discuss impacts in
regards to the Proj
ect as a whole, rather than Terminal and Pipeline facilities individually. If the
proposed Proj
ect was constructed, several potential socioeconomic impacts could occur as a
result. Potential impacts from construction activities would include increased local population
levels, and increased demands on public services and housing, increased local expenditures for
materials during construction, increased payroll and sales tax revenues, local j
ob opportunities,
and increased property values. Socioeconomic impacts are detailed below.
4.9.1

Population

Both maj
or Proj
ect components, the Terminal and the Pipeline, would be within the
Corpus Christi Metropolitan Statistical Area (CCMSA), which includes Nueces and San Patricio
Counties. Nearby towns and cities include Gregory, Portland, Corpus Christi, Taft, Sinton,
Ingleside, Ingleside-on-the-Bay, and Aransas Pass.
Table 4.9-1 below provides a summary of selected population and socioeconomic
statistics for the State of Texas. Nueces County had population growth from 2000 to 2010 of 8.5
percent, and the population of San Patricio County declined by 3.5 percent during the same time
period.

_________________________
Source: U.S. Bureau of the Census 2012.

The total Proj
ect-related population change would equal the total number of non-local
workers, plus any family members accompanying them. During peak construction periods
(approximately 60 months), Terminal and Pipeline construction workforces, combined would
include a total of approximately 2,100 workers;peaking at approximately 3,300 workers. As
discussed further in sections 4.9.2 and 4.9.6, Cheniere would utilize predominantly local workers
during construction, and employ a relatively small full-time operational staff at the Terminal.
We determined Proj
ect-related impacts on the regional population would be short-term and
negligible;however, more localized impacts on the nearby community of Portland could be
significant when the workforce is at its peak.
Representatives from Cheniere met with area of Chambers of Commerce on three
occasions: March 22, 2012, October 17, 2012, and December 4, 2012 to address the potential
impacts of construction and operation of the Proj
ect. In addition, Cheniere representatives have
met regularly since 2010 with local community officials, specifically all of the area mayors and
councils (Ingleside, Port Aransas, Aransas Pass, Corpus Christi, Portland, and Gregory), the
regional Economic Development Corporations, and non-governmental organizations such as
environmental groups, civic organizations, and educational facilities.
Constructing the Proj
ect would result in a short-term, moderate increase to the local
population and operating would result in a negligible long-term increase. Therefore, we
determined the Proj
ect, as a whole, would not significantly impact local population size.
4.9.2

Economyand Employment

In 2012, the government (19 percent), trade/transportation/utility (19 percent),
education/health services (17 percent), and the leisure and hospitality (12 percent)service sectors
were the largest economic sectors in the CCMSA. The largest employers in the CCMSA were
the petrochemical industries, health care industry, government and military, and agriculture.
The nearest municipality to the Terminal is Portland (pop. 15,099). With a civilian
employed population of 7,196, Portland has no heavy industry and little commercial or retail
business within the town limits;however, there are several industrial facilities located within
10 miles. The largest industries in Portland are educational services, and health care and social
assistance (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012).
The 2012 American Community Survey 5-year estimate for per capita income in San
Patricio County was $22,958 and the unemployment rate was 8.0 percent. According to the
same 5-year estimate, the per capita income in Nueces County was $23,660 and the
Environmental Impact Statement

4-73

Corpus Christi LNG

unemployment rate was also 8.0 percent (see table 4.9-2). The 2012 American Community
Survey 5-year estimate for unemployment rate in the CCMSA was 7.9percent, comparable to
the State of Texas rate of 7.7 percent (U.S. Census, 2012). Constructing the Proj
ect would
positively impact employment opportunities in both San Patricio and Nueces Counties. The
Proj
ect would not have an adverse impact on the unemployment rate, and could decrease the
unemployment rate due to hiring a predominantly local workforce where feasible.

Construction of the Terminal would require an estimated 1,800 workers over a duration
of approximately 60 months. Construction of the Pipeline and associated facilities, including
compressor stations, would require an estimated 300 workers over approximately 9months. A
large national or regional pipeline construction firm would likely be selected to construct the
Pipeline. However, there is a substantial local pipeline construction capability that could be
employed through the Pipeline contractor.
Construction schedules for the Terminal and Pipeline are planned to overlap in 2016 for a
period of approximately 9months to 1 year (the length of time that it would take to construct the
Pipeline facilities). The total number of workers on the Proj
ect when the two phases overlap
would be approximately 2,100;peaking at approximately 3,300 workers. Pipe and equipment for
the Pipeline would be staged several miles from the Terminal and construction activities
associated with the Pipeline immediately adj
acent to the Terminal would be limited to the time
necessary to install the Pipeline and would not encroach directly on the Terminal facility.
During operation, Cheniere anticipates adding approximately 175 full-time positions,
split into three daily shifts, to operate the Terminal facilities, and approximately six full-time
employees to operate the Pipeline and associated compressor stations. Cheniere estimates that
Environmental Impact Statement

4-74

Corpus Christi LNG

staffing for operating the Terminal would result in very little relocation due to the local
availability of a large, skilled workforce. This is due primarily to the local refining and
petrochemical sectors as well as training programs at local colleges. Operating the Pipeline and
compressor stations would also draw primarily from the local workforce. A few management
level employees could relocate to the area for the operations phase. The Proj
ect workforce and
anticipated construction schedules for the Terminal and Pipeline facilities are summarized in
table 4.9-3.

Cheniere estimates that construction and other pre-operational activities associated with
the Proj
ect would result in beneficial cumulative impacts on business activity ranging from $7.4
to $10.0 billion to the local economy, $22.9to $31.0 billion to the Texas economy, and $34.4 to
$46.4 billion to the U.S. economy. Over the first 25 years of Proj
ect operation, the cumulative
impacts of operations of the Proj
ect on business activity and tax receipts is estimated to
contribute $27.6 billion to the local economy, $35.0 billion to the Texas economy, and $38.0
billion to the U.S. economy.
Additionally, according to Cheniere the Proj
ect is estimated to contribute indirectly to the
creation of approximately 50,000 new j
obs annually across the U.S. through increased natural
gas exploration, drilling and production. These secondary effects are expected to result in total
economic benefits of approximately $327 billion over 25 years for the U.S. economy.
4.9.3

PropertyValues

Construction and operation of the Proj
ect would not require the relocation or involuntary
displacement of any residences or businesses. The Terminal would be constructed on property
owned by Cheniere that was previously an industrial site, but has since been reclaimed. The
Pipeline and compressor station facilities would be primarily on agricultural lands, and no
existing residences or buildings are located within 50 feet of the Pipeline construction work area.
Cheniere owns that land of the proposed location of the Taft Compressor Station. Cheniere is in
negotiations to acquire the land for the proposed Sinton Compressor Station.
No significant impacts on property values are anticipated from construction and operation
of the Proj
ect. The Terminal would be located in an industrialized area surrounded by industrial
and commercial development, and there are currently no existing or planned residential
developments within 0.25 mile of the Terminal. The LNG storage tanks would be surrounded by
industrial/commercial properties, and there would be no land within 0.25 mile of the Terminal
site that would be available for residential development. The Pipeline would be located
primarily in agricultural areas, and there are no existing residences or buildings within 50 feet of
Environmental Impact Statement

4-75

Corpus Christi LNG

the Pipeline construction work area. Additionally, there are currently no existing or planned
residential developments within 0.25 mile of the Pipeline (see section 4.8). The proposed
pipeline may have an impact on the property values of the surrounding area;however, valuation
depends on many factors, including the size of the parcel, the values of adj
acent properties, the
presence of other utilities, the current value of the land, and the current land use. Similar
pipeline rights-of-way are present in the surrounding areas;therefore, the property values in the
general area of the proposed pipeline would already reflect the presence of underground
facilities.
Property taxes are generally based on the actual size of the land. Construction of the
pipeline would not change the general use of the land, but would preclude construction of
aboveground structures on the permanent right-of-way. If landowner feels that the presence of a
pipeline easement reduces the values of his or her land, resulting in an overpayment of property
taxes, he/she may appeal the issue of the assessment and subsequent property taxation to the
local property tax agency. This issue is beyond the scope of this EIS.
We received a comment regarding the potential for insurance premium adj
ustments or
loss of coverage associated with the proposed Proj
ect. This landowner didn’t explicitly specify
if they would be directly affected by the Pipeline, or if they reside near the Terminal. If they
reside near the Terminal, no potential loss or coverage of insurance is expected. Assuming the
landowner may be affected by the pipeline, we cannot assess how their property and or any
insurance they hold may be affected. Research conducted and included in the Constitution
Pipeline Proj
ect draft EIS20, which consisted of the FERC staff calling insurance agents,
suggested that potential for a residential action would depend on several factors, including terms
of the individual landowners policy and terms of the applicant’s policy (in this case Cheniere).
As indicated in the Constitution EIS, we were unable to confirm exclusively under what
conditions a landowner’s insurance policy could change.
4.9.4

Construction Payroll and Material Purchases

The Proj
ect would have an estimated total construction payroll of approximately $1.0 to
$1.5 billion over the 60-month construction period. The expenditures of Proj
ect personnel on
local goods, services, and labor would create several cycles of income as wages are spent and respent by succeeding recipients. The average monthly payroll impact of the Proj
ect on local
communities would be an estimated $1.4 million. Because the region supports an extensive
manufacturing and processing infrastructure for the chemical and petro-chemical industries,
many construction materials and equipment supplies are locally available, and Cheniere
anticipates that purchases of local construction materials would range from approximately $785
million to $1.06 billion.
4.9.5

Tax Revenues

The overall sales tax on goods and services in the CCMSA is 8.25 percent. No state
income tax is levied in the State of Texas. Construction of the Proj
ect would result in increased
sales tax revenues for the State of Texas, San Patricio and Nueces Counties, Gregory-Portland
Independent School District , Taft Independent School District, and Sinton Independent School
District. The Proj
ect is estimated to contribute approximately $1.6 to $2.8 million per month in
20

Docket No. CP13-499

Environmental Impact Statement

4-76

Corpus Christi LNG

local tax revenues. Additionally, the total tax revenues from construction and other preoperational activities associated with the Proj
ect is estimated to contribute $96.8 million for
Corpus Christi, $578.4 million for the State of Texas, and $1.4 billion for the U.S. New
revenues would provide direct and indirect benefits to local residents throughout the life of the
Proj
ect.
4.9.6

Housing

A sufficient supply of temporary housing units is available in San Patricio and Nueces
Counties. However, due to the size of Portland non-local workers would likely have to disperse
to the surrounding communities to meet all of the housing needs during construction. The
number of temporary and permanent housing units available is provided in table 4.9-4 below.
The Corpus Christi area is a popular tourist destination in south Texas and there are many hotels,
campgrounds, and recreational vehicle (RV)parks in the area.

a/ Housing Unit: According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s website glossary, a housing unit may be a house, apartment, mobile home
or trailer, group of rooms, or a single room occupied as separate living quarters or vacant, intended for occupancy as separate
living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from other individuals in the building and
which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall.
b/ Vacant Housing Unit: According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s website glossary, a housing unit is vacant if no one is living in it at
the time of enumeration, unless its occupants are only temporarily absent. Units temporarily occupied at the time of enumeration
entirely by people who have a usual residence elsewhere are also classified as vacant.
c/ Seasonal, Recreational, or Occasional Use Housing Unit: According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey
2008 Subject Definitions, seasonal, recreational, or occasional use housing units include vacant units used or intended for use
only in certain seasons or for weekends or other occasional use throughout the year. Seasonal units include those used for
summer or winter sports or recreation, such as beach cottages and hunting cabins. Seasonal units also may include quarters for
such workers as herders and loggers. Interval ownership units, sometimes called shared ownership or time-sharing
condominiums, are included in this category.

Corpus Christi LNG

Seasonal tourism, recreation, and port activity are maj
or components of the local
economy in the Corpus Christi metropolitan area. Because of the importance of these economic
sectors, businesses, local governments, and economic development agencies have worked to
ensure adequate availability of housing to accommodate these activities. Proj
ected increases in
tourism for the area are already being addressed by growth in local temporary housing capacity.
The Proj
ect is not expected to require construction of new residences. However, because
of the creation of high paying direct and indirect j
obs, the value of local housing is likely to
increase markedly due to the demand for higher-quality, owner-occupied and rental housing.
The maj
ority of workers associated with the Proj
ect is anticipated to come from within 50 miles
of the Proj
ect area and would not require temporary housing. Therefore, constructing the Proj
ect
is not expected to significantly impact local market conditions.
4.9.7

Removal of Agricultural,Pasture,or Timberland from Production

Construction and operation of the Terminal would not require the removal of agricultural
land, pasture, or timberland from production;therefore, no adverse impacts would occur.
Although construction of the Pipeline would temporarily impact agricultural land, these lands
would be allowed to revegetate and return to preconstruction conditions and uses. Therefore, no
significant impact on potential revenue from agricultural lands is anticipated, as overall
production should not be affected.
Some areas, including those used for the Taft Compressor Station as well as other
aboveground facilities, would be permanently converted to industrial land and thus, would
require the removal of agricultural land from pasture. However, these impacts would be minor,
and Cheniere would compensate landowners for the use of their land and for production loss.
4.9.8

Public Services

San Patricio and Nueces Counties have well-developed infrastructure that would provide
health, police, fire, emergency, and social services near the Proj
ect site. Public health
infrastructure in San Patricio County includes one community hospital, five health centers, and
10 private clinics. Nueces County has seven hospitals: Care Regional Medical Center in Aransas
Pass, Texas, is located approximately 7 miles from the proposed Terminal;and Christus Spohn
Hospital, Corpus Christi Medical Center, Driscoll Children's Hospital, Kindred Hospital,
Northwest Regional Hospital, and Doctors Regional Medical Center, are all in Corpus Christi,
Texas, approximately 13 to 16 miles from the proposed Terminal.
The cities of Corpus Christi, Portland, Gregory, Ingleside, Sinton, and Taft each have a
police department and fire department near the Proj
ect area. The nearest hospital, Care Regional
Medical Center, is equipped with a trauma center and has 75 beds. Additional hospitals with
trauma centers are located nearby in Corpus Christi. The nearest police station, located
approximately 2.4 miles from the proposed Terminal, is the Portland City Police Department.
Other law enforcement and emergency services are provided by the Nueces County Sheriff’s
Department and San Patricio County Sheriff's Office in Sinton, Texas. The Portland City Fire
Department is the nearest fire service. Emergency services, including medical, fire, and law
enforcement, are available through the “911” service and can address large scale emergency
responses, as needed.

municipal fire department;therefore, Cheniere is exploring contracting with the Refinery
Terminal Fire Company to provide firefighting and emergency services in the area.
The Terminal site lies within the Gregory-Portland Independent School District and the
Pipeline crosses through Gregory-Portland Independent School District, Taft Independent School
District, and Sinton Independent School District. Table 4.9-5 below provides information on the
school districts and school enrollment in the Proj
ect area. For the 2010-2011 school year there
were 74,517 students enrolled in 130 schools in the Proj
ect area. Most of the Proj
ect
construction personnel would not be expected to relocate their entire families to the Proj
ect area;
therefore, the Proj
ect would not have a significant impact on local schools.

Corpus Christi LNG

The Corpus Christi area is home to several academic institutions of higher learning.
Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi and Del Mar College are located in Corpus Christi. Del
Mar College is a community college offering associate level and technical courses, while Texas
A&M University - Corpus Christi is an institution offering both undergraduate and graduate
degrees. Port Aransas hosts the University of Texas at Austin Marine Science Institute, an
institution fostering both undergraduate and postgraduate oceanographic studies.
Impacts on public services would be greatest while constructing the Proj
ect, as the
greatest number of workers would be present. City of Portland public services, as those closest
to the Terminal, would be in highest demand during construction. While public services in
Portland may not be sufficient to accommodate the increased demand when the workforce is at
its peak, public services in the surrounding areas would be sufficient. Through cooperation and
coordination with local law enforcement and health care providers, the Proj
ect would not
significantly burden local public services.

Environmental Justice

Environmental j
ustice considers disproportionately high and adverse impacts on minority
or low-income populations in the surrounding community resulting from the programs, policies,
or activities of federal agencies. Items considered in the evaluation of environmental j
ustice
include human health or environmental hazards, the natural physical environment, and associated
social, economic, and cultural factors. Environmental j
ustice analysis is conducted in
compliance with Executive Order 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in
Minority Populations and Low Income Populations.
Under Executive Order 12898, each federal agency must ensure that public documents,
notices, and hearings are readily available to the public. The mailing list for the Proj
ect was
initiated when the FERC’s NOI was issued, and has been continually updated during the EIS
process. All property owners affected by the Proj
ect, as identified by Cheniere, received the
notices about the Proj
ect without any distinction based on minority or income status. The
distribution list for the draft EIS included local newspapers and libraries;and all landowners,
miscellaneous individuals, and environmental groups who provided scoping comments or asked
to remain on the mailing list.
The maj
ority of impacts associated with the Proj
ect would result from construction and
operation of the Terminal facilities, as presented throughout this EIS. The nearest residential
area is located more than 1 mile from the Terminal and consists of a golf course community
(Northshore Country Club). Impacts associated with the Pipeline facilities are primarily
associated with construction and operation of the compressor stations. There are no residences
located within 0.5 mile of either the Sinton or Taft Compressor Stations, and the closest
residential areas are more than 3 miles and 1.4 miles, respectively.
Table 4.9-6 presents the general ethnic mix and economic status of San Patricio County,
and Nueces County, Texas based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau (2012). Nueces and San
Patricio Counties have a lower percentage of Black and Asian populations than the State of
Texas as a whole. However, both Counties have a higher percentage of people of Hispanic or
Latino origin than the rest of the state.

The communities in the immediate vicinity of the Proj
ect area do not show any
fundamental characteristics that would differentiate them from Nueces or San Patricio Counties,
or the State of Texas as a whole (see table 4.9-7). While a relatively high percentage of the
population lives below the poverty level in Census Tracts 105 and 108, these tracts would not be
directly crossed by the Proj
ect. Additionally, there are no aboveground facilities within 0.5 mile
of these tracts. All of the other census tracts within which the Proj
ect would be located have
fewer people below the poverty level than the State of Texas or the county;therefore, low
income populations would not be disproportionately impacted. Similarly, the percentage of
minority populations within some of the census tracts (Census Tracts 105, 108, and 110)are
higher than that for the Proj
ect counties. As stated, Census Tracts 105 and 108 are not directly
crossed by the Proj
ect, and only a small portion of the Pipeline would cross Census Tract 110.
All of the other tracts in which the Proj

than the county;therefore, minority populations are not disproportionately impacted. The
location of the Terminal and compressor stations in relation to the low income and minority
populations in the Proj

Contractors working on the Proj

opportunity and non-discrimination laws and policies. The criteria for all positions would be
based upon qualifications without regard to age, race, creed, or sex, and in accordance with
applicable, federal, state, and local employment laws and policies. Disproportionate, adverse
impacts on minority or low-income populations would not occur as a result of constructing or
operating the Proj
ect. Furthermore, the Proj
ect is expected to provide a beneficial economic
impact on local communities through employment opportunities, construction payroll
expenditures, purchases of construction goods and materials, local expenditures by workers, and
increased tax revenues, regardless of race or income group.
The FERC staff held one public scoping meeting in the Proj
ect area to provide residents,
municipalities, special interest groups, and federal and state regulatory agencies an opportunity
to comment on the Proj
ect. The date and location of the meeting was included in the NOI.
Throughout this document we identify impacts on environmental resources that potentially may
have a direct or indirect effect on the local population, including air quality (see section 4.11.1),
water resources (see section 4.3), and hazardous materials (see section 4.2). We have not
identified any disproportionately high or adverse human health or environmental effects on
minority and low-income communities or Native American groups.
With the implementation of Cheniere’s construction plans, we have determined that the
construction and operation of the Proj

local population including low-income and minority populations.

Transportation and Traffic

4.9.10.1

Terminal Facilities

Land Transportation
The Terminal site is accessible via public roadways. It would be located on La Quinta
Road, which intersects SH 35 and SH 361 in Gregory. From Gregory, US 181 provides southern
access to Portland, Corpus Christi, and Interstate 37 (I-37), and northern access to Sinton and US
77. The city of San Antonio is 150 miles northwest of Gregory via I-37 and Houston is
210 miles north via US 77/59.
South of Gregory, existing roads would provide land access to the Terminal site via
SH 35, SH 361, and La Quinta Road. La Quinta Road, which is a private road currently used as
access to the adj
acent Sherwin Alumina facility, would provide primary access to the Terminal
during both construction and operation. All Terminal traffic must access La Quinta Road via the
SH 35 eastbound frontage road, which requires all traffic entering the site to turn right from the
SH 35 eastbound frontage road onto La Quinta Road. All traffic exiting the site would turn right
from La Quinta Road onto the SH 35 eastbound frontage road. Personnel and deliveries driving
from Aransas Pass would travel west on SH 35 to Portland, exit Broadway, perform a U-turn and
proceed east on the SH 35 frontage road, which is the same direction as traffic from Corpus
Christi. Vehicles leaving the site and traveling to Aransas Pass would proceed easterly on the
SH 35 frontage road, and vehicles traveling to Corpus Christi would also travel easterly on the
SH 35 frontage road, but would U-turn under SH 35 at the SH 361 intersection and travel west
on SH 35.
Based on 2010 traffic data from the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT),
approximately 32,000 vehicles per day traveled SH 35 near the exit for La Quinta Road. No
official level of service ratings have been assigned to the roads in the Proj
ect vicinity.
There would be an increase in heavy truck traffic and workforce traffic to the Terminal
site during the Terminal construction phase. Cheniere estimates an average of 26 to 36 deliveries
of construction materials per day, with a peak of 44 to 59trips per day. The estimated daily
construction traffic would equate to approximately 1,620 to 2,268 trips to and from the Terminal
during an average month of construction, including all worker vehicles, deliveries, and other
construction traffic. During peak construction, Cheniere would anticipate approximately 2,700
to 3,645 vehicle trips per month to and from the site. Based on available traffic count data,
constructing the Terminal would not be expected to significantly impact traffic flow on SH 35, as
this volume represents a temporary daily increase in traffic of 2 to 3 percent. To help mitigate
increases in traffic, a parking area for construction workers is planned near SH 361 at the
Sherwin Alumina exit, from which the construction workers would be carried by a bus through
the Sherwin Alumina property to the rear entrance of the Terminal site. This arrangement would
reduce traffic on La Quinta Road during peak hours.
Vehicles entering the site could have an impact on traffic at the intersection of SH 35 and
Broadway (in Portland). A southbound SH 35 frontage road to northbound SH 35 frontage road
U-turn exists at the Broadway intersection which should minimize construction traffic from
passing through the intersection. Vehicles exiting the site would increase traffic at the
intersection of SH 35 and State Loop 202. However, a U-turn that connects the northbound SH
35 frontage road to the SH 35 southbound main lanes is located j
ust west of State Loop 202.
Environmental Impact Statement

4-84

Corpus Christi LNG

This connector provides vehicles leaving the Terminal site an additional route, which would
minimize impacts at the intersection.
Cheniere would consult with the TxDOT and other local entities responsible for
transportation planning, including San Patricio and Nueces Counties and the cities of Gregory
and Portland, to determine if a Proj
ect-specific construction transportation plan is necessary.
Operating the Terminal would require an estimated 175 employees, split between 3 daily
shifts. The additional traffic generated by operational employees would not result in a
significant increase in traffic volume on area roadways because the increase would be less than 1
percent of the daily traffic volumes in the area.
Overall, impacts on land transportation would primarily occur during construction of the
Terminal. During construction, Cheniere would minimize impacts on traffic via the use of
busses to transport workers to the site. Additionally, the increase in traffic while constructing the
Terminal would be temporary and would only slightly increase traffic in the area. During
operation of the Terminal, the increase in traffic volume would be negligible and would not
result in a perceptible overall increase in area traffic.
Marine Transportation
The Port of Corpus Christi is the fifth largest port in the U.S. in tonnage. In 2009, the
volume of ship and barge activities (total of 5,160 ship calls)declined approximately 14 percent
from 2008. In 2010, the Port of Corpus Christi handled 5,768 ship calls, including 416 ships
carrying dry cargo, 992 tankers, and 4,360 barges. The top three inbound commodities in 2010
were crude oil, fuel oil, and gas oil, while the top outbound commodities were gasoline, fuel oil,
and diesel.
The La Quinta Channel is the site of the Kiewit Offshore Industries marine fabrication
yard, DuPont Chemical Company, Occidental Chemical Company, and the Sherwin Alumina
Company. Traffic consists of rigs and platforms, tank ships and barges carrying chemicals and
products to and from the chemical plants, and ore and alumina carriers (ships and barges)to and
from Sherwin Alumina.
The ferries at Port Aransas operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, typically departing
every 10 to 20 minutes. Additionally, Corpus Christi Bay is utilized by commercial fishing and
shrimping boats, and recreational boaters;however, the maj
ority of recreational boaters use the
GIWW channels (see section4.8.1.3).
Commercial vessel traffic (less than 18-foot draft)traverses the ship channel between
Harbor Island and the Gulf of Mexico. On average, this traffic volume is less than six vessels
per day. Several fishing boats and other small crafts dock at Harbor Island and use either the
ship channel or Aransas Channel, and the Aransas Pass Outer Bar Channel to access the Gulf of
Mexico. Although this is a significant fleet of small boats, they typically do not use the Corpus
Christi Channel and would only be affected by LNG carrier traffic for the period of time the
LNG carrier is in the 4 nm along Outer Bar Channel. Aransas Pass also has a shipyard, but
traffic related to this facility would not be significant as compared to the normal volume of
fishing boats and other small crafts in the area.
The distance from the sea buoy off Aransas Pass to the Terminal’s marine berths would
be about 19.7 nm. The LNG carrier total U.S. territorial water route consists of an approximately
7.0 nm Safety Fairway transit from the U.S. Territorial Sea Boundary to the Aransas Pass Sea
Environmental Impact Statement

Buoy, thence approximately 4.6 nm to the entrance of the Jetty Channel, thence approximately
1.5 nm to the Corpus Christi Channel, thence approximately 9.0 nm to the La Quinta Channel,
and thence approximately 4.6 nm up the La Quinta Channel to the proposed Terminal LNG
carrier marine berths.
Cheniere estimates piloted channel transit times in each direction for an LNG carrier
would be between three and four hours, including docking and undocking operations, between
the sea buoy of Aransas Pass and the Terminal. Actual underway time would be approximately
1.25 hours in the Corpus Christi Ship Channel and approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour in the La
Quinta Channel. A moving safety and security zone would be established that would essentially
limit deep draft traffic to a one-way pattern when LNG carriers are in the channel, though it
would not be expected to adversely impact overall traffic patterns.
The maj
ority of vessel traffic that enters Corpus Christi Bay, via either the ship channel
or the GIWW, is bound for the Port of Corpus Christi. With the ship channel entrance and the
intersection with the GIWW both located east of the entrance to the La Quinta Channel,
transiting LNG carriers could have a transient effect on vessel traffic flow in Corpus Christi Bay
within that section of the channel. The maj
ority of other vessel traffic consists of tug and barge
tows utilizing the GIWW. Their potential to intersect with the LNG carrier route would be for a
relatively short distance as the tug and barge tow route and the LNG carrier route would overlap
for approximately 1.5 nm between the GIWW intersection with the ship channel and the branch
to the La Quinta Channel. Ship traffic, although subj
ect to the restrictions of the moving safety
and security zone around the transiting LNG carrier, would generally share the Corpus Christi
Channel between the Aransas Pass Sea Buoy and the entrance of the La Quinta Channel, a
distance of approximately 15 nm.
The Port Aransas ferry system crosses the Corpus Christi Ship Channel within
approximately 0.6 nm of the cut between San Jose Island and Mustang Island. Typically, four to
six ferryboats operate during daylight hours. However, when LNG carriers would be transiting;
one LNG carrier entering the Corpus Christi Ship Channel once every one to two days would not
be anticipated to have a significant effect on the Port Aransas ferry operations. Cheniere has
estimated that a single ferry trip may be potentially delayed up to a maximum of 20 minutes due
to the passage of an LNG carrier. According to TxDOT, ferry operators in the area are
accustomed to navigating around large vessels with safety zones and do not anticipate significant
impacts on ferry operations from LNG carriers under normal conditions.
4.9.10.2

Pipeline Facilities

Land Transportation
The Pipeline would cross 18 roadways;including SH 35, US 181, SH 188, and US 77;as
well as a number of local roadways. Roads crossed by the pipeline and the proposed crossing
method for each road are listed in table 4.9-8. The two pipeline compressor stations would be
located approximately 3 miles north of Sinton and 2 miles southeast of Taft. The Sinton
Compressor Station would be accessible from a private access road off of US 77 and the Taft
Compressor Station would be accessible via County Road 78.
Constructing the pipeline would require approximately 300 workers. An additional six
employees would be necessary to operate the Pipeline and associated compressor stations.
Construction traffic in and out of compressor station sites and yards would result in localized

Constructing the Pipeline would result in some minor, short-term impacts on area
roadways along the 23-mile route. Short-term impacts on traffic flow could occur where the
Pipeline would be installed beneath roads due to safety precautions for workers crossing and
working in the vicinity of the road crossings. However, these crossings would be constructed via
bore and would have no long-term impacts on traffic patterns or road conditions.
Construction traffic in and out of the compressor station sites and ware yards would result
in localized increases in traffic but existing traffic in the area is generally limited and the
increased traffic from construction is expected to be minor. If necessary, traffic control
personnel would be utilized to manage traffic in areas of active construction, but this would
typically only be required for large trucks entering or exiting the Pipeline workspaces and the
traffic impacts would be of short duration. Cheniere would repair any damage to public
roadways caused by construction equipment. Operation of the Pipeline and associated facilities
would require an additional workforce of six people which would not have an impact on traffic
in the area.

CULTURAL RESOURCES

Section 106 of the NHPA, as amended, requires that the FERC take into account the
effects of its undertakings on historic properties, and afford the ACHP an opportunity to
comment. The steps in the process to comply with Section 106, outlined in the ACHP’s
implementing regulations at 36 CFR 800, include consultations, identification of historic
properties, assessment of effects, and resolution of adverse effects. Activities related to
consultation and/or Proj
ect coordination for both the Terminal and Pipeline facilities are
presented for the Proj
ect as a whole, below. Field survey activities and the results of
investigations to identify and evaluate cultural resources that are completed to date are discussed
separately below.
4.10.1

Consultations

We sent copies of our NOI for this Proj
ect to a wide range of stakeholders, including the
ACHP, U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI)National Park Service, DOI Bureau of Indian
Affairs (BIA), the Texas SHPO, and Indian tribes which may have an interest in the Proj
ect area.
The NOI contained a paragraph about Section 106 of the NHPA, and stated that we use the
notice to initiate consultations with the SHPO, and to solicit their views, and those of other
government agencies, interested Indian tribes, and the public on the Proj
ect’s potential effects on
historic properties. No comments on cultural resources issues were received in response to our
NOI.
Through a review of Cheniere’s application, and independent research, we identified
Indian tribes that historically used or occupied the Proj
ect area, and may attach religious or
cultural significance to historic properties in the APE, in accordance with Section 101(d)(6)(B)
of the NHPA. In addition to sending our NOI to potentially interested Indian tribes, we wrote
letters to the 12 tribes listed on table 4.10-1 on January 9, 2013, describing the Proj

the Southern Plains Regional Office of the BIA requesting information about Indian tribes that
should be contacted about the Proj
ect. The BIA confirmed that the appropriate tribes that should
be contacted included the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe, Caddo Nation, Tonkawa Tribe, and Wichita
and Affiliated Tribes. Cheniere contends that it contacted the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe
concerning its proposed LNG import terminal in 2003, at the same location as the current
Proj
ect, and the tribe indicated that the Proj
ect area was outside of their ceded lands. Cheniere
sent letters dated January 13, 2012 to the Caddo Nation, Tonkawa Tribe of Oklahoma, and
Wichita and Affiliated Tribes requesting information about effects the Proj
ect may have on
traditional cultural properties. Cheniere has not filed any responses to its communications with
Indian tribes.
Cheniere also consulted with the THC, representing the SHPO. Cheniere had been
communicating with the SHPO since 2003, regarding its original LNG import terminal proposal.

Overview and SurveyResults

4.10.2.1

Terminal Facilities

On August 10, 2004, the SHPO indicated that the State Marine Archaeologist had
reviewed the submerged area where Cheniere proposed to excavate and construct its marine
berth for the originally proposed LNG import terminal and determined that much of the area had
been previously surveyed and the rest was very shallow, therefore, “the proj
ect may proceed
without further underwater archaeological survey.” Cheniere’s consultant, Tetra Tech, wrote a
letter to the SHPO on May 21, 2012, requesting concurrence that the previous cultural review
was still valid for the newly proposed LNG export proposal, because the basic location and
design of the marine berth had not greatly changed. The SHPO concurred on May 25, 2012.
Upland portions of the proposed Terminal site were first surveyed by Historic
Preservation Associates (Cheniere contractor), and reported in 2004. That survey identified 11
archaeological sites along the bluff edge (Klinger, 2004). A second survey report in 2004 by
PBS&J (Cheniere Contractor)inventoried about 79acres within the Terminal site. Nine of the
sites originally recorded by Historic Preservation Associates were relocated by PBS&J, plus
three new archaeological sites and an isolated find were identified (Turner, 2004b). PBS&J
tested six of the sites originally recorded by Historic Preservation Associates (Turner, 2004a).
The prehistoric sites were shell middens, usually found eroding from the bluffs, with limited
faunal materials and chipped stone artifacts.
One site (41SP35), however, contained an historic component, identified as the
archaeological remains of the so-called Taft Ranch Mansion. The Taft Ranch began as the
Fulton Cattle Company in 1871, and was controlled after 1900 by Charles Taft, half-brother to
future U.S. President William Taft. In 1907, Joseph Green, the Taft Ranch foreman, oversaw the
construction of a mansion and ranch headquarters, known as La Quinta, at the location of
41SP35. The mansion burned down in 1938.
PBS&J was of the opinion that none of the sites within the Terminal tract were eligible
for the NRHP. The SHPO agreed on August 24, 2004.
In May 2012, Tetra Tech inventoried about 4.2 acres at the proposed Terminal, relocated
10 of the previously recorded sites, and found three new sites. Again, all of the sites were
evaluated as not eligible for the NRHP (Tetra Tech, 2012). Tetra Tech submitted the report of
these investigations to the SHPO on August 8, 2012, who accepted it and agreed with the
recommendations, in a letter dated August 15, 2012.
On August 8, 2012, Tetra Tech wrote a letter to the SHPO, requesting permission not to
conduct archaeological surveys at the proposed DMPA 2 covering 385 acres and the borrow pit
covering 90 acres. It was Tetra Tech’s opinion that those areas were previously disturbed and
had a low potential to contain cultural resources. The SHPO agreed on August 15, 2012 that no
historic properties would be affected in those areas;and work at the DMPA 2 and borrow pit
could proceed as planned.
4.10.2.2

Pipeline Facilities

The original pipeline route proposed by Cheniere for its LNG import proj
ect, and
analyzed in our March 2005 EIS in Docket Nos. CP04-37-000 and CP04-44-000, was 23-mileslong, with eight proposed M&R stations at interconnections for other existing natural gas
Environmental Impact Statement

pipeline systems. Within two reports filed in 2004, PBS&J documented surveys that covered all
but 2.1 miles of that original route (Perkins and Latham 2004;Perkins 2004). No archaeological
or historic sites were recorded during those surveys. The SHPO accepted those reports in letters
dated March 25 and July 8, 2004 and agreed that no historic properties were identified in the
areas inventoried. On May 21, 2012, Tetra Tech wrote the SHPO a letter to confirm that the
previous surveys were still valid for the current Proj
ect proposed by Cheniere in Docket No.
CP12-508-000, and the SHPO concurred on May 25, 2012.
The newly proposed pipeline route in Docket No. CP12-508-000 differs from the
originally proposed route at about six locations, totaling approximately 3.5 miles. In May 2012,
Tetra Tech conducted a cultural resources inventory of various segments along the newly
proposed pipeline route from approximately MP 3.0 to 5.0, MP 9.0 to 11.0, MP 18.1 to 18.3, and
MP 22.9 to 23.3;the location of the newly proposed Taft Compressor Station;and four
alternative locations for the Sinton Compressor Station. No cultural resources were recorded.
Tetra Tech conveyed the report to the SHPO on August 8, 2012, who accepted it and agreed with
the recommendations in a letter dated August 15, 2012.
The only segment of the newly proposed pipeline route that was not surveyed by PBS&J
in 2004 or by Tetra Tech in 2012 was from MP 0.0 to 0.5. However, this segment is within the
tract proposed for the La Quinta Trade Gateway Terminal.
On June 20, 2012, Tetra Tech wrote a letter to the SHPO requesting permission not to
conduct archaeological surveys at the proposed temporary construction laydown area within the
proposed La Quinta Trade Gateway Terminal tract, a temporary construction worker parking
area within the industrial area associated with the Sherwin aluminum plant, and the proposed
Sinton Compressor Station at approximately MP 22.5 on the proposed pipeline route. Reasoning
for this request was either because these areas were previously surveyed, were previously
disturbed, or have a low potential to contain cultural resources. The SHPO concurred on July 3,
2012, that no historic properties would be affected within those areas, and the Proj
ect could
proceed as planned.
4.10.3

Unanticipated Discoveries

On August 7, 2012, Tetra Tech submitted an updated Plan and Procedures for
Addressing Unanticipated Discoveries of Cultural Resources and Human Remains. Cheniere
also filed a copy of this plan with its application to the FERC. The SHPO concurred that this
plan was acceptable on August 15, 2012, and we agree.
4.10.4

Compliance with NHPA

No traditional cultural resources, burials, or sites of religious significance to Indian tribes
were identified in the APE by the National Park Service, BIA, SHPO, Cheniere, Tetra Tech, or
the Indian tribes contacted by the FERC. We agree with the SHPO that no historic properties
would be affected in areas that have been inventoried. The only segment that was not
documented by Cheniere as covered by a cultural resources survey was the newly proposed
pipeline route approximately between MP 0.0 and 0.5.

To ensure our responsibilities under Section 106 of the NHPA and its implementing
regulations are met, we recommend:
 Cheniere should not begin construction of facilities and use of all staging,storage,
and temporaryworkareas,and new or to-be-improved access roads,until:
a. Cheniere files with the Secretary:
1. any additional inventory reports,including documentation of survey of the
proposed pipeline route between about MP 0.0 and 0.5;
2. anyrequired evaluation reports,and anynecessarytreatment plans;and
3. comments on the reports and plans from the Texas SHPO.
b. the ACHP is afforded an opportunity to comment if any historic properties
would be adverselyaffected;and
c. the FERC staff reviews,and the Director of the Office of EnergyProjects (OEP)
approves,all cultural resources reports,documentation,and plans and notifies
Cheniere in writing that it mayproceed with treatment or construction.
All materials filed with the Commission containing location, character, and

AIR QUALITY AND NOISE

4.11.1

Air Quality

Air quality would be affected by construction and operation of the Proj
ect. Though air
emissions would be generated by operation of equipment during construction of the Proj
ect
facilities, most air emissions associated with the Proj
ect would result from the long-term
operation of the Terminal and compressor stations. This section of the EIS addresses the
construction- and operation-based emissions from the Proj
ect, as well as proj
ected impacts to air
quality and applicable regulatory requirements.
4.11.1.1

Regional Climate

The Proj
ect area climate (humid subtropical)is significantly influenced by its location in
the Texas Coastal Zone (i.e., proximity to the Gulf of Mexico). In general, Corpus Christi has
very short mild winters and long hot summers, although the sea breeze can help moderate peak
temperatures. Climate data obtained from NOAA for the period 1981 to 2010 show that daily
average high temperatures range from 67°F during January to 94°F during August. Daily
average low temperatures range from 47°F during January to 75°F during August. The record
minimum and maximum temperatures are 11°F and 109°F, respectively. The annual average
precipitation amounts to approximately 32 inches, with a monthly maximum of 5 inches in
September. At least a trace of precipitation occurs on 77 days during the year, on average
(NOAA, 2013a).
Two principal wind patterns dominate the Texas Coastal Zone: frequent, strong
southeasterly winds (essentially at any time of the year, but most pronounced in the spring
through mid-summer)and north-northeasterly winds associated with cold fronts from October
Environmental Impact Statement

4-92

Corpus Christi LNG

through March. The prevailing wind for the region is from the southeast and has an annual
average velocity of 12 mph (NOAA, 2013b). The prevailing southeast wind is further
strengthened by the thermal winds which develop when the air over the heated land in west
Texas is warmer than the air over the relatively cooler waters of the Gulf of Mexico. This effect
is most pronounced in the spring and summer (Corpus Christi Windsurfing Association, 2013).
4.11.1.2

Existing Air Quality

Ambient Air Quality Standards
The EPA has established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)for six
pollutants: SO2, CO, ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM)including PM
less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10)and PM less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), and
lead. There are two classifications of NAAQS, primary and secondary standards. Primary
standards set limits the EPA believes are necessary to protect human health including sensitive
populations such as children, the elderly, and asthmatics. Secondary standards are set to protect
public welfare from detriments such as reduced visibility and damage to crops, vegetation,
animals, and buildings.
Individual state air quality standards cannot be less stringent than the NAAQS. The
federal NAAQS for criteria pollutants are the same as the state standards established by the
TCEQ in accordance with Section 30 of the TAC, Rule §101.21. The TCEQ has also established
30-minute average property line standards for SO2 and H2S in 30 TAC §112. The federal
NAAQS and Texas-specific standards (referenced as net ground-level concentrations) are
summarized in table 4.11-1.

GHGs occur in the atmosphere both naturally and as a result of human activities, such as
the burning of fossil fuels. These gases are the integral components of the atmosphere’s
greenhouse effect that warms the earth’s surface and moderates day/night temperature variation.
In general, the most abundant GHGs are water vapor, CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),
and O3. On December 7, 2009, the EPA defined air pollution to include the mix of six long-lived
Environmental Impact Statement

4-94

Corpus Christi LNG

and directly-emitted GHGs, finding that the presence of the following GHGs in the atmosphere
may endanger public health and welfare through climate change:
CO2, CH4, N2O,
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
As with any fossil fuel-fired proj
ect or activity, the Proj
ect would contribute GHG
emissions. The principle GHGs that would be produced by the Proj
ect are CO2, CH4, and N2O.
Emissions of GHGs are quantified and regulated in units of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e).
The CO2e unit of measure takes into account the global warming potential (GWP)of each GHG.
The GWP is a ratio relative to CO2 that is based on the particular GHG’s ability to absorb solar
radiation as well its residence time within the atmosphere. Thus, CO2 has a GWP of 1, CH4 has
a GWP of 25, and N2O has a GWP of 29821. To obtain the CO2e quantity, the mass of the
particular compound is multiplied by the corresponding GWP, the product of which is the CO2 e
for that compound. The CO2e value for each of the GHG compounds is summed to obtain the
total CO2e GHG emissions.
Air Quality Control Regions and Attainment Status
Air Quality Control Regions (AQCRs)are areas established for air quality planning
purposes in which implementation plans describe how ambient air quality standards will be
achieved and maintained. AQCRs were established by the EPA and local agencies, in
accordance with Section 107 of the CAA and its amendments, as a means to implement the CAA
and comply with the NAAQS through SIPs. The AQCRs are intrastate and interstate regions
such as large metropolitan areas where the improvement of the air quality in one portion of the
AQCR requires emission reductions throughout the AQCR. The entire Proj
ect area (including
the Terminal and Pipeline)is located in the Corpus Christi-Victoria Intrastate AQCR. Likewise,
ship transit would impact the same AQCR.
An AQCR, or portion thereof, is designated based on compliance with the NAAQS.
AQCR designations fall under three general categories as follows: attainment (areas in
compliance with the NAAQS);nonattainment (areas not in compliance with the NAAQS);or
unclassifiable. AQCRs that were previously designated nonattainment, but have since met the
requirements to be classified as attainment are classified as maintenance areas. The Corpus
Christi-Victoria Intrastate AQCR is designated as unclassifiable and/or attainment for all criteria
pollutants.
Air Quality Monitoring and Existing Air Quality
Air quality monitors are located throughout the state to determine existing levels of
various air pollutants. Air quality monitoring data obtained from the EPA AirData and the
TCEQ Air Quality Data databases for the period 2009-2011 were reviewed by Cheniere to
characterize ambient air quality for regulated criteria pollutants in the vicinity of the Proj
ect area.
The assessment included the following pollutants: O3, CO, NO2, PM2.5, PM10, and SO2. Data for
the three-year period from representative Proj
ect area monitors are summarized in table 4.11-2.
This table shows representative concentrations for the 3-year period and/or short-term averaging
periods.
21

On November 29, 2013, EPA revised the GWPs as part of amendments made to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting
Rule (78 FR 71904). When Resource Report No. 9was prepared by Cheniere, the EPA-stated GWPs for CO2, CH4,
and N2O were 1, 21, and 310, respectively. Because the GHG emissions for the Proj
ect are primarily CO2,
associated CO2e emissions will not change significantly as a result of EPA’s revisions.

A review of the 2012 ambient monitoring data in the TCEQ Air Quality Data database
(TCEQ, 2013)shows that, except for PM2.5 (annual average), the measured concentrations for all
pollutants for the various averaging periods are either at or below the values shown in
table 4.11-2. For PM2.5, the annual average concentration for 2012 was 9.6 µg/m3, which was
slightly higher than the annual average concentration (for 2009and 2010)shown in table 4.11-2.
4.11.1.3 RegulatoryRequirements for Air Quality
The Proj
ect would be potentially subj
ect to a variety of federal and state regulations
pertaining to the construction or operation of air emission sources. The TCEQ has the primary
j
urisdiction over air emissions produced by stationary sources associated with the Proj
ect. The
TCEQ is delegated by the EPA to implement Federal air programs, with the exception of issuing
permits for GHG emissions. However, on February 18, 2014, EPA issued a proposed
rulemaking approving Texas' GHG permitting program. In anticipation of a final rulemaking,
EPA has offered applicants who are currently in the permitting process with EPA the choice of
continuing the permitting process with EPA, or moving their applications to the TCEQ. For
those applicants who transition to the TCEQ, the process will restart with a new public notice
period. Although Texas' GHG permitting program is not finalized, TCEQ has begun accepting
Environmental Impact Statement

4-96

Corpus Christi LNG

applications. If a final rulemaking fails to occur, applicants would have the opportunity to return
back to EPA for federal permitting at the point in the application process where EPA left off.
The following sections summarize the applicability of various state and federal regulations.
Federal Air Quality Requirements
The CAA, 42 USC 7401 et seq., as amended in 1977 and 1990, and 40 CFR Parts 50
through 99are the basic federal statutes and regulations governing air pollution in the U.S. The
following federal requirements have been reviewed for applicability to the Proj
ect.








New Source Review (NSR)/ Prevention of Significant Deterioration;
Title V Operating Permits;
New Source Performance Standards (NSPS);
National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP);
Greenhouse Gas Reporting;
Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions;and
General Conformity.

New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration
Separate preconstruction review procedures for maj
or new sources of air pollution (and
maj
or modifications of maj
or sources)have been established for proj
ects that are proposed to be
built in attainment areas versus nonattainment areas. The preconstruction permit program for
new or modified maj
or sources located in attainment areas is called PSD. This review process is
intended to keep new air emission sources from causing existing air quality to deteriorate beyond
acceptable levels codified in the federal regulations. Construction of maj
or new stationary
sources in nonattainment areas must be reviewed in accordance with the nonattainment NSR
regulations, which contain stricter thresholds and requirements. Because all of the stationary
emission sources at the Proj
ect facilities (the Terminal, the Sinton Compressor Station, and the
Taft Compressor Station)are all located within an attainment area, nonattainment NSR does not
apply. Rather, each facility must be reviewed to determine applicability with the PSD program.
The PSD rule defines a maj
or stationary source as any source with a potential to emit
(PTE)100 tons per year (tpy)or more of any criteria pollutant for source categories listed in
40 CFR §52.21(b)(1)(i)or 250 tpy or more of any criteria pollutant for source categories that are
not listed. In addition, with respect to GHG, the maj
or source threshold CO2e is 100,000 tpy. If
a new source is determined to be a maj
or source for any PSD pollutant, then other remaining
criteria pollutants would be subj
ect to PSD review if those pollutants are emitted at rates that
exceed significant emission thresholds (100 tpy for CO;40 tpy for nitrogen oxides [NOx], VOC,
and SO2 each;25 tpy for total suspended particulate, 15 tpy for PM10, and 10 tpy for [direct]
PM2.5). Sources which exceed the maj
or source threshold are then subj
ect to a PSD review.
The three facilities associated with the Proj
ect are all evaluated separately for purposes of
PSD applicability. As shown in table 4.11-7, the Terminal is subj
ect to PSD review for NOx,
VOC, CO, PM10, PM2.5, and CO2e. As shown in table 4.11-13, the Sinton Compressor Station is
subj
ect to PSD review for NOx, CO, PM10, PM2.5, and CO2e. The Taft Compressor Station is not
subj
ect to PSD review.
The PSD GHG Tailoring Rule intends to account for facilities that represent an estimated
70 percent of GHG emissions. This rule applies to all industrial sources that are maj
or sources of
Environmental Impact Statement

4-97

Corpus Christi LNG

any NSR-regulated pollutant other than GHGs and emit or have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy
or more of CO2e.
Maj
or new stationary sources applying for a PSD construction permit must include a Best
Available Control Technology (BACT)analysis and a detailed air quality impacts analysis in its
permit application. As part of the air quality impacts analysis, the applicant must demonstrate
that the proposed facilities would comply with applicable NAAQS.
One additional factor considered in the PSD permit review process is the potential
impacts on protected Class I areas. Class I areas were designated specifically as pristine natural
areas or areas of natural significance and have the lowest increment of permissible deterioration,
which precludes development near these areas. Class I areas are given special protection under
the PSD program. However, as described in section 4.11.1.4, because of the distance to the
nearest Class I area, and the quantity of emissions predicted from the Proj
ect, a Class I analysis
is not required for the Proj
ect.
The TCEQ issued a draft PSD permit for the Terminal's criteria pollutants on July 8,
2013. The TCEQ issued a final PSD permit for the Sinton Compressor Station's criteria
pollutants on December 20, 2013. The Terminal and Sinton Compressor Station began GHG
permitting with the EPA prior to the February 18, 2014 rulemaking. The EPA issued a draft
GHG permit for the Sinton Compressor Station on February 6, 2014, and the Terminal on
February 27, 2014. On April 14, 2014, Cheniere notified EPA and TCEQ that it was selecting
TCEQ as its GHG permitting authority for the Terminal and would be transitioning its GHG
permit application. Cheniere also filed additional information indicating that it made no changes
to the Terminal or BACT analysis upon submission to the TCEQ.
Title V Operating Permits
Title V of the CAA requires states to establish an air quality operating permit program.
The requirements of Title V are outlined in the federal regulations in 40 CFR Part 70 and in
30 TAC §122. The operating permits required by these regulations are often referred to as
Title V or Part 70 permits.
Maj
or sources (i.e., sources with a PTE greater than a maj
or source threshold level)are
required to obtain a Title V operating permit. Title V maj
or source threshold levels are 100 tpy
for CO, SO2, PM10, or PM2.5, 10 tpy for an individual hazardous air pollutant (HAP), or 25 tpy
for any combination of HAPs. The recent Title V GHG Tailoring Rule also requires facilities
that have the potential to emit GHGs at a threshold level of 100,000 tpy CO2e be subj
ect to Title
V permitting requirements.
Both the Terminal and Sinton Compressor Station would be subj
ect to the Title V
program. The Terminal exceeds the maj
or source thresholds for NOx, CO, VOC, HAPs and
GHGs. For the Sinton Compressor Station, emissions of NOx, CO and GHGs are greater than
the maj
or source thresholds. Therefore, the Terminal and Sinton Compressor Station would need
to apply for and obtain Title V operating permits. The Taft Compressor Station does not qualify
as a maj
or source under Part 70.
Cheniere submitted Title V operating permit applications for the Terminal and Sinton
Compressor Station to the TCEQ in November 2012, which are still under review.

New Source Performance Standards
NSPS regulations (40 CFR Part 60)establish pollutant emission limits and monitoring,
reporting, and recordkeeping requirements for various emission sources based on source type
and size. These regulations apply to new, modified, or reconstructed sources. The following
NSPS requirements were identified as potentially applicable to the specified sources at the
Terminal and Sinton and Taft compressor stations.
Subpart KKKK of 40 CFR Part 60, Standards of Performance for Stationary Combustion
Turbines, applies to stationary combustion turbines that are modified, constructed, or
reconstructed after February 18, 2005 and have maximum heat input rates greater than 10
MMBtu per hour. Turbines subj
ect to this subpart are exempt from 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart GG
emission standards for turbines. Subpart KKKK applies to the 18 natural gas-fuel turbines used
to drive refrigeration compressors at the Terminal. Subpart KKKK also applies to the two
natural gas-fired turbines at both the Sinton Compressor Station and the Taft Compressor
Station, which are used to compress natural gas for onward transport through the pipeline.
Subpart KKKK regulates emissions of SO2 and NOx. One method of complying with the SO2
emission limit is to not burn any fuel in the turbine which contains total potential sulfur
emissions in excess of 26 nanograms (ng)SO2 per j
oule (/J)(0.060 pounds [lb]SO2 /MMBtu)
heat input. The turbines would be fueled by natural gas or boil-off gas and therefore would
comply with the fuel sulfur content requirement. Based on the size of the turbines, NOx
emissions must be limited to 25 ppm by volume at 15 percent oxygen (O2)or 1.2 lb per
megawatt-hour (lb/MWh). Refrigeration turbines located at the Terminal would utilize water
inj
ection for NOx emission control. The turbines located at the compressor stations would not
employ water or steam inj
ection to control NOx emission, and therefore annual performance
testing would be conducted to demonstrate continuous compliance. As an alternative to
performance testing, continuous parameter monitoring for each turbine may be conducted to
demonstrate that the units are operating in low-NOx mode.
Subpart Kb of 40 CFR Part 60, Standards of Performance for Volatile Organic Liquid
Storage Vessels, applies to storage vessels containing volatile organic liquids. Regulatory
applicability is dependent on the construction date, size, vapor pressure, and contents of the
storage vessel. Subpart Kb applies to new tanks, unless otherwise exempted, that have a storage
capacity between 75 m3 (19,813 gallons)and 151 m3 (39,890 gallons)and contain VOCs with a
maximum true vapor pressure greater than or equal to 15.0 kilopascals (kPa). Subpart Kb also
applies to tanks that have a storage capacity greater than or equal to 151 m3 and contain VOCs
with a maximum true vapor pressure greater than or equal to 3.5 kPa. Pressure tanks are exempt
from the requirements of Subpart Kb.
There are storage tanks for propane and ethylene refrigerants located at the Terminal;
however, these storage tanks are exempt because they qualify as pressure vessels designed to
operate in excess of 204.9kPa and without emissions to the atmosphere. The three LNG storage
tanks would have a capacity of 160,000 m3, which would meet the volume criteria for Subpart
Kb. The LNG is considered a volatile organic liquid because a small portion of the LNG would
consist of VOCs. The LNG storage tank would operate at approximately -260°F and the true
vapor pressure of the VOC (assumed to be propane)at this temperature is 0.0007 kPa. This
would be well below the applicability threshold of 3.5 kPa;therefore, Subpart Kb would not
apply to the LNG storage tanks. There is one condensate storage tank at the Terminal that stores
VOCs and has a capacity greater than 75 m3. However, this tank is subj
ect to the requirements
Environmental Impact Statement

4-99

Corpus Christi LNG

of 40 CFR Part 63, Subpart EEEE and therefore is not subj
ect to Subpart Kb. Additionally, there
are eight diesel fixed-roof storage tanks and one gasoline fixed-roof storage tank located at the
Terminal. The tanks each have a capacity less than 75 m3, and therefore are exempt from
Subpart Kb based on size. Both the Sinton and Taft compressor stations have condensate tanks
with volumes less than 75 m3, thus exempting the tanks from Subpart Kb.
Subpart JJJJ of 40 CFR Part 60, Standards of Performance for Stationary Spark Ignition
Internal Combustion Engines, applies to spark ignition engines with a maximum engine power
greater than 25 hp for which construction commenced by July 12, 2006 and was manufactured
after January 1, 2009. The 1,328-brake-hp natural gas-fired generator at the Sinton Compressor
Station and the 838-brake-hp natural gas-fired generator at the Taft Compressor Station, to be
used for standby electricity generation to power the facilities, meet these applicability criteria
and are therefore subj
ect to the requirements of Subpart JJJJ. In order to demonstrate
compliance with the emission limits found in the rule, owners and operators may either operate a
manufacturer-certified engine according to manufacturer’s operation and maintenance
procedures or conduct performance testing. Owners/operators of emergency engines are
required to keep records of their hours of operation. Additionally, maintenance records must be
kept for all engines.
Subpart IIII of 40 CFR Part 60, Standards of Performance for Stationary Compression
Ignition Internal Combustion Engines, applies to diesel-fueled stationary compression ignition
internal combustion engines of any size that are constructed, modified, or reconstructed after
July 11, 2005. The rule requires manufacturers of these engines to meet emission standards
based on engine size, model year, and end use. The rule also requires owners and operators to
configure, operate, and maintain the engines according to specifications and instructions
provided by the engine manufacturer. These requirements of Subpart IIII would apply to the
three 422-brake-hp diesel-fired fire water pump engines and the four 2,220-brake-hp diesel-fired
standby generators located at the Terminal. The recordkeeping and reporting requirements
would also apply.
Subpart OOOO of 40 CFR Part 60, Standards of Performance for Crude Oil and Natural
Gas Production, Transmissions and Distributions, applies in part to compressors that are located
between the wellhead and point of custody transfer. The Sinton and Taft compressor stations are
not located between the wellhead and the point of custody transfer and therefore are not subj
ect
to Subpart OOOO.
National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants
The NESHAP codified in 40 CFR Parts 61 and 63, regulate HAP emissions. Part 61 was
promulgated prior to the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA)and regulates specific HAPs,
such as asbestos, benzene, beryllium, coke oven emissions, inorganic arsenic, mercury,
radionuclides, and vinyl chloride.
The 1990 CAAA established a list of 189 HAPs, while directing EPA to publish
categories of maj
or sources and area sources of these HAPs, for which emission standards were
to be promulgated according to a schedule outlined in the CAAA. These standards, also known
as the Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT)standards, were promulgated under
Part 63. The 1990 CAAA defines a maj
or source of HAPs as any source that has a PTE of
10 tpy for any single HAP or 25 tpy for all HAPs in aggregate. Area sources are stationary

Environmental Impact Statement

4-100

Corpus Christi LNG

sources that do not exceed the thresholds for maj
or source designation. Federal NESHAP
requirements are incorporated by reference in 30 TAC §113.55 and §113.00.
The annual PTE HAP emissions from the Terminal would be 24.2 tpy in aggregate and
16 tpy for formaldehyde (the individual HAP with the greatest PTE)(see section 4.11.1.4);
therefore, the Terminal would be a maj
or source of HAPs. Although an LNG storage and
process facility is not one of the source categories regulated under Part 63, NESHAP/MACT
standards could still apply for specific types of sources (i.e., stationary combustion turbines)that
support facility operations. The annual PTE all-HAP emissions from the Sinton Compressor
Station and Taft Compressor Station are 4.1 tpy and 1.5 tpy, respectively (see section 4.11.1.4);
therefore, each station is classified as an area source of HAPs. The NESHAP described in the
following paragraphs have been identified as being potentially applicable to specific sources at
the Terminal and Sinton and Taft Compressor Stations.
Subpart Y of 40 CFR Part 63, National Emission Standards for Marine Tank Vessel
Loading Operations, applies to marine vessel loading operations at facilities that are considered
maj
or sources of HAPs. Because the marine tank vessel loading operations at the Terminal
would occur at loading berths that only transfer liquids containing organic HAPs as impurities,
as that term is defined in 40 CFR §63.561, the Terminal is exempt from Subpart Y [40 CFR
§63.560(d)(5)].
Subpart EEEE of 40 CFR Part 63, NESHAP for Organic Liquids Distribution (NonGasoline), applies to owners and operators of organic liquid distribution operations located at a
maj
or source of HAP emissions. The condensate storage tank and condensate loading operation
at the Terminal are subj
ect to the requirements of this rule. The Terminal would need to comply
with the operating limitations, requirements for initial compliance demonstrations, and other
applicable requirements under Subpart EEEE.
Subpart YYYY of 40 CFR Part 63, NESHAP for Stationary Combustion Turbines,
applies to owners and operators of stationary combustion turbines located at a maj
or source of
HAP emissions. The GE LM2500+G4 combustion turbines at the Terminal meet the definition
of a lean premix gas-fired stationary combustion turbine as defined under this subpart, and
therefore would potentially be subj
ect to an emission limitation for formaldehyde of 91 parts per
billion (ppb)by volume, at 15 percent O2. The Terminal is a maj
or source of HAPs and would
be required to comply with the operating limitations, requirements for performance test and
initial compliance demonstrations, and reporting requirements under Subpart YYYY.
Subpart CCCCCC of 40 CFR Part 63, NESHAP for Gasoline Dispensing Facilities,
applies to the loading of gasoline storage tanks at an area source of HAP emissions. The
Terminal is a maj
or source of HAPs;therefore, Subpart CCCCCC would not apply to the loading
of the gasoline storage tank at the Terminal. The Sinton and Taft Compressor Stations would not
be equipped with gasoline storage tanks.
Subpart ZZZZ of 40 CFR Part 63, NESHAP for Stationary Reciprocating Internal
Combustion Engines, applies to reciprocating internal combustion engines of all sizes located at
maj
or and area sources of HAPs. The Terminal is a maj
or source of HAPs and would have four
diesel-fired standby generators each rated at 2,220 brake-hp;therefore, these generators (each of
which would operate less than 100 hours per year)are subj
ect only to the initial notification
requirement of Subpart ZZZZ. As discussed previously, the three 422-brake-hp diesel-fired fire
water pumps at the Terminal would be required to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR Part
Environmental Impact Statement

4-101

Corpus Christi LNG

60, Subpart IIII. These engines satisfy the requirements of Subpart ZZZZ by meeting the
requirements of 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart IIII, per 40 CFR §63.6590(c)(6).
The Sinton and Taft compressor stations are classified as area sources of HAPs. The
standby generators at these facilities are considered a new emergency reciprocating internal
combustion engine at an area source and, as discussed previously, would be required to comply
with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 60 Subpart JJJJ. These engines satisfy the requirements of
Subpart ZZZZ by meeting the requirements of 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart JJJJ, per 40 CFR
§63.6590(c)(1).
Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule
Subpart W under 40 CFR Part 98, the Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule,
requires petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2e per
year to report annual emissions of GHG to the EPA. “LNG storage”and “LNG import and
export equipment”’are industry segments specially included in the source category definition of
petroleum and natural gas systems. Equipment subj
ect to reporting includes storage of LNG,
regasification of LNG and liquefaction of natural gas.
Emissions of GHGs associated with the construction and operation of the Proj
ect,
including all direct and indirect emission sources were calculated. In addition, GHG emissions
were converted to total CO2e emissions based on the GWP of each pollutant. The reporting rule
does not apply to construction emissions;however, we have included the construction emissions
for accounting and disclosure purposes. GHG emissions from operation of the Terminal, the
Sinton Compressor Station and the Taft Compressor Station are each anticipated to exceed the
25,000 metric ton threshold and therefore may be subj
ect to the reporting rule. If actual GHG
emissions from the Terminal or compressor stations are equal to or greater than the reporting
threshold, Cheniere would need to comply with all applicable requirements of 40 CFR Part 98.
Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions
The chemical accident prevention provisions, codified in 40 CFR Part 68, are federal
regulations designed to prevent the release of hazardous materials in the event of an accident and
minimize potential impacts if a release does occur. The regulations contain a list of substances
(including methane, propane, and ethylene)and threshold quantities for determining applicability
to stationary sources. If a stationary source stores, handles, or processes one or more substances
on this list in a quantity equal to or greater than specified in the regulation, the facility must
prepare and submit a risk management plan. A risk management plan is not required to be
submitted to the EPA until the chemicals are stored onsite at the facility.
If a facility does not have a listed substance on-site, or the quantity of a listed substance is
below the applicability threshold, the facility does not have to prepare an RMP. However, if
there is any regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance onsite, the facility still
must comply with the requirements of the General Duty Clause in Section 112(r)(1)of the 1990
CAAA. The General Duty Clause is as follows:
“The owners and operators of stationary sources producing, processing, handling
and storing such substances have a general duty to identify hazards which may result from
such releases using appropriate hazard assessment techniques, to design and maintain a
safe facility, taking such steps as are necessary to prevent releases, and to minimize the
consequences of accidental releases which do occur.”
Environmental Impact Statement

4-102

Corpus Christi LNG

Stationary sources are defined in 40 CFR Part 68 as any buildings, structures, equipment,
installations, or substance-emitting stationary activities which belong to the same industrial
group, that are located on one or more contiguous properties, are under control of the same
person (or persons under common control), and are from which an accidental release may occur.
The Terminal would store about 514,037,299pounds of methane as LNG, 1,956,793 pounds of
propane, and 1,007,181 pounds of ethylene on site. However, the definition also states that the
term stationary source does not apply to transportation, including storage incidental to
transportation, of any regulated substance or any other extremely hazardous substance. The term
transportation includes transportation subj
ect to oversight or regulation under 49CFR Parts 192,
193, or 195. Based on these definitions, the Terminal, which is subj
ect to 49 CFR Part 193,
would not be required to prepare an risk management plan. We have included an analysis of the
proposed design’s compliance with Part 193, including overpressure modeling, in section 4.12 of
this EIS.
General Conformity
A conformity analysis must be conducted by the lead federal agency if a federal action
would result in the generation of emissions that would exceed the conformity threshold levels (de
minimis) of the pollutants(s) for which an AQCR is in nonattainment. According to
Section 176(c)(1)of the CAA (40 CFR §51.853), a federal agency cannot approve or support any
activity that does not conform to an approved SIP. Conforming activities or actions should not,
through additional air pollutant emissions:
 Cause or contribute to new violations of the NAAQS in any area;
 Increase the frequency or severity of an existing violation of any NAAQS;or
 Delay timely attainment of any NAAQS or interim emission reductions.
General Conformity assessments must be completed when the total direct and indirect
emissions of a planned proj
ect would equal or exceed the specified pollutant conformity
emission thresholds per year in each nonattainment area.
A General Conformity Determination must show that the emissions would conform to the
applicable SIP and would not degrade air quality in the nonattainment area. This can be
demonstrated through acquisition of emission offsets, SIP revisions, or dispersion modeling.
On-site mitigation of emissions, (i.e., controls above and beyond what is required by regulation),
can also be used to demonstrate conformity. According to 40 CFR §51.853, emissions from
sources subj
ect to NSR or PSD requirements are exempt and are deemed to have conformed.
As discussed in a previous section of this report, the Proj
ect facilities (Terminal and
Sinton and Taft Compressor Stations)are located in an area currently designated by EPA as
better than national standards or unclassifiable or in attainment for all criteria pollutants.
Operating emissions for these facilities would be located entirely within designated
unclassifiable/attainment areas for all criteria air pollutants and would be subj
ect to evaluation
under the PSD permitting program;therefore, these emissions are not subj
ect to General
Conformity regulations. However, during the construction phase of the Proj
ect, barges carrying
equipment and materials would travel periodically from the Port of Houston to the Proj
ect
construction dock via the GIWW during the 2014 to 2017 period. Specifically, one barge in
2014 and approximately six barges per year in 2015, 2016, and 2017 would travel from the Port
of Houston to the construction dock. The Port of Houston is located in the Houston-GalvestonBrazoria (HGB)“severe”ozone nonattainment area (1997 8-hr NAAQS);therefore, each barge
Environmental Impact Statement

Corpus Christi LNG

would spend part of its trip within the HGB ozone nonattainment area. The construction barge
traffic emissions associated with travel in the HGB ozone nonattainment area would be subj
ect to
evaluation under General Conformity regulations.
The relevant general conformity pollutant thresholds for the HGB ozone nonattainment
area are 25 tpy of NOx and VOC (ozone precursors)for the portions of the Proj
ect located in the
nonattainment area.
Cheniere estimated emissions from tug vessels that push the barges using the
methodology and emission factors described in EPA’s Current Methodologies in Preparing
Mobile Source Port-Related Emission Inventories (ICF International, 2009). The emissions were
apportioned between the HGB ozone nonattainment area and the adj
acent
unclassifiable/attainment areas based on the emissions generated during the time spent traveling
through each of these areas.
Cheniere estimated that the total potential direct and indirect emissions of NOx and VOC
from the Proj
ect construction-related activity (i.e., construction barge travel in HGB ozone
nonattainment area)would be less than 25 tpy for each year of the construction period (2014 to
2017), as shown in table 4.11-3. Based on these emissions, a General Conformity Determination
is not required for the Proj
ect.

Applicable State Air Quality Requirements
In addition to the federal regulations identified above, the TCEQ has its own air quality
regulations, codified in 30 TAC. The state requirements potentially applicable to the Proj
ect are
discussed below.
 30 TAC Chapter 101, Subchapter A –General Rules. This chapter includes provisions
related to circumvention, nuisance, traffic hazards, sampling and sampling ports,
emissions inventory requirements, sampling procedures and terminology, compliance
with EPA standards, inspection and emission fees, and emission events and scheduled
maintenance, startup, and shutdown activities.
 30 TAC Chapter 111 –Control of Air Pollution from Visible Emissions and Particulate
Matter. This chapter outlines the allowable visible emission (i.e., opacity)requirements
and total suspended particulate emission limits based on calculated emission rates.
 30 TAC Chapter 112 –Control of Air Pollution from Sulfur Compounds. This chapter
outlines emission limits and monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements. This
chapter also lists net ground-level concentration standards at the property line for certain
sulfur compounds.

 30 TAC Chapter 113 – Control of Air Pollution from Toxic Materials. Chapter 113
incorporates by reference the NESHAP source categories (40 CFR Part 63).
 30 TAC Chapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles. This chapter
addresses inspection requirements and maintenance and operation of air pollution control
systems/devices for motor vehicles owned and/or operated at the Proj

chapter applies to use of construction- and operations-related vehicles.
 30 TAC Chapter 115 –Control of Air Pollution from Volatile Organic Compounds. This
chapter outlines applicable requirements for storage tanks, process vents, and loading
operations, including the standards and recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
 30 TAC Chapter 116, Subchapter B – Control of Air Pollution by Permits for New
Construction or Modification. This chapter outlines the permitting requirements for the
construction of new sources. Unlike the Terminal and Sinton Compressor Station, the
Taft Compressor Station construction and operation would be authorized by the TCEQ
Standard Permit for Installation and/or Modification of Oil and Gas Facilities, per 30
TAC §116.620. Cheniere intends to apply for the Standard Permit at a date closer in time
to the anticipated construction date for the Taft Compressor Station.
 30 TAC Chapter 118 – Control of Air Pollution Episodes. This chapter outlines the
requirements relating to generalized and localized air pollution episodes.
 30 TAC Chapter 122 – Federal Operating Permits. This chapter outlines the
requirements for complying with the Federal operating permits program.
4.11.1.4

Construction Emissions and Mitigation

Construction of the Terminal, Sinton and Taft Compressor Stations, and Pipeline
facilities would result in short-term increases in emissions of some air pollutants due to the use
of equipment powered by diesel fuel or gasoline engines and the generation of fugitive dust due
to the disturbance of soil and other dust-generating activities. More specifically, the construction
activities that would generate air emissions include:
 Site preparation (vegetation clearing, trenching, land contouring, foundation preparation,
etc.);
 Installation of Terminal equipment;
 Installation of compressor stations equipment;
 Installation of pipeline and pipeline interconnection equipment;
 Operation of off-road vehicles and trucks during construction;
 Operation of marine vessels (e.g., equipment barges)during construction;
 Offshore dredging;and
 Workers’vehicles used for commuting to and from the construction site (i.e., on-road
vehicles).
The total period of construction for the Terminal is estimated by Cheniere to be
60 months. The emission increases associated with the Proj
ect construction activities would
have short-term, localized impacts on air quality. These emissions are not subj
ect to the air
quality permitting requirements that apply to emissions from operation of stationary sources at
the Terminal and compressor stations. We note that there are no residential or sensitive
Environmental Impact Statement

Corpus Christi LNG

populations within 1 mile of the Terminal site. Nevertheless, the construction-related emission
rates are discussed in this section as a means of identifying potential air quality concerns
associated with the construction phase of the Proj
ect and to assist in developing mitigation.
The amount of fugitive dust for an area under construction would depend on numerous
factors including: degree of vehicular traffic;size of area disturbed, amount of exposed soil, soil
properties (silt and moisture content);and wind speed. Construction of the Proj
ect would also
result in fuel combustion emissions from a variety of sources, including off-road sources (e.g.,
bulldozers, cranes, front-end loaders, pile drivers), on-road sources (e.g., construction worker
vehicles), and marine vessels (e.g., tugs, barges).
Site preparation activities for the Terminal, compressor stations, and M&R stations
would include grading, cutting of drainage ditches, placement of gravel surfaces (e.g., lay-down
areas), and construction of access roads within the Proj
ect site boundaries. Site preparation
activities would generate fugitive dust from earthmoving and movement of construction
equipment over unpaved surfaces and tailpipe emissions from construction equipment and
vehicle engines. The construction equipment and vehicles would be powered by internal
combustion engines that would generate PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NOx, VOC, and CO emissions. Site
preparation equipment would include bulldozers, front-end loaders, backhoes, compactors,
scrapers, dump trucks, and other mobile construction equipment.
The construction of the Terminal would include installation of three liquefaction trains,
three LNG storage tanks, LNG vaporization and natural gas send-out facilities, LNG carrier
berths and LNG transfer lines, maj
or mechanical equipment, and piping and instrumentation, as
well as construction of foundations, pipe racks, miscellaneous storage tanks, and buildings. The
Terminal construction equipment would include cranes, forklifts, pile drivers, welders, concrete
pump trucks, and generators (for various duties, such as pumping, lighting, etc.), which would
result in fuel combustion and fugitive dust emissions.
The Proj
ect would include off-shore dredging of the LNG carrier berthing area at the
Terminal. The emissions generated by these activities would be predominantly combustion
emissions from the construction equipment and marine vessel engines. The construction
equipment would include a clam shell dredge, tugboats, survey/workboats, crew boats,
inspection vessels, and trucks.
Air emissions would also be generated during construction of the Pipeline. Pipeline site
preparation and construction activities would generate fugitive dust from clearing, trenching,
backfilling, grading, and traffic on paved and unpaved areas, as well as fuel combustion
emissions from the construction equipment. The internal combustion engines powering most of
the Pipeline construction equipment and vehicles would burn ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel and the
remaining vehicles would burn gasoline. Equipment that would be used for the Pipeline
construction activities would include various earthmoving equipment (bulldozers, backhoes,
trenchers, graders, and compactors), cranes, forklifts, compressors, pumps, trenchers, stringing
trucks, welding rigs, generators, and miscellaneous trucks.
The construction of the Sinton and Taft Compressor Stations would include installation
of two compressor turbines at each station, maj
or mechanical equipment, and piping and
instrumentation, as well as construction of foundations, miscellaneous storage tanks, and
buildings. The construction equipment would include cranes, forklifts, welders, pumps, and
generators, which would result in fuel combustion and fugitive dust emissions.
Environmental Impact Statement

4-106

Corpus Christi LNG

Site truck traffic (e.g., supply trucks)and worker commuter vehicles would generate
fugitive dust from travel on paved and unpaved surfaces as well as tailpipe emissions. The
Terminal construction would require an average of approximately 1,800 workers over a period of
approximately 60 months. The Pipeline construction would require approximately 300 workers
over a period of approximately nine months. Most of the commuter vehicles would likely burn
gasoline, although supply trucks and some worker pickup trucks would burn ultra-low-sulfur
diesel fuel.
Fuel combustion emissions from off-road construction equipment and on-road vehicles
(e.g., for commuter workers)were based on EPA emission factors. SO2 emissions would be
further mitigated by the use of ultra-low-sulfur diesel. In addition, vehicle emissions would be
minimized through compliance with 30 TAC Chapter 114 –Control of Air Pollution from Motor
Vehicles. Fugitive dust emissions generated by on-site construction equipment were based on
emission factors developed by the Western Regional Air Partnership (WRAP Fugitive Dust
Handbook). Fugitive dust emission estimates associated with construction activities for the
Proj
ect assume a dust suppressant control efficiency of 50 percent. The total criteria air pollutant
and GHG (as CO2e)emissions associated with construction-related activities for the Terminal are
summarized in table 4.11-4. The total criteria air pollutant and GHG (as CO2e)emissions
associated with construction-related activities for the Pipeline, compressor stations, and M&R
facilities are summarized in table 4.11-5. These totals include fuel combustion emissions as well
as fugitive PM emissions. For fuel combustion emissions from non-road and on-road engines,
nearly all emitted PM is assumed to be PM2.5.

As shown in table 4.11-4, the fugitive dust accounts for the maj
ority of PM emissions
during the construction period for the Terminal. Cheniere developed a Fugitive Dust Control
Plan (FDCP)to mitigate these emissions (see appendix D). Measures outlined in the FDCP
include the following:
 use of a dedicated water truck to apply water to heavily used unpaved areas, as needed;
 ensure that dump trucks and other open-bodied trucks hauling soil or other dusty
materials to or from the Proj
ect site are covered, as needed;
 use of signage to direct construction vehicle traffic to designated (paved or gravel)roads
when practical;and
 enforcing a 15-mph speed limit on unsurfaced roads.
We, and the EPA, have reviewed the FDCP and believe it does not adequately address
track-out onto paved roads. Therefore, we recommend that:
 Prior to construction,Cheniere should file a revised FDCP with the Secretary for
review and written approval from the Director of OEP. The revised FDCP should
include the following:
a. the use of gravel at construction entrance and exit locations;and
b. measures to clean paved roads upon mud or dirt trackout.
Emissions over the 60-month construction period would increase pollutant concentrations
in the vicinity of the Proj
ect;however, their effect on ambient air quality would vary with time
due to the construction schedule, the mobility of the sources, and the variety of emission sources.
Construction emissions associated with the Pipeline are considered temporary and would cease at
completion of construction. Construction emissions associated with the compressor stations are
considered temporary, but would transition to permanent operational-phase emissions.
Construction emissions at the Terminal would occur over a five-year period in one location;
therefore, the associated air quality impacts are considered short-term. In addition, following
construction, air quality would not revert back to previous conditions, but would transition to
operational-phase emissions after commissioning and initial start-up.

4.11.1.5 Operating Emissions and Mitigation
Operation of the Terminal would result in air emissions from stationary equipment (e.g.,
refrigerant compressor turbines, flares, oxidizers, and emergency generators)and mobile sources
(e.g., LNG carriers and tugs). Also, operation of the Sinton and Taft Compressor Stations would
result in air emissions from stationary equipment (e.g., gas compressor turbines and emergency
generators). Operational-phase emissions from a variety of sources/equipment would be
permanent. These various sources and associated criteria pollutant, GHG, and HAP emission
rates are discussed in detail in the following sections.
Terminal
As discussed earlier, in addition to liquefaction operations, the Terminal would be
equipped to receive LNG and conduct vaporization of stored LNG using two trains of AAV and
pumps, with send-out to customers through the Pipeline. The AAVs provide regasification of the
LNG without requiring combustion, eliminating associated air emissions. This section focuses
on the Terminal emission sources associated with the operating liquefaction process.
The Terminal would operate up to three natural gas liquefaction trains continuously.
Sources of air emissions associated with operation of the Terminal include:
 18 GE LM2500+G4 natural gas-fired combustion turbines or equivalent (43,013 hp each;
six per train);
 Seven diesel-fired engines for emergency use (four standby power generators and three
fire water pumps);
 Five flares (for control of vented organic compound emissions);
 Three thermal oxidizers (for control of acid gas emissions);
 Miscellaneous storage tanks (condensate, gasoline, amine, and distillate/no. 2 oil);
 Maneuvering and hoteling LNG carriers;and
 Fugitive VOC and GHG emission sources (e.g., valves, flanges, connectors, and marine
vessel offloading equipment).
Criteria pollutant emissions of NOx, VOC, CO, PM10, PM2.5, and SO2 would be generated
primarily by the fuel combustion sources at the Terminal. The main emission sources at the
Terminal, the 18 combustion turbines, would be fueled with boil-off (natural)gas.
Table 4.11-6 provides a summary of the estimated annual criteria air pollutant, GHG (as
CO2e), and HAP emission rates for operating stationary sources associated with the Terminal.
The annual emissions are based on continuous operation (8,760 hours per year), except for
standby generators and fire water pumps, which are based on no more than 27 and 52 hours per
year, respectively. As discussed above, the Terminal is a maj
or source under the PSD program
and a maj
or source of HAPs.

The TCEQ reviewed and approved Cheniere’s PSD BACT analysis for the Terminal,
including the refrigeration compressor turbines, internal combustion engines (standby
generators), flares, and thermal oxidizers. Methods for reducing emissions of NOx, CO, and
VOCs for each of these sources were evaluated based on technical feasibility. Cheniere would
reduce emissions of NOx from the refrigeration compressor turbines through use of waterinj
ection and good combustion practices;CO and VOC emissions would be controlled through
the use of good combustion practices. The limited-use standby generators/engines would utilize
good combustion practices and ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel to reduce emissions, especially PM
and SO2 emissions. Emissions from the flares and thermal oxidizers would be reduced through
good combustion practices. The resulting BACT-based emission rates are equal to or better than
any NSPS, NESHAP, and/or Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) emission
standards applicable to the Terminal emission sources.
Once constructed, the Terminal would undergo an initial start-up process before it could
be fully operational. This process would result in larger emissions than under normal operating
conditions and would last approximately one to two months. After initial startup, Cheniere plans
to continuously operate the liquefaction facility, thus limiting start-up/shutdown events to those
associated with periodic routine maintenance or the need to shut down due to equipment
malfunction. Table 4.11-8 summarizes the criteria pollutants, GHGs, and HAP emissions for
initial startup activities.

Outside of scheduled routine maintenance events, complete shutdown of the refrigeration
compressors is not anticipated. A routine maintenance shutdown of each LNG train would occur
every three years for turbine engine replacement, amine vessel inspection, and molecular sieve
replacement. The maintenance schedule would be staggered such that one of the three trains per
year would undergo the maintenance activities. When the refrigerant compressors are shut down
for these maintenance events, there would be no need to vent or flare the refrigerants stored in
the equipment;therefore, no additional emissions are anticipated. Higher turbine emissions
during start-up and shutdown are not expected during these infrequent maintenance events.
Flaring emissions would occur during the regularly scheduled maintenance event on an
LNG train. Shutdown of the LNG train would require depressurization of the acid gas removal
unit and dehydration unit. The encompassed feed gas within the system would be pressure
purged to the process flare stack (526,000 lb per 12-hour period). After the maintenance event,
the LNG train would be purged, with a total of approximately 18,343,000 lb of feed gas vented
to the process flare stack over a 72-hour period.
During operation of the Terminal, LNG carriers and supporting marine vessels, namely
tugboats and security vessels, would routinely generate air emissions. Cheniere assessed the
emissions associated with various potential LNG carrier operating scenarios, in terms of engine
duty and fuel type, in determining the highest emissions-generating scenario. All scenarios
assumed a main engine size rating of 30,000 kilowatt, based on available engine data on the
existing fleet of LNG carriers.
Air pollutant emissions from LNG carriers would occur along the entire route from the
open seas to the ships’berth. Air emissions generated during ship transit in offshore areas would
be temporary, transient, and occurring at distances allowing for considerable dispersion before
reaching any sensitive receptors. Therefore, air emissions from ship transit outside the point
where the pilot boards the vessel (which is within state territorial waters)would not be expected
to result in a significant impact on air quality.
Ship emissions are quantified along the entire length of the reduced speed zone (RSZ).
Cheniere’s emission calculations for the LNG carriers transiting through the RSZ are based on
the use of residual oil with a sulfur content of 2.7 percent in the ship’s main engine. This
calculation is conservative in that International Maritime Organization Marine Pollution
Environmental Impact Statement

4-112

Corpus Christi LNG

standards will require the use of oil with a maximum sulfur content of 0.10 percent, effective
January 1, 2015. Therefore, we re-calculated the RSZ emissions based on the use of oil with a
sulfur content of 0.10 percent to more accurately represent main engine emissions.
LNG carrier maneuvering for each LNG carrier call would take place within the security
zone over a four-hour time period (two hours arriving and two hours departing). Cheniere
assumed that three tugboats and one security vessel would be deployed for each ship call. While
the LNG carrier is docked and LNG is being loaded to the ship, emissions would be generated by
hoteling operations on the ship for a 20-hour period. Cheniere examined various on-board power
generating scenarios for the maneuvering and hoteling phase of LNG carrier calls at the
Terminal. Based on proj
ections for the type/class of LNG carriers calling at the Terminal in the
future, Cheniere selected a set of emission rates representative of the anticipated fleet profile.
Emissions may also be generated in the case of the potential future operating scenario whereby
LNG is being offloaded from a docked LNG carrier to the Terminal (i.e., LNG import
operations).
Table 4.11-9presents a summary of the estimated highest annual criteria air pollutant and
GHG (as CO2e)emissions associated with the operation of marine vessels within the security
zone at the Terminal. Marine vessel operations within the security zone would result in
emissions associated with maneuvering and hoteling LNG carriers, and could include emissions
from offloading operations on LNG carriers (under a potential future LNG import operating
scenario). Table 4.11-10 presents a summary of the estimated highest annual criteria air
pollutant and GHG (as CO2e)emissions associated with the operation of marine vessels outside
the security zone. Marine vessel operations outside the security zone would include LNG
carriers traversing the RSZ (i.e., the route between the security zone and pilot boarding zone).
These emissions, which are not subj
ect to review under the PSD program, are based on 300 LNG
carrier calls per year.

Pipeline Facilities: Sinton and Taft Compressor Stations
Sources of air emissions associated with operation of the Sinton and Taft Compressor
Stations would include:
 Combustion turbines for gas compression:
a. Sinton: two Solar Titan 130-2050S turbine/compressor units (20,794 hp each);
b. Taft: two Solar Centaur 50 turbine/compressor units (6,387 hp each);

4-114

Corpus Christi LNG

 Emergency generators for standby power (one generator at each station);
 Condensate storage and truck loading (one tank at each station);
 Fugitive VOC and GHG emission sources (e.g., valves, flanges, and connectors);and
 VOC and GHG emissions associated with limited blowdown events.
Criteria pollutant emissions of NOx, VOC, CO, PM10, PM2.5, and SO2 would be generated
primarily by the fuel (natural gas)combustion sources at the terminal. The main emission
sources at the compressor stations are the natural gas-fired combustion turbines.
Table 4.11-12 provides a summary of the estimated annual criteria air pollutant, GHG (as
CO2e), and HAP emissions for the Sinton and Taft Compressor Stations. For the combustion
turbines at each station, the annual emissions are based on continuous operation (i.e., 8,760 hours
per year). For the standby generators, annual emissions are based on operation of 100 and 500
hours per year for the Sinton and Taft Compressor Stations, respectively. As discussed in
section 4.11.1.3, the Sinton Compressor Station is a new maj
or source under the PSD program
and the Taft Compressor Station is not a maj
or source. Neither compressor station is a maj
or
source of HAP emissions. Fugitive emissions associated with the M&R Stations would be
negligible, and no air emissions would be directly generated by the Pipeline during normal
operation. Rare situations (e.g., Pipeline maintenance/inspections)may require blowing down a
segment of the Pipeline;the air pollutant emissions of concern for such limited events are VOC
and GHG. Emissions associated with “blow-down” events at the compressor stations are
included in the fugitive emissions category in table 4.11-12 and table 4.11-13.

The TCEQ reviewed and approved Cheniere’s PSD BACT analysis for the Sinton
Compressor Station, including the compressor turbines and the standby generator. Methods for
reducing emissions of NOx, CO, and VOCs for each of these sources were evaluated based on
technical feasibility. Cheniere would reduce emissions of NOx and CO from the compressor
turbines through use of dry low-NOx combustors and good combustion practices; VOC
emissions would be controlled through use of good combustion practices. The natural gas-fired,
limited-use standby generator would be equipped with a turbocharger and use good combustion
practices to reduce emissions. The resulting BACT-based emission rates are equal to or better
than any NSPS, NESHAP, and/or RACT emission standards applicable to the compressor station
emission sources.
Emissions from the Taft Compressor Station would be below PSD and Title V permitting
thresholds;therefore, the facility is classified as a minor source. As a result of triggering PSD
review, the air quality impacts that could occur during normal operation of the Sinton
Compressor Station are assessed below.
4.11.1.6

Operational Impact Assessment

To provide a more thorough evaluation of the potential impacts on air quality in the
vicinity of the Proj
ect, Cheniere conducted a quantitative assessment of air emissions from
operation of both the Terminal and the Sinton Compressor Station. The assessment included air
dispersion modeling to predict off-site (i.e., ambient)concentrations in the vicinity of the Proj
ect.
We considered five separate air quality impacts analyses in our review for the Terminal
and Sinton Compressor Station.
Air quality impact analyses for the Terminal include:
 Analysis 1: NAAQS modeling analysis, including associated marine activities;
 Analysis 2: PSD increment consumption and additional impacts analyses;

 Analysis 5: PSD permitting analyses.
Overall Modeling Methodology
With the exception of Analysis 3, all modeling was conducted using the American
Meteorological Society/EPA Regulatory Model. This model is the preferred guideline model for
predicting impacts from new and modified stationary sources. Analysis 3 was conducted using
the EPA-approved Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx). Data sets input
to these models include emission source parameter values (e.g., stack height and diameter, stack
exhaust temperature and gas flow, and pollutant emission rate), building/structure dimensions for
determining the effects of the buildings/structure on dispersion of emissions, receptor locations,
terrain elevation data, and meteorological data, as appropriate. Emission rates for stationary and
marine vessel sources are shown above. No receptors were placed within the facility fence line,
because these are not considered “ambient air”locations in accordance with modeling guidance.
Background concentrations and NAAQS were converted to units of µg/m3 to be consistent with
the model-predicted units of concentration.
Analysis 1: Terminal - NAAQS Modeling Analysis
Cheniere conducted a cumulative NAAQS analysis addressing emissions from the
Terminal, marine activities associated with Terminal (including LNG carrier maneuvering,
hoteling and unloading, tugboat maneuvering and standby, and security vessel standby), existing
off-site emission sources (e.g., TCEQ-provided inventory of industrial/commercial facilities),
and representative background concentrations.
For the emissions from marine vessel activities, Cheniere considered two representative
operating scenarios: 1)one LNG carrier hoteling and offloading while a tug is on standby within
the security zone;and 2)one LNG carrier hoteling and offloading, a second LNG carrier being
maneuvered by two tugs, a third tug on standby nearby, and one security vessel on standby
nearby, all within the security zone. For these operating scenarios, Cheniere examined three
different combustion fuel options for the main and auxiliary engines used for the maneuvering
and hoteling phases. One of these options included main engine operation on oil with a 0.1
percent sulfur content maximum. Cheniere established LNG carrier emission rates for modeling
based on the anticipated future LNG carrier fleet mix profile for the three options.
Cheniere initially modeled the Terminal alone (with the marine activities included)and
compared the maximum concentrations against the Significant Impact Levels (SILs), which are
defined as a de minimis impact level below which a source is presumed not to cause or contribute
to an exceedance of a NAAQS. Table 4.11-14 shows the SIL analysis modeling results,
demonstrating that only the 1-hr NO2 and SO2 and annual NO2 impacts would be greater than the
SILs. Therefore, a cumulative NAAQS analysis was conducted only for NO2 and SO2.

For the cumulative NAAQS analysis, the Terminal (including associated marine
activities)and other off-site sources were modeled. To account for additional sources not
explicitly modeled but that contribute to background pollutant levels in the vicinity of the
Terminal, monitoring data from TCEQ-approved representative monitoring sites also were added
to the modeling results prior to comparison to the NAAQS. The monitoring site for NO2 was the
Lake Jackson Monitor (EPA Monitor 48-039-1016), located in the southern part of Brazoria
County. The monitoring site for SO2 was in Corpus Christi, Texas (EPA Monitor 48-355-0032).

review of these results indicated that only one receptor, at another industrial site, is predicted to
have a concentration greater than the 1-hr NO2 NAAQS. A source culpability analysis
demonstrated that the Terminal’s contribution to this predicted industrial-site exceedance is
below the SIL;therefore, the Terminal would not cause or significantly contribute to this
exceedance.
Analysis 2: Terminal - PSD Increment Consumption and Additional Impacts Analyses
In addition to the cumulative NAAQS analysis discussed above, Cheniere submitted to
the TCEQ a PSD increment consumption analysis and an Additional Impacts Analysis to satisfy
PSD permitting requirements for the Terminal. The results of these analyses are provided below
to disclose further impacts associated with the Terminal.
PSD increment is the amount of pollution an area is allowed to increase. PSD increments
are intended to prevent the air quality in attainment areas from deteriorating to the level set by
the NAAQS. The PSD increment analysis is used to determine whether a proposed proj
ect
would cause or contribute to an exceedance of the allowable decrease in air quality in
conj
unction with other existing sources. Federal PSD guidelines specify allowable changes in air
pollutant concentrations due to industrial expansion in an area.
The PSD SIL modeling results submitted to the TCEQ showed that the predicted
maximum 1-hr and annual NO2 concentrations exceed the respective SILs. There is no 1-hr NO2
PSD increment;however, a comprehensive PSD increment analysis was required for annual NO2
emissions as part of the PSD permit application submitted to the TCEQ.
For the NO2 PSD increment consumption analysis, the analysis considered Terminal
sources as well as off-site emission sources. Off-site sources within an area defined by the
Radius of Influence (the maximum distance in kilometers at which a modeled concentration is
predicted to be above a SIL) plus 50 kilometers were included. Emission rates/release
parameters for the off-site sources were obtained from the TCEQ Point Source Database. The
modeled annual NO2 concentration of 9.88 µg/m3 is below the PSD increment of 25 µg/m3.
Cheniere also submitted to the TCEQ an Additional Impact Analysis as required by the
PSD regulations. For the growth analysis, no significant commercial, residential, or industrial
growth is expected as a result of construction/operation of the Terminal.
Secondary air quality standards are set under the CAA for the protection of public
welfare, including protection against decreased visibility and damage to animals and vegetation,
including crops. The NAAQS analysis demonstrated that the Terminal would comply with
applicable secondary NAAQS;therefore, any impacts on vegetation, animals, and other public
welfare concerns would not be significant.
In Texas, if a facility complies with visibility and opacity requirements specified in 30
TAC Chapter 111, no additional visibility impact analyses are required. Cheniere would comply
with visibility and opacity requirements specified in 30 TAC Chapter 111. Because the main
combustion units at the Terminal would use only natural gas as fuel, we do not anticipate
significant impacts to regional visibility.

Analysis 3: Terminal - Ozone Modeling
The TCEQ and FERC staff requested an assessment of the Terminal’s impact on local
ozone concentrations. Cheniere conducted this analysis using both the two-step screening
process established by the TCEQ as well as the refined photochemical model CAMx.
The two-step TCEQ screening process begins by first identifying a representative ozone
background concentration from a nearby ambient monitor. Step 2 of the screening procedure
involves calculating the ratio of annual VOC to NOx emissions. The results of this screening
process demonstrated that Cheniere’s emissions were considered ozone neutral, and therefore are
not expected to have a meaningful impact on local ozone levels.
Based on discussions with EPA and the TCEQ, Cheniere conducted refined modeling
using CAMx to further support the conclusion drawn from the two-step TCEQ screening
process. Unlike air quality analyses conducted for other criteria pollutants, there is not specific
guidance from EPA or the TCEQ concerning how to conduct ozone modeling. However, there is
precedent from recent permitting actions as to how to determine whether or not a permitting
action will have a meaningful impact on ozone levels.
The CAMx modeling was conducted for the May 31, 2006 through July 1, 2006 ozone
episode, because this episode has been used for local air quality planning. The use of CAMx and
this ozone episode was based on discussions with both EPA and the TCEQ. CAMx was run
using a “base case”scenario of emissions as well as an emissions scenario that included the
Proj
ect (added to the base case), thus allowing for a comparison of ozone levels before and after
the Proj
ect is permitted.
The results of the CAMx modeling analysis were evaluated in the same manner as has
been done for other recent permitting proj
ects in Texas. This evaluation demonstrates that the
Terminal is not expected to cause or contribute to an exceedance of an ozone NAAQS violation.
Analysis 4: Terminal - Additional State-Specific Modeling
Although the Terminal’s SO2 emissions increase did not trigger PSD review, the TCEQ
requested an air dispersion modeling analysis for SO2 emissions to assess compliance with the
SO2 NAAQS as well as the State Property Line Standards for SO2 and H2S as specified in
30 TAC §112.3(a). The modeling conducted by Cheniere considered stationary sources
associated with the Terminal.
Table 4.11-16 shows the modeling results for the SO2 NAAQS analyses. All modeled
concentrations of SO2 were predicted to be less than the applicable SILs. Therefore, this
modeling analysis demonstrates compliance with the SO2 NAAQS.

Cheniere submitted to the TCEQ a State Effects Evaluation assessing emitted
compounds’potential to cause adverse health effects, odor nuisances, vegetation effects, or
materials damage. Following TCEQ procedures, a comparison against Effects Screening Levels
(ESLs)was required for only three compounds: benzene, gasoline, and ethylene.
The modeling conducted by Cheniere considered stationary sources associated with the
Terminal. Table 4.11-18 shows the modeling results of the State Effects Evaluation analysis.
Because the maximum predicted concentrations for ethylene were found to be less than their
corresponding ESLs, no further analysis of ethylene emissions was necessary. Although
predicted concentrations of benzene and gasoline were found to be greater than their respective
ESLs, TCEQ’s guidance deems the benzene and gasoline modeling results acceptable.
Therefore, no further State Effects Evaluation modeling is necessary.

4.11.2

Noise

Noise would affect the local environment during both the construction of the Proj
ect
facilities and operation of each of the proposed compressor stations associated with the Proj
ect.
At any location, both the magnitude and frequency of environmental noise may vary
considerably over the course of the day and throughout the week. This variation is caused in
part by changing weather conditions, the effects of seasonal vegetative cover, and man-made
activities.
Two measures used by federal agencies to relate the time-varying quality of
environmental noise to its known effect on people are the equivalent sound level (Leq)and the
day-night average sound level (Ldn). The Leq is the level of steady sound with the same total
(equivalent)energy as the time-varying sound of interest, averaged over a 24-hour period. The
Ldn is the Leq with 10 decibels on the A-weighted scale (dBA)added to nighttime sound levels
between the hours of 10:00 PM and 7:00 AM to account for people's greater sensitivity to sound
during nighttime hours. The A-weighted scale is used because human hearing is less sensitive to
low and high frequencies than mid-range frequencies. A person’s threshold of perception for a
perceivable change in loudness on the A-weighted sound level is on average 3 dBA, whereas
a 5 dBA change is clearly noticeable and a 10 dBA change is perceived as twice or half as loud.
4.11.2.1

RegulatoryRequirements

In 1974, the EPA published Information on Levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to
Protect Public Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety (EPA, 1974). This
document provides information for state and local governments to use in developing their own
ambient noise standards. The EPA has determined that, to protect the public from activity
interference and annoyance outdoors in residential areas, noise levels should not exceed an Ldn of
55 dBA. We have adopted this criterion and use it to evaluate the potential noise impacts from
the Proj
ect at NSAs, such as residences, schools, or hospitals. Due to the 10 dBA nighttime
penalty added prior to calculation of the Ldn, for a facility to meet the Ldn 55 dBA limit, it must
be designed such that actual constant noise levels on a 24-hour basis do not exceed 48.6 dBA Leq
at any NSA.
Based on a review of state regulations, there are no noise quality regulations or
ordinances at the state or county level that are applicable to the Proj
ect. At the local level,
ordinances were identified for the City of Corpus Christi and the City of Portland. However, due
to the separation distance of the Proj
ect from the nearest point in the City of Corpus Christi, the
City of Corpus Christi ordinance requirements are not applicable to the Proj
ect. The City of
Portland’s Municipal Code of Ordinances provides a noise limit of 63 dBA at the residential
property line:
The ordinance listed above is generally less stringent for residences than the FERC limit.
However, in the unusual situation of a house set back on a very large parcel of land, the FERC
sound level limit could be satisfied at the house and the Portland City Ordinance limit exceeded

at the property line. Upon review of the site and existing NSAs for the Proj
ect, this unusual
condition is not expected to occur.
4.11.2.2

Existing Noise Levels

Impacts at the Terminal, two compressor stations, and three HDD crossings have been
evaluated for adj
acent NSAs and surrounding ambient noise levels.
Terminal
There are no NSAs within a 1-mile radius of the proposed Terminal. For the purposes of
studying noise impacts for the proposed Terminal and dredging activities, the nearest five NSAs
were identified. These NSAs are shown on figure 4.11-1 and are located about 1.6 to 3.2 miles
from the noise-producing equipment at the Terminal. The NSAs include residential
communities, Ingleside High School, two churches, and a hotel.
Cheniere’s consultant, Tetra Tech, conducted a noise survey from February 16 to
February 17, 2012 to characterize the existing acoustic environment in the vicinity of the
Terminal site. Principal contributors to the acoustic environment include existing industrial
facilities, motor vehicle traffic on local roadways, periodic aircraft flyovers and rail movements,
and natural sounds such as birds, insects, and leaf or vegetation rustle during elevated wind
conditions. Table 4.11-23 summarizes the results of the baseline sound measurements for the
Terminal. The measured Ldn sound levels ranged from 51 to 54 dBA, indicating a relative
acoustic consistency across the area in the vicinity of the Terminal site, with NSAs exposed to
both similar sound sources and overall background sound levels.

At the Sinton Compressor Station site, one NSA was identified, representative of a
grouping of privately owned cabins approximately 3,300 feet southeast of the proposed Sinton
Compressor Station site. A representative monitoring location was selected approximately 0.5mile from the intersection of Edwards Road and US 77. The ambient acoustic environment
included sounds from distant highway traffic on US 77, birds, distant air conditioning units at
one of the cabins, insects, and a night-time train pass-by and horn.
At the Taft Compressor Station site, four NSAs were identified within 1.5 miles;all were
residences. Two monitoring locations were selected to represent the ambient sound level
environment. The T-1 monitoring location was positioned northeast of the intersection of
US 181 and County Road 3465. The T-2 monitoring location was positioned southwest of the
intersection of US 181 and County Road 79(Midway Road). The acoustic environment included
sounds from roadway traffic on US 181, wind turbine generators, wind during both daytime and
nighttime monitoring, and insect and rodent noise only at night.
Horizontal Directional Drills
Cheniere conducted baseline sound measurements at NSAs in the vicinity of the three
proposed HDD crossings. The NSAs identified for the HDD site baseline sound surveys are
shown in figures 4.11-4 and 4.11-5. Cheniere has not finalized the entry and exit sides of the
crossing points, so the two sites associated with each crossing are labeled as (a)and (b).
Measurements were conducted during the same time period as those conducted for the
compressor stations. Table 4.11-25 summarizes the results of the baseline sound measurements
for the HDD sites. The results of the baseline sound survey show varying ambient sound levels
throughout the HDD areas. The measured daytime sound levels (Ld)ranged from 42 to 58 dBA.

conditions or other unusual circumstances may necessitate nighttime work. Construction noise is
highly variable, as the types of equipment in use at a construction site change with the
construction phase and the type of activities. The first phase of Terminal construction
(consisting of excavation, filling and grading using heavy earth-moving equipment, pile driving
for docks, and dredging), would generate the highest sound levels. In general, heavy equipment
would be used during this phase of construction. Sound levels at the nearest NSA for each
construction phase were calculated. The results ranged from 43 to 48 dBA Leq.
Noise generated during pile-driving for installation of the LNG carrier docks was
considered as a separate case of construction noise because activities could occur 24 hours per
day. There may be two pile driving machines working simultaneously during construction. One
pile driving machine would be located at the west j
etty and the other would be located at the east
j
etty. Assuming two pile drivers in simultaneous 24-hour operation, the predicted Ldn value at
the nearest NSA (NSA 1)is 47.7 dBA, which is less than the existing ambient sound level.
Dredging noise is not expected to cause a significant environmental noise impact. There
are no NSAs located within 0.5 miles of the dredge proposed area, as shown on figure 4.11-1.
NSAs and the ambient acoustic environment closest to Proj
ect dredging activities are the same at
those NSAs identified near the Terminal site. The noise will vary as the activities move nearer
or farther from the NSAs, but even at the closest approach using the noisiest dredge option, the
temporary dredging contributions are not expected to exceed the FERC noise level criterion.
Dredging activities would require approximately six months to complete. Total daily activity
work time would vary from 16 to 20 hours, and may occur at any time of day or night, 7 days per
week.
Construction noise levels for the Terminal (including pile driving of the LNG carrier
docks and dredging activities)are proj
ected below the FERC criterion at the closest NSAs and
are not expected to cause a significant impact.
Pipeline Facilities
Compressor Stations
Construction of the Pipeline would result in short-term noise impacts, primarily due to
heavy equipment used in clearing and grading, pipe trenching, pipe welding, trench backfill, and
right-of-way restoration activities. These activities are temporary and of short duration at any
given point along the linear pipeline route.
Noise levels from compressor station construction were conservatively evaluated
considering equipment usage factors and construction hours. The estimated noise level from the
Sinton Compressor Station would be 50 dBA Leq at the nearest NSA (NSA-1)at 0.6 miles. The
Environmental Impact Statement

4-135

Corpus Christi LNG

estimated noise level from the Taft Compressor Station is proj
ected to be 47 dBA Leq at the
nearest NSA (NSA-1)at 0.7 miles. Actual received sound levels will fluctuate, depending on the
construction activity, equipment type, and separation distances between source and receiver.
Construction noise may be periodically audible at several residential receptor locations.
In order to minimize noise levels associated with compressor station construction, Cheniere
identified the following mitigation measures may be implemented to the extent practical:
 Construction site and access road speed limits may be established and enforced during
the construction period;
 Electrically-powered equipment may be used instead of pneumatic or internal combustion
powered equipment, where feasible;
 Material stockpiles and mobile equipment staging, parking, and maintenance areas may
be located as far as practicable from noise-sensitive receptors;
 The use of noise-producing signals, including horns, whistles, alarms, and bells, will be
for safety warning purposes only.
Additionally, all noise-producing construction equipment and vehicles using internal
combustion engines should be equipped with mufflers, air-inlet silencers where appropriate, and
any other shrouds, shields, or other noise-reducing features in good operating condition that meet
or exceed original factory specification.
Horizontal Directional Drills
Cheniere proposes three HDD crossings on the Proj
ect. Each HDD would require eight
days or more to complete. Cheniere has also committed to performing all HDD activities, except
potentially the pipe pullback, during daylight hours. HDD operations will occur at one site at a
time.
HDD equipment consists of an HDD drilling rig and auxiliary support equipment
including electric mud pumps, portable generators, a crane, mud mixing and cleaning equipment,
forklifts, loaders, trucks, and portable light sets. Sound levels at NSAs resulting from HDD
entry and exit operations were calculated using sound power levels of typical equipment. The
calculation also assumes the worst case condition that the entry would be nearest the NSA. The
results of this analysis are presented in table 4.11-25.
Noise levels from the Chiltipin Creek and US 181/SH 35 HDDs would be below existing
noise levels at the nearest NSAs. Potential noise impacts may occur at the Oliver Creek HDD
where noise levels would be at or above existing noise levels for several NSAs and would be
perceived as twice as loud as existing noise levels at a residence located 300 feet from one site.
However, noise levels during daytime hours would not be any louder than other typical
construction noise and would not impact night-time sound levels.

Operational Noise
Terminal Facilities
The Terminal would include the following maj
or noise-producing sources:
 LM2500+G4 gas turbine driven refrigerant compressors;
 Gas treatment facilities;
 Waste heat recovery systems;
 Induced draft air coolers;
 Piping;
 Recycle boil-off gas compressors;and
 Instrument air compressor packages.
Noise contributions for the Terminal were calculated using environmental noise
prediction software Cadna/A version 4. The model calculates the total sound pressure level at a
specified receiver location or over a grid from all sources.
The following equipment noise mitigation measures are included in this study:
Environmental Impact Statement

4-137

Corpus Christi LNG

 large air-cooled heat exchangers with a sound power level limit of 99dBA and a sound
pressure level limit of 85 dBA at 1 meter;
 Each gas turbine for refrigerant compression requires a silencer for the gas turbine inlet,
gas turbine enclosure, inlet duct, inlet intake, filter house, gas turbine ventilation and
auxiliaries, resulting in an average 85 dBA sound pressure level at 1 meter;
 noise hood on gearboxes;and
 compressor suction, discharge and recycle piping are assumed to have 4 inch acoustic
insulation.
Predicted Ldn values from the Terminal are shown in table 4.11-26 for the five noise
sensitive areas identified on figure 4.11-1. Based on results of the noise model summarized
above, the Terminal (with the aforementioned noise control measures) would result in a
maximum sound level contribution of 51.3 dBA Ldn at the nearest NSA. Based on these results,
operation of the Terminal would comply with the FERC 55 Ldn criterion and City of Portland
noise requirements. Therefore, we do not believe that noise impacts due to operation of the
Terminal would be significant. However, to ensure that the actual noise resulting from operation
of the Terminal facilities is not significant, we recommend that:
 Cheniere should file a noise surveywith the Secretaryno later than 60 days after
placing each liquefaction train and the entire Terminal in service. If a full load
condition noise surveyis not possible,Cheniere should provide an interim surveyat
the maximum possible load and provide the full load surveywithin six months. If
the noise attributable to the operation of all of the equipment for a liquefaction train
or at the Terminal,under interim or full load conditions,exceeds an Ldn of 55dBA
at anynearbyNSAs,Cheniere should file a report on what changes are needed and
should install the additional noise controls to meet the level within one year of the
in-service date. Cheniere shall confirm compliance with the above requirement by
filing a second noise surveywith the Secretaryno later than 60 days after it installs
the additional noise controls.

Pipeline Facilities
Compressor Stations
Operation of the Sinton and Taft Compressor Stations has the potential to result in noise
impacts at nearby NSAs. The facilities for both compressor stations are similar but the Taft
Compressor Station would utilize two Solar Centaur 50 turbine/compressor units (6,387 hp each)
whereas the Sinton Compressor Station would utilize two Solar Titan 130 turbine/compressor
units (20,794 hp each). The following noise sources would be present at the compressor stations:
 Two Solar Centaur 50 turbine/compressor units (6,387 hp each)at the Taft Compressor
Station;
 Two Solar Titan 130 turbine/compressor units (20,794 hp each)at the Sinton Compressor
Station;
 Discharge gas coolers;
 Lube oil coolers;
 Air compressor;
 Electrical transformer;and
 Aboveground compressor station piping.
Similar to the modeling methodology of the Terminal, Cadna/A was used to model noise
generated during Compressor Station operation. Site-specific topography was imported into the
model and ground absorption characteristics within the Proj
ect area were also considered. Sound
attenuation through foliage and diffraction was ignored. Octave band sound power data from the
equipment manufacturer were used as inputs to the model wherever possible. In the absence of
manufacturer data, reasonable and appropriate assumptions were derived from engineering
guidelines and literature.
Cheniere is in the initial engineering phases for each compressor station and has not
finalized specific noise mitigation measures. Common vendor information has been applied to
each compressor station’s acoustic model when available. Final design would be inclusive of a
number of noise mitigation measures which may include acoustical enclosures, barriers,
silencers, and lagging, in addition to low noise equipment. The principal noise mitigation
measures which have been included in the noise analysis are as follows:
 Acoustically insulated compressor station buildings;
 Combustion air inlet silencers;
 Combustion turbines equipped with exhaust silencers;and
 Aboveground piping outside the compressor station building covered with acoustic pipe
insulation.
The modeled operational sound from the Taft and Sinton Compressor Stations considers
simultaneous operation of all sound sources at their maximum rated loads under normal
operating conditions. Results are presented in table 4.11-28, which contains a comparison of the
calculated levels with existing levels, the combined future levels, and the expected net increase.
The modeling results indicate that the calculated sound levels resulting from compressor station

operation at the NSAs are all below the FERC criterion of Ldn of 55 dBA. Also, the expected
increases in noise levels at the NSAs around both compressor station sites are shown to be
negligible. However, to ensure that the actual noise levels resulting from operation of the Sinton
and Taft Compressor Stations are not significant, we recommend that:
 Cheniere should file noise surveys with the Secretary no later than 60 days after
placing the Sinton and Taft Compressor Stations in service. If a full load condition
noise survey is not possible,Cheniere should provide an interim survey at the
maximum possible horsepower load and provide the full load survey within six
months. If the noise attributable to the operation of all of the equipment at the
Sinton or Taft Compressor Station, under interim or full horsepower load
conditions,exceeds an Ldn of 55 dBA at any nearby NSAs,Cheniere should file a
report on what changes are needed and should install the additional noise controls
to meet the level within one year of the in-service date. Cheniere should confirm
compliance with the above requirement by filing a second noise survey with the
Secretaryno later than 60 days after it installs the additional noise controls.

Blowdowns
The sound levels associated with high pressure gas venting vary based on initial
blowdown pressure, the diameter and type of blowdown valve, and the diameter and
arrangement of the downstream vent piping. Blowdown sound levels are loudest at the
beginning of the blowdown event and they decrease as the blowdown pressure decreases. There
are typically two types of gas blowdown events at compressor stations:
 unit blowdown: a routine gas blowdown that can occur when a compressor is stopped and
gas between the suction/discharge valves and compressor(s)is vented to the atmosphere
through a blowdown silencer;and
 station blowdown: a gas blowdown, vented via a silencer that occurs when all of the
station piping is depressurized.

Environmental Impact Statement

4-140

Corpus Christi LNG

The blowdown silencers at the stations have been designed to produce no more than
60 dBA at 300 feet, during standard blowdown events in order to reduce the potential for adverse
noise impacts. Due to the short duration and infrequent timing of station blowdowns, these
events would not influence the 24-hour Ldn values proj
ected for these facilities.
Meter and Regulator Stations
Six M&R stations would be installed at interconnects along the Pipeline. Facilities at the
M&R stations generally consist of filter separators, liquid handling tank, one bi-directional M&R
system, and a 48-inch by 36-inch “T”and valve on the Pipeline. Sound generated from M&R
stations is expected to be low level resulting in minimal impacts at NSAs.

RELIABILITY AND SAFETY

4.12.1

LNG FacilityRegulatoryOversight

Three federal agencies share regulatory authority over the siting, design, construction and
operation of LNG import and export terminals: the Coast Guard, the DOT, and the FERC. The
Coast Guard has authority over the safety of an LNG facility’s marine transfer area and LNG
marine traffic, as well as over security plans for the entire LNG facility and LNG marine traffic.
Those standards are codified in 33 CFR parts 105 and 127. The DOT establishes federal safety
standards for siting, construction, operation, and maintenance of onshore LNG facilities, as well
as for the siting of marine cargo transfer systems at waterfront LNG plants. Those standards are
codified in 49CFR 193. Under the NGA and delegated authority from the DOE, the FERC
authorizes the siting and construction of LNG import and export facilities.
In 1985, the FERC and DOT entered into a memorandum of understanding regarding the
execution of each agency’s respective statutory responsibilities to ensure the safe siting and
operation of LNG facilities. In addition to FERC’s existing ability to impose requirements to
ensure or enhance the operational reliability of LNG facilities, the memorandum of
understanding specified that FERC may, with appropriate consultation with DOT, impose more
stringent safety requirements than those in Part 193.
In February 2004, the Coast Guard, DOT, and FERC entered into an Interagency
Agreement to ensure greater coordination among these three agencies in addressing the full
range of safety and security issues at LNG terminals, including terminal facilities and tanker
operations, and maximizing the exchange of information related to the safety and security
aspects of the LNG facilities and related marine operations. Under the Interagency Agreement,
the FERC is the lead federal agency responsible for the preparation of the analysis required
under NEPA for impacts associated with terminal construction and operation. The DOT and
Coast Guard participate as cooperating agencies.
As part of the review required for a FERC authorization, Commission staff must ensure
that all proposed facilities would operate safely and securely. The design information that must
be filed in the application to the Commission is specified by 18 CFR 380.12 (m)and (o). The
level of detail necessary for this submittal requires the Proj
ect sponsor to perform substantial
front-end engineering of the complete facility. The design information is required to be sitespecific and developed to the extent that further detailed design would not result in changes to
the siting considerations, basis of design, operating conditions, maj
or equipment selections,

equipment design conditions, or safety system designs which we considered during our review
process.
The FERC’s filing regulations also require each applicant to identify how its proposed
design would comply with DOT’s siting requirements in 49CFR 193, Subpart B. As part of our
NEPA review, we use this information from the applicant to assess whether or not a facility
would have a public safety impact. As a cooperating agency, DOT assists FERC staff in
evaluating whether an applicant’s proposed siting meets the DOT requirements. If a facility is
constructed and becomes operational, the facility would be subj
ect to DOT’s inspection program.
Final determination of whether a facility is in compliance with the requirements of 49CFR 193
would be made by DOT staff.

processed, and handled at the LNG Facility;section 4.12.3 discusses our technical review of the
preliminary design of the LNG Facility;section 4.12.4 discusses siting requirements for the LNG

LNG FacilityHazards

With the exception of the October 20, 1944, failure at an LNG facility in Cleveland,
Ohio, the operating history of the U.S. LNG industry has been free of safety-related incidents
resulting in adverse effects on the public or the environment. The 1944 incident in Cleveland led
to a fire that killed 128 people and inj
ured 200 to 400 more people23. The failure of the LNG
storage tank was due to the use of materials inadequately suited for cryogenic temperatures.
LNG migrating through streets and into underground sewers due to the lack of adequate spill
impoundments at the site was also a contributing factor. Current regulatory requirements ensure
that proper materials suited for cryogenic temperatures are used and that spill impoundments are
designed and constructed properly to contain a spill at the site.
Another operational accident occurred in 1979at the Cove Point LNG facility in Lusby,
Maryland. A pump seal failure resulted in gas vapors entering an electrical conduit and settling
in a confined space. When a worker switched off a circuit breaker, the gas ignited, causing
heavy damage to the building and a worker fatality. With the participation of the FERC, lessons
learned from the 1979Cove Point accident resulted in changing the national fire codes to better
ensure that the situation would not occur again.
On January 19, 2004, a blast occurred at Sonatrach’s Skikda, Algeria, LNG liquefaction
facility, which killed 27 and inj
ured 56 workers. No members of the public were inj
ured.
Findings of the accident investigation suggested that a cold hydrocarbon leak occurred at
Liquefaction Train 40 and was introduced to the high-pressure steam boiler by the combustion
air fan. An explosion developed inside the boiler firebox, which subsequently triggered a larger
explosion of the hydrocarbon vapors in the immediate vicinity. The resulting fire damaged the

acent liquefaction process and liquid petroleum gas (LPG)separation equipment of Train 40,
and spread to Trains 20 and 30. Although Trains 10, 20, and 30 had been modernized in 1998
and 1999, Train 40 had been operating with its original equipment since start-up in 1981. To
ensure that this potential hazard would be addressed at the proposed Proj
ect, Cheniere would
install hazard detection devices at all combustion and ventilation air intake equipment to enable
isolation and deactivation of any combustion equipment whose continued operation could add to,
or sustain, an emergency.
On March 31, 2014, an explosion and fire occurred at Northwest Pipeline Corporation’s
LNG peak-shaving facility in Plymouth, Washington. The facility was immediately shut down,
and emergency procedures were activated, which included notifying local authorities and
evacuating all plant personnel. No members of the public were inj
ured. The accident
investigation is still in progress. Once developed, measures to address any causal factors which
led to this incident will be applied to all facilities under Commission j
urisdiction.
4.12.2.1

Hazards Associated with the Proposed Equipment

Before liquefaction, Cheniere would pre-treat the feed gas for removal of mercury, H2S,
and CO2. The removal of these substances from the feed gas stream can be hazardous as a result
from the physical, chemical, flammability, and/or toxicity properties of the substances used or
produced during the pretreatment process.
The CO2 and H2S would be removed using an activated methyldiethanolamine (a-MDEA
or amine)system. Amine is commonly used to remove CO2 and H2S in natural gas. The amine
solution would be clear or pale yellow with an ammonia odor and is completely soluble in water.
The amine solution could result in eye and skin irritation or burns if contacted, upper respiratory
tract irritation or death if inhaled, and can be toxic if swallowed. Amine vapor is also flammable
in concentrations between approximately 1.4 and 8.8 percent, but would be handled at
temperatures below the point at which it could produce enough vapors to form a flammable
mixture. The piping and equipment containing amine would be contained if spilled, as discussed
under “Impoundment Sizing” in section 4.12.5. Due to its low vapor pressure, the amine
solution would not pose a significant hazard to the public, which would have no access to the onsite areas.
Carbon dioxide is a common component of natural gas. The CO2 would be in its gaseous
state and would be colorless and odorless. Carbon dioxide could result in eye and skin irritation
if contacted, and respiratory irritation or death if inhaled. Carbon dioxide is non-flammable.
Cheniere proposes a design capacity to handle up to 2 percent by volume (% vol)CO2, in the
natural gas stream. The CO2 would be removed from the natural gas stream to prevent fouling in
the liquefaction process and would be accumulated to concentrations exceeding 93% vol during
regeneration of the amine. After regeneration, the CO2 would eventually be vented to the
atmosphere after passing through scavenger beds and a thermal oxidizer. Due to the limited
amount of CO2 processed and high concentrations needed to cause asphyxiation, safety hazards
associated with the release of CO2 would be localized at the exit of the thermal oxidizer stack,
and therefore, the CO2 would not pose a significant safety hazard to the public, which would
have no access to the on-site areas.
Hydrogen sulfide may also exist in the natural gas stream. Hydrogen sulfide would be in
its gaseous state and would be colorless with a rotten egg odor. Hydrogen sulfide could result in
eye and skin irritation if contacted, and is toxic and can result in death if inhaled. Cheniere
Environmental Impact Statement

4-143

Corpus Christi LNG

proposes a design capacity to handle up to 4 parts per million by volume (ppm-v)H2S, however
lower concentrations would be expected in the natural gas stream. The H2S would be removed
from the natural gas stream from the amine system to prevent downstream corrosion and fouling
in the liquefaction process. During this process, H2S may accumulate to concentrations up to
approximately 0.016% vol during regeneration of the amine. After regeneration, the H2S would
be sent through scavenger beds to be removed. The spent scavenger would be disposed of offsite
at a licensed facility and would not pose a significant safety hazard to the public. In the case of a
release of H2S prior to reaching the scavenger beds, Cheniere has provided hazard modeling, as
described in section 4.12.5.
Mercury may exist in the natural gas stream, but is not expected to be present. Mercury
would be in a liquid state and would be a metallic silver color and is odorless. Mercury could
result in toxic effects, including death, if contacted, ingested, or inhaled in certain doses.
Cheniere proposes a design capacity to handle up to 20 micrograms per standard cubic meter
(µg/Sm3)of mercury. Mercury would be removed to prevent corrosion and potential liquid
metal embrittlement of downstream aluminum heat exchangers through the use of
sulfur-impregnated activated carbon beds to form mercuric sulfide, which is stable and insoluble.
The sulfur impregnated carbon beds would have enough capacity to last at least four years before
the beds would need to be replaced. Maintenance and safety procedures would cover the proper
replacement and disposal of the mercuric sulfide within the carbon beds and would not pose a
safety hazard to the public, which would have no access to the on-site areas.
In addition to the removal of H2S, CO2, and mercury, Cheniere would also install a heavy
hydrocarbon removal system to remove hydrocarbons that may be present in the natural gas
stream and could freeze and foul the liquefaction process. The hydrocarbons heavier than
methane would be separated out through a series of distillation columns. The lighter
hydrocarbons that exist as liquids under elevated pressures often present in a natural gas
transmission pipeline, such as ethane, propane, and butane, are often referred to as natural gas
liquids (NGLs). The NGLs would not freeze during the liquefaction process and would be
recycled back into the natural gas stream before liquefaction. The NGLs are not toxic, but are
flammable and can present overpressure hazards if ignited. The heavier hydrocarbons that exist
as liquids near atmospheric pressure, such as pentane, hexane, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene,
and xylene, are referred to as condensates. These components would freeze during the
liquefaction process and damage or foul equipment. Therefore, these components would be
removed from the natural gas stream as liquids and sent to floating roof storage tanks where they
would be either pumped into an existing condensate pipeline or transferred to tanker trucks for
removal in the event that the stabilized condensate does not meet the applicable quality
specifications of the pipeline. Most of the stabilized condensate components are flammable and
some are toxic. Any liquid spill would be contained in impoundments, as discussed under
“Impoundment Sizing” in section 4.12.5. Cheniere has provided modeling in the case of an
accidental release of NGLs and stabilized condensate, also described in section 4.12.5.
After pre-treatment, the treated natural gas would then be liquefied into LNG through a
series of heat exchangers utilizing ethylene, propane, and methane as refrigerants. The LNG
would then be stored on-site in atmospheric storage tanks before being transferred to LNG
carriers for export. The refrigerants would also be stored on-site and periodically re-filled as
needed. The LNG and refrigerants are not toxic, but are flammable and some can present
overpressure hazards if ignited. Any liquid spill would be contained in impoundments, as

Corpus Christi LNG

discussed under “Impoundment Sizing”in section 4.12.5. Cheniere has provided modeling in
the case of an accidental release of LNG and refrigerants, also described in section 4.12.5.
Loss of Containment
A loss of the containment is the initial event that results in all other potential hazards.
The initial loss of containment can result in a liquid and/or gaseous release with the formation of
vapor at the release location, as well as from any liquid that pooled. The fluid released may
present low or high temperature hazards, and may result in the formation of toxic and flammable
vapors. The extent of the hazard will depend on the material released, the storage and process
conditions, and the volumes released.
Cheniere would store LNG at atmospheric pressure and at a cryogenic temperature of
approximately -260°F;liquid ethylene at approximately 45 psig and a cryogenic temperature of
approximately -110°F;and liquid propane at ambient temperature and elevated pressures of
approximately 125 psig, similar to the conditions typically used in propane storage and
distribution. However, lower temperatures of propane would exist during the refrigeration
process and upon a release the rapidly expanding gas may further cool. The NGLs would vary
from approximately -88°F to 316°F and at approximately 40 psig to 620 psig. Condensate
storage would be at near atmospheric pressure and temperature.
Due to the temperature and pressure conditions under which these liquids would be
handled onsite, loss of containment of these liquids could lead to the release of both liquid and
vapor into the immediate area. Contact with either cold liquid or vapor could cause freeze burns
or frostbite for personnel in the immediate area or more serious inj
ury or death depending on the
length of exposure. However, spills would be contained to on-site areas and the cold state of
these releases would be greatly limited due to the continuous mixing with the warmer air. The
cold temperatures from the release would not present a safety hazard to the public, which would
not have access to on-site areas.
These releases may also quickly cool any materials contacted by the liquid on release,
causing extreme thermal stress in materials not specifically designed for such conditions. These
thermal stresses could subsequently subj
ect the material to brittleness, fracture, or other loss of
tensile strength. These temperatures, however, would be accounted for in the design of
equipment and structural supports, and would not be substantially different from the hazards
associated with the storage and transportation of liquid oxygen (-296ºF) or several other
cryogenic liquids that have been routinely produced and transported in the United States.
A rapid phase transition (RPT)can occur when a cryogenic liquid is spilled onto water
and changes from liquid to gas, virtually instantaneously. Unlike an explosion that releases
energy and combustion products from a chemical reaction, an RPT is the result of heat
transferred to the liquid inducing a change to the vapor state. RPTs have been observed during
LNG test spills onto water. In some test cases, the overpressures generated were strong enough
to damage test equipment in the immediate vicinity of the LNG release point. The sizes of the
overpressure events have been generally small and are not expected to cause significant damage.
The average overpressures recorded at the source of the RPTs during the Coyote tests have
ranged from 0.2 pounds per square inch (psi)to 11 psi24. These events are typically limited to
24

The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory conducted seven tests (the Coyote series)on vapor cloud
dispersion, vapor cloud ignition, and RPTs at the Naval Weapons Center in China Lake, California in 1981.

the area within the spill and are not expected to cause damage outside of the area engulfed by the
LNG pool. However, a RPT may affect the rate of pool spreading and the rate of vaporization
for a spill on water.
Vapor Dispersion
In the event of a loss of containment, LNG, ethylene, propane, and NGLs would vaporize
on release from any storage or process facilities. Depending on the size of the release, they may
also form a liquid pool and vaporize. Additional vaporization would result from exposure to
ambient heat sources, such as water or soil. When released from a containment vessel or transfer
system, LNG will generally produce 620 to 630 standard cubic feet (ft3)of natural gas for each
cubic foot of liquid. Ethylene will produce approximately 375 ft3 of gas for each cubic foot of
liquid. Propane will produce approximately 250 ft3 of gas for each cubic foot of liquid. The
composition of NGL would vary throughout the heavy hydrocarbon removal process and may
produce up to 380 ft3 of gas for each cubic foot of liquid. In the event of a loss of containment of
stabilized condensate, the stabilized condensate would spill primarily as a liquid and form a pool,
but would vaporize much more slowly than NGL.
The vapor may form a toxic or flammable cloud depending on the material released. The
dispersion of the vapor cloud will depend on the physical properties of the cloud, the ambient
conditions, and the surrounding terrain and structures. Generally, a denser-than-air vapor cloud
would sink to the ground due to the relative density of the vapor to the air and would travel with
the prevailing wind, while a lighter-than-air vapor cloud would rise and travel with the prevailing
wind. The density will depend on the material releases and the temperature of the material. For
example, a LNG release would initially form a denser-than-air vapor cloud and transition to
lighter-than-air vapor cloud as the vapor disperses downwind and mixes with the warm
surrounding air;a liquid ethylene release would form a denser-than-air vapor cloud and
transition to a neutrally buoyant vapor cloud as it mixes with the warm surrounding air;and a
propane, NGL, or condensate release would form a denser-than-air vapor cloud and would
remain denser than the surrounding air, even after warming to ambient temperatures. However,
experimental observations and vapor dispersion modeling indicate a LNG vapor cloud would not
typically be warm, or buoyant, enough to lift off from the ground before the LNG vapor cloud
disperses below its lower flammable limit (LFL).
The vapor cloud would continue to be hazardous until it dispersed below toxic levels
and/or flammable limits. Toxicity is primarily dependent on the concentration of the vapor cloud
in the air and the exposure duration, while flammability of the vapor cloud is primarily
dependent j
ust on the concentration of the vapor when mixed with the surrounding air. In
general, higher concentrations within the vapor cloud would exist near the spill, and lower
concentrations would exist near the edge of the cloud as it disperses downwind.
Toxicity is defined by a number of different agencies for different purposes. Acute
Exposure Guideline Levels (AEGLs)and Emergency Response Planning Guidelines (ERPGs)
are recommended for use by federal, state, and local agencies, as well as the private sector for
emergency planning, prevention, and response activities related to the accidental release of

hazardous substances25. Other federal agencies, such as the Department of Energy, EPA, and
NOAA, use AEGLs and ERPGs as the primary measure of toxicity26,27,28.
There are three AEGLs and ERPGs which are distinguished by varying degrees of
severity of toxic effects with AEGL-1 and ERPG-1 (level 1)being the least severe to AEGL-3
and ERPG-3 (level 3)being the most severe. AEGL-1 is the airborne concentration of a
substance that the general population, including susceptible individuals, could experience notable
discomfort, irritation, or certain asymptomatic non-sensory effects. However, these effects are
not disabling and are transient and reversible upon cessation of the exposure. AEGL-2 is the
airborne concentration of a substance above which it is predicted that the general population,
including susceptible individuals, could experience irreversible or other serious, long-lasting
adverse health effects or an impaired ability to escape. AEGL-3 is the airborne concentration of
a substance above which it is predicted that the general population, including susceptible
individuals, could experience life-threatening health effects or death. ERPG levels have similar
definitions, but are based on the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed
nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing similar effects
defined in each of the AEGLs. The EPA provides ERPGs (1 hour)and AEGLs at varying
exposure times (10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, and 8 hours)for a list of chemicals.
AEGLs are used preferentially as they are more inclusive and provide toxicity levels at various
exposure times. The preferential use of AEGLs is also done by DOE and NOAA. The toxic
properties for the various material components stored and processed on-site are tabulated in
table 4.12-1.

Environmental Impact Statement

Corpus Christi LNG

The extent of the affected area and the severity of the impacts on obj
ects within a vapor
cloud would primarily be dependent on the material, quantity, and duration of the initial release,
the surrounding terrain, and the environmental conditions present during the dispersion of the
cloud. Cheniere has modeled the extent of the potential vapor dispersion hazards for the Proj
ect,
which is discussed in section 4.12.5.
Flammable Vapor Ignition
If the flammable portion of a vapor cloud encounters an ignition source, a flame would
propagate through the flammable portions of the cloud. In most circumstances, the flame would
be driven by the heat it generates. This process is known as a deflagration, or a flash fire
because of its relatively short duration. However, exposure to a deflagration, or flash fire, can
cause severe burns and death, and can ignite combustible materials within the cloud. Cheniere
has modeled the extent of the potential flammable vapor dispersion hazards for the Proj
ect,
which is discussed in section 4.12.5.
If the deflagration in a flammable vapor cloud accelerates to a sufficiently high rate of
speed, pressure waves that can cause damage would be generated. As a deflagration accelerates
to super-sonic speeds, the large shock waves produced, rather than the heat, would begin to drive
the flame, resulting in a detonation. The flame speeds are primarily dependent on the reactivity
of the fuel, the ignition strength and location, the degree of congestion and confinement of the
area occupied by the vapor cloud, and the flame travel distance. Cheniere has modeled the
extent of the potential overpressure hazards for the Proj
ect, which is discussed in section 4.12.5.
Once a vapor cloud is ignited, the flame front may propagate back to the spill site if the
vapor concentration along this path is sufficiently high to support the combustion process. When
the flame reaches vapor concentrations above the UFL, the deflagration could transition to a
fireball and result in a pool or j
et fire back at the source. A fireball would occur near the source
of the release and would be of a relatively short duration compared to an ensuing j
et or pool fire.
The extent of the affected area and the severity of the impacts on obj
ects in the vicinity of a fire
would primarily be dependent on the material, quantity, and duration of the fire, the surrounding
terrain, and the environmental conditions present during the fire. Cheniere has modeled the
extent of the potential radiant heat hazards for the Proj
ect, which is discussed in section 4.12.5.
Cascading Events
Fires and overpressures may also cause failures of nearby storage vessels, piping, and
equipment if not properly mitigated. These failures are often termed cascading events or domino
effects and can exceed the consequences of the initial hazard.
The failure of a pressurized vessel could cause fragments of material to fly through the
air at high velocities, posing damage to surrounding structures and a hazard for operating staff,
emergency personnel, or other individuals in proximity to the event. In addition, failure of a
pressurized vessel when the liquid is at a temperature significantly above its normal boiling point
could result in a boiling-liquid-expanding-vapor explosion (BLEVE). BLEVEs can produce
overpressures when the superheated liquid rapidly changes from a liquid to a vapor upon the
release from the vessel. BLEVEs of flammable fluids may also ignite upon its release and cause
a subsequent fireball.

Failures of nearby storage vessels, piping, and equipment and the potential for cascading
events are discussed in this section 4.12.5. Cheniere has mitigated the risk for cascading event
hazards for the Proj
ect, which is also discussed in section 4.12.5.
4.12.3

Technical Review of the FacilityPreliminaryEngineering Design

Operation of the proposed facility poses a potential hazard that could affect the public
safety if strict design and operational measures to control potential accidents are not applied.
The primary concerns are those events that could lead to an LNG spill of sufficient magnitude to
create an off-site hazard as discussed in section 4.12.2. However, it is important to recognize the
stringent requirements in place for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the
facility, as well as the extensive safety systems proposed to detect and control potential hazards.
In general, we consider an acceptable design to include various layers of protection or
safeguards in the facility design to reduce the risk of a potentially hazardous scenario from
developing into an event that could impact the off-site public. These layers of protection are
independent of one another so that any one layer would perform its function regardless of the
action or failure of any other protection layer or initiating event. Such design features and
safeguards typically include:
 A facility design that prevents hazardous events through the use of inherently safer
designs;suitable materials of construction;operating and design limits for process piping,
process vessels, and storage tanks;adequate design for wind, flood, seismic, and other
outside hazards;
 Control systems, including monitoring systems and process alarms, remotely-operated
control and isolation valves, and operating procedures to ensure the facility stays within
the established operating and design limits;
 Safety-instrumented prevention systems, such as safety control valves and emergency
shutdown systems, to prevent a release if operating and design limits are exceeded;
 Physical protection systems, such as appropriate electrical area classification, proper
equipment and building spacing, pressure relief valves, spill containment, and structural
fire protection, to prevent escalation to a more severe event;
Site security measures for controlling access to the facility, including security inspections
and patrols;response procedures to any breach of security and liaison with local law enforcement
officials;and
On-site and off-site emergency response, including hazard detection and control
equipment, firewater systems, and coordination with local first responders to mitigate the
consequences of a release and prevent it from escalating to an event that could impact the public.
The inclusion of such protection systems or safeguards in a facility design can minimize
the potential for an initiating event to develop into an incident that could impact the safety of the
off-site public. In addition, siting of the facility with regard to potential off-site consequences
can be further used to minimize impacts to public safety. As discussed in section 4.12.4, DOT’s
regulations in 49CFR 193, Subpart B require a siting analysis be performed by Cheniere.
As part of the application, Cheniere provided a FEED for the Proj
ect. In developing the
FEED, Cheniere conducted a hazard identification study of the process flow diagram (PFD)to

identify potential risk scenarios. This helped to establish the required safety control levels and
identify whether additional process and safety instrumentation, mitigation, and/or administrative
controls would be needed. We have analyzed the information filed by Cheniere to determine the
extent that layers of protection or safeguards to enhance the safety, operability, and reliability of
the facility are included in the FEED.
The obj
ectives of our FEED review focused on the engineering design and safety
concepts of the various protection layers, as well as the proj
ected operational reliability of the
proposed facilities. The design would use materials of construction suited to the pressure and
temperature conditions of the process design. Piping would be designed in accordance with
ASME B31.3. Pressure vessels would be designed in accordance with ASME Section VIII and
the storage tanks would be designed in accordance with American Petroleum Institute (API)
Standard 620, per 49 CFR 193 and the National Fire Protection Association’s Standard 59A
(NFPA 59A). All LNG storage tanks would also include boil-off gas compression or reliquefaction to prevent the release of boil-off to the atmosphere in accordance with NFPA 59A
for an inherently safer design. Valves and other equipment would be designed to recommended
and generally accepted good engineering practices. Cheniere states that its facility would be
designed to withstand a sustained wind of 150 mph in accordance with
49CFR 193.2067(b)(2)(i), which would also exceed the 10,000 year mean return interval or 0.5
percent probability of exceedance in a 50-year period requirement in federal regulations of
49CFR 193.2067(b)(2)(ii)32. The base plant elevation would be at a height of 25 feet or greater
NAVD 88 or 25.59feet NGVD 29to minimize the risk of flooding. This elevation would be
able to withstand surge and tide equivalent to 10,000 year mean return interval hurricanes, which
would exceed the 100 year mean return interval Base Flood Elevation of 13 feet NVGD 29as
well as a potential storm surge elevation defined by NOAA for a Category 5 hurricane of 20.3
feet NGVD 2933. As discussed in Section 4.1.4, we also examined the seismic and structural
design of the facility and provided recommendations to deal with the issues identified. In
addition, FAA issued Aeronautical Study 2012-ASW-5296-OE34, indicating there is no
substantial adverse effect on the safe and efficient utilization of the navigable airspace. The
report concluded that there would be no substantial adverse impact for heights of 529feet above
ground level or 550 feet AMSL. No facilities or equipment would exceed this height. The
tallest structures that would be installed would be the flare stacks, LNG storage tanks, and the
gas turbine stacks. The LNG storage tanks would be outfitted with lighting and aircraft warning
lights and the flare stacks and gas turbine stacks would be marked and lighted in accordance with
the FAA Advisory Circular 70/7460-1K, “Obstruction Marking and Lighting.” Cheniere would
need to extend the FAA determination before the expiration date of July 29, 2014.

A 150 mph sustained wind speed would correspond to a 183 mph 3-second gust using the Durst Curve in ASCE
7-05 and a 185 mph 3-second gust using a 1.23 gust factor for onshore winds at a coast line recommended in World
Meteorological Organization, Guidelines for Converting Between Various Wind Averaging Periods in Tropical
Cyclone Conditions. These wind speeds are equivalent to approximately a 14,000 year mean return interval or

Cheniere would install process control valves and instrumentation to safely operate and
monitor the facility. Alarms would have visual and audible notification in the control room to
warn operators that process conditions may be approaching design limits. Operators would have
the capability to take action from the control room to mitigate an upset.
Cheniere would develop facility operation procedures after completion of the final
design; this timing is fully consistent with accepted industry practice. We have made
recommendations for Cheniere to provide more information on the operating and maintenance
procedures as they are developed, including safety procedures, hot work procedures and permits,
abnormal operating conditions procedures, and personnel training. In addition, we have
recommended measures such as labeling of instrumentation and valves, piping, and equipment
and car-seals/locks, to address human factor considerations and improve facility safety. An
alarm management program would also be in place to ensure effectiveness of the alarms.
Safety valves and instrumentation would be installed to monitor, alarm, shutdown, and
isolate equipment and piping during process upsets or emergency conditions. Safety
instrumented systems would comply with International Society for Automation (ISA)Standard
84.01 and other recommended and generally accepted good engineering practices. We also
made recommendations on the design, installation, and commissioning of instrumentation and
emergency shutdown equipment to ensure appropriate cause and effect alarm or shutdown logic
and enhanced representation of the emergency shutdown valves in the facility control system.
Safety relief valves and flares would be installed to protect the process equipment and
piping. The safety relief valves would be designed to handle process upsets and thermal
expansion within piping, per NFPA 59A and ASME Section VIII, and would be designed based
on API 520, 521, 527, and other recommended and generally accepted good engineering
practices. In addition, we made recommendations to ensure the design and installation of
pressure and vacuum relief devices are adequate.
The security requirements for the Proj
ect are governed by 49 CFR 193, Subpart J Security. This subpart includes requirements for conducting security inspections and patrols,
liaison with local law enforcement officials, design and construction of protective enclosures,
lighting, monitoring, alternative power sources, and warning signs. Requirements for
maintaining safety of the liquefaction facility are in the Coast Guard regulations in 33 CFR 127.
Requirements for maintaining security of the terminal are in 33 CFR 105.
Title 49, CFR, Part 193, Subpart J – Security, specifies security requirements for the
onshore component of LNG facilities. This subpart includes requirements for conducting
security inspections and patrols, liaison with local law enforcement officials, design and
construction of protective enclosures, lighting, monitoring, alternative power sources, and
warning signs. Security at the facility would be provided by both active and passive systems.
The site would be surrounded by a protective enclosure (i.e., a fence or natural barrier). The
enclosure would be illuminated with not less than 2.2 lux between sunset and sunrise. Title 33
CFR 127 would require even higher intensity lighting at any loading flange and at each work
area. Intrusion detection systems and day/night camera coverage would identify unauthorized
access. A separate security staff would conduct periodic patrols of the plant, and screen visitors
and contractors. The security staff may also assist in maintaining security of the marine terminal
during cargo unloading.

In addition to the requirements of Part 193, there are also requirements for maintaining
security of a marine terminal contained in Coast Guard regulations. Title 33, CFR, Part 105, as
authorized by the MTSA, requires all terminal owners and operators to submit a Facility Security
Assessment and a Facility Security Plan to the Coast Guard for review and approval. Some of
the responsibilities of the applicant include, but are not limited to:
 designating a Facility Security Officer with a general knowledge of current security
threats and patterns, risk assessment methodology, and the responsibility for
implementing the Facility Security Assessment and Facility Security Plan and performing
an annual audit for the life of the proj
ect;
 conducting a Facility Security Assessment to identify site vulnerabilities, possible
security threats and consequences of an attack, and facility protective measures;
 developing a Facility Security Plan based on the Facility Security Assessment, with
procedures for: responding to transportation security incidents; notification and
coordination with local, state, and federal authorities;prevention of unauthorized access;
measures and equipment to prevent or deter dangerous substances and devices;training;
and evacuation;
 implementing scalable security measures to provide increasing levels of security at
increasing maritime security levels for facility access control, restricted areas, cargo
handling, vessel stores and bunkers, and monitoring;
 ensuring the Transportation Worker Identification Credential program is properly
implemented;and
 reporting all breaches of security and security incidents to the National Response Center.
Under 33 CFR 105, Cheniere would be required to submit a Facility Security Plan to the
Coast Guard for review and approval before commencement of operations.
In the event of a release, drainage systems from LNG storage and liquefaction process
facilities would direct a spill away from equipment in order to minimize flammable vapors from
dispersing to confined, occupied, or public areas and to minimize heat from impacting adj
acent
equipment and public areas if ignition occurs. Spacing of vessels and equipment between each
other, from ignition sources, and to the property line would comply with NFPA 59A and
NFPA 30. We also made recommendations to ensure the spacing and designs of impoundments
reduce the thermal radiation distances and reduce the risk of cascading failure of future
condensate tanks. Impoundment systems are further discussed in section 4.12.5.
Cheniere performed a preliminary fire protection evaluation to ensure that adequate
hazard detection, hazard control, and firewater coverage would be installed to detect and address
any upset conditions. Structural fire protection, proposed to prevent failure of structural supports
of equipment and pipe racks, would comply with NFPA 59A and other recommended and
generally accepted good engineering practices. Cheniere would also install hazard detection
systems to detect, alarm, and alert personnel in the area and control room to initiate an
emergency shutdown and/or initiate appropriate procedures, and would meet NFPA 72,
ISA 12.13, and other recommended and generally accepted good engineering practices. Hazard
control devices would be installed to extinguish or control incipient fires and releases, and would
meet NFPA 59A and NFPA 10, 12, 15, 17, and other recommended and generally accepted good

engineering practices. Cheniere would provide automatic firewater systems and monitors for use
during an emergency to cool the surface of storage vessels, piping, and equipment exposed to
heat from a fire, and would meet NFPA 59A, 20, 22, and 24 requirements. We have made
recommendations for Cheniere to provide more information on the design, installation, and
commissioning of hazard detection, hazard control, and firewater systems as Cheniere would
further develop this information during the final design phase.
Cheniere would also have emergency procedures in accordance with 49 CFR 193 and
33 CFR 127. The emergency procedures would provide for protection of personnel and the
public as well as the prevention of property damage that may occur as a result of incidents at the
facility. Cheniere would also be required to develop an emergency response plan (ERP)in
accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005), as discussed further in section
4.12.7.
The use of these protection layers would minimize the potential for an initiating event to
develop into an incident that could impact the safety of the off-site public. As a result of the
technical review of the information provided by Cheniere in the submittal documents, we
identified a number of concerns in information data requests issued on April 8, April 22, and
August 16, 2013 relating to the reliability, operability, and safety of the proposed design.
Cheniere provided written responses on April 26, May 9, May 30, June 5, June 19, September
23, 2013 in response to staff’s questions. However, some of these responses indicated that
Cheniere would correct or modify its design in order to address issues raised in the information
request. As a result, we recommend that:
 Prior to construction of the final design,Cheniere should file with the Secretary,for
review and written approval by the Director of the OEP,information/revisions
pertaining to Cheniere’s responses,as listed in Table 4.12-3 of the EIS,which
indicated features to be included in the final design and documentation.

The FEED and specifications submitted for the proposed facilities to date are
preliminary, but would serve as the basis for any detailed design to follow. If authorization is
granted by the Commission, the next phase of the Proj
ect would include development of the final
design, including final selection of equipment manufacturers, process conditions, and resolution
of some safety-related issues. We do not expect that the detailed design information to be
developed would result in changes to the basis of design, operating conditions, maj
or equipment
selections, equipment design conditions, or safety system designs that were presented as part of
the FEED.
A more detailed and thorough hazard and operability review (HAZOP)analysis would be
performed by Cheniere during the final design phase to identify the maj
or hazards that may be
encountered during the operation of facilities. The HAZOP study would be intended to address
hazards of the process, engineering and administrative controls, and would provide a qualitative
evaluation of a range of possible safety, health, and environmental effects which may result from
the design or operation of the facility. Recommendations to prevent or minimize these hazards
would be generated from the results of the HAZOP review.
Once the design has been subj
ected to a HAZOP review, the design development team
tracks changes in the facility design, operations, documentation, and personnel. Cheniere would
evaluate these changes to ensure that the safety, health, and environmental risks arising from
these changes are addressed and controlled. Resolutions of the recommendations generated by
the HAZOP review would be monitored by FERC staff. We have included a recommendation
that Cheniere should file a HAZOP study on the completed final design.
Information regarding the development of the final design, as detailed below, would need
to be filed with the Secretary for review and written approval by the Director of the OEP before
equipment construction at the site would be authorized. To ensure that the concerns we’ve
identified relating to the reliability, operability, and safety of the proposed design are addressed
by Cheniere, and to ensure that the facility is subj
ect to the Commission’s construction and
operational inspection program, we recommend that the following measures should applyto
the Cheniere Project. Information pertaining to these specific recommendations should be
filed with the Secretary for review and written approval by the Director of OEP either:
prior to initial site preparation; prior to construction of final design; prior to
commissioning;prior to introduction of hazardous fluids;or prior to commencement of
service,as indicated by each specific condition. Specific engineering,vulnerability,or
detailed design information meeting the criteria specified in Order No. 683 (Docket

Environmental Impact Statement

4-163

Corpus Christi LNG

 The facility should be subject to regular FERC staff technical reviews and site
inspections on at least an annual basis or more frequentlyas circumstances indicate.
Prior to each FERC staff technical review and site inspection,Cheniere should
respond to a specific data request including information relating to possible design
and operating conditions that may have been imposed by other agencies or

plant modifications including future plans and progress thereof. Abnormalities
should include, but not be limited to: unloading/loading shipping problems,
potential hazardous conditions caused byoff-site vessels,storage tank stratification
or rollover,geysering,storage tank pressure excursions,cold spots on the storage
tanks,storage tank vibrations and/or vibrations in associated cryogenic piping,
storage tank settlement,significant equipment or instrumentation malfunctions or
failures,nonscheduled maintenance or repair (and reasons therefore),relative
movement of storage tank inner vessels,hazardous fluids releases,fires involving
natural gas and/or from other sources,negative pressure (vacuum)within a storage
tank and higher than predicted boil-off rates. Adverse weather conditions and the
effect on the facilityshould also be reported. Reports should be submitted within 45
days after each period ending June 30 and December 31. In addition to the above

 Significant non-scheduled events,including safety-related incidents (e.g.,hazardous
fluid releases,fires,explosions,mechanical failures,unusual over pressurization,
and major injuries) and security related incidents (i.e.,attempts to enter site,
suspicious activities)should be reported to FERC staff. In the event an abnormality
is of significant magnitude to threaten public or employee safety,cause significant
property damage,or interrupt service,notification should be made immediately,
without unduly interfering with any necessary or appropriate emergency repair,
alarm,or other emergencyprocedure. In all instances,notification should be made
to FERC staff within 24 hours. This notification practice should be incorporated
into the LNG facility's emergency plan. Examples of reportable hazardous fluids
related incidents include:

death or personal injurynecessitating in-patient hospitalization;
release of hazardous fluid for five minutes or more;
unintended movement or abnormal loading byenvironmental causes,such as an
earthquake, landslide, or flood, that impairs the serviceability, structural
integrity,or reliability of an LNG facility that contains,controls,or processes
hazardous fluids;
any crack or other material defect that impairs the structural integrity or
reliabilityof an facilitythat contains,controls,or processes a hazardous fluid;
any malfunction or operating error that causes the pressure of a pipeline or
facilitythat contains or processes a hazardous fluid to rise above its maximum
allowable operating pressure (or working pressure for LNG facilities)plus the
build-up allowed for operation of pressure limiting or control devices;
a leak in a facilitythat contains or processes a hazardous fluid that constitutes
an emergency;
inner tank leakage, ineffective insulation, or frost heave that impairs the
structural integrityof an LNG storage tank;
any safety-related condition that could lead to an imminent hazard and cause
(either directly or indirectly by remedial action of the operator),for purposes
other than abandonment,a 20 percent reduction in operation of a pipeline or a
facilitythat contains or processes a hazardous fluid;
safety-related incidents to hazardous material transportation occurring at or en
route to and from the LNG facility;or
an event that is significant in the judgment of the operator and/or management
even though it did not meet the above criteria or the guidelines set forth in an
LNG facility’s incident management plan.

In the event of an incident,the Director of OEP has delegated authority to take
whatever steps are necessaryto ensure operational reliabilityand to protect human
life,health,property or the environment,including authority to direct the LNG
facilityto cease operations. Following the initial companynotification,FERC staff
would determine the need for a separate follow-up report or follow-up in the
upcoming semi-annual operational report. All company follow-up reports should
include investigations results and recommendations to minimize a reoccurrence of
the incident.
In addition to the final design review, we would conduct inspections during construction
and would review additional materials, including quality assurance and quality control plans,
nonconformance reports, and cooldown and commissioning plans, to ensure that the installed
design is consistent with the safety and operability characteristics of the FEED. We would also
conduct inspections during operation to ensure that the facility is operated and maintained in
accordance with the filed design throughout the life of the facility. Based on our analysis and
recommendations presented above, the FEED presented by Cheniere would include acceptable

layers of protection or safeguards which would reduce the risk of a potentially hazardous
scenario from developing into an event that could impact the off-site public.
4.12.4

LNG FacilitySiting Requirements

The principal hazards associated with the substances involved in the liquefaction, storage
and vaporization of LNG result from cryogenic and flashing liquid releases, flammable and toxic
vapor dispersion, vapor cloud ignition, pool fires, BLEVEs, and overpressures. As discussed in
section 4.12.3, our FEED review indicates that sufficient layers of protection would be
incorporated into the facility design to mitigate the potential for an initiating event to develop
into an incident that could impact the safety of the off-site public. Siting of the facility with
regard to potential off-site consequences is also required by DOT’s regulations in 49CFR 193,
Subpart B as to ensure that impact to the public would be minimized. The Commission’s
regulations under 18 CFR 380.12(o)(14)require Cheniere to identify how the proposed design
complies with the siting requirements of DOT’s regulations in 49CFR 193, Subpart B. As part
of our review, we used Cheniere’s information, developed to comply with DOT’s regulations, to
assess whether or not the facility would have a public safety impact. The Part 193 requirements
state that an operator or government agency must exercise control over the activities that can
occur within an “exclusion zone,”defined as the area around an LNG facility that could be
exposed to specified levels of thermal radiation or flammable vapor in the event of a release.
Approved mathematical models must be used to calculate the dimensions of these exclusion
zones. The 2001 edition of NFPA 59A, an industry consensus safety standard for the siting,
design, construction, operation, maintenance, and security of LNG facilities, is incorporated into
Part 193 by reference, with regulatory preemption in the event of conflict. The following
sections of Part 193 specifically address the siting requirements applicable to each LNG
container and LNG transfer system:


Part 193.2001, Scope of part, excludes any matter other than siting provisions
pertaining to marine cargo transfer systems between the marine vessel and the last
manifold or valve immediately before a storage tank.



Part 193.2051, Scope, states that each LNG facility designed, replaced, relocated
or significantly altered after March 31, 2000, must be provided with siting
requirements in accordance with Subpart B and NFPA 59A (2001). In the event
of a conflict with NFPA 59A (2001), the regulatory requirements in Part 193
prevail.



Part 193.2057, Thermal radiation protection, requires that each LNG container
and LNG transfer system have thermal exclusion zones in accordance with
Section 2.2.3.2 of NFPA 59A (2001).



Part 193.2059, Flammable vapor-gas dispersion protection, requires that each
LNG container and LNG transfer system have a dispersion exclusion zone in
accordance with Sections 2.2.3.3 and 2.2.3.4 of NFPA 59A (2001).

For the LNG facilities proposed for the Proj
ect, these Part 193 siting requirements would
be applicable to the following equipment:


Three 47,000,000 gallon (160,000 m3)nominal full containment LNG storage
tanks and associated piping and appurtenances - Parts 193.2057 and 2059require
the establishment of thermal and flammable vapor exclusion zones for LNG

Corpus Christi LNG

tanks. NFPA 59A (2001), Section 2.2.3.2 specifies four thermal exclusion zones
based on the design spill and the impounding area. NFPA 59A (2001), Sections
2.2.3.3 and 2.2.3.4 specify a flammable vapor exclusion zone for the design spill
which is determined with Section 2.2.3.5.


Two 30-inch-diameter and three 20-inch-diameter LNG transfer lines for the
proposed ship (un)loading docks – Parts 193.2001, 2057, and 2059 require
thermal and flammable vapor exclusion zones for the marine cargo transfer
system. NFPA 59A (2001)does not address LNG transfer systems.



Twelve in-tank pumps (three 8,806-gallon-per-minute (gpm) pumps and one
4,403-gpm pump for each of the LNG storage tanks)and associated piping and
appurtenances;six 6,569-gpm LNG transfer pumps (one operating and one spare
for each liquefaction train)and associated piping and appurtenances;and two

Previous FERC environmental assessments/impact statements for past proj
ects have
identified inconsistencies and areas of potential conflict between the requirements in Part 193
and NFPA 59A (2001). Sections 193.2057 and 193.2059require exclusion zones for each LNG
container and LNG transfer system, and an LNG transfer system is defined in Section 193.2007
to include cargo transfer system and transfer piping (whether permanent or temporary).
However, NFPA 59A (2001)requires exclusion zones only for “transfer areas,”which is defined
as the part of the plant where the facility introduces or removes the liquids, such as truck loading
or ship-unloading areas. The NFPA 59A (2001)definition does not include permanent plant
piping, such as cargo transfer lines. Section 2.2.3.1 of NFPA 59A (2001)also states that transfer
areas at the water edge of marine terminals are not subj
ect to the siting requirements in that
standard.
Environmental Impact Statement

Corpus Christi LNG

The DOT has addressed some of these issues in a March 2010 letter of interpretation.35
In that letter, DOT stated that: (1)the requirements in the NFPA 59A (2001)for transfer areas
for LNG apply to the marine cargo transfer system at a proposed waterfront LNG facility, except
where preempted by the regulations in Part 193;(2)the regulations in Part 193 for LNG transfer
systems conflict with NFPA 59A (2001)on whether an exclusion zone analysis is required for
transfer piping or permanent plant piping;and (3)the regulations in Part 193 prevailed as a result
of that conflict. The DOT has determined that an exclusion zone analysis of the marine cargo
transfer system is required.
In FERC environmental assessments/impact statements for past proj
ects, we have also
noted that when the DOT incorporated NFPA 59A into its regulations, it removed the regulation
that required impounding systems around transfer piping. As a result of that change, it is unclear
whether Part 193 or the adopted sections of NFPA 59A (2001)require impoundments for LNG
transfer systems. We note that Part 193 requires exclusion zones for LNG transfer systems, and
that those zones were historically calculated based on impoundment systems. We also note that
the omission of containment for transfer piping is not a sound engineering practice. For these
reasons, we generally recommend containment for all LNG transfer piping within a plant’s
property lines.
Federal regulations issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA)under 29CFR 1910.119(Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals;
Explosives and Blasting Agents (PSM)), and the EPA under 40 CFR 68 (Risk Management
Plans)cover hazardous substances, such as methane, propane, and ethylene at many facilities in
the U.S. However, OSHA and EPA regulations are not applicable to facilities regulated under 49
CFR 193. On October 30, 1992, shortly after the promulgation of the OSHA Process Safety
Management regulations, OSHA issued a letter of interpretation that precluded the enforcement
of PSM regulations over gas transmission and distribution facilities. In a subsequent letter on
December 9, 1998, OSHA further clarified that this letter of interpretation applies to LNG
distribution and transmission facilities.
In addition, EPA’s preamble to its final rule in Federal Register, Volume 63, Number 3,
639-645, clarified that exemption from the requirements in 40 CFR 68 for regulated substances
in transportation, including storage incident to transportation, is not limited to pipelines. The
preamble further clarified that the transportation exemption applies to LNG facilities subj
ect to
oversight or regulation under 49CFR 193, including facilities used to liquefy natural gas or used
to transfer, store, or vaporize LNG in conj
unction with pipeline transportation. Therefore, the
above OSHA and EPA regulations are not applicable to facilities regulated under 49CFR 193.
As stated in Section 193.2051, LNG facilities must be provided with the siting requirements of
NFPA 59A (2001 edition). The siting requirements for flammable liquids within an LNG
facility are contained in NFPA 59A, Chapter 2:


NFPA 59A, Section 2.1.1 requires consideration of clearances between flammable
refrigerant storage tanks, flammable liquid storage tanks, structures and plant
equipment, both with respect to plant property lines and each other. This section
also requires that other factors applicable to the specific site that have a bearing
on the safety of plant personnel and surrounding public be considered, including

an evaluation of potential incidents and safety measures incorporated in the
design or operation of the facility.


NFPA 59A Section 2.2.2.2 requires impoundments serving flammable
refrigerants or flammable liquids to contain a 10-minute spill of a single
accidental leakage source or during a shorter time period based upon
demonstrable surveillance and shutdown provisions acceptable to the DOT. In
addition, NFPA Section 2.2.2.5 requires impoundments and drainage channels for
flammable liquid containment to conform to NFPA 30, Flammable and
Combustible Liquids Code.



NFPA 59A Section 2.2.3.2 requires provisions to minimize the damaging effects
of fire from reaching beyond a property line, and requires provisions to prevent a
radiant heat flux level of 1,600 British thermal units per cubic foot per hour
(Btu/ft2-hr)from reaching beyond a property line that can be built upon. The
distance to this flux level is to be calculated with LNGFIRE or using models that
have been validated by experimental test data appropriate for the hazard to be
evaluated and that are acceptable to DOT.



NFPA 59A Section 2.2.3.4 requires provisions to minimize the possibility of any
flammable mixture of vapors from a design spill from reaching a property line
that can be built upon and that would result in a distinct hazard. Determination of
the distance that the flammable vapors extend is to be determined with DEGADIS
or alternative models that take into account physical factors influencing LNG
vapor dispersion. Alternative models must have been validated by experimental
test data appropriate for the hazard to be evaluated and must be acceptable to
DOT. Section 2.2.3.5 requires the design spill for impounding areas serving
vaporization and process areas to be based on the flow from any single accidental
leakage source.

For the following liquefaction facilities that are proposed for the Proj
ect, FERC staff
identified that the siting requirements from Part 193 and NFPA 59A would be applicable to the
following equipment:


Three liquefaction heat exchangers and associated piping and appurtenances for
each of the proposed 4.5 mtpa (approximately 1.9billion standard cubic feet per
day)liquefaction trains;



Three 75,961-gallon ethylene storage vessels and associated piping and
appurtenances common to the facility;



Two 235,597-gallon propane storage vessels and associated piping and
appurtenances common to the facility;



One 144,000-gallon stabilized condensate storage tank and associated piping and

LNG FacilitySiting Analysis

Suitable sizing of impoundment systems and selection of design spills on which to base
hazard analyses are critical for establishing an appropriate siting analysis. Although
impoundment capacity and design spill scenarios for storage tank impoundments are well
described by Part 193, a clear definition for other impoundments is not provided either directly
by the regulations or by the adopted sections of NFPA 59A (2001). Under NFPA 59A (2001)
Section 2.2.2.2, the capacity of impounding areas for vaporization, process, or LNG transfer
areas must equal the greatest volume that can be discharged from any single accidental leakage
source during a 10-minute period or during a shorter time period based upon demonstrable
surveillance and shutdown provisions acceptable to the DOT. However, no definition of single
accidental leakage source is provided in the regulations.
We recommend impoundments to be sized based on the greatest flow capacity from a
single transfer pipe for 10 minutes, while recognizing that different spill scenarios may be used
for the single accidental leakage sources for the hazard calculations required by Part 193. A
similar approach is used with impoundments for process vessels. We recommend these to be
able to contain the contents of the largest process vessel served, while recognizing that smaller
design spills may be appropriate for Part 193 calculations.
4.12.5.1

Impoundment Sizing

Part 193.2181 references NFPA 59A (2001)for siting, which specifies each impounding
system serving an LNG storage tank must have a minimum volumetric liquid capacity of 110
percent of the LNG tank’s maximum design liquid capacity for an impoundment serving a single
tank. We also consider it prudent design practice to provide a barrier to prevent liquid from
flowing to an unintended area (i.e., outside the plant property) in the event that the full
containment storage tank primary and secondary containers have a common cause failure. The
purpose of the barrier is to prevent liquid from flowing off the plant property, and does not
define containment or an impounding area for thermal radiation or flammable vapor exclusion
zone calculations or other code requirements already met by sumps and impoundments
throughout the site.
Table 4.12-4 shows the spill volumes and their corresponding impoundment systems.
Cheniere proposes three full containment LNG storage tanks where the outer tank wall would
serve as the impoundment system. The proposed LNG storage tanks would have a design
maximum volume of 47,463,327 gallons with a maximum potential capacity of 48,030,856
gallons. As shown in Table 4.12-4, the outer tank would have a volumetric capacity of
56,444,124 gallons, which exceeds the 110 percent requirement by 4,234,465 gallons. The outer
tank would contain 119 percent of the design maximum volume and 112 percent of the
Environmental Impact Statement

4-170

Corpus Christi LNG

maximum potential capacity of the inner tank, meeting the Part 193 requirements. Cheniere
would install a raised access road around the perimeter of the facility, which also serves to limit
liquid from flowing off the plant property in the case of a common cause failure of the existing
full containment storage tank primary and secondary containers. The raised access road
surrounding the proposed LNG storage tanks would meet our recommendation that a barrier be
provided to prevent liquid from flowing off plant property.
Potential spills occurring from the LNG Tank withdrawal lines, liquefaction trains, LNG
vaporization, and associated pumps, vessels, equipment, piping and appurtenances would drain
toward trenches and would be directed to the outside battery limit (OSBL)Impoundment. The
trenches would have a rectangular cross-sectional area with a minimum slope of 0.1 percent, and
were confirmed to handle the maximum volumetric flow from any single line. The OSBL
Impoundment would be a cylindrical impoundment, 70 feet in diameter by 19feet deep, with a
usable capacity of approximately 547,000 gallons. The largest spill to the OSBL Impoundment
would be a 10 minute spill volume of 528,340 gallons from a guillotine rupture of the 30-inchdiameter ship transfer (un)loading line. The OSBL Impoundment would also contain spills from
the in-tank pump withdrawal header and the LNG rundown line. The proposed LNG storage
tank would be equipped with four in-tank pumps, three rated at 8,806 gpm and one at 4,403 gpm.
With all four in-tank pumps operating at full rated capacity, the volume for a 10-minute spill
from the in-tank pump withdrawal header would be 308,210 gallons. Any spills from the LNG
rundown line of the liquefaction trains would include two 6,569gpm LNG transfer pumps (one
operating and one spare) and would be sloped toward trenches leading to the OSBL
Impoundment. A 10 minute spill volume from the LNG rundown line assuming three pumps
running (one operational per train) would be approximately 197,070 gallons. The OSBL
Impoundment would also contain spills from the send-out pump header to the vaporizers. Sendout equipment would include two trains utilizing 1,834-gpm send-out pumps. A 10-minute spill
from one of the send-out trains would be 18,340 gallons. These spills would all be contained in
the OSBL Impoundment. The proposed OSBL Impoundment would also be able to contain
spills from the largest vessels in these areas, including three 75,961-gallon ethylene storage
vessels, two 235,597-gallon propane storage vessels, two approximately 176,000-gallon capacity
dry gas flare knockout vessels.
Potential spills occurring from the ship transfer line and associated vessels, equipment,
piping and appurtenances would drain toward troughs, trenches, and swales and would be
directed to the Jetty Impoundment. The swales would have trapezoidal cross-sectional areas
with a minimum slope of 0.1 percent, and were confirmed to handle the maximum volumetric
flow of 52,384 gpm from the transfer line. The Jetty Impoundment would also be a cylindrical
impoundment, 70 feet in diameter by 19 feet deep, with a usable capacity of approximately
547,000 gallons. The largest spill to the Jetty Impoundment would be a 10-minute spill volume
of 528,340 gallons from a guillotine rupture of the 30-inch-diameter ship transfer (un)loading
line.
Cheniere proposes to install a stabilized condensate product storage tanks with a
maximum design volumetric capacity of 237,945 gallons. Containment for the stabilized
condensate storage tank would be provided by a concrete pad and wall with dimensions of
150 feet-long by 90 feet-wide by 4 feet-high, and a usable volume of approximately
403,948 gallons.

Design Spills

Design spills are used in the determination of the hazard calculations required by
Part 193. Prior to the incorporation of NFPA 59A in 2000, the design spill in Part 193 assumed
Environmental Impact Statement

4-172

Corpus Christi LNG

the full rupture of “a single transfer pipe which has the greatest overall flow capacity”for not
less than 10 minutes (old Part 193.2059(d)). With the adoption of NFPA 59A, the basis for the
design spill for impounding areas serving only vaporization, process, or LNG transfer areas
became the flow from any single accidental leakage source. Neither Part 193 nor NFPA 59A
(2001)defines “single accidental leakage source.”
In a letter to FERC staff, dated August 6, 2013, DOT requested that LNG facility
applicants contact the Office of Pipeline Safety's Engineering and Research Division regarding
the Part 193 siting requirements36. Specifically, the letter stated that DOT required a technical
review of the applicant’s design spill criteria for single accidental leakage sources on a case-bycase basis to determine compliance with Part 193.
In response, Cheniere provided DOT with its design spill criteria and identified leakage
scenarios for the proposed equipment. DOT reviewed the data and methodology Cheniere used
to determine the single accidental leakage sources for the design spills based on the flow from
various leakage sources including piping, containers, and equipment containing LNG,
refrigerants, and other hazardous fluids. On February 10, 2014, DOT provided a letter to FERC
staff stating that DOT had no obj
ection to Cheniere's methodology for determining the single
accidental leakage sources for candidate design spills to be used in establishing the Part 193
siting requirements for the proposed LNG liquefaction facilities37,38. The design spills produced
by this method were identified in the documents reviewed by DOT and have been filed in the
FERC docket for this proj
ect. These are the same design spills described in the following
sections.
DOT’s conclusions on the candidate design spills used in the siting calculations required
by Part 193 was based on preliminary design information which may be revised as the
engineering design progresses. If Cheniere’s design or operation of the proposed facility differs
from the details provided in the documents on which DOT based its review, then the facility may
not comply with the siting requirements of Part 193. As a result, we recommend that:
 Prior to the construction of the final design,Cheniere should file with the Secretary
for review and approval bythe Director of OEP,certification that the final design is
consistent with the information provided to DOT as described in the design spill
determination letter dated February 10,2014 (Accession Number 20140210-4008).
In the event that anymodifications to the design alters the candidate design spills on
which the Title 49 CFR Part 193siting analysis was based,Cheniere should consult
with DOT on anyactions necessaryto complywith Part 193.

As design spills vary depending on the hazard (vapor dispersion, overpressure or radiant
heat), the specific design spills used for the Cheniere siting analysis are discussed under “Vapor
Dispersion Analyses”, “Overpressure Analysis”, and “Thermal Radiation Analysis”.
4.12.5.3 Vapor Dispersion Analyses
As discussed in section 4.12.2, a release may form a toxic or flammable cloud depending
on the material released. A large quantity of flammable material released without ignition would
form a flammable vapor cloud that would travel with the prevailing wind until it either dispersed
below the flammable limit or encountered an ignition source. In order to address these hazards,
49CFR §193.2051 and 193.2059require vapor dispersion evaluation of potential incidents and
exclusion zones in accordance with applicable sections of NFPA 59A (2001). NFPA 59A,
Section 2.1.1 requires consideration of clearances between flammable refrigerant storage tanks,
flammable liquid storage tanks, structures and plant equipment, both with respect to plant
property lines and each other. This section also requires that other factors applicable to the
specific site that have a bearing on the safety of plant personnel and surrounding public be
considered, including an evaluation of potential incidents and safety measures incorporated in
the design or operation of the facility. NFPA 59A, Section 2.2.3.4 also requires provisions to
minimize the possibility of any flammable mixture of vapors from a design spill from reaching a
property line that can be built upon and that would result in a distinct hazard. Taken together,
Part 193 and NFPA 59A (2001)require that flammable vapors either from an LNG tank
impoundment or a single accidental leakage source do not extend beyond a facility property line
that can be built upon and that other potential incidents (e.g., toxic releases)must also be
considered.
Title 49CFR §193.2059requires that dispersion distances be calculated for a 2.5 percent
average gas concentration (one-half the LFL of LNG vapor)under meteorological conditions
which result in the longest downwind distances at least 90 percent of the time. Alternatively,
maximum downwind distances may be estimated for stability Class F, a wind speed of 4.5 mph,
50 percent relative humidity, and the average regional temperature. Similar safety factors (i.e.,
one half the LFL of other flammable materials and one half the AEGL of toxic materials)and
similar parameters (i.e., F stability, 2 meters per second wind speed, 50 percent relative
humidity, average regional temperature, and 0.03 meter surface roughness)have also been
specified for other hazardous fluids.
The regulations in Part 193 specifically approve the use of two models for performing
these dispersion calculations, DEGADIS and FEM3A. The use of alternative models is also
allowed, but must be specifically approved by the DOT. Although Part 193 does not require the
use of a particular source term model, modeling of the spill and resulting vapor production is
necessary prior to the use of vapor dispersion models. In August 2010, the DOT issued Advisory
Bulletin ADB-10-07 to provide guidance on obtaining approval of alternative vapor-gas
dispersion models under Subpart B of 49 CFR 193. In October 2011, two dispersion models
were approved by DOT for use in vapor dispersion exclusion zone calculations: PHAST-UDM
Version 6.6 and Version 6.7 (submitted by Det Norske Veritas)and FLACS Version 9.1 Release
2 (submitted by GexCon). PHAST 6.7 and FLACS 9.1, with their built-in source term models,
were used to calculate dispersion distances.
As discussed under “Design Spills”in section 4.12.5, failure scenarios must be selected
as the basis for the Part 193 dispersion analyses. Process conditions at the failure location would
Environmental Impact Statement

4-174

Corpus Christi LNG

affect the resulting vapor dispersion distances. In determining the spill conditions for these
leakage sources, process flow diagrams for the proposed design, used in conj
unction with the
heat and material balance information (i.e., flow, temperature, and pressure), can be used to
estimate the flow rates and process conditions at the location of the spill. In general, higher flow
rates would result in larger spills and longer dispersion distances;higher temperatures would
result in higher rates of flashing;and higher pressures would result in higher rates of j
etting and
aerosol formation. Therefore, two scenarios may be considered for each design spill:
1. The pressure in the line is assumed to be maintained by pumps and/or hydrostatic
head to produce the highest rate of flashing and jetting (i.e., flashing and j
etting
scenario);and
2. The pressure in the line is assumed to be depressurized by the breach and/or
emergency shutdowns to produce the highest rate of liquid flow within a curbed,
trenched, or impounded area (i.e., liquid scenario).
Alternatively, a single scenario for each design spill could be selected if adequately
supported with an assessment of the depressurization calculations and/or an analysis of process
instrumentation and shutdown logic acceptable to DOT.
In addition, the location and orientation of the leakage source must be considered. The
closer a leakage source is to the property line, the higher the likelihood that the vapor cloud
would extend off-site. As most flashing and j
etting scenarios would not have appreciable liquid
rainout and accumulation, the siting of impoundment systems would be driven by liquid
scenarios, while siting of piping and other remaining portions of the plant would be driven by
flashing and j
etting scenarios.
Cheniere reviewed multiple releases for the liquid scenarios and for the flashing and
j
etting scenarios. Cheniere used the following conditions, corresponding to 49CFR §193.2059,
for the vapor dispersion calculations: ambient temperature of 72°F, relative humidity of
50 percent, wind speeds of 1 to 2 meters per second in various directions, atmospheric stability
class of F and a ground surface roughness of 0.03 meter. In addition, a sensitivity analysis to the
wind speed and direction was provided to demonstrate the longest predicted downwind
dispersion distance in accordance with the PHAST and FLACS Final Decisions.
Cheniere accounted for the facility geometry, including the impoundment and trench
geometry details as established by available plant layout drawings. The plant geometry accounts
for any on-site wind channeling that could occur. The releases were initiated after sufficient time
had passed in the model simulations to allow the wind profile to stabilize from effects due to the
presence of buildings and other on-site obstructions.
Vapor Dispersion Design Spill Analyses for LNG
According to table 2.2.3.5 of NFPA 59A, design spills from containers with over the top
withdrawal lines and no bottom penetrations should be the largest flow from the container (i.e.,
storage tank)withdrawal pumps for a 10-minute duration at full-rated capacity. Design spills
from process areas should be single accidental leakage sources for a 10-minute duration.
Cheniere evaluated more than 440 different piping segments, vessels, valves, and other
equipment. Based on the failure frequency, total vapor flow rate, and location of the release,
Cheniere considered different LNG releases with varying release conditions, orientations, wind
speeds, and wind directions as described below. In order to address the highest rate of LNG flow

(i.e., liquid scenario), Cheniere evaluated multiple scenarios, including: a)full guillotine ruptures
of the 30-inch withdrawal lines of LNG Storage Tanks 1 and 2, b)a hole equivalent to 10-inchdiameter (⅓-diameter)and a full guillotine rupture at various locations in the 30-inch transfer
line from the LNG storage tanks to the Jetty Areas, c)a hole equivalent to 10-inch-diameter
(⅓-diameter)in the 30-inch transfer line from Liquefaction Train 1 to the LNG storage tanks,
and d)a hole equivalent to 5.33-inch-diameter (⅓-diameter)in the 16-inch transfer line from the
LNG storage tanks to Liquefaction Train 3.
The full guillotine rupture of the withdrawal line from the LNG storage tanks was
assumed to be at the maximum sendout flow rate of 52,834 gpm for a 10-minute duration based
on two of the three tanks operating three of its four pumps at the rated capacities of 8,806 gpm
(or three tanks operating two of its four pumps). This exceeds the maximum flow rate from a
withdrawal line from a single tank with all four pumps running at their maximum pump runout.
This design spill was evaluated at LNG Storage Tank 1 (closest LNG storage tank to the property
line)and at LNG Storage Tank 2 prior to its change in dimensions and relocation farther away
from the property line. LNG Storage Tank 3 would be the farthest from the property line and
LNG vapors would be expected to disperse no farther than LNG Storage Tank 1 or 2. The spills
were assumed to be completely liquid.
The 10-inch-diameter (⅓-diameter)equivalent hole in the 30-inch transfer line from the
storage tanks to the Jetty Areas was calculated to produce a 17,119gpm flow rate based on the
orifice equation and process conditions. This spill was evaluated at the send-out equipment
nearest to the property line, at the transition in the direction of the trenchway nearest to the
occupied buildings, and at the West and East Jetty Areas. A full guillotine rupture in the 30-inch
transfer line was also modeled and assumed to be at the be at the maximum sendout flow rate of
52,834 gpm for a 10-minute duration based on two of the three tanks operating three of its four
pumps at the rated capacities of 8,806 gpm (3 pumps for export)and 4,403gpm (1 pump for
sendout). This spill was evaluated at various locations along the transfer line, including at the
OSBL Impoundment, at the send-out equipment nearest to the property line, at the transition in
direction of the spillway nearest to the occupied buildings, and at the Jetty Sump. All spills were
assumed to be completely liquid.
The 10-inch-diameter (⅓-diameter) equivalent hole in the 30-inch transfer line from
Liquefaction Train 1 to the LNG storage tanks was assumed to be at a maximum flow rate of
19,677 gpm for a 10-minute duration based on three trains running one of their two pumps at full
rated capacity of 6,569gpm. The spill was evaluated at Liquefaction Train 1 and was assumed
to be completely liquid.
The 5.33-inch-diameter (⅓-diameter)equivalent hole in the 16-inch transfer line from
Liquefaction Train 3 to the storage tanks was calculated to produce a 6,374 gpm flow rate based
on the orifice equation and process conditions. The spill was evaluated at Liquefaction Train 3
and was assumed to be completely liquid.
Cheniere used PHAST Version 6.7 to perform diameter, wind, and elevation sensitivity
studies in order to address the highest rate of LNG vapor flow (i.e., flashing and j
etting scenario).
The sensitivity analysis led Cheniere to evaluate multiple scenarios, including: a)a full guillotine
rupture of a 3-inch-diameter cooldown line attached to a 16-inch transfer pump discharge, b)a
full guillotine rupture of a 4-inch-diameter line attached to a 16-inch transfer pump discharge, c)
a full guillotine rupture of a 4-inch-diameter line attached to a 10-inch-diameter high pressure

the shoreline to the East Jetty, and e)a hole equivalent to 2.23-inch-diameter in the LNG storage
tank withdrawal line.
The full guillotine of a 3-inch diameter line was calculated to produce 2,209gpm flow
rate based on the orifice equation and process conditions. The spill was evaluated at
Liquefaction Train 1 and was determined to produce no liquid rainout (i.e., all vapor).
The full guillotine of a 4-inch-diameter cooldown line was calculated to produce
3,927 gpm flow rate based on the orifice equation and process conditions. The spill was
evaluated at Liquefaction Train 3 and was determined to produce no liquid rainout (i.e., all
vapor).
The full guillotine of a 4-inch-diameter line was assumed to produce 2,180 gpm flow rate
for a 10-minute duration based on the pump operating at the maximum flow of 2,180 gpm. The
spill was evaluated at the send-out pump area and was determined to produce no liquid rainout
(i.e., all vapor).
The 8-inch-diameter equivalent hole in the 20-inch transfer line from the shoreline to the
East Jetty was calculated to produce 10,955 gpm based on the design flow rate of the line. The
release was evaluated at the East Jetty and was determine to produce. Shrouds were installed to
minimize j
etting effects and resulted in 97 percent rainout.
The 2.23-inch-diameter equivalent hole in the LNG storage tank withdrawal line
representative of a gasket failure was calculated to produce 1,226 gpm based on the orifice
equation. The release was evaluated at the top of the northern most LNG storage tank.
The LNG releases are summarized in table 4.12-5. DOT staff reviewed the methodology
used to select these design spills and had no obj
ection at the time of its review.

Vapor Dispersion Design Spill Analyses for Other Hazardous Fluids
In addition to the 13 LNG releases evaluated, Cheniere considered 14 other hazardous
fluid releases after using PHAST Version 6.7 to perform diameter sensitivity, wind sensitivity,
and elevation sensitivity studies. The sensitivity analysis led Cheniere to evaluate multiple
scenarios, including: a)a full guillotine rupture of a 3-inch-diameter line attached to a 24-inchdiameter ethylene line from the Ethylene Surge Drum to the Ethylene Economizer at the
Ethylene Cold Box b)a full guillotine rupture of the 2-inch-diameter line attached to a 36-inch
propane line from the Propane Condensers to the Propane Accumulator c)a hole equivalent to
1-inch-diameter in the 4-inch-diameter discharge of the Heavy Reflux Pumps, d)a hole
equivalent to 1-inch-diameter in a 24-inch acid gas line from the Solvent Regenerator Reflux
Drum to the Hydrogen Sulfide Removal Skids at the Acid Gas Removal Unit, e) a hole
equivalent to 1-inch-diameter in the 4-inch-diameter discharge of the Condensate Pumps at the
Condensate Storage Area, f)a full guillotine rupture of the 2-inch-diameter ethylene transfer

The full guillotine rupture of the 3-inch-diameter line at the Ethylene Cold Box was
calculated to produce 4,571 gpm for a 10-minute duration based on the orifice equation and
process conditions. The spill was evaluated at Liquefaction Trains 1, 2, and 3, and was
determined to produce no liquid rainout (i.e., all vapor).
The full guillotine rupture of the 2-inch-diameter line at the Propane Accumulator was
calculated to produce 1,520 gpm for a 10-minute duration based on the orifice equation and
process conditions. The spill was evaluated at Liquefaction Trains 1, 2, and 3, and was
determined to produce no liquid rainout (i.e., all vapor).
The 1-inch-diameter equivalent hole at the discharge of the Heavy Reflux Pumps was
determined to be at a flow rate of 199gpm for a 10-minute duration based on one of two pumps

and was determined to produce the largest amount of vapor.
The 1-inch-diameter equivalent hole at the Acid Gas Removal Unit was calculated to
produce a flow rate of 1,221 gpm based on the orifice equation and process conditions. The spill
was evaluated at Liquefaction Trains 1, 2, and 3, and would produce all vapor.
The 1-inch-diameter equivalent hole at the discharge of the Condensate Pumps was
determined to be at a flow rate of 100 gpm for a 10-minute duration based on one of two pumps
running at rated capacity of 100 gpm. The spill was evaluated at the Condensate Storage Area,
and was determined to produce the largest amount of vapor.
The full guillotine rupture of the 2-inch-diameter ethylene transfer hose was determined
to be at a flow rate of 50 gpm for a 10-minute duration based on the design flow rate from a
delivery truck. The spill was evaluated at the Refrigerant Storage Area, and was determined to
produce no liquid rainout (i.e., all vapor).
The full guillotine rupture of the 2-inch-diameter propane transfer hose was determined
to be at the maximum pump flow rate of 50 gpm for a 10-minute duration based on the design
flow rate from a delivery truck. The spill was evaluated at the Refrigerant Storage Area, and was
determined to produce no liquid rainout (i.e., all vapor).

FLACS was used to predict the extent of the ½ LFL vapor cloud. Since the acid gas
would contain the toxic component, H2S, and the stabilized condensate would contain toxic
components of benzene, toluene, ethylebenzene, and xylene, Cheniere also calculated the
dispersion distances to toxic threshold exposure limits based on the toxicity levels that were at or
below ½ AEGLs.
Vapor Dispersion Analyses for LNG and Other Hazardous Fluids
Cheniere proposes to install a series of 20-foot, 12-foot, and 10-foot-high vapor fences, as
shown in figure 4.12-1, as well as a shroud surrounding a portion of their transfer lines near their
East and West Docks to limit the vapor cloud dispersion distances.

Environmental Impact Statement

Figure 4.12-1

Vapor Fences (20 feet high in green; 12 feet high in yellow; 10 feet high in purple)

Cheniere stated that the vapor fences would be routinely inspected by personnel and
repaired as necessary. The design of the vapor fences would be completed during detailed
engineering. In order to ensure that the vapor barriers are maintained throughout the life of the
facility, we recommend that:
 Prior to construction of the final design,Cheniere should file with the Secretaryfor
review and written approval bythe Director of OEP,the details of the vapor fences
as well as procedures to maintain and inspect the vapor barriers provided to meet
the siting provisions of 49 CFR § 193.2059. This information should be filed a
minimum of 30 days before approval to proceed is requested.
As shown in figure 4.12-2, the FLACS results indicated that the vapor dispersion hazards
would primarily remain within the Cheniere property line with the exception of limited areas that
would still remain within areas of legal control by Cheniere through exclusion zone agreements
with Alcoa, Sherwin, and the Port. These exclusion zone agreements have been reviewed by
DOT staff, who raised no obj
ections at the time of review.

Flammable and Toxic Vapor Cloud Dispersion Contours

As a result, we conclude that the siting of the proposed Proj
ect would not have a
significant impact on public safety. If the facility is constructed and operated, compliance with
the requirements of 49 CFR 193 would be addressed as part of DOT’s inspection and
enforcement program.
All vapor fences would be required to meet 49CFR 193 regulations. However, the
10-foot-high vapor fence along the transfer line was not included in later model submittals.
Therefore, we recommend that:
 Prior to the end of the draft environmental impact statement comment period,
Cheniere should file with the Secretary for review and written approval by the
Director of OEP,clarification if a 10-foot vapor fence would be provided to mitigate
vapor dispersion from releases when the ambient air vaporizers are operational.
4.12.5.4

Overpressure Analysis

As discussed in section 4.12.2, the propensity of a vapor cloud to detonate or produce
damaging overpressures is influenced by the reactivity of the material, the level of confinement
and congestion surrounding and within the vapor cloud, and the flame travel distance. It is
possible that the prevailing wind direction may cause the vapor cloud to travel into a partially
confined or congested area.

Environmental Impact Statement

4-182

Corpus Christi LNG

LNG Vapor Clouds
As adopted by Part 193, Section 2.1.1 of NFPA 59A (2001)requires an evaluation of
potential incidents and safety measures incorporated in the design or operation of the facility be
considered. As discussed under “Flammable Vapor Ignition”in section 4.12.2, unconfined LNG
vapor clouds would not be expected to produce damaging overpressures.
The potential for unconfined LNG vapor cloud detonations was investigated by the Coast
Guard in the late 1970s at the Naval Weapons Center in China Lake, California. Using methane,
the primary component of natural gas, several experiments were conducted to determine whether
unconfined LNG vapor clouds would detonate. Unconfined methane vapor clouds ignited with
low-energy ignition sources (13.5 j
oules), produced flame speeds ranging from 12 to 20 mph.
These flame speeds are much lower than the flame speeds associated with a deflagration with
damaging overpressures or a detonation.
To examine the potential for detonation of an unconfined natural gas cloud containing
heavier hydrocarbons that are more reactive, such as ethane and propane, the Coast Guard
conducted further tests on ambient-temperature fuel mixtures of methane-ethane and methanepropane. The tests indicated that the addition of heavier hydrocarbons influenced the tendency
of an unconfined natural gas vapor cloud to detonate. Less processed natural gas with greater
amounts of heavier hydrocarbons would be more sensitive to detonation.
The Coast Guard indicated overpressures of 4 bar and flame speeds of 78 mph were
produced from vapor clouds of 86 percent to 96 percent methane in near stoichiometric
proportions using exploding charges as the ignition source. The 4 bar overpressure was the same
overpressure produced during the calibration test involving exploding the charge ignition source
alone, so it remains unclear that the overpressure was attributable to the vapor deflagration.
Additional tests were conducted to study the influence of confinement and congestion on
the propensity of a vapor cloud to detonate or produce damaging overpressures. The tests used
obstacles to create a partially confined and turbulent scenario, but found that flame speeds
developed for methane were not significantly higher than the unconfined case and were not in
the range associated with detonations.
Although it has been possible to produce damaging overpressures and detonations of
unconfined LNG vapor clouds, the Proj
ect would be designed to receive feed gas with methane
concentrations as low as 90 percent, which are not in the range shown to exhibit overpressures
and flame speeds associated with high-order explosions and detonations. Although Cheniere did
not identify any specific LNG imports with methane concentrations below 89percent, Cheniere
had stated that the Proj
ect may receive LNG from various foreign sources, and has considered
methane concentrations as low as 84 percent in the design of the facility. These concentrations
could provide a higher propensity to produce damaging overpressures if ignited, but would be
less reactive than propane or ethylene stored onsite and handled in areas with less congestion and
confinement. In addition, the substantial amount of initiating explosives needed to create the
shock initiation during the limited range of vapor-air concentrations also renders the possibility
of detonation of these vapors at an LNG plant as unrealistic.
Ignition of a confined LNG vapor cloud could result in higher overpressures. In order to
prevent such an occurrence, Cheniere would take measures to mitigate the vapor dispersion and
ignition into confined areas, such as buildings. Building would be located away from process

areas and combustion and ventilation air intake equipment would be required to have hazard
detection devices that enable isolation of the air dampers. Hazard detection with shutdown
capability would also be installed at air intakes of combustion equipment whose continued
operation could add to, or sustain, an emergency. In general, the primary hazards to the public
from an LNG spill that disperses to an unconfined area, either on land or water, would be from
dispersion of the flammable vapors or from radiant heat generated by a pool fire.
Vapor Clouds from Other Hazardous Fluids
In comparison with LNG vapor clouds, there is a higher potential for unconfined propane
clouds to produce damaging overpressures, and an even higher potential for unconfined ethylene
vapor clouds to produce damaging overpressures. Unconfined ethylene vapor clouds also have
the potential to transition to a detonation much more readily than propane. This has been shown
by multiple experiments conducted by the Explosion Research Cooperative to develop predictive
blast wave models for low, medium, and high reactivity fuels and varying degrees of congestion
and confinement39. The experiments used methane, propane, and ethylene, as the respective low,
medium, and high reactivity fuels. In addition, the tests showed that if methane, propane, or
ethylene is ignited within a confined space, such as in a building, they all have the potential to
produce damaging overpressures. The refrigerant streams would contain all three of these
components (i.e., methane, propane, and ethylene). Therefore, a potential exists for unconfined
vapor clouds that could produce damaging overpressures in the event of a release of propane or
ethylene.
In order to evaluate this hazard, Cheniere used FLACS to perform an overpressure
analysis. Cheniere used the vapor dispersion results, previously discussed in “Vapor Dispersion
Analyses”. Due to the highest reactivity, releases of ethylene from the liquefaction process area
dispersing to the most confined and congested regions of the plant were evaluated in the
overpressure analyses. Various ignition locations and times were evaluated to predict the worst
case overpressure distances. Releases of methane and propane and subsequent ignition would be
less severe due to their lower reactivity. The overpressure scenarios evaluated are summarized
in table 4.12-7.

As shown in Figure 4.12-3, the FLACS results indicated that the maximum extent of
1 psi overpressures with a safety factor of 2 (i.e., ½ psi overpressure)would remain within the
Cheniere property line.

Figure 4.12-3

Vapor Cloud Explosion Overpressure Contours

Overpressures were also evaluated at the proposed LNG storage tanks, which would be as
high as 9psi. Cheniere indicated that the LNG storage tank would be designed for this external
blast loading. Cheniere indicated that the LNG storage tanks would be designed to withstand
this overpressure. Proj
ect specifications have been included that reflect this. In order to ensure
that the LNG storage tanks can withstand this overpressure, we recommend:
 Prior to construction of the final design,Cheniere should file with the Secretaryfor
review and approval bythe Director of OEP,the details of the LNG storage tank
structural design that demonstrates the tanks can withstand overpressures from
ignition of design spills. This information should be filed a minimum of 30 days
before approval to proceed is requested.
As a result, we conclude that the siting of the proposed Proj
ect would not have a
significant impact on public safety. If the facility is constructed and operated, compliance with

the requirements of 49 CFR 193 would be addressed as part of DOT’s inspection and
enforcement program.
4.12.5.5 Thermal Radiation Analysis
As discussed in section 4.12.2, if flammable vapors are ignited, the deflagration could
propagate back to the spill source and result in a pool fire causing high levels of thermal
radiation (i.e., heat from a fire). In order to address this, 49 CFR §193.2051 and §193.2057
require evaluation of thermal radiation hazards of potential incidents and exclusion zones in
accordance with applicable sections of NFPA 59A (2001). Together, Part 193 and NFPA 59A
(2001)specify different hazard endpoints for spills into LNG storage tank containment and spills
into impoundments for process or transfer areas. For LNG storage tank spills, there are three
radiant heat flux levels which must be considered:
 1,600 Btu/ft2-hr - This level can extend beyond the facility’s property line that can
be built upon but cannot include areas that, at the time of facility siting, are used
for outdoor assembly by groups of 50 or more persons;
 3,000 Btu/ft2-hr - This level can extend beyond the facility’s property line that can
be built upon but cannot include areas that, at the time of facility siting, contain
assembly, educational, health care, detention or residential buildings or structures;
and
 10,000 Btu/ft2-hr - This level cannot extend beyond the facility’s property line
that can be built upon.
The requirements for spills from process or transfer areas are more stringent. For these
impoundments, the 1,600 Btu/ft2-hr flux level cannot extend beyond the facility’s property line
that can be built upon. Other potential incidents that could have a bearing on the safety of plant
personnel or surrounding public are also required to be evaluated under NFPA 59A, Section
2.1.1.
Part 193 requires the use of the LNGFIRE3 computer program model developed by the
Gas Research Institute to determine the extent of the thermal radiation distances. Part 193
stipulates that the wind speed, ambient temperature, and relative humidity that produce the
maximum exclusion distances must be used, except for conditions that occur less than 5 percent
of the time based on recorded data for the area. Cheniere selected the following ambient
conditions to produce the maximum exclusion distances: wind speeds of 15 to 28 mph, ambient
temperature of 34°F, and 40 percent relative humidity. We agree with Cheniere’s selection of
atmospheric conditions.
For its LNG storage tank analysis, Cheniere calculated thermal radiation distances using
LNGFIRE3 for the 1,600-, 3,000-, and 10,000-Btu/ft2-hr incident radiant heat levels using an
inner tank concrete wall inner diameter (261 feet)as the pool diameter. This diameter was based
on the initial LNG storage tank design, which is larger than the updated outer concrete wall outer
diameter (258.5 feet)and therefore would be conservative. The flame base was set equal to an
approximate height of the concrete wall (150 feet)above the surrounding terrain. This flame
height was based on the initial LNG storage tank design, which is lower than the updated outer
concrete container height (169.5 feet)and therefore would be conservative. Target heights were
set at the ground level.

Corpus Christi LNG

For its Impoundment analysis, Cheniere calculated thermal radiation distances using
LNGFIRE3 for the 1,600-Btu/ft2-hr incident radiant heat level centered on the OSBL and Jetty
Impoundments. The OSBL and Jetty Impoundments are both 70 feet in diameter. The fire base
is conservatively assumed to be at ground elevation.
For other potential incidents, such as ethylene, propane, or NGL spills or a pool fire
within the condensate storage tank impoundment, Cheniere also calculated thermal radiation
distances using LNGFIRE3 for the 1,600-, 3,000-, and 10,000-Btu/ft2-hr incident radiant heat
levels. Although LNGFIRE3 is specifically designed to calculate thermal radiation flux levels
for LNG pool fires, LNGFIRE3 could also be used to conservatively calculate the thermal
radiation flux levels for flammable hydrocarbons such as ethylene, propane, NGL, and
condensate. Two of the parameters used by LNGFIRE3 to calculate the thermal radiation flux
are the mass burning rate of the fuel and the surface emissive power (SEP)of the flame, which is
an average value of the thermal radiation flux emitted by the fire. The mass burning rate and
SEP of an ethylene, propane, NGL, or condensate fire would be less than an equally sized LNG
fire. Since the thermal radiation from a pool fire is dependent on the mass burning rate and SEP,
the thermal radiation distances required for ethylene, propane, NGL, and condensate fires would
not extend as far as the exclusion zone distance previously calculated for an LNG fire in the
same sump. For condensate spills into the condensate impoundment, Cheniere modeled a pool
fire within the impoundment, which measures 150ft by 90ft. The flame base was conservatively
assumed to be at ground level.
As shown in table 4.12-8 and figure 4.12-4, the 10,000-, 3,000-, and 1,600-Btu/ft2-hr heat
fluxes from the LNG storage tank, OSBL Impoundment, Jetty Impoundment, and condensate
storage impoundment would remain within the facility property lines. In addition, as shown in
figure 4.12-1, radiant heat flux from the flares would not impact personnel or the public.

Fires from trenches would not be expected to extend beyond the vapor dispersion
distances from the trenches and would not be expected to be of sufficient duration to warrant a
hazard to the public. FERC staff also evaluated j
et fires from various piping and found that the
j
et fires radiant heat to 5 kiloWatts per square meter (kW/m2)would extend a limited extent
beyond the property line, and not onto any structures. In addition, it is possible that the vapor
fences may in fact block the radiant heat from extending beyond the property line.
As a result, we conclude that the siting of the proposed Proj
ect would not have a
significant impact on public safety. If the facility is constructed and operated, compliance with
the requirements of 49 CFR 193 would be addressed as part of DOT’s inspection and
enforcement program.
4.12.5.6

Cascading Events

Although Cheniere proposes to install the propane and ethylene storage vessels away
from other equipment, the propane and ethylene storage vessels could be subj
ect to radiant heat
exposure from a LNG storage tank roof top fire. In order to mitigate this potential, Cheniere
proposes to install radiant heat shields to protect the ethylene and propane storage vessels. The
radiant heat shields would result in negligible risk of a BLEVE occurring at the refrigerant
storage area from a LNG storage tank roof top fire.

In addition, Cheniere would have pressure and level instrumentation, fire detection,
emergency isolation and depressurization valves, passive fire protection, fire suppression units,
and remotely activated firewater monitors to mitigate the potential of a BLEVE from an adj
acent
j
et fire. As a result, we conclude that the siting of the proposed Proj
ect would not have a
significant impact on public safety.
4.12.6

LNG Carrier Hazards

Since 1959, ships have transported LNG without a maj
or release of cargo or a maj
or
accident involving an LNG carrier. There are more than 370 LNG carriers in operation routinely
transporting LNG between more than 100 import/export terminals currently in operation
worldwide. Since U.S. LNG terminals first began operating under FERC j
urisdiction in the
1970s, there have been more than 2,600 individual LNG carrier arrivals at terminals in the U.S.
For more than 40 years, LNG shipping operations have been safely conducted in U.S. ports and
waterways.
Cheniere has not identified specific source(s)for LNG import or export destinations for
the proposed Proj
ect. LNG could be obtained from terminals throughout the world and delivered
by LNG carriers to the proposed Terminal. There are 19 countries which provide LNG for
export: Algeria; Angola, Australia, Brunei, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, Libya,
Malaysia, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Peru, Qatar, Russia, Trinidad & Tobago, United Arab
Emirates, United States, and Yemen with another 5 countries intending to develop export
facilities: Columbia, Canada, Iran, Papua New Guinea, and Venezuela. Cheniere has stated that
the proposed Terminal would be for a wide range of LNG import compositions, including from
Trinidad & Tobago (lean LNG)and Nigeria (rich LNG)
LNG from the Terminal may also be exported to any importing terminal throughout the
world for which Cheniere has authorization to export.40 There are 29 countries which have
facilities to receive LNG: Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Dominican
Republic, England, France, Greece, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico,
Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey,
United Arab Emirates, United States, and Wales with another 9planned or under construction:
Albania, Croatia, Cyprus, Germany, Ireland, Lithuania, Pakistan, Philippines, and Poland.
Although LNG could be sent to any of these, Cheniere has stated that its export would likely be
to Latin America, Asia, and Europe.
4.12.6.1

Past LNG Carrier Incidents

A review of the history of LNG maritime transportation indicates that there has not been
a serious accident at sea or in a port which resulted in a spill due to rupturing of the cargo tanks.
However, insurance records, industry sources, and public websites identify a number of incidents
involving LNG carriers, including minor collisions with other vessels of all sizes, groundings,
minor LNG releases during cargo unloading operations, and mechanical/equipment failures
typical of large vessels. Some of the more significant occurrences, representing the range of
incidents experienced by the worldwide LNG carrier fleet, are described below:

 El Paso Paul Kayser grounded on a rock in June 1979in the Straits of Gibraltar
during a loaded voyage from Algeria to the United States. Extensive bottom
damage to the ballast tanks resulted;however, no cargo was released because no
damage was done to the cargo tanks. The entire cargo of LNG was subsequently
transferred to another LNG carrier and delivered to its U.S. destination.
 Tellier was blown by severe winds from its docking berth at Skikda, Algeria in
February 1989 causing damage to the loading arms and the vessel and shore
piping. The cargo loading had been secured j
ust before the wind struck, but the
loading arms had not been drained. Consequently, the LNG remaining in the
loading arms spilled onto the deck, causing fracture of some plating.
 Mostefa Ben Boulaid had an electrical fire in the engine control room during
unloading at Everett, Massachusetts. The ship crew extinguished the fire and the
ship completed unloading.
 Khannur had a cargo tank overfill into the vessel’s vapor handling system on
September 10, 2001, during unloading at Everett, Massachusetts. Approximately
100 gallons of LNG were vented and sprayed onto the protective decking over the
cargo tank dome, resulting in several cracks. After inspection by the Coast
Guard, the Khannur was allowed to discharge its LNG cargo.
 Mostefa Ben Boulaid had LNG spill onto its deck during loading operations in
Algeria in 2002. The spill, which is believed to have been caused by overflow
rather than a mechanical failure, caused significant brittle fracturing of the
steelwork. The vessel was required to discharge its cargo, after which it
proceeded to dock for repair.
 Norman Ladywas struck by the USS Oklahoma City nuclear submarine while
the submarine was rising to periscope depth near the Strait of Gibraltar in
November 2002. The 87,000 m3 LNG carrier, which had j
ust unloaded its cargo
at Barcelona, Spain, sustained only minor damage to the outer layer of its double
hull but no damage to its cargo tanks.
 Tenaga Lima grounded on rocks while proceeding to open sea east of Mopko,
South Korea due to strong current in November 2004. The shell plating was torn
open and fractured over an approximate area of 20 by 80 feet, and internal
breaches allowed water to enter the insulation space between the primary and
secondary membranes. The vessel was refloated, repaired, and returned to
service.
 Golar Freeze moved away from its docking berth during unloading on
March 14, 2006, in Savannah, Georgia. The powered emergency release
couplings on the unloading arms activated as designed, and transfer operations
were shut down.
 Catalunya Spirit lost propulsion and became adrift 35 miles east of Chatham,
Massachusetts on February 11, 2008. Four tugs towed the vessel to a safe
anchorage for repairs. The Catalunya Spirit was repaired and taken to port to
discharge its cargo.

 Al Gharrafa collided with a container ship, Hanjin Italy, in the Malacca Strait
off Singapore on December 19, 2013. The bow of the Al Gharrafa and the
middle of the starboard side of the Hanjin were damaged. Both ships were safely
anchored after the incident. No losses of LNG, fatalities, or inj
uries were
reported.
4.12.6.2

LNG Carrier RegulatoryOversight

The Coast Guard exercises regulatory authority over LNG carriers under 46 CFR 154,
which contains the United States safety standards for vessels carrying LNG in bulk. The LNG
carriers visiting the proposed facility would also be constructed and operated in accordance with
the International Maritime Organization (IMO)Code for the Construction and Equipment of
Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at
Sea. All LNG carriers entering U.S. waters are required to possess a valid IMO Certificate of
Fitness and either a Coast Guard Certificate of Inspection (for U.S. flag vessels)or a Coast
Guard Certificate of Compliance (for foreign flag vessels). These documents certify that the
vessel is designed and operating in accordance with both international standards and the U.S.
regulations for bulk LNG carriers under Title 46 CFR Part 154.
The LNG carriers which would deliver or receive LNG to or from the proposed facility
would also need to comply with various U.S. and international security requirements. The IMO
adopted the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code in 2003. This code requires both
ships and ports to conduct vulnerability assessments and to develop security plans. The purpose
of the code is to prevent and suppress terrorism against ships;improve security aboard ships and
ashore;and reduce the risk to passengers, crew, and port personnel on board ships and in port
areas. All LNG carriers, as well as other cargo vessels 500 gross tons and larger, and ports
servicing those regulated vessels, must adhere to the IMO standards. Some of the IMO
requirements for ships are as follows:
 ships must develop security plans and have a Vessel Security Officer;
 ships must have a ship security alert system. These alarms transmit ship-to-shore
security alerts identifying the ship, its location, and indication that the security of
the ship is under threat or has been compromised;
 ships must have a comprehensive security plan for international port facilities,
focusing on areas having direct contact with ships;and
 ships may have equipment onboard to help maintain or enhance the physical
security of the ship.
In 2002, the MTSA was enacted by the U.S. Congress and aligned domestic regulations
with the maritime security standards of the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code
and the Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk and
the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. The resulting Coast Guard
regulations, contained in 33 CFR 104, require vessels to conduct vulnerability assessments and
develop corresponding security plans. All LNG carriers servicing the facility would have to
comply with the MTSA requirements and associated regulations while in U.S. waters.
The Coast Guard also exercises regulatory authority over LNG facilities that affect the
safety and security of port areas and navigable waterways under Executive Order 10173;the
Environmental Impact Statement

4-191

Corpus Christi LNG

Magnuson Act (50 USC Section 191);the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972, as amended
(33 USC Section 1221, et seq.);and the MTSA of 2002 (46 USC Section 701). The Coast Guard
is responsible for matters related to navigation safety, carrier engineering and safety standards,
and all matters pertaining to the safety of facilities or equipment located in or adj
acent to
navigable waters up to the last valve immediately before the receiving tanks. The Coast Guard
also has authority for LNG facility security plan review, approval, and compliance verification as
provided in Title 33 CFR Part 105.
The Coast Guard regulations in 33 CFR 127 apply to the marine transfer area of
waterfront facilities between the LNG carrier and the first manifold or valve located inside the
containment. Title 33 CFR 127 regulates the design, construction, equipment, operations,
inspections, maintenance, testing, personnel training, firefighting, and security of LNG
waterfront facilities. The safety systems, including communications, emergency shutdown, gas
detection, and fire protection, must comply with the regulations in 33 CFR 127. Under §
127.019, Cheniere would be required to submit two copies of its Operations and Emergency
Manuals to the Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP)for examination.
Both the Coast Guard regulations under 33 CFR 127 and FERC regulations under
18 CFR 157.21, require an applicant who intends to build an LNG import facility to submit a
Letter of Intent to the Coast Guard at the same time the pre-filing process is initiated with the
Commission.
In addition to the Letter of Intent, 33 CFR 127 and FERC regulations require each LNG
proj
ect applicant to submit a WSA to the cognizant COTP no later than the start of the FERC
pre-filing process. Until a facility begins operation, applicants must annually review their WSAs
and submit a report to the COTP as to whether changes are required. The WSA must include the
following information:
 port characterization;
 risk assessment for maritime safety and security;
 risk management strategies;and
 resource needs for maritime safety, security, and response.
In order to provide the Coast Guard COTPs/Federal Maritime Security Coordinators,
members of the LNG industry, and port stakeholders with guidance on assessing the suitability
of a waterway for LNG marine traffic, the Coast Guard has published a Navigation and Vessel
Inspection Circular –Guidance on Assessing the Suitability of a Waterway for Liquefied Natural
Gas (LNG) Marine Traffic (NVIC 01-11).
As described in 33 CFR 127 and in NVIC 01-11, the applicant develops the WSA in two
phases. The first phase is the submittal of the Preliminary WSA, which begins the Coast Guard’s
review process to determine the suitability of the waterway for LNG marine traffic. The second
phase is the submittal of the Follow-On WSA. This document is reviewed and validated by the
Coast Guard and forms the basis for the agency’s recommendation to the FERC.
The Preliminary WSA provides an outline which characterizes the port community and
the proposed facility and transit routes. It provides an overview of the expected maj
or impacts
LNG operations may have on the port, but does not contain detailed studies or conclusions. This

Environmental Impact Statement

4-192

Corpus Christi LNG

document is used to start the Coast Guard’s scoping process for evaluating the suitability of the
waterway for LNG marine traffic.
The Follow-On WSA must provide a detailed and accurate characterization of the LNG
facility, the LNG tanker route, and the port area. The assessment should identify appropriate risk
mitigation measures for credible security threats and safety hazards. The Follow-on WSA
provides a complete analysis of the topics outlined in the Preliminary WSA. It should identify
credible security threats and navigational safety hazards for the LNG marine traffic, along with
appropriate risk management measures and the resources (federal, state, local, and private sector)
needed to carry out those measures.
NVIC 01-11 directs the use of the three concentric Zones of Concern, based on LNG
carriers with a cargo carrying capacity up to 265,000 m³, used to assess the maritime safety and
security risks of LNG marine traffic. The Zones of Concern are:
 Zone 1 – impacts on structures and organisms are expected to be significant
within 500 meters (1,640 feet). The outer perimeter of Zone 1 is approximately
the distance to thermal hazards of 37.5 kW/m2 (12,000 Btu/ft2-hr)from a pool
fire.
 Zone 2 –impacts would be significant but reduced, and damage from radiant heat
levels are expected to transition from severe to minimal between 500 and
1,600 meters (1,640 and 5,250 feet). The outer perimeter of Zone 2 is
approximately the distance to thermal hazards of 5 kW/m2 (1,600 Btu/ft2-hr)from
a pool fire.
 Zone 3 –impacts on people and property from a pool fire or an un-ignited LNG
spill are expected to be minimal between 1,600 meters (5,250 feet) and a
conservative maximum distance of 3,500 meters (11,500 feet or 2.2 miles). The
outer perimeter of Zone 3 should be considered the vapor cloud dispersion
distance to the LFL from a worst case un-ignited release. Impacts to people and
property could be significant if the vapor cloud reaches an ignition source and
burns back to the source.
Once the applicant submits a complete Follow-On WSA, the Coast Guard reviews the
document to determine if it presents a realistic and credible analysis of the public safety and
security implications from LNG marine traffic in the port.
As required by its regulations (33 CFR 127.009), the Coast Guard is responsible for
issuing a LOR to the FERC regarding the suitability of the waterway for LNG marine traffic with
respect to the following items:
 physical location and description of the facility;
 the LNG carrier’s characteristics and the frequency of LNG shipments to or from
the facility;
 waterway channels and commercial, industrial, environmentally sensitive, and
residential areas in and adj
acent to the waterway used by LNG carriers en route to
the facility, within 25 kilometers (15.5 miles)of the facility;
 density and character of marine traffic in the waterway;
Environmental Impact Statement

4-193

Corpus Christi LNG

 locks, bridges, or other manmade obstructions in the waterway;
 depth of water;
 tidal range;
 protection from high seas;
 natural hazards, including reefs, rocks, and sandbars;
 underwater pipes and cables;and
 distance of berthed vessels from the channel and the width of the channel.
The Coast Guard may also prepare an LOR Analysis, which serves as a record of review
of the LOR and contains detailed information along with the rationale used in assessing the
suitability of the waterway for LNG marine traffic.
4.12.6.3 Cheniere’s WaterwaySuitabilityAssessment
In a letter to the Coast Guard dated December 13, 2011, Cheniere submitted a Letter of
Intent and a Preliminary WSA to the COTP, Sector Corpus Christi to notify the Coast Guard that
it proposed to construct an LNG terminal. In the development of the Follow-On WSA, Cheniere
consulted with the Coast Guard, the Area Maritime Security Committee, and other port
stakeholders. As part of its assessment of the safety and security aspects of this proj
ect, the
COTP Sector Corpus Christi consulted various safety and security working groups, including the
Area Maritime Security Committee, Harbor Safety Committee, and Corpus Christi Port Security
Working Group. In addition, the Coast Guard participated in meetings with the Port of Corpus
Christi Authority, the Aransas-Corpus Christi Pilots, a focused La Quinta user group, and other
federal, state, and local agencies.
Cheniere submitted the Follow-On WSA to the Coast Guard on August 30, 2012 with an
Addendum submitted on January 28, 2013.
LNG Carrier Routes and Hazard Analysis
An LNG carrier’s transit to and from the Terminal would enter/exit at Port Aransas and
pass by Harbor Island and Pelican Island, before turning at Ingleside at the Bay near Cooks
Island. The LNG carrier would head north by Quinta Island before reaching its final destination
at the Cheniere Proj
ect. Pilotage is compulsory for foreign vessels and U.S. vessels under
registry in foreign trade when in U.S. waters. All deep draft ships currently entering the shared
waterway would employ a U.S. pilot. The National Vessel Movement Center in the U.S. would
require a 96-hour advance notice of arrival for deep draft vessels calling on U.S. ports. A LNG
carrier port time with pilotage would be approximately three to four hours for inbound and
outbound transits with transit speeds of approximately 5 to 20 knots depending on the location,
weather, sea state, and vessel traffic in the area. During transit, vessels would be required to
maintain voice contact with controllers and check in on designated frequencies at established
way points.
NVIC 01-11 references the “Zones of Concern”for assisting in a risk assessment of the
waterway. As LNG carriers proceed along the intended track line, Hazard Zone 1 would
encompass coastal areas along Port Aransas, including University of Texas Marine Science
Institute, US Coast Guard Port Aransas Station, and Roberts Point Park. Hazard Zone 1 would
Environmental Impact Statement

4-194

Corpus Christi LNG

also encircle coastal areas along Ingleside consisting primarily of industrial facilities. Portions of
Pelican Island, Cooks Island, and La Quinta Island would also be within Zone 1. Commercial
vessels, recreational and fishing vessels may also fall within Zone 1, depending on their course.
Transit of such vessels through a Zone 1 area of concern can be avoided by timing and course
changes, if conditions permit.
Zone 2 would cover a wider swath of coastal areas along Port Aransas and Ingleside,
including Port Aransas Fire Department and Police Department, and multiple residential,
commercial, industrial, and institutional (e.g., church, school, etc.)buildings. Pelican Island,
Cooks Island, and La Quinta Island would also be entirely within Zone 2.
Zone 3 would span Port Aransas in almost its entirety and larger portions of Ingleside,
including multiple residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional (e.g., church, school, etc.)
buildings.
The areas impacted by the three different hazard zones are illustrated for both accidental
and intentional events in figures 4.12-6 and 4.12-7.

Coast Guard Letter of Recommendation and Analysis

In a letter dated March 21, 2013, the Coast Guard issued a LOR and LOR Analysis to
FERC stating that the Corpus Christi Ship Channel from the entrance approach at Port Aransas
to the La Quinta Junction, and the entire length of the La Quinta Channel be considered suitable
for accommodating the type and frequency of LNG marine traffic associated with this Proj
ect.
The recommendation was based on full implementation of the strategies and risk management
measures identified to the Coast Guard by Cheniere in its WSA.
Although Cheniere has suggested mitigation measures for responsibly managing the
maritime safety and security risks associated with LNG marine traffic, the necessary vessel
traffic and/or facility control measures may change depending on changes in conditions along the
waterway. The Coast Guard regulations in 33 CFR 127 require that applicants annually review
WSAs until a facility begins operation. Accordingly, Cheniere is required to submit a report to
the Coast Guard identifying any changes in conditions, such as changes to the port environment,
the LNG facility, or the tanker route, that would affect the suitability of the waterway. The Coast
Guard has indicated that Cheniere has provided its annual update, which is currently under
review of the Coast Guard.
The Coast Guard’s LOR is a recommendation on the current status of the waterway to the
FERC, the lead agency responsible for siting the on-shore LNG facility. Neither the Coast
Guard nor the FERC has authority to require waterway resources of anyone other than the
Environmental Impact Statement

4-196

Corpus Christi LNG

applicant under any statutory authority or under the ERP or the Cost Sharing Plan (see
section 4.12.7). As stated in the LOR, the Coast Guard would assess each transit on a case by
case basis to identify what, if any, safety and security measures are necessary to safeguard the
public health and welfare, critical infrastructure and key resources, the port, the marine
environment, and the vessel.
Under the Ports and Waterways Safety Act, the Magnuson Act, the MTSA, and the
Safety and Accountability For Every Port Act, the COTP has the authority to prohibit LNG
transfer or LNG carrier movements within his or her area of responsibility if he or she
determines that such action is necessary to protect the waterway, port or marine environment. If
this Proj
ect is approved and if appropriate resources are not in place prior to LNG carrier
movement along the waterway, then the COTP would consider at that time what, if any, vessel
traffic and/or facility control measures would be appropriate to adequately address navigational
safety and maritime security considerations. Therefore, we recommend that:
 Cheniere should receive written authorization from the Director of OEP before
commencement of service at the Terminal. Such authorization would only be
granted following a determination bythe Coast Guard,under its authorities under
the Ports and Waterways SafetyAct,the Magnuson Act,the MTSA,and the Safety
and Accountability For Every Port Act,that appropriate measures to ensure the
safety and security of the facility and the waterway have been put into place by
Cheniere or other appropriate parties.
4.12.7

LNG Facilityand LNG Carrier EmergencyResponse

As required by 49 CFR §193.2059, Cheniere would need to prepare emergency
procedures manuals that provide for: a)responding to controllable emergencies and recognizing
an uncontrollable emergency;b)taking action to minimize harm to the public including the
possible need to evacuate the public;and c)coordination and cooperation with appropriate local
officials. Specifically, §193.2509(b)(3)requires “Coordinating with appropriate local officials in
preparation of an emergency evacuation plan… ”
Section 3A(e)of the NGA, added by Section 311 of the EPAct 2005, stipulates that in
any order authorizing an LNG terminal, the Commission must require the LNG terminal operator
to develop an ERP in consultation with the Coast Guard and state and local agencies. The FERC
must approve the ERP prior to any final approval to begin construction. Therefore, we
recommend that:
 Cheniere should develop an ERP (including evacuation)and coordinate procedures
with the Coast Guard;state,county,and local emergency planning groups;fire
departments;state and local law enforcement;and appropriate federal agencies.
This plan should include at a minimum:
a. designated contacts with state and local emergencyresponse agencies;
b. scalable procedures for the prompt notification of appropriate local officials and
emergency response agencies based on the level and severity of potential
incidents;
c. procedures for notifying residents and recreational users within areas of
potential hazard;

Environmental Impact Statement

4-197

Corpus Christi LNG

d. evacuation routes/methods for residents and public use areas that are within any
transient hazard areas along the route of the LNG marine transit;
e. locations of permanent sirens and other warning devices;and
f. an “emergencycoordinator”on each LNG carrier to activate sirens and other
warning devices.
The ERP should be filed with the Secretary for review and written approval by the
Director of OEP prior to initial site preparation. Cheniere should notify the FERC
staff of all planning meetings in advance and should report progress on the
development of its ERP at 3-month intervals.
A number of organizations and individuals have expressed concern that the local
community would have to bear some of the cost of ensuring the security and emergency
management of the LNG facility and the LNG carriers while in transit and unloading at the berth.
Section 3A(e)of the Natural Gas Act (as amended by EPAct 2005)specifies that the ERP must
include a Cost-Sharing Plan that contains a description of any direct cost reimbursements the
applicants agree to provide to any state and local agencies with responsibility for security and
safety at the LNG terminal and in proximity to LNG carriers that serve the facility. Therefore,
we recommend that:
 The ERP should include a Cost-Sharing Plan identifying the mechanisms for
funding all Project-specific security/emergency management costs that would be
imposed on state and local agencies. In addition to the funding of direct transitrelated security/emergency management costs,this comprehensive plan should
include funding mechanisms for the capital costs associated with any necessary
security/emergencymanagement equipment and personnel base. Cheniere should
file the Cost-Sharing Plan for review and written approval bythe Director of OEP
prior to initial site preparation.
The Cost-Sharing Plan must specify what the LNG terminal operator would provide to
cover the cost of the state and local resources required to manage the security of the LNG
terminal and LNG carrier, and the state and local resources required for safety and emergency
management, including:
 direct reimbursement for any per-transit security and/or emergency management
costs (for example, overtime for police or fire department personnel);
 capital costs associated with security/emergency management equipment and
personnel base (for example, patrol boats, firefighting equipment);and
 annual costs for providing specialized training for local fire departments, mutual
aid departments, and emergency response personnel; and for conducting
exercises.
The cost-sharing plan must include the LNG terminal operator’s letter of commitment
with agency acknowledgement for each state and local agency designated to receive resources.
4.12.8

Conclusions on FacilityReliabilityand Safety

As part of the NEPA review, Commission staff must assess whether the proposed
facilities would be able to operate safely and securely to minimize potential public impact. Based
Environmental Impact Statement

4-198

Corpus Christi LNG

on our technical review of the preliminary engineering designs, we have made a number of
recommendations to be implemented prior to initial site preparation, prior to construction of final
design, prior to commissioning, prior to introduction of hazardous fluids, prior to
commencement of service, and throughout the life of the facility to enhance the reliability and
safety of the facility and to mitigate the risk of impact to the public.
In addition, we analyzed whether Cheniere would be sited consistently with federal
regulations promulgated by DOT in 49CFR 193. As a cooperating agency, DOT assisted FERC
staff in evaluating whether an applicant’s proposed siting meets the DOT requirements. DOT
reviewed the data and methodology Cheniere used to determine the design spills from various
leakage sources, including piping, containers, and equipment containing hazardous liquids.
Cheniere used those design spills to model hazardous releases, which extended beyond their
property line, but under their legal control through covenants with the adj
acent property owners.
On February 10, 2014, DOT provided a letter to FERC staff stating that DOT had no obj
ection to
Cheniere’s methodology for determining the single accidental leakage sources for candidate
design spills to be used in establishing the Part 193 siting requirements for the proposed LNG
liquefaction facilities. In a letter to FERC dated February 10, 2014, DOT stated it has no
obj
ection to Cheniere’s methodology for determining the candidate design spills used to establish
the required siting for its proposed LNG import facility. If a facility is constructed and becomes
operational, the facility would be subj
ect to DOT’s inspection and enforcement program. Final
determination of whether a facility is in compliance with the requirements of 49CFR 193 would
be made by DOT staff.
We also analyzed the potential impacts along the waterway from LNG marine traffic. As
a cooperating agency, the Coast Guard analyzed the suitability of the waterway for LNG marine
traffic. In a letter dated March 21, 2013, the Coast Guard issued a LOR and LOR Analysis to
FERC stating that the Corpus Christi Ship Channel from the entrance approach at Port Aransas
to the La Quinta Junction, and the entire length of the La Quinta Channel be considered suitable
for accommodating the type and frequency of LNG marine traffic associated with this Proj
ect.
The recommendation was based on full implementation of the strategies and risk management
measures identified to the Coast Guard by Cheniere in its WSA. Under the Ports and Waterways
Safety Act, the Magnuson Act, the MTSA, and the Safety and Accountability For Every Port
Act, the COTP has the authority to prohibit LNG transfer or LNG carrier movements within his
or her area of responsibility if he or she determines that such action is necessary to protect the
waterway, port or marine environment. If appropriate resources are not in place prior to LNG
carrier movement along the waterway, then the COTP would consider at that time what, if any,
vessel traffic and/or facility control measures would be appropriate to adequately address
navigational safety and maritime security considerations. FERC staff recommends Cheniere
receive written authorization from the Director of OEP before commencement of service at the
Terminal to ensure the Coast Guard has determined that appropriate measures to ensure the
safety and security of the facility and the waterway have been put into place by Cheniere or other
appropriate parties.
Based on our engineering design analysis and recommendations presented in section 4.12
for the Terminal, the no obj
ection by DOT to the design spill methodology and our subsequent
review of the siting analysis for the Terminal, the LOR issued by the Coast Guard concluding the
LNG vessel transit is suitable for LNG marine traffic, and the regulatory requirements for the

would not result in significantly increased public safety risks.
4.12.9

Pipeline SafetyStandards

The transportation of natural gas by pipeline involves some incremental risk to the public
due to the potential for accidental release of natural gas. The greatest hazard is a fire or
explosion following a maj
or pipeline rupture.
Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. It is
not toxic, but is classified as a simple asphyxiate, possessing an inhalation hazard. If breathed in
high concentration, oxygen deficiency can result in serious inj
ury or death.
Methane has an auto-ignition temperature of 1,000°F and is flammable at concentrations
between 5.0 percent and 15.0 percent in air. An unconfined mixture of methane and air is not
explosive;however, it may ignite and burn if there is an ignition source. A flammable
concentration within an enclosed space in the presence of an ignition source can explode. It is
buoyant at atmospheric temperatures and disperses rapidly in air.
The DOT is mandated to provide adequate protection against risks to life and property
posed by pipeline transportation under Title 49, USC Chapter 601. The DOT’s Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), Office of Pipeline Safety administers the
national regulatory program to ensure the safe transportation of natural gas and other hazardous
materials by pipeline. It develops safety regulations and other approaches to risk management
that ensure safety in the design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance, and emergency
response of pipeline facilities. Many of the regulations are written as performance standards
which set the level of safety to be attained and allow the pipeline operator to use various
technologies to achieve safety. PHMSA ensures that people and the environment are protected
from the risk of pipeline incidents. This work is shared with state agency partners and others at
the federal, state, and local level.
The DOT provides for a state agency to assume all aspects of the safety program for
intrastate facilities by adopting and enforcing the federal standards. A state may also act as
DOT's agent to inspect interstate facilities within its boundaries; however, the DOT is
responsible for enforcement actions. Federal inspectors from the DOT Office of Pipeline Safety
perform inspections on interstate natural gas pipeline facilities in Texas.
The DOT pipeline standards are published in Parts 190-199of Title 49of the CFR. Part
192 specifically addresses natural gas pipeline safety issues.
Under a Memorandum of Understanding on Natural Gas Transportation Facilities
(Memorandum)dated January 15, 1993, between the DOT and the FERC, the DOT has the
exclusive authority to promulgate federal safety standards used in the transportation of natural
gas. Section 157.14(a)(9)(vi)of our regulations require that an applicant certify that it will
design, install, inspect, test, construct, operate, replace, and maintain the facility for which a
Certificate is requested in accordance with federal safety standards and plans for maintenance
and inspection. Alternatively, an applicant must certify that it has been granted a waiver of the
requirements of the safety standards by the DOT in accordance with Section 3(e)of the Natural
Gas Pipeline Safety Act. The FERC accepts this certification and does not impose additional
safety standards. If the Commission becomes aware of an existing or potential safety problem,
there is a provision in the Memorandum to promptly alert DOT. The Memorandum also
Environmental Impact Statement

4-200

Corpus Christi LNG

provides for referring complaints and inquiries made by state and local governments and the
general public involving safety matters related to pipelines under the Commission's j
urisdiction.
The FERC also participates as a member of the DOT's Technical Pipeline Safety
Standards Committee which determines if proposed safety regulations are reasonable, feasible,
and practicable.
The facilities associated with the Pipeline must be designed, constructed, operated, and
maintained in accordance with the DOT Minimum Federal Safety Standards in 49CFR 192. The
regulations are intended to ensure adequate protection for the public and to prevent natural gas
facility accidents and failures. The DOT specifies material selection and qualification;minimum
design requirements;and protection from internal, external, and atmospheric corrosion.
The DOT also defines area classifications, based on population density in the vicinity of
the pipeline, and specifies more rigorous safety requirements for populated areas. The class
location unit is an area that extends 220 yards on either side of the centerline of any continuous
1-mile length of pipeline. The four area classifications are defined below:
Class 1

Location with 10 or fewer buildings intended for human occupancy.

Class 2

Location with more than 10 but less than 46 buildings intended for human
occupancy.

Class 3

Location with 46 or more buildings intended for human occupancy or
where the pipeline lies within 100 yards of any building, or small welldefined outside area occupied by 20 or more people on at least 5 days a
week for 10 weeks in any 12-month period.

Class 4

Location where buildings with four or more stories aboveground are
prevalent.

Class locations representing more populated areas require higher safety factors in
pipeline design, testing, and operation. For instance, pipelines constructed on land in Class 1
locations must be installed with a minimum depth of cover of 30 inches in normal soil and 18
inches in consolidated rock. Class 2, 3, and 4 locations, as well as drainage ditches of public
roads and railroad crossings, require a minimum cover of 36 inches in normal soil and 24 inches
in consolidated rock.
Class locations also specify the maximum distance to a sectionalizing block valve
(e.g., 10.0 miles in Class 1, 7.5 miles in Class 2, 4.0 miles in Class 3, and 2.5 miles in Class 4).
Pipe wall thickness and pipeline design pressures;hydrostatic test pressures;MAOP;inspection
and testing of welds;and frequency of pipeline patrols and leak surveys must also conform to
higher standards in more populated areas. Once the pipeline route has been finalized, Cheniere
would identify the pipeline centerline with respect to other structures or manmade features and
determine the class locations along the Pipeline.
If a subsequent increase in population density adj
acent to the right-of-way results in a
change in class location for the pipeline, Cheniere would reduce the MAOP or replace the
segment with pipe of sufficient grade and wall thickness, if required to comply with the DOT
requirements for the new class location.
The DOT Pipeline Safety Regulations require operators to develop and follow a written
integrity management program that contain all the elements described in 49CFR 192.911 and
Environmental Impact Statement

4-201

Corpus Christi LNG

address the risks on each transmission pipeline segment. The rule establishes an integrity
management program which applies to all high consequence areas (HCA).
The DOT has published rules that define HCAs where a gas pipeline accident could do
considerable harm to people and their property and requires an integrity management program to
minimize the potential for an accident. This definition satisfies, in part, the Congressional
mandate for DOT to prescribe standards that establish criteria for identifying each gas pipeline
facility in a high-density population area.
The HCAs may be defined in one of two ways. In the first method an HCA includes:
 current Class 3 and 4 locations,
 any area in Class 1 or 2 where the potential impact radius41 is greater than 660 feet and
there are 20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy within the potential impact
circle42, or
 any area in Class 1 or 2 where the potential impact circle includes an identified site.
An identified site is an outside area or open structure that is occupied by 20 or more
persons on at least 50 days in any 12-month period;a building that is occupied by 20 or more
persons on at least 5 days a week for any 10 weeks in any 12-month period;or a facility that is
occupied by persons who are confined, are of impaired mobility, or would be difficult to
evacuate.
In the second method, an HCA includes any area within a potential impact circle which
contains:
 20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy;or
 an identified site.
Once a pipeline operator has determined the HCAs along its pipeline, it must apply the
elements of its integrity management program to those segments of the pipeline within HCAs.
The DOT regulations specify the requirements for the integrity management plan at
Section 192.911. Of the 23 miles of proposed pipeline route, Cheniere has identified
approximately 2.9miles that would be classified as an HCA. The pipeline integrity management
rule for HCAs requires inspection of the pipeline HCAs at intervals specified in §192.939, but at
least every seven years.
The DOT prescribes the minimum standards for operating and maintaining pipeline
facilities, including the requirement to establish a written plan governing these activities. Each
pipeline operator is required to establish an emergency plan that includes procedures to minimize
the hazards of a natural gas pipeline emergency. Key elements of the plan include procedures
for:
 receiving, identifying, and classifying emergency events, gas leakage, fires, explosions,
and natural disasters;
 establishing and maintaining communications with local fire, police, and public officials,
and coordinating emergency response;
 emergency system shutdown and safe restoration of service;
41

The potential impact radius is calculated as the product of 0.69and the square root of: the MAOP of the pipeline
in psig multiplied by the square of the pipeline diameter in inches.
42
The potential impact circle is a circle of radius equal to the potential impact radius.
Environmental Impact Statement

4-202

Corpus Christi LNG

 making personnel, equipment, tools, and materials available at the scene of an
emergency;and
 protecting people first and then property, and making them safe from actual or potential
hazards.
The DOT requires that each operator establish and maintain liaison with appropriate fire,
police, and public officials to learn the resources and responsibilities of each organization that
may respond to a natural gas pipeline emergency, and to coordinate mutual assistance. The
operator must also establish a continuing education program to enable customers, the public,
government officials, and those engaged in excavation activities to recognize a gas pipeline
emergency and report it to appropriate public officials. Cheniere would provide the appropriate
training to local emergency service personnel before the pipeline is placed in service.
4.12.9.1

Pipeline Accident Data

The DOT requires all operators of natural gas transmission pipelines to notify the DOT of
any significant incident and to submit a report within 20 days. Significant incidents are defined
as any leaks that:
 caused a death or personal inj
ury requiring hospitalization;or
 involve property damage of more than $50,000 (1984 dollars)43.
During the 20 year period from 1994 through 2013, a total of 1,237 significant incidents
were reported on the more than 300,000 total miles of natural gas transmission pipelines
nationwide.
Additional insight into the nature of service incidents may be found by examining the
primary factors that caused the failures. Table 4.12-8 provides a distribution of the causal factors
as well as the number of each incident by cause.
The dominant causes of pipeline incidents are corrosion and pipeline material, weld or
equipment failure constituting 48.2 percent of all significant incidents. The pipelines included in
the data set in table 4.12-8 vary widely in terms of age, diameter, and level of corrosion control.
Each variable influences the incident frequency that may be expected for a specific segment of
pipeline.
The frequency of significant incidents is strongly dependent on pipeline age. Older
pipelines have a higher frequency of corrosion incidents and material failure, since corrosion and
pipeline stress/strain is a time-dependent process.

The use of both an external protective coating and a cathodic protection system44,
required on all pipelines installed after July 1971, significantly reduces the corrosion rate
compared to unprotected or partially protected pipe.
Outside force, excavation, and natural forces are the cause in 34.5 percent of significant
pipeline incidents. These result from the encroachment of mechanical equipment such as
bulldozers and backhoes;earth movements due to soil settlement, washouts, or geologic hazards;
weather effects such as winds, storms, and thermal strains;and willful damage. Table 4.12-9
provides a breakdown of outside force incidents by cause.
Older pipelines have a higher frequency of outside forces incidents partly because their
location may be less well known and less well marked than newer lines. In addition, the older
pipelines contain a disproportionate number of smaller-diameter pipelines;which have a greater
rate of outside forces incidents. Small diameter pipelines are more easily crushed or broken by
mechanical equipment or earth movement.
Since 1982, operators have been required to participate in "One Call" public utility
programs in populated areas to minimize unauthorized excavation activities in the vicinity of
pipelines. The "One Call" program is a service used by public utilities and some private sector
companies (e.g., oil pipelines and cable television)to provide preconstruction information to
contractors or other maintenance workers on the underground location of pipes, cables, and
culverts.
44

Cathodic protection is a technique to reduce corrosion (rust)of the natural gas pipeline through the use of an
induced current or a sacrificial anode (like zinc)that corrodes at faster rate to reduce corrosion.

Impact on Public Safety

The service incidents data summarized in table 4.12-8 include pipeline failures of all
magnitudes with widely varying consequences.
Table 4.12-10 presents the average annual inj
uries and fatalities that occurred on natural
gas transmission lines for the 5-year period between 2009and 2013. The maj
ority of fatalities
from pipelines are due to local distribution pipelines not regulated by FERC. These are natural
gas pipelines that distribute natural gas to homes and businesses after transportation through
interstate natural gas transmission pipelines. In general, these distribution lines are smaller
diameter pipes and/or plastic pipes which are more susceptible to damage. Local distribution
systems do not have large right-of-ways and pipeline markers common to the FERC regulated
natural gas transmission pipelines.

should be made cautiously, however, because individual exposures to hazards are not uniform
among all categories. The data nonetheless indicate a low risk of death due to incidents
involving natural gas transmission pipelines compared to the other categories. Furthermore, the

CUMULATIVE IMPACTSANALYSIS

NEPA requires the lead federal agency to consider the potential cumulative impacts of
proposals under review. Cumulative impacts may result when the environmental effects
associated with the proposed action are superimposed on or added to impacts associated with
past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future proj
ects. Cumulative impacts can result from
individually minor, but collectively significant, actions taking place over a period of time.
Generally, cumulative impacts could result only from the construction of other proj
ects in the
same vicinity and impacting the same resource areas as the proposed facilities. In such a
situation, although the impact associated with each proj
ect might be minor, the cumulative
impact resulting from all proj
ects being constructed in the same general area could be greater.
Environmental Impact Statement

4-207

Corpus Christi LNG

Our analysis includes other proj
ects in the vicinity of the proposed Proj
ect that affect the
same resources as the proposed Proj
ect in the same approximate time frame. Specifically,
actions included in the cumulative impact analysis must:
 impact a resource area potentially affected by the proposed Proj
ect
 cause the impact within all or part of the same area affected by the proposed Proj
ect for
that resource;and
 cause the impact within all or part of the time span as that of the potential impact from
the proposed Proj
ect.
Using this approach, the potential for cumulative impacts was assessed by combining the
potential environmental impacts of the proposed Proj
ect with the impacts of identified proj
ects.
The cumulative impact area for each resource is defined in section 4.13.2.
4.13.1

Projects PotentiallyContributing to Cumulative Impacts

While Cheniere states its purpose and need would support increased shale gas production,
no specific shale gas play is identified. The Pipeline would receive and deliver domestic natural
gas via interconnections with a number of existing intrastate and interstate pipeline systems.
These interconnecting pipeline systems (Texas Eastern, Tej
as, NGPL, Transco, and Tennessee
Gas)span states from Texas to Illinois to Tennessee and Pennsylvania and cross multiple shale
gas plays, as well as conventional gas plays. In addition, each of these interconnecting pipeline
systems has a developed network of additional interconnects with other gas transmission pipeline
companies that may cross additional gas plays.
Further, Cheniere states that the export of natural gas as LNG would allow the further
development of shale gas. However, Cheniere does not, and cannot, estimate how much of the
export volumes would come from current shale gas production and how much, if any, would be
new production or development attributable to the Proj
ect. The Proj
ect does not depend on
additional shale gas production which may occur for reasons unrelated to the Proj
ect and over
which the Commission has no control, such as state permitting for additional gas wells. An
overall increase in nationwide production of shale gas may occur for a variety of reasons, but the
location and subsequent activity is unknown and is too speculative to assume based on the
interconnected interstate natural gas pipeline system. Additionally, the factors necessary for a
meaningful analysis of when, where, and how the development of shale gas would occur are
unknown at this time.
Wells which could produce gas that might ultimately flow to this Proj
ect might be
developed in any of the shale plays that exist in nearly the entire eastern half of the United
States. Accordingly, it is simply impractical for the Commission to consider impacts associated
with additional shale gas development as cumulative indirect impacts resulting from the Proj
ect
which must, under CEQ regulations, be meaningfully analyzed by the Commission. For
purposes of this cumulative impact analysis, impacts which may result from additional shale gas
production is not considered reasonably foreseeable, as defined by CEQ regulations, nor is such
an additional production or any correlative potential impacts, an effect of the Proj
ect. Therefore,
we find that the EIS appropriately considers cumulative impacts on the areas surrounding the
Proj
ect and appropriately focuses on potential impacts associated with the Proj
ect. The analysis
of the potential impacts of the Proj
ect on geology and soils, water resources, fisheries,

vegetation, wildlife, land use, recreation, visual resources, socioeconomics, cultural resources,
air quality, and noise, indicates that the Proj
ect would result in little to no incremental
contribution to impacts on resources in the Proj
ect area;therefore, the Proj
ect’s incremental
contribution to impacts on resources well beyond the Proj
ect area would likewise be negligible.

U.S. ArmyCorps of Engineers La Quinta Channel Extension

The COE, Galveston District, awarded a contract on September 22, 2011 in the amount
of $33,537,027 to King Fisher Marine Service, LP for dredging of the Corpus Christi Ship
Channel’s La Quinta extension located less than 1 mile southeast of the Terminal in Nueces
County, Texas. Commencement of dredging began in December 2011, and will be completed by
the summer of 2014. Construction activities have included dredging of approximately 7,400 feet
of the La Quinta Channel extension to a depth of -39feet mean low tide (equivalent to -40 feet
NAVD 88)(plus 2 feet paid overdredge, plus 2 feet advanced maintenance dredge).
The proj
ect, for navigation and ecosystem restoration, is part of the Corpus Christi Ship
Channel - Channel Improvement Proj
ect as authorized by Section 1001(40) of the Water
Resources Development Act of 2007. Funding for the construction contracts was approved on
May 17, 2011 by the COE as part of its 2011 work plan for the Army Civil Works program. The
proj
ects include the following navigation and ecosystem restoration elements:
 extend the La Quinta Ship Channel approximately 7,400 feet;
 construct an ecosystem restoration feature;and
 create a beneficial use site.

Port of Corpus Christi AuthorityLa Quinta Trade GatewayTerminal

The proposed La Quinta Trade Gateway Terminal comprises a maj
or component of the
POCCA’s proposed long-term development plan and would be located immediately west of the
Terminal on a 1,100-acre site on the north side of Corpus Christi Bay. Once complete, this fully
permitted proj
ect would provide a state-of-the-art multi-purpose dock and container facility.
Proj
ect features consist of the extension of the La Quinta Channel (see description for COE La
Quinta Channel Extension), construction of a 3,800-foot-long, 3-berth ship dock with nine shipto-shore cranes, utilizing 250 acres of container/cargo storage yards, an intermodal rail yard, and
over 400 acres for on-site distribution and warehouse centers. The facility would have the
capacity to handle approximately 1 million 20-foot equivalent units annually. The La Quinta
Trade Gateway Terminal would be located adj
acent to US 181/SH 35 and immediately to the
west of the proposed Proj
ect site.
The federal authorization to construct the extension of the La Quinta Ship Channel has
been a key factor for moving forward with the construction of the La Quinta Trade Gateway
Terminal. With the authorization and initial appropriation to construct the channel extension, the
Port Commission signed a Proj
ect Partnership Agreement with the COE in October 2009in order
to authorize and construct the extension. The COE began work at the site in 2010 through
construction of a 126-acre dredge material placement area as well as the dredging of the La
Quinta Channel extension as discussed above. The completion of the La Quinta Channel
extension by the summer of 2014 would facilitate the initiation of construction of the La Quinta
Trade Gateway Terminal, beginning with additional dredging of the Ship Channel. A start date
has not yet been set for construction of the cargo terminal.

The Texas Mill Proj
ect is a seamless steel pipe manufacturing facility on a 253-acre site,
which will be located between SH 35 and SH 361, approximately 1.5 miles north of the proposed
Proj
ect site. The 1.6 million square-foot facility would produce 500,000 metric tons per year of
pipe principally for use in the energy industry. The seamless pipe would be used in both the U.S.
and abroad, utilizing an electric arc furnace to convert recycled scrap steel and pig iron. Once
fully operational, the TPCO America facility would be the largest single investment by TPCO, a
Chinese company, in a U.S. manufacturing facility.

approximately 483 acres and contains more than 70 state-of-the-art buildings, such as warehouse
facilities, office and administrative facilities, barracks, fitness and recreation facilities, a capitalclass pier and wharf area, and several others.
Oxy Ingleside Energy Center has recently announced plans to construct a propane export
facility within this property and anticipates the facility to be operational by January 2015. The
company has also indicated that it could potentially export other fuels from the proposed facility,
such as butanes, natural gas, and condensate. Construction and operation plans for this proj
ect
have not been made available to the public;therefore, reasonable approximations of potential
impacts were used in the cumulative impacts analysis.

Papalote CreekWind Farm

The Papalote Creek Wind Farm is located on actively cultivated agricultural land near the
communities of Taft and Gregory. Portions of the wind farm would be crossed by the Cheniere
Pipeline between approximate MPs 7 to 10. Papalote Creek Wind Farm complex is a two-phase
proj
ect consisting of 87 Siemens 2.3 megawatt (MW)turbines and 109 Vestas V82 1.65 MW
turbines capable of generating nearly 380 MW. The first phase of the wind farm went into
service in fall 2009and the second phase began operations in 2011.
4.13.1.8 Occidental Chemical Corporation Natural Gas Liquids Fractionation Facility
Occidental Chemical Corporation (OxyChem)proposes to construct and operate a new
87,000 barrel per day NGL Fractionation Facility within its existing site along the La Quinta
Channel, located 2 miles west of Ingleside, Texas and approximately 1.2 miles east of the
Terminal. The proposed proj
ect also includes the installation of four hydrocarbon pipelines,
which would be constructed within the existing 18.5-mile-long and 100-foot-wide San Patricio
Pipeline Corridor. These pipelines would serve to transport NGL to the proposed 470-acre
facility where they would be fractionated into ethane, propane, butane, and natural gasoline. The
products would then be stored on-site before being transferred via pipeline, tank truck, rail car, or
barge to various markets or the proposed OxyChem Ethylene Plant located immediately adj
acent
to the fractionation facility.
In May 2012, OxyChem submitted a GHG PSD permit application to the EPA for their
proposed fractionation facility. OxyChem identified two thermal oxidizers, one flare, one
cooling tower, fugitive sources for five operating areas, one emergency generator, and four
firewater pump engines as new sources of GHG emissions. The public comment period for the
GHG PSD permit closed as of August 9, 2013.
OxyChem recently released an anticipated construction schedule, with proj
ect activities
estimated to be completed by December 2014. However, this schedule is currently under review
and a final in-service date has not yet been determined.
4.13.1.9

OxyChem Ethylene Plant

OxyChem proposes to construct and operate a new 1.2 billion pounds per year (lb/y)
ethylene plant within its existing site along the La Quinta Channel, located approximately
2 miles west of Ingleside, Texas and approximately 1.2 miles east of the Terminal. The plant
would receive ethane feed via pipeline or from the proposed NGL Fractionation Facility to be
constructed on adj
acent property. Once fully operational, the plant would produce 1.2 billion
lb/y of market grade ethylene. Construction on this proj
ect is expected to commence in 2014,
with the facility becoming fully operational in early 2017.
In December 2012, OxyChem submitted a GHG PSD permit application to the EPA for
their proposed ethylene plant. OxyChem identified five cracking furnaces, two thermal
oxidizers, one high pressure ground flare, one emergency generator engine, one low pressure
enclosed flare, one cooling tower, and fugitive sources for six operating areas as new sources of
GHG emissions. OxyChem is currently in the early development and permitting stages for the
proj
ect, and an updated construction schedule has not been released.

4.13.1.10 Voestalpine DRIPlant
Voestalpine proposes to construct and operate a DRI plant on land adj
acent to the west
side of the Proj
ect in San Patricio County, Texas. The proposed DRI plant would be constructed
on approximately 475 acres of upland property and approximately 11 acres of submerged land
owned by the POCCA. Additionally, the facility would also include the construction of a
1,060-foot-long high performance dock.
Proj
ect features consist of a reformer and reactor necessary for the conversion of
Canadian or Brazilian ore into highly metallized iron, either in the form of DRI or hot briquetted
iron. The DRI Plant is expected to require approximately 150 people for the annual production
of 2 million metric tons of iron, which would be distributed to Austrian steel mills as well as
other international and domestic markets. It is anticipated that the proj
ect would begin
operations in late 2015 and would be in full production by early 2016. Voestalpine submitted a
GHG PSD permit application to the EPA for their proposed DRI Plant in January 2013.
4.13.1.11 Flint Hills West RefineryExpansion
Flint Hills Resources Corpus Christi, LLC (FHR)proposes to expand their existing crude
oil refinery located on the north eastern shore of Nueces Bay, approximately 15 miles east of the
Terminal. The expansion of their currently operating West Refinery would allow the refinery to
process a larger percentage of domestic crude oil and increase the total crude processing
capacity.
Construction of new facilities for this proj
ect would include a process unit called the
Saturates Gas Plant No. 3, one cooling tower, and equipment piping fugitive components in
several existing process units. The existing equipment affected by construction would include
increasing the firing duty of the CCR Hot Oil Heater, physical changes to the Mid Plant Cooling
Tower, and conversion of the current Gas Oil Hydrotreating Unit to a Distillate Hydrotreating
Unit.
In December 2012, FHR submitted a GHG PSD permit application to the EPA, as the
proposed refinery expansion will increase emissions at the site. The application was incomplete
and FHR has since submitted updated information;however, the application has not been
deemed complete to date.
4.13.2

Existing LNG Terminals and Projects

We identified one existing LNG terminal in the general Proj
ect vicinity (Freeport
Liquefaction Proj
ect)that could contribute to cumulative impacts with those of the proposed
Proj
ect. Other existing or proposed LNG terminals were identified but dismissed from this
analysis as they are located approximately 300 miles away. A brief description of the proj
ect is
provided below. This cumulative impacts analysis considered the impacts of operation of the
existing terminal as well as the potential construction and operation impacts of the planned or
proposed proj
ects.
4.13.2.1

Freeport Liquefaction Project

FLEX has proposed the Freeport Liquefaction Proj
ect in Brazoria County, Texas, which
includes the addition of liquefaction facilities to its existing terminal located on Quintana Island
to provide export capacity of approximately 13.2 mtpy of LNG. This proj
ect would require
Environmental Impact Statement

4-214

Corpus Christi LNG

approximately 86 acres for three proposed trains, each with a capacity of 4.4 mtpy, and
associated facilities. This proj
ect is located more than 150 miles from the proposed Proj
ect.
Therefore, we do not believe that cumulative impacts would have a cumulative effect on the
resources in the Proj
ect area, including air quality impacts as discussed in section 4.13.4.
4.13.3

CurrentlyOperating Oil and Gas Facilities

There are various oil and gas wells in the vicinity of the proposed Proj
ect site (see
section 4.1), primarily located near the Pipeline, and many of these are oil and gas gathering and
transmission pipelines and related facilities. Those facilities are in place and generally would not
contribute to the cumulative impacts associated with construction of the Proj
ect;however, the
operation of the wells permanently removed both wetlands and vegetation. There are no maj
or
storage or processing facilities in the vicinity.
The Pipeline would be adj
acent to portions of other rights-of-way including those with
which the proposed Pipeline would interconnect. These pipelines have been in service for a
number of years and the only impacts relating to the cumulative impact analysis include
maintenance for permanent rights-of-way in the vicinity of the interconnections and emissions
from compressor stations associated with the pipelines.
4.13.4

Other Projects and Activities Considered

4.13.4.1

Non-Jurisdictional Power Lines and Substations

As discussed in section 1.6.1, Cheniere identified an electrical power line extension and
substation that would be required for construction and operation of the Terminal. An overhead
powerline would extend from the j
unction of SH 35 and SH 361 to a new facilities substation
located at the Terminal site. The power line and electrical substation would be built, owned, and
operated by AEP. Cheniere would also build, own, and operate an underground power line that
would extend from the AEP substation to the facilities substation at the Terminal.
4.13.4.2

Non-Jurisdictional Waterline

As discussed in section 1.6.2, the construction and operation of the Terminal would
require a waterline connection to the San Patricio Municipal Water District potable water system
at the north end of La Quinta Road. The waterline would be constructed within the same
corridor as the power lines discussed above.
4.13.4.3 Removal of Non-Jurisdictional Natural Gas Pipelines
Three existing non-j
urisdictional natural gas pipelines (Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP
[Gulf South], Crosstex Corpus Christi Natural Gas Transmission [Crosstex], and Royal
Production Company [Royal]were removed by their respective operators following Cheniere’s
receipt of the 2005 Order. Descriptions of the locations of the pipeline segments previously
present at the Terminal are provided below.
Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP -approximately 1.2 miles of 6-inch-diameter natural
gas pipeline owned and operated by Gulf South was located within the Terminal site boundary.
Crosstex Corpus Christi Natural Gas Transmission - approximately 0.3 mile of 10-inchdiameter natural gas pipeline owned and operated by Crosstex was located within the Terminal
site boundary. Portions of this pipe would have been impacted during dredging activities
Environmental Impact Statement

4-215

Corpus Christi LNG

associated with the marine berth, as well as the La Quinta Channel Extension, further discussed
in section 4.13.
Royal Production Company - approximately 0.6 mile of 6-inch-diameter offshore natural
gas pipeline extending from a well in Corpus Christi Bay, a 4-inch tie-in, and a tank battery, all
owned and operated by Royal, was located within the Terminal site boundary.
These three existing non-j
urisdictional natural gas pipelines were abandoned, removed, or
relocated following Cheniere’s receipt of the Order issued by the Commission on April 18, 2005.
The exact nature of the abandonment, removal, or relocation activities is not known to Cheniere
or FERC, as each of the individual operators permitted and conducted these operations on their
own. Environmental impacts associated with the removal of those three pipelines are anticipated
to have occurred within previously disturbed areas and were not significant
4.13.5

Potential Cumulative Impacts byResource

The following sections address the potential cumulative impacts from Cheniere’s Proj
ect
on each environmental resource.
4.13.5.1

Geologic Resources

The cumulative impact area for geologic resources and natural hazards was considered to
be the area adj
acent to the Terminal and the Pipeline construction areas. Although the
topography in the area is nearly flat, construction of the Terminal would require some
modification of existing contours to safely accommodate the facilities and maintain drainage in
the area. These modifications would not differ substantially from the existing topography in
adj
acent areas. The LNG tanks would be located in areas that may be subj
ect to differential
surcharge conditions, which could result in detrimental differential foundation settlements.
The proj
ects in the cumulative impact area for geologic conditions at the Terminal would
include the COE La Quinta Channel Extension, the POCCA La Quinta Trade Gateway Terminal,
and the Voestalpine DRI Plant, all of which may require dredging activities. The three nonj
urisdictional facilities associated with the proposed Proj
ect occur within the cumulative impact
area for geologic conditions at the Terminal;however, construction of these non-j
urisdictional
facilities is not expected to result in noticeable changes in topography. Scouring of sand layers
exposed during dredging of the shoreline and La Quinta Channel could increase the erosion
potential of exposed sand layers and may cause eventual slumping or slope failure. Although the
Terminal is located in an area that may present challenges relative to slope stability, mitigation
plans and implementation of erosion controls would reduce or minimize any significant
cumulative impacts on these resources in the Corpus Christi Bay area.
Construction and operation of the Pipeline would primarily occur within previously
disturbed areas and would result in minimal impacts on geological resources. Cheniere would
restore topographic contours along the right-of-way to preconstruction conditions to the
maximum extent practicable.
4.13.5.2

Soils and Sediments

The cumulative impact area for soils was considered to be the area adj
acent to the
Terminal and the Pipeline construction areas. Past impacts on soils resources in the vicinity of
the Proj
ect have resulted from agriculture and industrial developments as well as construction
Environmental Impact Statement

4-216

Corpus Christi LNG

and maintenance of existing roads, railroads, utility lines, and transmission lines. Clearing,
grading, and equipment movement associated with construction of the Terminal and the Pipeline
could result in soil loss due to erosion, which could reduce soil fertility and impair revegetation,
and discharge of sediment to waterbodies and wetlands. However, Cheniere would implement
mitigation measures outlined in our Plan and Procedures as well as recommendations of the local
NRCS to minimize erosion and aid in the reestablishment of vegetation in areas temporarily
impacted during construction.
The planned non-j
urisdictional facilities, including the electrical power line extensions
and substations as well as the waterline, would be constructed within and adj
acent to the
Terminal site. All of the non-j
urisdictional facilities would be constructed within existing,
previously disturbed areas and would not contribute significantly to a cumulative impact on soils.
4.13.5.3 Water Resources
The cumulative impact area for groundwater was limited to the aquifers that Proj
ect is
located within. The cumulative impact area for surface water resources extends approximately 2
miles upstream and downstream of the Terminal site boundaries and the pipeline stream
crossings. Cumulative impacts on water resources at the Terminal site, when combined with
other proj
ects in the area, would be limited primarily to the waters of the La Quinta Channel and
the Corpus Christi Ship Channel, as the maj
ority of other identified proj
ects are located along
those waterways. Although the non-j
urisdictional waterline to the San Patricio Municipal Water
District potable water system would be installed at the Terminal site, the waterline would be
constructed entirely within previously disturbed areas and would not result in adverse impacts on
water resources or local water quality.
Some of the proj
ects would require dredging in order to deepen, widen, or maintain
marine channels, turning basins, or to install pilings or footings. As a result of initial dredging
activities, construction of new channels and turning basins, and during future maintenance
dredging, increased turbidity and sedimentation would temporarily decrease water quality in the
vicinity of each proj
ect. Water resources may have been previously impacted during dredging
activities associated with the abandonment, removal, or relocation of the non-j
urisdictional
natural gas pipelines located at the Terminal site. However, dredging and construction activities
associated with the abandonment, removal, or relocation of these pipelines would have been
similar to those discussed above but would have occurred on a much smaller scale.
If dredging associated with the Terminal could add to the cumulative impact on water
quality if it were to occur concurrently with dredging for the other proj
ects identified in the area.
However, the negative impacts on water quality as a result of dredging in and adj
acent to the
existing La Quinta and Corpus Christi Channels would be temporary, and water quality would be
expected to return to ambient conditions soon after completion of activities.
The design of the offshore platforms for the Offshore Wind Foundation Site offers a
relatively small area of impact using a reduced footprint on the sea floor. Although some
turbidity in the water column could occur as a result of installation of the platforms at the test
site, it is likely that this impact would be minor and temporary in nature. In addition, turbidity
would remain isolated to the area directly adj
acent to the platform.
Installation of the Pipeline associated with the Proj
ect would not have a significant
impact on the freshwater waterbodies that would be crossed. Even if the other proj
ects identified
Environmental Impact Statement

4-217

Corpus Christi LNG

in the area have concurrent impacts on the same waterbodies, significant cumulative impacts
would not be anticipated. Each company would implement crossing methods and erosion and
sediment control measures that would comply with local, state, and, federal permit requirements
for each crossing. The impacts on waterbodies that would occur as a result of the installation of
the Pipeline would be short-term, and full restoration of stream banks, pipeline right-of-ways,
and all other natural horizons would be restored to preconstruction contours to the maximum
extent practicable.
In the event of a spill of hazardous materials during construction or operation of any of
the proj
ects identified, water resources could potentially be impacted. However, the Proj
ect is
not likely to contribute significantly to cumulative impacts on water resources due to spills. In
the event of a spill of hazardous materials, Cheniere would implement its SPCC Plan.
Additionally, the location of the Terminal site occurs on previously disturbed, highly
industrialized lands including old bauxite tailing storage areas. Best management practices
would be utilized during installation of the Pipeline in order to prevent contamination of
waterbodies being crossed in the event of a hazardous materials spill.
4.13.5.4

Wetlands and Submerged Aquatic Vegetation

The cumulative impact area for wetlands was considered to be the area adj
acent to the
proposed Proj
ect construction area.
Several of the proj
ects identified in table 4.13-1 (see appendix C)could have a significant
cumulative impact on wetlands and submerged aquatic vegetation. In the case of the Pipeline,
impacts on wetlands would be mostly temporary, as they would be restored after construction,
with less than 0.01 acre of anticipated permanent impacts. However, construction of the
Terminal is expected to contribute more significantly to cumulative impacts on wetlands in the
region. Each of the proj
ect proponents would be required by the terms and conditions of their
respective Section 404 permit to provide compensatory mitigation for these unavoidable wetland
impacts.
Additionally, the abandonment, removal, or relocation of the non-j
urisdictional natural
gas pipelines would have impacted wetlands and SAV at the Terminal site. Although the exact
nature of the abandonment, removal, or relocation activities is not known to Cheniere or the
FERC, it is assumed that impacts associated with dredging activities as well as mitigation
measures would have been similar to those associated with the marine berth and the La Quinta
Channel Extension.
Both temporary and permanent impacts on SAV are expected as a result of dredging and
other construction activities from each of the identified proj
ects, including the abandonment,
removal, or relocation of the non-j
urisdictional natural gas pipelines. Additional mitigation plans
have been proposed by the POCCA to compensate for adverse impacts on SAV communities,
including the creation of nearly 200 acres of shallow-bottom habitat using dredged material from
the La Quinta Ship Channel Extension Proj
ect and construction of an Ecosystem Restoration
Feature to protect approximately 45 acres of existing SAV.
While impacts on wetlands and SAV are anticipated, mitigation plans and activities
would reduce or minimize cumulative impacts on these resources in Corpus Christi Bay area.
Therefore, the Proj
ect would not contribute significantly to cumulative impacts on wetlands and
SAV.
Environmental Impact Statement

4-218

Corpus Christi LNG

4.13.5.5 Vegetation,Wildlife,and Aquatic Resources
The cumulative impact area for vegetation and wildlife was considered to be the area
adj
acent to and near the proposed Proj
ect construction zones. The cumulative impact area for
aquatic resources was considered to be the same as that for water resources.
When proj
ects are constructed concurrently, the combination of construction activities
could have cumulative impact on vegetative, wildlife, or aquatic resources. All of the proj
ects
considered in this cumulative impacts analysis would be within or adj
acent to previously, highly
disturbed, industrial areas or developed sites. These areas do not typically offer high quality
habitat for diverse vegetation or wildlife species. In addition, while constructing these proj
ects,
mobile wildlife species would be able to temporarily displace to similar adj
acent habitats. These
species would later be able to return to the open proj
ect lands following restoration. Therefore,
we determined impacts on wildlife species would be short-term and not significant.
Dredging activities associated with several of the identified proj
ects would impact a
significant amount of shallow-bottom habitat considered EFH. Deepening shipping channels,
maneuvering areas, and docks would result in a permanent conversion of shallow-bottom habitat
to deeper water habitat, maintained as such through periodic maintenance dredging. Dredging
associated with the abandonment, removal, or relocation of the non-j
urisdictional natural gas
pipelines would have resulted in impacts on shallow-bottom habitat and other aquatic resources
similar to those associated with construction of the marine berth, but on a much smaller scale.
Therefore, cumulative impacts on vegetative, wildlife, or aquatic resources from the
abandonment, removal, or relocation of these non-j
urisdictional pipelines would not be
significant. Most other impacts associated with dredging would be short-term, such as localized
turbidity resulting in reduced water quality and potential temporary impacts on local fish species.
Compensatory mitigation for loss of vegetated components of EFH (seagrass and coastal marsh
habitats)would be addressed through Section 404 permitting, and consultation with NOAA
Fisheries.
The construction and operation of large turbines associated with wind farm proj
ects could
potentially affect bird and bat species through collision-related fatalities. However, a Phase I
Avian Risk Assessment conducted for the Revolution Energy Wind proj
ect determined that
fatalities among birds in the area are not likely to be biologically significant. Additionally, the
proj
ect has been constructed in a highly industrialized area which does not provide high quality
bird habitat. The Proj
ect would not be likely to contribute significantly to cumulative impacts on
flying species, as the tallest structures (storage tanks, marine flare, and process flare tower
located at the Terminal facilities)would have visual markers and aircraft warning lights installed
on guy-wires and tall, free-standing structures. Additionally, the heights of the tallest structures
associated with the Proj
ect would be similar or less than those located on neighboring properties.
Although some collisions with these structures could potentially occur it is not likely that these
fatalities would be of biological significance.
4.13.5.6

Threatened and Endangered Species

Of the proj
ects listed in table 4.13-1 (see appendix C), only the La Quinta Channel
Extension, OxyChem NGL Fractionation Facility, FHR West Refinery Expansion, and Freeport
Liquefaction proj
ects had results of threatened and endangered species impact assessments that
are publicly available. Seventeen federally listed species were identified as occurring or
potentially occurring within the Proj
ect area, including two plants (south Texas ambrosia and
Environmental Impact Statement

4-219

Corpus Christi LNG

slender rush-pea), nine mammals (five whales, ocelot, gulf coast j
aguarundi, and West Indian
manatee), two birds (whooping crane and piping plover), and five reptiles (loggerhead sea turtle,
green sea turtle, leatherback sea turtle, Atlantic hawksbill sea turtle, and Kemp’s ridley sea
turtle). We have determined the Proj
ect would not be likely to adversely affect any of these
federally listed threatened and endangered species. An additional 24 state listed species were
identified in San Patricio and Nueces Counties, 14 of which would not be impacted and 10 which
would not likely be impacted by the Proj
ect.
According to the Environmental Assessment for the La Quinta Channel Extension, the
proj
ect would either have no effect or would not be likely to adversely affect the species listed in
Nueces and San Patricio Counties. Dredging of the Ship Channel may indirectly impact EFH
due to increased turbidity and suspended sediment load in the estuarine water column;however,
these impacts on EFH are expected to be temporary and minor. OxyChem developed a draft BA
to assess any potential impacts from its NGL Fractionation Facility on the listed threatened and
endangered species. The results of this BA determined that the proj
ect would have no effect on
four of these listed species and may affect, but would not be likely to adversely affect the
remaining listed species. Additionally, the BA states that the NGL Fractionation Facility would
have no adverse impacts on EFH. The GHG PSD permit application for FHR’s West Refinery
Expansion indicates that no listed threatened and endangered species or their critical habitats
occur within the proj
ect’s potential impact area and thus, no impacts on listed species are
expected. Freeport LNG indicated in its application to the FERC that the proj
ect will have no
effect, or will be not likely to adversely affect any threatened or endangered species in the area.
No adverse impacts on threatened and endangered species are expected occur as a result
of the Proj
ect and the proj
ects identified in table 4.13-1 (see appendix C)(with publicly available
species impact assessments);therefore, no cumulative impacts are anticipated. However,
dredging associated with the Proj
ect;the abandonment, removal, or relocation of the nonj
urisdictional natural gas pipelines;and the La Quinta Channel Extension could result in adverse
cumulative impacts on EFH. However, dredging activities for the La Quinta Channel Extension
and the abandonment, removal, or relocation of the non-j
urisdictional natural gas pipelines
would not be performed in conj
unction with the Proj
ect and thus, cumulative impacts on EFH
would not be significant.
4.13.5.7

Land Use,Recreation,and Visual Resources

The cumulative impact area for land use was considered to be the area adj
acent to and in
the vicinity of the proposed Proj
ect. The cumulative impact area for recreation was considered
to be GIWW, the Corpus Christi and La Quinta Ship Channels, and Corpus Christi Bay. The
cumulative impact area for visual resources was considered to be the area within the viewsheds
of the Proj
ect facilities.
Almost all proj
ects identified (on land)in the vicinity of the Proj
ect, including the nonj
urisdictional electrical power line extensions and waterline, would be or have been, constructed
on, or adj
acent to, highly disturbed industrial or agricultural lands. A significant, additional
cumulative loss of unique or special interest lands would not occur as a result of constructing or
operating the proj
ects. The installation of the Pipeline and other pipelines across agricultural
lands would result only in short-term impacts on agricultural and open, herbaceous lands, as land
use would be restored following completion of construction activities.

Environmental Impact Statement

4-220

Corpus Christi LNG

The Corpus Christi Bay is actively utilized for recreation activities such as boating and
fishing;therefore, it is probable that the construction or operation of the identified proj
ects could
have a significant, negative impact on the area’s recreational value. However, the Corpus Christi
and La Quinta Ship Channels are already actively used by commercial ship traffic, as the Port of
Corpus Christi is the fifth largest commercial port in the U.S. Though total port traffic would
increase, large ships would be restricted to the deep water-dredged Corpus Christi and La Quinta
Ship Channels, while most recreational boaters would utilize shallower channels of the GIWW
and many shallow water bays within the Corpus Christi Bay area.
The visual character of the existing landscape is defined by historic and current land uses
such as recreation, conservation, and development. The visual qualities of the landscape are
further influenced by existing installations such as highways, railroads, pipelines, and electrical
transmission and distribution lines and facilities. Cumulatively, the identified proj
ects’
infrastructure facilities and their construction would have some visual impact on the immediate
surroundings. However, the identified proj
ects would be consistent with ongoing industrial
activities and existing facilities along the Corpus Christi and La Quinta Ship channels.
The proposed non-j
urisdictional underground power line and waterline would be buried
from the AEP substation to the Proj
ect substation at the Terminal site and would not affect the
visual character of the area after construction is complete. The overhead power line and
supporting structures would alter visual quality and expand the industrial character of the area to
the north of the Terminal site. However, the visual quality would be consistent with the
industrial character of the surrounding area and consistent with electrical transmission lines that
parallel many roadways in the area.
Impacts on visual resources resulting from the storage tanks and flare stack would be
moderate and permanent;however, due to the proximity of the Terminal to other industrial
structures, the storage tanks and flare stack would be consistent with the surrounding land use.
There are no residences, schools, community parks, or public areas that would be
considered visually sensitive areas within 1 mile of the Terminal. The Terminal would use the
minimum lighting necessary to allow personnel to safely work and inspect the equipment at the
Terminal. The lighting at the Terminal would be consistent with lighting at other industrial
facilities along the La Quinta Channel and would not significantly increase light pollution in the
area. Therefore, cumulative impacts from lighting and nighttime flaring on the environment
would not be significant.
4.13.5.8 Socioeconomics
The cumulative impact area for socioeconomics included San Patricio and Nueces
Counties. The construction period for the Proj
ect would likely be concurrent with those of
several of the maj
or La Quinta Channel proj
ects and the non-j
urisdictional electrical power line
extensions and waterline. Combined, the proj
ects identified would generate several thousand
temporary construction j
obs and many permanent j
obs associated with various operational duties.
Many of the workers would likely reside locally and would not require temporary housing.
However, if temporary housing would be required for multiple proj
ects occurring concurrently,
Corpus Christi offers a relatively large number of temporary housing facilities such as hotels,
campgrounds, and RV parks.

Environmental Impact Statement

4-221

Corpus Christi LNG

Positive benefits of the new j
obs and workers in the area would include lowering local
unemployment rates, increasing revenue for local business owners, and generating new tax
revenue to the Corpus Christi area. No identified minority or low-income populations would be
disproportionately impacted by the proj
ects (see section 4.9.9);therefore, the Proj
ect would not
contribute to cumulative impacts on these populations.
A cumulative impact on land transportation would be dependent on the construction
schedules and amount of overlap between the construction phases for all of the identified
proj
ects in the geographic region. Construction of the non-j
urisdictional electric power lines and
substations and the non-j
urisdictional waterline would contribute to cumulative impacts on
traffic along portions of US 361 and in the vicinity of the Terminal site, primarily at the
beginning and end of each construction shift. Although we recognize concurrent construction of
the proposed Proj
ect and other proj
ects in the vicinity of the Terminal site would result in
increased workers in the area, periods of increased traffic, and impacts on public services, we are
not recommending additional mitigation at this time. Therefore, we have determined that with
the implementation of Cheniere’s mitigation measures, the impacts of the Proj
ect when added
with other proj
ects’impacts would not result in significant cumulative impacts.
Currently, the Port accommodates more than 6,000 vessels and 80,000 tons of cargo
annually. The amount of vessel traffic in the Nueces Bay area would not significantly increase
as a result of construction and operation of the Cheniere Terminal and other identified proj
ects.
However, it is not anticipated that the Corpus Christi and La Quinta Ship Channels Port would
be adversely impacted, as the Port has been maintained in such a way as to handle significant
increases in docking a maneuvering capacity.
4.13.5.9

Cultural Resources

Because no historic properties have been identified to date that would be adversely
effected by Cheniere’s proposal, that proj
ect would not be adding incrementally to cumulative
regional impacts on cultural resources which are listed or eligible for listing on the NRHP. Any
other proj
ects with a federal nexus would have to adhere to section 106 of the NHPA, and follow
the regulatory requirements of 36 CFR 800. Under those regulations, the lead federal agency, in
consultation with the SHPO, would have to identify historic properties in the APE, assess
potential proj
ect effects, and resolve adverse effects through an agreement document that
outlines a treatment plan. The NHPA and its implementing regulations ensure that proj
ects that
require a federal permit, license, or approval would not have significant cumulative impacts on
historic properties.
4.13.5.10 Air Qualityand Noise
The cumulative impact area for air quality during construction of the Proj
ect is the area
adj
acent to and near the boundary of the Terminal site and along the Pipeline. The cumulative
impact area for air quality during operation of the proj
ect was established based on the Proj
ect’s
PSD Area of Impact, as described in section 4.11.1
Construction of the Proj
ect and many of the past, present, or future proj
ects listed in
table 4.13-1 (see appendix C)would involve the use of construction equipment that generates air
pollution, including fugitive dust. Operation of construction equipment would be primarily
restricted to daylight hours and would be minimized through typical controls and practices, some
of which are required under TCEQ rules. The emissions from construction activities for the
Environmental Impact Statement

4-222

Corpus Christi LNG

Proj
ect and other proj
ects in the region would result in short-term emissions that would be
localized to each proj
ect area;therefore, construction emissions are not expected to have a
significant cumulative impact on regional air quality.
Operation of the Proj
ect, including LNG carriers and associated support vessels in the
vicinity of the Terminal, would contribute cumulatively to air pollutant levels in combination
with some of the other proj
ects identified as part of the cumulative impacts analysis. As
discussed in section 4.11.1.4, detailed air quality impact analyses were conducted by Cheniere to
quantitatively evaluate the combined impacts from operation of the Proj
ect and other emission
sources in the region, including pollutant background concentrations. Those combined impacts
were compared against the NAAQS, which are designed to be protective of human health and the
environment. The results of the NAAQS analyses demonstrated that there would be no
significant impact on regional air quality from operation of the Proj
ect.
Newly proposed (future) proj
ects in the area (e.g., Voestalpine DRI Plant) would
contribute cumulatively to air quality through construction and operation activities. Each of
these proj
ects would need to comply with federal, state, and local air quality regulations, which
may require controls to limit the emissions of certain criteria pollutants or HAPs. Although
outside the scope of our analysis, it is anticipated that these proj
ect activities would result in
increased permanent emissions of criteria pollutants, HAPs, and GHGs within the region. The
Proj
ect’s associated operating emissions would be mitigated by federal and state permits and
approvals. Thus, the Proj
ect is not anticipated to contribute to the cumulative impact on regional
air quality as a result of operation.
Noise levels typically attenuate quickly as the distance from the noise source increases.
Therefore, the cumulative impact area considered for noise is within about 1.5 miles of the
Terminal, 1 mile of the pipeline route, and a 1-mile radius of the Sinton and Taft Compressor
Stations. The only proj
ects in the cumulative impact area that may be constructed at the same
time as the Terminal are the OxyChem NGL Fractionation Facility and Ethylene Plant, and
Voestalpine DRI Plant. Noise produced during the construction of these identified proj
ects could
create some short-term impacts on nearby residences and could have short-term impacts on some
aquatic species. However, Noise impacts during construction of these proj
ects would be
localized and would attenuate as the distance from the noise source increases. The nearest NSAs
in the vicinity of the Terminal site are over one mile away. Therefore, cumulative noise impacts
associated with construction would be unlikely to be noticeable, unless one or more of the
proj
ects were constructed concurrently at the same location.
Operation of the identified proj
ects with land-based facilities would also generate noise.
For the Proj
ect, the FERC would require that noise generated during operation would not exceed
the 55 decibel limit established by the EPA for protection of public health and welfare. The
combined operation of the identified proj
ects, should they all be authorized, could result in the
raising of the average ambient noise level at the nearest NSAs but not by a significant measure.
Cumulative operational noise would be audible at the Terminal, but should not be significantly
greater than current measured ambient noise due to noise attenuation.
4.13.5.11 Climate Change
Climate change is the change in climate over an extended period of time, whether due to
natural variability, human activities, or a combination of both, and cannot be characterized by an
individual event or anomalous weather pattern. For example, a severe drought or abnormally hot
Environmental Impact Statement

4-223

Corpus Christi LNG

summer in a particular region is not an indication of climate change, while a series of severe
droughts or hot summers that statistically alter the trend in average precipitation or temperature
over decades may indicate climate change.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)is the leading international,
multi-governmental scientific body for the assessment of climate change. The U.S. is a member
of the IPCC and participates in the IPCC working groups studying various aspects of climate
change. The leading U.S. scientific body on climate change is the U.S. Global Change Research
Program (USGCRP). Thirteen federal departments and agencies45 participate in the USGCRP,
which began as a presidential initiative in 1989 and was mandated by Congress in the Global
Change Research Act of 1990 (GCRA). The USGCRP coordinates and supports U.S.
participation in the IPCC assessments.
The IPCC and USGCRP have recognized that:


globally, GHGs have been accumulating in the atmosphere since the beginning of the
industrial era (circa 1750);



combustion of fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, and natural gas), combined with agriculture
and clearing of forests, is primarily responsible for the accumulation of GHG;



anthropogenic GHG emissions are the primary contributing factor to climate change;and



impacts extend beyond atmospheric climate change alone, and include changes to water
resources, transportation, agriculture, ecosystems, and human health.

The USGCRP issued the report, Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States, in
June 2009 summarizing the impacts climate change has already had on the U.S. and the
proj
ected future impacts due to continued climate change (USGCRP, 2009). The report
describes the effects of global change on different regions of the U.S. (e.g., Southeast)and on
various societal and environmental sectors, such as water resources, agriculture, energy use, and
human health. Building on the findings presented in this report as well as other recent research,
the USGCRP issued the report, The National Global Change Research Plan 2012-2021: A
Strategic Plan for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which outlines specific goals and
obj
ectives for the Program to generate and disseminate scientific knowledge that is readily
available and directly useful to decision-makers and the general public (USGCRP, 2012). These
efforts are intended to fulfill the Congressional mandate of the GCRA. Although climate change
is a global concern, for this analysis, the focus is on the cumulative impacts of climate change in
the Proj
ect area.
The USGCRP’s report notes the following observations of environmental impacts that
may be attributed to climate change in the Southeast region:
 average temperatures have risen about 2°F since 1970 and are proj
ected to increase
another 4.5 to 9°F during this century;
 increases in illness and death due to greater summer heat stress;

The USGCRP member agencies are: Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of
Defense, Department of Energy, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of the Interior, Department
of State, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, National Science Foundation, Smithsonian Institution, and U.S. Agency for International
Development.

 the destructive potential of Atlantic hurricanes increased since 1970 and the intensity
(with higher peak wind speeds, rainfall intensity, and storm surge height and strength)is
likely to increase during this century;
 within the past century in the U.S., relative sea level changes ranged from falling several
inches to rising about 2 feet and are proj
ected to increase another 3 to 4 feet this century;
 sea level rise and human alterations have caused coastal wetland loss during the past
century, reducing the capacity of those wetlands to protect against storm surge, and
proj
ected sea level rise is anticipated to result in the loss of a large portion of the nation’s
remaining coastal wetlands;
 declines in dissolved oxygen in streams and lakes have caused fish kills and loss of
aquatic species diversity;
 moderate to severe spring and summer drought areas have increased 12 to 14 percent
(with frequency, duration and intensity also increasing and proj
ected to increase);
 longer periods of time between rainfall events may lead to declines in recharge of
groundwater and decreased water availability;
 responses to decreased water availability, such as increased groundwater pumping, may
lead to stress or depletion of aquifers and a strain on surface water sources;
 increases in evaporation and plant water loss rates may alter the balance of runoff and
groundwater recharge, which would likely to lead to saltwater intrusion into shallow
aquifers;
 coastal waters temperature rose about 2°F in several regions and are likely to continue to
warm as much as 4 to 8°F this century;and
 coastal water warming may lead to the transport of invasive species through ballast water
exchange during ship transit.
Climate Change in the Proj
ect region would have two effects which may cause increased
storm surges;increase temperatures of Gulf Waters which would increase storm intensity, and a
rising sea level. Even with the increased sea levels due to climate change, and increased storm
surge, the critical structure elevations of 25-feet above mean sea level at the Liquefaction Plant
would provide a significant barrier to even a 100-year climate change-enhanced storm surge.
The GHG emissions associated with construction and operation of the Proj
ect were
identified and quantified in section 4.11.1.4. Based on the total annual potential emissions for
the constructed Terminal and Sinton and Taft Compressor Stations, Proj
ect operations would
increase CO2 emissions in Texas by approximately 0.5 percent (based on 2010 emissions for the
State [DOE, 2013]).
GHG emissions from sources located at Proj
ect facilities (Terminal and Sinton
Compressor Stations)would be minimized by application of EPA-approved BACT under the
PSD permitting program. Cheniere prepared a BACT analysis for the proposed refrigeration
compressor turbines, standby generators, flares, thermal oxidizers, and fugitive emissions at the
Terminal which was submitted to TCEQ for review. CO2 emissions from the turbines would be
minimized through use of natural gas as fuel, design energy efficiency, and operational energy

efficiency (i.e., good combustion practices) as BACT.
The aeroderivative-class GE
LM2500+G4 SAC model turbines selected by Cheniere have a higher thermal efficiency than the
heavy-duty frame-class turbines. Also, natural gas for fuel yields the lowest CO2 emissions, on a
lb/MWh basis, of any fuel available for the turbines. Cheniere’s design also includes a waste
heat recovery system on the exhaust of two ethylene turbines for each liquefaction train to
provide the required heat for gas treatment, thus avoiding the need for new CO2-emitting gasfired heaters. Cheniere proposed a BACT emission limit for the turbines of 0.058 ton
CO2/MMBtu. BACT for the flares and thermal oxidizers is the implementation of design and
operational energy efficiency measures, along with a BACT emission limit for the oxidizers of
57.8 ton CO2 per million standard cubic feet. BACT for the limited-use standby generators and
fire water pump engines is the use of efficiently designed and operated generators with low
annual capacity factors (expected to be no more than 0.6 percent). BACT for fugitive emissions
from natural gas components is a gas leak detection and repair program, including a modified
form of the TCEQ 28M leak detection and repair program for fugitive emissions of methane.
Cheniere also prepared a BACT analysis for the proposed compressor turbines, standby
generator, and gas blowdowns at the Sinton Compressor Station, which was reviewed by EPA.
BACT for the turbines is the use of natural gas as fuel, with a proposed emission limit of 0.058
ton CO2/MMBtu. BACT for the standby generator is the use of efficiently designed and
operated generator using natural gas. BACT for the gas blowdowns is the use of an additional
seal gas booster system for the gas compressors and the capability to burn potential blowdown
gases as fuel, assuming at least one turbine is in operation.
Cheniere provided an assessment of the feasibility of a carbon capture and storage system
to TCEQ as part of the GHG permit application BACT analysis. Cheniere provided information
on the technical and economic feasibility of developing and using carbon capture and storage for
the Terminal and Sinton Compressor Stations. This technology involves deploying a method to
capture carbon from the exhaust stream of the combustion units and then finding a method for
permanent storage (inj
ecting the recovered CO2 underground through various means, including
enhanced oil recovery, saline aquifers, and un-mineable coal seams). In the GHG BACT
analysis, Cheniere stated that there is no commercially available carbon capture system of the
scale that would be required to control the CO2 emissions from compressor turbines, thermal
oxidizers, and flares, such as those typically located at an LNG terminal or compressor station.
Also, Cheniere stated that no long-term CO2 storage facilities are located near the Proj
ect, as the
region does not have geological formations that support sequestration. Based on the magnitude
of the estimated capital and annualized costs, Cheniere demonstrated that CCS is not
economically feasible. Even if feasibility could be demonstrated, Cheniere noted that any CCS
system would cause significant adverse energy and environmental impacts due to the additional
water and energy needs for system operation, with the associated generation of additional GHGs
and other criteria pollutants from natural gas firing in combustion units. EPA and TCEQ are still
evaluating the GHG permit applications for the Terminal and Sinton Compressor Station.
Climate Change in the region would have two effects which may cause increased storm
surges;increase temperatures of Gulf Waters which would increase storm intensity, and a rising
sea level. Even with the increased sea levels due to climate change, and increased storm surge,
the critical structure elevations of 25-feet above mean sea level at the Liquefaction Plant would
provide a significant barrier to even a 100-year climate change-enhanced storm surge.

Environmental Impact Statement

Corpus Christi LNG

Currently, there is no standard methodology to determine how the Proj
ect’s incremental
contribution to GHGs would result in physical effects on the environment, either locally or
globally. However, estimated emissions associated with the Proj
ect would incrementally
increase the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs, in combination with GHG emissions from
other sources identified in the cumulative impacts analysis. Because we cannot determine the
Proj
ect’s incremental physical impacts due to climate change on the environment, we cannot
determine whether or not the Proj
ect’s contribution to cumulative impacts on climate change
would be significant.
4.13.5.12 Safety
For the proposed Terminal, we considered the cumulative impact area for marine vessel
traffic to include the water route from the Aransas Pass Sea Buoy, through the entrance of the
Jetty Channel, Corpus Christi Channel, and the La Quinta Channel, terminating at the Terminal
marine berths. The cumulative impact area for the Terminal is the area adj
acent to and in the
vicinity of the Terminal site, and the cumulative impact area for the Pipeline was considered to
be within about 660 yards of the pipeline centerline. The cumulative impact area for emergency
services includes the area in the general vicinity of the Terminal and the Pipeline.
Cheniere would mitigate impacts on public safety through the implementation of
applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations for the proposed Proj
ect as described in
section 4.12. Those rules and regulations would ensure that the applicable design and
engineering standards are implemented to protect the public and avoid or minimize the potential
for accidents and failures.
As noted in section 4.12, the risk associated with the Pipeline would be small. In
addition, the proposed Pipeline is adj
acent to several pipelines and crosses several other
pipelines. Although operation of the proposed Pipeline would increase the risk of a pipeline
accident, the increase in risk would be small. As a result, cumulative impact on risk for the
Pipeline would not be significant.
Emergency response time is a key aspect of public health and safety. Key emergency
services would be provided by the existing services in San Patricio and Nueces Counties. In
accordance with our regulations, Cheniere would prepare a comprehensive plan that identifies
the cost sharing mechanisms for funding these emergency response costs. Therefore, the
cumulative impact of each proj
ect’s comprehensive plans would not result in a significant impact
on public safety.
4.13.6

Conclusions for Overall Cumulative Impacts

A thorough determination regarding the significance of cumulative impacts for specific
environmental resources is difficult due to a lack of access to the details of activities for many
identified proj
ects. Additionally, distinct threshold values for most environmental resources are
typically undetermined. The most significant cumulative impacts would occur should all
identified proj
ects in the area be constructed concurrently with the Proj
ect;however, this is not
anticipated. However, construction of the Terminal, in addition several of the identified proj
ects,
would result in the permanent loss of various wildlife habitats and natural land use types. As a
result, construction of the Proj
ect would cumulatively contribute to the increasing
industrialization of agricultural and/or open lands in the area.

Environmental Impact Statement

4-227

Corpus Christi LNG

Most of the cumulative environmental impacts identified would be short-term and minor,
such as impacts on geology, soils, water, threatened and endangered species, and terrestrial
vegetation. The Proj
ect and several of the identified proj
ects would increase vessel traffic within
the Port;however, the large port would more than likely be capable to adequately accommodate
such an increase and thus, would not contribute significantly to cumulative impacts on marine
traffic.
Wetlands and SAV within the region would sustain the most significant impacts, as
dredging and other activities associated with the Proj
ect and others would result in the
degradation and permanent loss of these resources. Compensatory and voluntary mitigation
plans and procedures for many of the proj
ects would offset the severity of cumulative permanent
impacts on wetlands and SAV. Cheniere would comply with the terms and conditions of the
Section 404 permit by creating new wetland habitat and protect existing habitat, and would not
significantly contribute to the loss of wetlands.
Cumulative benefits would be realized from the creation of new wetlands, seagrass, and
marsh habitats through compensatory and voluntary mitigation programs. Additionally, the
Proj
ect and identified proj
ects would enhance the local economy through j
obs and wages,
purchases of goods and materials, and tax revenues.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
SECTION 5

5.0

CONCLUSIONSAND RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1

SUMMARY OFTHE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

The conclusions and recommendations presented in this section are those of the FERC
environmental staff. Our conclusions and recommendations are based on input from the COE,
Coast Guard, DOE, DOT, and EPA as cooperating agencies in the preparation of this EIS.
However, the cooperating agencies will present their own conclusions and recommendations in
their respective Records of Decision and determinations, and can adopt this EIS consistent with
40 CFR 1501.3 if, after an independent review of the document, they conclude that their
requirements have been satisfied. Otherwise, they may elect to conduct their own supplemental
environmental analysis.
We conclude that construction and operation of the Corpus Christi LNG Proj
ect would
result in temporary and short-term impacts on numerous resources. However, the Proj
ect would
result in permanent impacts on wetlands, EFH, agricultural lands, and visual resources;and longterm impacts on air quality. As part of our analysis, we developed specific mitigation measures
that are practical, appropriate, and reasonable for construction and operation of the Proj
ect. We
are, therefore, recommending that these mitigation measures be attached as conditions to any
authorization issued by the Commission. Implementation of the mitigation proposed by
Cheniere and our recommended mitigation would ensure that impacts in the Proj
ect area would
be avoided or minimized and would not be significant. A summary of the Proj
ect impacts and
our conclusions are presented below by resource.
5.1.1

Geologic Resources

Construction and operation of the Proj
ect would not significantly alter the geologic
conditions of the Proj
ect area or affect mining of resources. Additional information is required
on the geology and seismology of the Terminal site to adequately design the facilities to prevent
any safety risks. Therefore, we are recommending that Cheniere file the Terminal and LNG tank
designs and construction details stamped and sealed by the professional engineer-of-record. The
Pipeline would not cross any significant geologic hazards, including areas of seismic activity or
subsidence. Cheniere is committed to conducting geotechnical investigations for the HDDs to
determine general subsurface conditions prior to constructing the Pipeline. Blasting is not
anticipated during construction of either the Terminal or the Pipeline. Based on Cheniere’s
proposal, including implementation of our Plan and Procedures and our recommended mitigation
measures, impacts on geological resources would be adequately minimized and would not be
significant, and that the potential for impacts on the Proj
ect from geologic hazards would also be
minimal.
5.1.2

Soils

Construction of the Proj
ect facilities would disturb soils, resulting in increased potential
for erosion, compaction, and mixing of topsoil. Soils within the Terminal site have high erosion
potential. Addition areas susceptible to erosion within the Proj
ect area include stream banks and
the banks of drainage ditches crossed by the Pipeline. Cheniere would implement the erosion
and sediment control measures outlined in our Plan and Procedures. Cheniere would further
minimize potential for shoreline erosion at the Terminal by installing articulated block mats or

Environmental Impact Statement

5-1

Corpus Christi LNG

rock breakwaters to protect the shoreline within the marine vessel maneuvering area from
erosion.
Construction of the Terminal would not significantly impact prime farmlands, as the area
was previously disturbed. However, construction of the Pipeline would result in the loss of 21.5
acres of prime farmland due to the installation of permanent aboveground facilities. Most
impacts during pipeline construction would be short-term and would not impact potential use of
prime farmland for agricultural purposes. Implementation of measures outlined in our Plan
would adequately minimize the impacts from the Proj
ect on prime farmland.
Due to the historic industrial use of the Terminal site and surrounding areas, there would
be potential for contaminated soils to be discovered during construction. However, no areas of
contamination have been identified at the Terminal site. In order to ensure that no contaminated
soils are imported to the site for use as structural fill, removed from the site, or discovered during
construction, Cheniere would follow guidelines outlined in its Specification for Site Preparation
and Earthwork to fulfill the requirements for soils imported to the site.
5.1.3

Water Resources

Due to the non-potable saline groundwater conditions that naturally occur at the
Terminal, lack of water supply wells in the area, depth of groundwater below land surface in
relation to anticipated excavation depths, construction of the proposed pilings within the
permeable zone of the Chicot aquifer rather than crossing the aquifer confining layers, and
surficial mitigation measures that would be implemented by Cheniere including those described
in its SPCC Plan and our Procedures, no significant impact on the groundwater resources
underlying the Terminal facilities is anticipated.
Impacts on groundwater as a result of the Pipeline would be similar to that discussed for
the Terminal. The greatest potential for impacts on groundwater would be an accidental release
of a hazardous substance, such as fuels, lubricants, and coolants while constructing and operating
the Pipeline. We have determined that the implementation of measures outlined in Cheniere’s
SPCC Plan and our Procedures would adequately minimize potential impacts on groundwater
resources resulting from construction and operation of the Pipeline.
Construction and operation of the Terminal would result in decreased water quality of
Corpus Christi Bay within the vicinity of the site as a result of initial dredging and maintenance
dredging, as well as stormwater runoff and dewatering. Impacts on water quality from dredging
activities would be short-term and localized to within a few hundred feet of the activity. Impacts
on water quality from dredging would be minimized by the use of a hydraulic cutterhead dredge
which effectively captures most sediment disturbed during dredging. Through implantation of
NPDES regulations, our Procedures, and Cheniere’s SPCC Plan, potential impacts resulting from
stormwater runoff or the discharge of hydrostatic test water would be adequately minimized or
avoided. We have determined that with implementation of the measures outlined above, impacts
on surface water resources as a result of the construction and operation of the Terminal would
not be significant.
Waterbodies crossed by the Pipeline via the open cut method would experience
short-term impacts on water quality including increased turbidity, sedimentation, and overall
stream bed and bank disturbance. Cheniere would avoid significantly impacting water quality in
two of the nine waterbodies crossed by the Pipeline, Chiltipin and Oliver Creeks, by utilizing
Environmental Impact Statement

5-2

Corpus Christi LNG

HDD crossing methods. We have determined that implementation of Cheniere’s SPCC Plan, the
HDD crossing method, and the measures outlined in our Procedures would adequately minimize
impacts on surface water resources associated with the construction and operation of the
Pipeline.
5.1.4

Wetlands

Construction and operation of the Terminal would result in the disturbance of 27.45 acres
of wetlands including 25.67 of permanent wetland loss. Wetlands within the Terminal consist of
cordgrass salt marsh, black mangrove, unvegetated sand flat, vegetated flats/high marsh, and
seagrass. To mitigate unavoidable impacts on wetlands at the Terminal, Cheniere submitted to
the COE an ARMP for the Proj
ect. As part of the 404 permit process, the COE will require that
Cheniere conduct a functional assessment to more adequately evaluate wetland impacts and
mitigation associated with the Proj
ect. Pending the results of the functional assessment, the COE
may require increased compensation as part of Cheniere’s final ARMP. We are recommending
that Cheniere file its final ARMP once complete prior to construction. Cheniere would monitor
all temporarily impacted wetlands in accordance with our Procedures until restoration is
complete.
The Pipeline would cross four PEM wetlands, three of which would be crossed by HDD
and would not result in any impacts. One small wetland (less than 0.01 acre)is located within
the proposed permanent pipeline easement and would be restored to preconstruction conditions
following the completion of construction activities.
Based on Cheniere’s proposed impact mitigation measures as well as preparation of the
functional assessment and ARMP to be approved by the COE, we have determined that
constructing and operating the Terminal and Pipeline would not have a significant impact on
wetlands.
5.1.5

Vegetation

Land-based facilities at the Terminal would not significantly impact vegetation, as the
site is highly disturbed and sparsely vegetated. Construction and operation of the marine berths
would permanently impact approximately 9.17 acres of SAV (seagrass beds). Mitigation for the
permanent conversion of SAV to deep water habitat would be mitigated by Cheniere through
implementation of its ARMP as discussed in section 4.4.1. Approximately 0.12 acre of SAV
will be temporarily impacted. Cheniere would adhere to our Procedures, including postconstruction monitoring, to ensure restoration of these areas following construction.
Based on the disturbed nature of the Terminal site, the amounts and types of vegetation
impacted, and Cheniere’s proposed impact minimization and mitigation measures, we have
determined that constructing and operating the Terminal facilities would not significantly impact
vegetation.
No sensitive vegetation would be impacted by the Pipeline. Vegetation impacted by the
Pipeline would be predominantly agricultural crops with some herbaceous and scrub-shrub
vegetation in open land. All areas impacted by installation of the Pipeline, with the exception of
the MLVs and two compressor stations, would be restored to preconstruction conditions. Due to
the abundance of similar vegetation in the area, permanent impacts on vegetation from the
aboveground facilities would not be significant.
Environmental Impact Statement

5-3

Corpus Christi LNG

5.1.6

Wildlife and Aquatic Resources

Construction and operation of the Terminal would result in the removal and/or
conversion of wildlife habitats at the site. Land-based facilities would result in the permanent
conversion of open land to industrial land. However, due to the previous industrial use of the
site and its proximity to other industrial areas, we conclude that this would not constitute a
significant impact on terrestrial wildlife habitat. To minimize impacts on wildlife, Cheniere
would restrict the size of construction areas to the maximum extent practicable and implement
measures described in our Plan and Procedures to avoid or minimize off-site impacts.
Construction and operation of the marine berths could impact aquatic reptiles and
mammals, as well as fisheries resources, as a result of dredging and pile driving during
construction and from LNG carrier traffic during operation. Impacts from pile driving and other
construction activities would be temporary. Operation impacts would be permanent;however,
because such activities are already common in the vicinity of the Terminal, and Cheniere would
inform LNG carriers about vessel strike avoidance measures, we have determined that impacts
on marine mammals and reptiles would not be significant.
Impacts on fisheries and other aquatic resources, including EFH would primarily result
from dredging, dredge disposal, and pile driving activities. These activities would also similarly
impact recreational and commercial fisheries. Additionally, LNG carriers calling on the
Terminal and other ship-related marine traffic and operations could also impact fisheries
resources. Impacts on EFH are further discussed in the EFH Assessment in appendix B.
Cheniere would adhere to measures outlined in our Plan and Procedures as well as its
ARMP to minimize and mitigate for impacts on fish and other aquatic resources. Potential
impacts associated with stormwater runoff would be minimized or avoided through
implementation of Cheniere’s SPCC Plan, construction of drainage ditches at the Terminal, and
adherence to NPDES regulations. Cheniere would also obtain state water quality certification
under Section 401 of the CWA from the RRC, and a Section 10/404 permit from the COE. We
have determined that construction and operation of the Terminal would impact fisheries and
other aquatic resources;however, based on Cheniere’s implementation of the measures outlined
above and in its ARMP, these impacts have been sufficiently minimized.
No sensitive wildlife habitats would be impacted by construction or operation of the
Pipeline. The maj
ority of the area disturbed during construction would be agricultural land and
open land that would revert back to preconstruction condition and use following the completion
of construction activities. Areas adj
acent to the Pipeline area provide similar and ample habitats
for wildlife displaced temporarily during construction of the Pipeline. Wildlife would return to
the maj
ority of the Proj
ect area following construction and restoration. Impacts on wildlife
during construction and operation of the Pipeline would be minimized by the implementation of
our Plan and Procedures as well as restriction of vegetation clearing between March 1 and
August 31 to avoid impacts on migratory birds. If vegetation clearing must be conducted during
this time, Cheniere would survey for migratory bird nests no more than three weeks prior to
commencing work. If an active migratory bird nest is found, Cheniere would consult with the
FWS to identify the most appropriate measure to be taken to avoid or minimize impacts.
Impacts on aquatic resources associated with construction and operation of the Pipeline
would consist of loss of aquatic habitat, disturbance of the stream bed, and increased turbidity
and sedimentation. Two of the nine waterbodies crossed by the Pipeline support sustainable
Environmental Impact Statement

5-4

Corpus Christi LNG

fisheries (Oliver and Chiltipin Creeks); however, Cheniere would cross both of these
waterbodies via HDD, avoiding direct impacts to fisheries and other aquatic resources.
Additionally, Cheniere would complete all waterbody crossings in accordance with the
construction and mitigation measures described in our Procedures.
Based on the characteristics of the fisheries contained within the nine waterbodies that
would be crossed and Cheniere’s use of HDDs and its implementation of impact minimization
measures as described in our Procedures, we have determined that constructing and operating the
Pipeline facilities would not significantly impact aquatic resources.
5.1.7

Threatened,Endangered,and Other Sensitive Species

Based on consultations with the FWS and NOAA Fisheries, as well as Cheniere’s habitat
surveys, 13 federally listed species potentially occur in the general Proj
ect area. We have
determined that construction and operation of the Proj
ect is not likely to adversely affect the blue
whale, fin whale, humpback whale, sei whale, sperm whale, West Indian manatee, whooping
crane, piping plover, loggerhead sea turtle, green sea turtle, leatherback sea turtle, Atlantic
hawksbill sea turtle, and Kemp’s ridley sea turtle at the Terminal, and that the Pipeline would
have no effect on federally listed species. Regarding federally listed threatened and endangered
species, NOAA Fisheries notified Cheniere on October 29, 2012 that initiation of Section 7
consultation would not be required;and in letters dated August 8, 2013 and November 5, 2013,
the FWS concurred with determinations that the Proj
ect is not likely to adversely affect species
under its j
urisdiction.
Ten state listed species were identified as potentially occurring within the Proj
ect area.
Based on the presence of potential habitat, we conclude that Cheniere’s collocation with existing
utility corridors and constructing primarily within previously disturbed areas would avoid or
minimize potential impacts on state listed species by reducing the overall extent of new land
disturbance.
In summary, implementation of Cheniere’s mitigation measures and use of our Plan and
Procedures during construction and operation of the Proj
ect would adequately minimize impacts
on federally and state listed species.
5.1.8

Land Use,Recreation,and Visual Resources

Construction of the Terminal would occur within a previous industrial site that has since
been reclaimed and would result in permanent impacts on 321 acres of open land and 148 acres
of open water. The maj
ority of the open land area used for operation would be permanently
converted to industrial land (approximately 5 acres would be converted to open water). Open
water areas impacted by operation would remain open water, but would be dredged to a greater
depth. To ensure compliance with the CZMA, we are recommending that Cheniere file RRC
concurrence that the Proj
ect is consistent with the Texas CZMP.
Construction and operation of the Pipeline, including permanent access roads, would
result in approximately 133.3 acres of permanent operation impacts on agricultural land
(including areas impacted by the permanent pipeline easement that would return to agricultural
use), 38.4 acres of permanent operation impacts on open land (including areas impacted by the
permanent pipeline easement that would return to open land), and 6.6 acres of industrial land for
operation.
Environmental Impact Statement

Corpus Christi LNG

Impacts on visual resources near the Terminal resulting from the storage tanks and
elevated flare stack would be permanent. However, due to the proximity of the Terminal to other
industrial structures, the storage tanks and elevated flare stack would be consistent with the
surrounding viewshed. Visual impacts from facility lighting at the Terminal would be
permanent, but would be the minimum amount necessary to allow personnel to safely work and
inspect the equipment at the Terminal.
The construction of the Pipeline would temporarily impact visual resources along the
route due to the presence of construction personnel and equipment. Construction and operation
of the Taft and Sinton Compressor Stations would permanently impact the viewshed in the area.
However, Taft Compressor Station would be located in a rural area near a wind farm and the
Sinton Compressor Station would not be visible from the nearest public area minimizing and
avoiding impacts on the surrounding viewshed.
5.1.9

Socioeconomics

Construction of the Proj
ect would require a workforce of 2,100 workers, peaking at
approximately 3,300 workers. Cheniere would utilize predominantly local workers during
construction and employ a relatively small full-time operations staff at the Terminal. Proj
ectrelated construction impacts on the regional population would result in a short-term, moderate
increase to the local population, and Proj
ect operation would result in a negligible, long-term
increase.
Construction and operation of the Proj
ect would increase local and state tax revenues
from sales taxes, payroll taxes, and would likely increase local employment. Additionally, the
Proj
ect would not impact any urban or residential areas, and no disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects on minority, low-income communities, or Indian
tribes have been identified.
Impacts on traffic in the Proj
ect area would primarily occur during construction of the
Terminal. During construction, Cheniere would minimize impacts on traffic via the use of
busses to transport workers to the site. Additionally traffic during construction would only
slightly increase overall traffic in the area. During operation, the increase in traffic would be
negligible and would not result in a perceptible increase in area traffic.
Construction and operation of the Terminal would result in an increase in marine traffic
in the area. During operation, Cheniere anticipates receiving approximately 300 LNG carriers
annually. Although LNG carriers would require a moving safety and security zone that would
limit deep draft traffic while LNG carriers are in the channel, the LNG carriers would only be in
the channel for about 1.25 hours and are not anticipated to adversely impact overall vessel traffic
patterns.
5.1.10

Cultural Resources

Cultural resource surveys were conducted for the entire Proj
ect area with the exception of
the area along the Pipeline between MP 0.0 and 0.5. No traditional cultural resources, burials, or
sites of religious significance to Indian tribes were identified in the APE by the National Park
Service, BIA, SHPO, Cheniere, or the Indian tribes contacted by the FERC. We agree with the
SHPO’s determination in a letter dated July 3, 2012, that no historic properties would be affected
in areas that have been inventoried. However, we are recommending that prior to the start of
Environmental Impact Statement

construction Cheniere file with the Secretary the remaining evaluation reports or treatment plans,
and comments on the reports and plans from the Texas SHPO
5.1.11

Air Qualityand Noise

Air quality impacts associated with construction of the Proj
ect would include emissions
from fossil-fueled construction equipment and fugitive dust. Construction emissions associated
with the Pipeline and compressor stations would be temporary and localized; however,
compressor station emissions would transition to operational-phase emissions. The five-year
construction period at the Terminal would result in short-term air quality impacts which would
transition to permanent operational-phase emissions after commissioning and initial start-up.
Cheniere would incorporate fugitive dust control measures during construction to minimize
emissions. However, we and the EPA find that Cheniere has not adequately addressed track-out
onto paved roads as part of its fugitive dust controls. Therefore, we are recommending that
Cheniere file a revised FDCP that incorporates additional mitigation measures to address trackout, prior to the start of construction.
Operation of the Terminal and the Sinton and Taft Compressor Stations would result in
permanent air quality impacts. Cheniere would minimize operation emissions through
implementation of Best Available Control Technology, as required by Cheniere’s operating air
permits. Cheniere has applied for all applicable air permits and would comply with all air permit
requirements for those facilities. The Taft Compressor Station would be below PSD and Title V
permit thresholds and would be classified as a minor source. In addition, air dispersion
modeling, which included LNG carriers and other nearby emission sources, demonstrated that
operation of the Terminal would not result in an exceedance of the NAAQS at any location, with
the exception of NO2. An expanded analysis determined that operation of the Terminal would
not contribute significantly to exceedances of the 1-hour NO2 NAAQS. Air dispersion modeling
also demonstrated that the Sinton Compressor Station would not result in any exceedances of the
NAAQS at any location.
Impacts on noise levels associated with construction of the Proj
ect would generally be
temporary, minor, and limited to daylight hours. The highest noise levels would be generated
during the four to six months of pile driving activities, which are estimated to be well below
significant at all NSAs. Based on the detailed noise assessments for each of the proposed HDD
locations, noise levels from the Chiltipin Creek and US 181/SH 35 HDDs would be below the
existing noise levels at the nearest NSAs. Noise levels may be perceived as twice as loud as the
existing noise levels at one residence located near the Oliver Creek HDD. Cheniere has
committed to performing all HDD activities, except potentially the pipe pullback, during daylight
hours to mitigate significant noise impacts at NSAs.
The Terminal and Sinton and Taft Compressor Stations would generate noise on a
continuous basis during operation. However, the predicted noise levels attributable to operation
of these facilities should not result in significant impacts on the NSAs nearest to those facilities.
To ensure that actual noise levels resulting from Proj
ect operation would not exceed significant
levels, we are recommending that Cheniere file post-construction noise survey reports for each
facility.

Safety

We evaluated the safety of the proposed Terminal facility, the related LNG carrier transit,
and the sendout Pipeline. As part of our evaluation of the Terminal, we performed a technical
review of the preliminary engineering design to ensure sufficient layers of protection would be
included in the facility designs to mitigate the potential for an incident that could impact the
safety of the public. The DOT reviewed the data and methodology Cheniere used to determine
the design spills from various leakage sources, including piping, containers, and equipment
containing hazardous liquids, and stated it has no obj
ection to Cheniere’s methodology for
determining the candidate design spills used to establish the required siting for its proposed
Terminal. The Coast Guard reviewed the suitability of the Corpus Christi Ship Channel from the
entrance approach at Port Aransas to the La Quinta Junction and the entire length of La Quinta
Channel, and issued a LOR indicating the waterway would be suitable for the type and frequency
of the marine traffic associated with the proposed Proj
ect. In addition, Cheniere would be
required to comply with all regulations in 49CFR 192 for its Pipeline and 33 CFR 105, 33 CFR
127, and 49CFR 193 for its Terminal facilities. Based on our engineering design analysis and
recommendations presented in section 4.12 for the Terminal, the design spill methodology
reviewed by DOT for the Terminal, the LOR issued by the Coast Guard for the LNG carrier
transit, and the regulatory requirements for the Pipeline and Terminal, we conclude that the
Proj
ect would not result in significantly increased public safety risks.
5.1.13

Cumulative Impacts

We considered the contributions of the proposed Proj
ect in conj
unction with other
proj
ects in the Proj
ect area to determine the potential for cumulative impact on the resources
affected by the Proj
ect. As a part of that assessment, we identified existing proj
ects, proj
ects
under construction, proj
ects that are proposed or planned, and reasonably foreseeable proj
ects
including existing and proposed LNG import and export terminals, other development proj
ects,
and non-j
urisdictional facilities associated with the Proj
ect. Our assessment considered the
impacts of the proposed Proj
ect combined with the impacts of the other proj
ects on resources
within all or part of the same area and time. We conclude that although cumulative impacts on
some resources would occur, those impacts would not be significant.
Most of the identified cumulative impacts would be temporary and minor. However,
construction of the Terminal, in addition to several of the identified proj
ects, would result in the
permanent loss of various wildlife habitats and natural land use types. As a result, construction
of the Proj
ect would contribute to the increasing industrialization of agricultural and/or open
lands in the area. Additionally, several of the identified proj
ects, as well as the proposed Proj
ect
would contribute to an increase in vessel traffic in the Port. This would be a long-term impact;
however, due to the size of the Port, this would not contribute significantly to cumulative
impacts on marine traffic.
Other temporary and minor cumulative environmental impacts identified include impacts
on water and air quality, threatened and endangered species, and terrestrial vegetation.
Additionally, several of the identified proj
ects, as well as the proposed Proj
ect would contribute
to an increase in vessel traffic in the Port;however, due to the size of the Port, this would not
contribute significantly to cumulative impacts on marine traffic.
Additionally the Proj
ect would result in cumulative impacts on wetlands and SAV within
the region when combined with dredging and degradation from other proj
ects in the area.
Environmental Impact Statement

5-8

Corpus Christi LNG

Compensatory and voluntary mitigation plans for many of the proj
ects would offset the severity
of permanent cumulative impacts on wetlands and SAV. Alternatively, there would also be
beneficial cumulative impacts from the creation of new wetlands, seagrass, and marsh habitats
through the compensatory and voluntary mitigation programs as well as beneficial use of
dredged material. Other beneficial cumulative impacts would be enhancement of the local
economy from increased tax revenues, j
obs and wages, and purchases of goods and materials.
5.2

ALTERNATIVES

As alternatives for the Terminal and the Pipeline, alternative Terminal sites, alternative
dredge disposal locations, alternative Pipeline aboveground facility sites, and maj
or and minor
route variation alternatives for the Pipeline. While the No-Action Alternative would avoid the
environmental impacts identified in this EIS, the obj
ectives of the Proj
ect would not be met.
However, any need for the import and export of natural gas could potentially be met by LNG
export and import proj
ects developed elsewhere, which would result in similar or greater impacts
at other locations. Potential end users could make other arrangements to obtain natural gas
service, or use alternative fossil fuel energy sources, other traditional long-term fuel source
alternatives, and/or renewable energy sources to compensate for the reduced availability of
natural gas that would otherwise be supplied by the Proj
ect. Similarly, natural gas capacity
holders on the Pipeline would have to find other outlets for getting natural gas to market, which
could include other pipelines or LNG terminals, each with their own environmental impacts.
We evaluated 12 Terminal system alternatives including 6 existing LNG import terminals
with planned, proposed, or authorized LNG export proj
ects and 6 planned, proposed, or
authorized LNG terminals dedicated solely to export of LNG. All of the systems would require
the need for substantial construction beyond that currently proposed, production volume
limitations, in-service dates scheduled significantly beyond Cheniere’s schedule, including any
customer commitments, and environmental impacts that were considered comparable to or
greater than those of the proposed Proj
ect. As a result, we eliminated them from further
consideration.
We evaluated 17 alternative Terminal sites at existing ports along the Gulf Coast. Three
of these sites were selected for further evaluation based on access to a channel greater than 40
feet deep, access to maj
or natural gas pipelines, industrial zoning, and availability of sufficient
open land for construction and operation of the Terminal. Each of these three evaluated sites
was previously proposed as a site for an LNG proj
ect, but the proj
ects were never built. We
conclude the use of two of those areas would no longer be feasible, as the properties are now
owned by Occidental Petroleum Corporation and are no longer available to Cheniere. The third
site was removed from consideration as a viable alternative, as it did not meet the Proj
ect’s
criteria for access to an existing pipeline system. In addition, the location of the Terminal site
was selected because it is compatible with the existing industrial land use, would minimize
impacts on agricultural land, and would not adversely impact protected resources. As a result,
we conclude that development of the Terminal on the alternative sites would not be
environmentally preferable or fully satisfy the Proj
ect’s purpose and need. We considered two
alternative dredge disposal locations, but found that neither of these locations were
environmentally preferable to the proposed site
We evaluated 12 existing pipeline systems as system alternatives to the proposed
Pipeline, including five pipelines that have planned connections to the Cheniere Pipeline. We
Environmental Impact Statement

5-9

Corpus Christi LNG

determined that those system alternatives would not have sufficient capacity to meet the natural
gas requirements of the Terminal without substantial expansion. Construction impacts of
expanding those pipeline systems would be similar to or greater than those of the proposed
Pipeline. Consequently, we conclude that none of the pipeline system alternatives would be
environmentally preferable to the proposed Pipeline.
We evaluated three maj
or pipeline route alternatives in addition to the proposed Pipeline
route to determine which would produce minimal environmental impacts while meeting the
Pipeline’s obj
ective. The proposed Pipeline route would provide the shortest distance from the
Terminal to existing high pressure natural gas pipeline systems in the South Texas region. In
addition, the proposed route minimizes environmental impacts by maximizing the use of existing
corridors in the area. We determined that the maj
or route alternatives would not offer a
significant environmental advantage over the proposed route. Consequently, we conclude that
none of the maj
or pipeline route alternatives would be environmentally preferable to the
proposed Pipeline route.
We evaluated one site alternative to the proposed Taft Compressor Station site. Although
both sites are located on agricultural land that lack environmentally-sensitive resources, the
proposed site is further away from NSAs than the alternative site. Consequently, we conclude
that the alternative site would not provide a significant environmental advantage to the proposed
Taft Compressor Station site.
We evaluated four site alternatives to the proposed Sinton Compressor Station site.
Three of these alternative sites would require crossing an existing railroad track along US
Highway 77, resulting in a safety concern for vehicle traffic. The remaining alternative site is
closer to the nearest NSA than the proposed site, which was also preferred by the landowner.
Therefore, we conclude that the alternative sites would not provide a significant environmental
advantage to the proposed Sinton Compressor Station site. No alternative sites were identified
that would be environmentally preferable to the other proposed aboveground facilities associated
with the Pipeline.

FERC STAFF’SRECOMMENDED MITIGATION

If the Commission authorizes the Proj
ect, we are recommending that the following
measures be included as specific conditions in the Commission’s Order. These measures would
further mitigate the environmental impacts associated with the construction and operation of the
proposed Proj
ect. The section number in parentheses at the end of a condition corresponds to the
section number in which the measure and related resource impact analysis appears in the EIS.
1.

Cheniere shall follow the construction procedures and mitigation measures described in
its applications and supplemental filings (including responses to staff data requests), and
as identified in the EIS, unless modified by the Order. Cheniere must:
a.

receive approval in writing from the Director of OEP before using that
modification.

For LNG facilities, the Director of the OEP has delegated authority to take all steps
necessary to ensure the protection of life, health, property, and the environment during
construction and operation of the Terminal. This authority shall include:
a.

stop-work authority and authority to cease operation;and

b.

the design and implementation of any additional measures deemed necessary to
ensure compliance with the intent of the Order.

The Director of OEP has delegated authority to take whatever steps are necessary to
ensure the protection of all environmental resources during construction and operation of
the Pipeline. This authority shall allow:
a.

the modification of conditions of the Order;and

b.

ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT
ASSESSMENT

APPENDIX B
ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT ASSESSMENT

1.0 INTRODUCTION
In 1976, the Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA) was passed in order to promote fish
conservation and management. The MSA granted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) legislative authority for
fisheries regulation in the United States within a jurisdictional area located between 3 miles to
200 miles offshore, depending on geographical location. NOAA Fisheries established eight
regional fishery management councils, each responsible for the proper management and harvest
of finfish and shellfish resources within their respective geographic regions. These fishery
management councils have developed Fisheries Management Plans (FMP), which outline
measures to ensure the proper management and harvest of the finfish and shellfish within these
waters.
Recognizing that many marine fisheries are dependent on nearshore and estuarine
environments for at least part of their life cycles, new habitat conservation provisions to the
MSA (Public Law [PL] 94-265, as amended in 1996 and PL 104-297, as amended in 1998) were
added, along with other goals, to promote more effective habitat management and protection of
marine fisheries. The protection of the marine environments important to marine fisheries,
referred to as essential fish habitat (EFH), is required in the review of projects conducted under
federal permits, licenses, or other authorities that affect or have the potential to affect such
habitat. EFH is defined as “those waters and substrate necessary to fish for spawning, breeding,
feeding, or growth to maturity” (16 United States Code [U.S.C.] 1802(10)).
Federal agencies that authorize, fund, or undertake activities that may adversely impact
EFH must consult with the NOAA Fisheries. Although absolute criteria have not been
established for conducting EFH consultations, NOAA Fisheries recommends consolidated EFH
consultations with interagency coordination procedures required by other statutes such as the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Endangered Species Act (ESA), in order to
reduce duplication and improve efficiency. Generally, the EFH consultation process includes the
following steps:
1) Notification – The action agency should clearly state the process being used for EFH
consultations (e.g., incorporating EFH consultation into the Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) or Rivers and Harbors Act Section 10 Permit).
2) EFH Assessment – The action agency should prepare an EFH Assessment that
includes both identification of affected EFH and an assessment of impacts.
Specifically, the EFH should include: 1) a description of the proposed action; 2) an
analysis of the effects (including cumulative effects) of the proposed action on EFH,
the managed fish species, and major prey species; 3) the federal agency’s views
regarding the effects of the action on EFH; and 4) proposed mitigation, if applicable.
3) EFH Conservation Recommendations – After reviewing the EFH Assessment,
NOAA Fisheries would provide recommendations to the action agency regarding
measures that can be taken by that agency to conserve EFH.

B-1

4) Agency Response – The action agency must respond to NOAA Fisheries within 30
days of receiving NOAA Fisheries’ recommendations to conserve EFH. The action
agency may notify NOAA Fisheries that a full response to conservation
recommendations will be provided by a specified completion date agreeable to all
parties. The response must include a description of measures proposed by the agency
for avoiding, mitigating, or offsetting the impact activity on EFH.
CONSULTATION PROCESS
Our1 consultations with NOAA Fisheries regarding the potential impacts on EFH
resulting from construction and operation of the proposed Corpus Christi LNG Project (Project)
have been conducted in coordination with our NEPA review.
EFH ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW
A description of the proposed action is provided in section 2.0 of the Project draft EIS.
Our analysis of the effects, including cumulative effects, of the proposed action and associated
mitigation on EFH, managed fish species, and major prey species, and our views regarding the
effects of the proposed action on EFH are provided in the following sections.
Based on our review of the proposed Project, including LNG marine traffic through the
La Quinta Channel, and in consultation with NOAA Fisheries, we have identified EFH for
various life stages of 14 species (Table 1): juvenile white (Litopenaeus setiferus) and brown
(Farfantepenaeus aztecus) shrimp; larval, post-larval, juvenile, and adult red drum (Sciaenops
ocellatus); adult gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus); post-larval and juvenile Goliath grouper
(Epinephelus itajara); post-larval and juvenile lane snapper (Lutjanus synagris); juvenile
yellowmouth grouper (Mycteroperca interstitialis); neonate, juvenile, and adult blacktip
(Carcharhinus limbatus), bull (Carcharhinus leucas), Atlantic sharpnose (Rhizoprionodon
terranovae), and bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo); neonate and juvenile scalloped
hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini) and lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris) within Corpus
Christi Bay (NOAA Fisheries, 2014; Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council [GMFMC],
2004).
In addition to being designated as EFH for a variety of federally managed species, the
Project area provides nursery, foraging, and refuge habitats that support various recreationally
and economically important marine fishery species such as spotted sea trout, southern flounder,
Atlantic croaker, black drum, Gulf menhaden, striped mullet, and blue crab. Such estuarinedependent species serve as prey for other fisheries managed by GMFMC and highly migratory
species managed by NOAA Fisheries (NOAA Fisheries, 2013).

2.0 ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT
All estuarine systems of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) are considered essential habitat for
fish species managed by the GMFMC. In 2005 the GMFMC amended seven FMPs in
accordance with Subpart J of 50 CFR Part 600. In 2004, the GMFMC completed a Final EIS for
the Generic Essential Fish Habitat Amendment addressing all required EFH components
included in the amendment to the MSA. The 2005 EFH Amendment delineated EFH as areas of
higher species density, based on the NOAA Atlas and functional relationships analysis for the
following FMPs: Red Drum, Reef Fish, Coastal Migratory Pelagics, Shrimp, Stone Crab, and
Spiny Lobster, and Coral.
The FMPs managed by the GMFMC, include: all estuaries; the U.S. – Mexico border to
the boundary between the areas covered by the GMFMC and the South Atlantic Fishery
Management Council from estuarine waters out to depths of 100 fathoms. Additionally, sharks
are managed through Amendment 1 to the Final Consolidated Highly Mobile Species FMP.
EFH is characterized as occurring within three zones: estuarine (inside barrier islands and
estuaries), nearshore (60 feet or less in depth), and offshore (greater than 60 feet in depth). The
GMFMC defines 12 standard habitat types, based on a combination of substrate and biogenic
structure descriptions, which are present with the Gulf. These 12 standard habitat types include:
submerged aquatic vegetation (e.g., seagrasses, benthic algae), mangroves, drifting algae,
emergent marshes (e.g., tidal wetlands, salt marshes, tidal creeks, rivers/streams), sand/shell
bottoms, soft bottoms (e.g., mud, clay bottoms, silt), hard bottoms (e.g., live hard bottoms, lowrelief irregular bottoms, high-relief irregular bottoms), oyster reefs, banks/shoals, reefs (e.g., reef
halos, patch reefs, deep reefs), shelf edge/slope, and pelagic (GMFMC, 2004).
All impacts associated with the Project are located within the estuarine zone. Habitat
types identified within the Project area include emergent marshes, submerged aquatic vegetation,
mangroves, soft bottoms (unvegetated shallow water), and sand/shell bottoms (unvegetated
shallow water). In addition to providing EFH, mangroves and vegetated wetlands also provide
other essential estuarine support functions, including: providing a physically recognizable
structure and substrate for refuge and attachment above and below the sediment surface, binding
sediments, preventing erosion, collecting organic and inorganic material by slowing currents, and
providing nutrients and detrital matter to the estuary.
A detailed description of these habitats as well as the life history characteristics and
habitat preferences of each federally managed species in the Project area is provided below and
is based primarily on the research referenced in Cheniere’s application to FERC, both Cheniere’s
and our consultation with NOAA Fisheries, and a review of the applicable FMPs, as amended.
3.0 FEDERALLY MANAGED SPECIES WITH EFH IN CORPUS CHRISTI BAY
Corpus Christi Bay is characterized as estuarine and provides habitat to a variety of
animal species across several taxa including, birds, reptiles, fish, macro invertebrates, and
mammals. Habitat types present within Corpus Christi Bay include, but are not limited to,
submerged aquatic vegetation, mangroves, emergent marshes, oyster reefs, sand/shell bottoms,
and soft bottoms (Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries Program, 2012).
The GMFMC final EIS for EFH for the Gulf FMPs (GFMFC, 2004) and the
Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species FMP (NOAA Fisheries, 2010) provide detailed
information on life history and relative abundance for species identified as having potential EFH

B-4

in the Project area. All species with EFH as identified by NOAA Fisheries are considered to be
at least classified as “common” in the Project area (NOAA Fisheries, 2014). The habitat types
utilized by each of the species for which EFH is present within the Project area are presented in
Table 2 and further discussed below.

a/ Information regarding specific estuarine habitats utilized by highly migratory species (sharks) is not
available; therefore, the habitat type is not further refined.

Shrimp Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico
Shrimp species within the Gulf use a variety of habitats as they grow from planktonic
larvae to spawning adults. Habitat throughout all life stages range from estuarine to open ocean.
Larvae are primarily found in the open ocean. As larvae progress into the post larval life stage,
they begin to move into the benthic estuarine habitats. Adult habitat use varies between species
and season but typically ranges from nearshore to offshore (GMFMC, 1981). Specific life
history and habitat use descriptions for species with EFH in the Project area are provided below.
White Shrimp (Litopenaeus setiferus)
White shrimp are found in estuaries and out to depths of approximately 40 meters (m)
offshore in the coastal waters extending from Florida to Texas and are most abundant in the
central and western Gulf. Non-spawning adult white shrimp inhabit offshore waters in the
winter and move inshore in the spring. Spawning generally occurs offshore in water depths of
less than 27 m from spring to late fall, peaking during June and July. Eggs are demersal and
share the same distribution as spawning adults. Larval white shrimp hatch within 12 hours of
spawning and begin to migrate through passes toward estuaries as they develop into post-larvae.
Estuarine migration peaks between June and September.
Juvenile white shrimp are most abundant in turbid estuaries along the western coast of the
Gulf and, within these estuarine nurseries, reach their greatest densities in marsh edge habitats
and in areas with submerged aquatic vegetation. However, juvenile white shrimp are also
common in marsh ponds, channels, inner marshes, shallow subtidal areas, and oyster reefs. In
non-vegetated areas, post-larvae and juveniles inhabit mostly muddy substrates with large
quantities of detritus. Sub-adult white shrimp move from the estuaries to coastal areas in late
August and September (GMFMC, 2004).

B-6

Brown Shrimp (Farfantepenaeus aztecus)
Adult brown shrimp inhabit neritic waters (over the continental shelf from low tide to a
depth of approximately 110 m) throughout the Gulf, but are more abundant off the coasts of
Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Non-spawning adults prefer turbid waters to soft sediments
(e.g., mud and sand). In the spring and fall, adult brown shrimp move to slightly deeper water
(46 to 91 m) to spawn. Brown shrimp eggs are demersal and usually hatch when temperatures
are greater than 24 degrees Celsius (C). Larval brown shrimp are most abundant offshore but do
occur in waters that range from 0 to 82 m deep. Post-larval brown shrimp migrate toward
estuaries in the spring, typically reaching their destination between February and April. Late
post-larval and juvenile brown shrimp are most abundant in shallow (less than 1 m) estuarine
habitats in the spring and early summer but typically are present through the fall.
Juvenile brown shrimp reach their greatest abundances in turbid estuaries but tolerate
waters with less suspended material. Within the estuarine environment, juvenile brown shrimp
prefer marsh edges and areas with submerged vegetation, but occur throughout the vegetated and
non-vegetated portions of the estuary and in the lower reaches of its tributaries. Sub-adults are
most abundant in slightly deeper waters from 1 to 18 m and prefer sand, mud, and shell
substrates to the vegetated bottoms preferred by juveniles. As they develop, sub-adult brown
shrimp continue to migrate toward deeper waters, eventually leaving the estuarine nurseries in
mid-summer.
Red Drum Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico
Red Drum (Sciaenops ocellatus)
Red drum occur in a variety of habitats over different substrates throughout the Gulf.
Habitats range in depth from about 40 m offshore to very shallow in estuarine wetlands with
substrates that include sand, mud, and oyster reefs. Adult red drum are roving predators that
opportunistically feed on a variety of invertebrate and vertebrate prey including crab, shrimp,
and other fishes. Spawning occurs from September through November over deeper waters
protected from currents such as the mouths of bays and inlets, and on the Gulf side of barrier
islands. Eggs typically hatch between late summer and early fall in the open waters of the Gulf
and are subsequently transported on tides and currents into estuarine nursery areas.
Larval red drum are most abundant in estuaries from mid-August through late November.
Within these estuarine nurseries, larvae, post-larvae, and juveniles prefer habitats protected from
currents with submerged and emergent vegetation and muddy substrates, but also tolerate nonvegetated hard and soft-bottomed areas. Larval and post-larval red drum feed primarily on
copepods whereas juveniles feed on a wide variety of small invertebrates. Juvenile red drum
become most abundant in early winter. Much like the adult red drum, late juveniles utilize a
wide variety of habitats. However, they still prefer protected waters and do not become
abundant in open waters until mid-September to early October. Estuarine wetlands are very
important to larval and juvenile red drum and while adult red drum use estuaries they tend to
spend more time offshore as they age (GMFMC, 2004).
Reef Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico
Estuarine dependent and nearshore reef fish and snapper-grouper species utilize areas
inshore of the 100-foot contour, such as attached macroalgae; submerged rooted vascular plants

B-7

(seagrasses); estuarine emergent vegetated wetlands (salt marshes, brackish marsh); tidal creeks;
estuarine scrub/shrub (mangrove fringe); oyster reefs and shell banks; unconsolidated bottom
(soft sediments); artificial and coral reefs; and live/hard bottom for all life stages. Snappers are
common in all warm marine waters. Most are inshore dwellers although some occur in openwater. Some species enter estuaries and mangroves, with the latter functioning as nursery
grounds. The serranids (grouper) are primarily carnivorous bottom dwellers, associated (as
adults) with hard-bottomed substrates and rocky reefs (GMFMC, 2004). Specific life history and
habitat use descriptions for species with EFH in the Project area are provided below.
Gray Snapper (Lutjanus griseus)
Gray snapper range from North Carolina to Brazil, including Bermuda, the Caribbean,
and northern Gulf (GMFMC, 1998). Juveniles can occasionally be found as far north as
Massachusetts (Manooch, 1988). Gray snapper are capable of inhabiting a wide variety of
habitats. Offshore benthic habitats include shipwrecks, ledges, hard bottom, coral reefs, and
rocky outcroppings to depths of 180 m, while inshore habitats consist of seagrasses, mangroves,
and rock piles (Bortone and Williams, 1986; Manooch, 1988; Florida Museum, 2013). Smaller,
younger fish are typically found utilizing more inshore habitats, such as seagrass beds and areas
of soft sediments, compared to larger, older adults (Manooch, 1988; Florida Museum, 2013).
Adults and juveniles are euryhaline and can tolerate a salinity range from 0 to 37 practical
salinity units and have even been recorded in freshwater lakes and rivers of southern Florida
(GMFMC, 1998; 2004; Florida Museum, 2013). They are also found utilizing waters with
temperatures between 13 and 32.5 degrees C (Bortone and Williams, 1986). Eggs and larvae are
pelagic until larvae settle at inshore nurseries consisting of seagrass beds, mangroves, jetties, or
pilings, approximately three weeks after hatching, typically from July through September
(Bortone and Williams, 1986; Domeier et al., 1996; GMFMC, 1998; 2004; Florida Museum,
2013).
This species does not exhibit extensive movements and remains in the same area for
extended periods of time, except during spawning season (GMFMC, 1998; Florida Museum
2013). Gray snapper do demonstrate daily movement associated with feeding and schooling.
Gray snapper migrate from inshore waters to offshore waters to spawn between April and
November, with spawning correlated with lunar cycles (Manooch, 1988; Domeier et al., 1996;
Florida Museum, 2013). Spawning locations have not been identified but are believed to be
associated with reefs and shipwrecks (Domeier et al., 1996). Individuals are capable of
spawning multiple times during a season (Florida Museum, 2013). This species is an
opportunistic predator. Crustaceans are a primary component of the adult gray snapper’s diet
(Starck and Schroeder, 1971). Adult gray snapper prey nocturnally on fish, shrimp, and crab
(Manooch, 1988; Florida Museum, 2013).
Lane Snapper (Lutjanus synagris)
Lane snapper are distributed from North Carolina to southern Brazil, including the Gulf
and the Caribbean Sea. Lane snapper are abundant in the Antilles, off Panama, and the northern
coast of South America (Florida Museum, 2013). These fish prefer clear nearshore water over
rocky bottoms near coral reefs and in sandy areas or seagrass with abundant shrimp. Juveniles
use inshore waters as nurseries. Lane snapper occur up to 400 m deep (Florida Museum, 2013).
Lane snapper spawn from March to September throughout their range, and both sexes are able to

B-8

spawn after the first year (GMFMC, 2004). Lane snapper are opportunistic predators feeding on
a variety of prey, such as small bottom fishes as well as shrimp, crabs, and cephalopods (Florida
Museum, 2013).
Goliath Grouper (Epinephelus itajara)
Goliath grouper are distributed from Florida to Brazil, including Bermuda, Caribbean
Sea, and Gulf (Florida Museum, 2013). They are most abundant off eastern Florida south to the
Florida Keys (GMFMC, 1998; 2004). This species is also found in the eastern Atlantic from
Senegal to Congo, Africa and in the eastern Pacific from the Gulf of California to Peru (Florida
Museum, 2013). Rocks, corals, caves, shipwrecks, ledges, and muddy substrates, in waters with
depths less than 46 m, are the preferred habitat of territorial adults, while juveniles are found in
estuarine areas associated with mangroves and oyster bars (Sadovy and Eklund, 1999; Florida
Museum, 2013). Eggs and larvae are pelagic with larvae becoming benthic approximately 25
days after hatching (Florida Museum, 2013). Spawning events occur around shipwrecks, rock
ledges, and reefs from July through September and are correlated with lunar events. Spawning
aggregations containing over 100 goliath groupers have been observed with all recorded
aggregations (except Bermuda) occurring between 15 degrees north and 26 degrees north
latitudes (Sadovy and Eklund, 1999; Florida Museum, 2013). These aggregations primarily
consist of the largest and oldest individuals of the population (Coleman et al., 2000). Goliath
grouper are considered sedentary and typically do not move among reefs, except to form
aggregations (Sadovy and Eklund, 1999). Goliath groupers are opportunistic feeders that prey
mainly on crustaceans (spiny lobsters, shrimp, and crabs) and fishes (stingrays and parrotfishes),
but also consume cephalopods and young sea turtles (Florida Museum, 2013).
Yellowmouth Grouper (Mycteroperca interstitialis)
Yellowmouth grouper are native to the western Atlantic from Florida to southern Brazil,
including the Gulf, Florida Keys, Bahamas, Cuba, and throughout the Caribbean Sea (IUCN,
2013). In the Gulf, yellowmouth grouper occur off of the Campeche Banks, the west coast of
Florida, Texas Flower Garden Banks, and the northwest coast of Cuba (GMFMC, 2004).
Yellowmouth grouper prefer rocky and coral bottoms from shoreline to at least 55 m deep.
Smaller yellowmouth grouper are common in mangrove areas (IUCN, 2013). Little information
is available on yellowmouth grouper life history, however, yellowmouth grouper are pelagic
spawners and sex-reversal is possible for this species (IUCN, 2013). Spawning occurs primarily
in spring and summer, with peaks in April and May off the west coast of Florida (GMFMC,
2004). Juveniles commonly occur in mangrove-lined lagoons and move into deeper water as
they grow (GMFMC, 2004). Yellowmouth grouper feed primarily on other fishes (IUCN, 2013).
Atlantic Highly Migratory Species
Highly migratory species (sharks) may utilize a variety of coastal and ocean habitats.
Shark habitat can be described in four broad categories: coastal, pelagic, coastal-pelagic, and
deep-dwelling. Coastal species inhabit estuaries, nearshore areas, continental slope, and
continental shelf. Bull, scalloped hammerhead, bonnethead, blacktip, finetooth, lemon, and
Atlantic sharpnose sharks are all considered coastal sharks (NOAA Fisheries, 2009; 1999).
Adult sharks are broadly distributed as adults, but often utilize estuaries as pupping and nursery
areas during pupping season and through their neonate and young-of-the-year life stages.

B-9

Specific life history and habitat use descriptions for species with EFH in the Project area are
provided below.
Bull Shark (Carcharhinus leucas)
The bull shark is managed under the Large Coastal Shark MU through the Final Atlantic
Consolidated FMP for Highly Migratory Species (NOAA Fisheries, 2006). Bull sharks are a
circumglobal species and in the Atlantic are distributed from Massachusetts to Florida, including
the Gulf. The bull shark is considered most common off southern Florida and within the Gulf
(Castro, 1983; Compagno, 1984b). This shallow-water species is common in both tropical and
subtropical regions and in marine, estuarine, and freshwater habitats and can journey long
distances up large rivers (NOAA Fisheries, 1999). The bull shark typically occupies shallow
coastal waters less than 30 m deep, but has been observed at depths of 152m. Adults occupy
deeper waters than juveniles. Bull sharks typically stay near the bottom, rarely utilizing surface
waters (Compagno, 1984b). Bull shark nurseries have been recorded in low salinity estuaries
extending from North Carolina to the Gulf (McCandless et al., 2002). Bull sharks migrate north
as far as Massachusetts, along the coast during the summer and then return south as waters cool
(Compagno, 1984b). Mating occurs in late spring or early summer (June or July), with birth to
live young occurring in estuaries and river mouths the following year, from April to June
(Compagno, 1984b; Castro, 1983). Bull sharks are opportunistic feeders that prey on a wide
variety of bony fishes, shark species, and invertebrates. Additionally, stomach contents have
revealed that this species also consumes sea turtles, sea birds, and marine mammals (Compagno,
1984b).
NOAA Fisheries (2009) has designated EFH for neonates, juveniles, and adult bull sharks
within the Project area. Neonate bull shark EFH is designated as shallow coastal waters,
including inlets and estuaries in the Gulf between Texas and the west coast of Florida, with
localized areas off of Mississippi and the Florida Panhandle. The mid-east coast of Florida to
South Carolina is also EFH for bull sharks (NOAA Fisheries, 2009). Juvenile bull shark EFH is
designated as shallow coastal waters, inlets, and estuaries in waters less than 25 m off western
Florida in the Gulf from Texas through the Florida Keys (NOAA Fisheries, 2009). Adult bull
shark EFH is in western Florida through the Florida Keys as well as the Texas coast and eastern
Louisiana.
Scalloped Hammerhead Shark (Sphyrna lewini)
The scalloped hammerhead shark is managed under the Large Coastal Shark MU through
the Final Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species FMP (NOAA Fisheries, 2006).
Scalloped hammerhead sharks are found in warm-temperate to tropical waters worldwide over
the continental shelf and slope. In the Atlantic, the scalloped hammerhead shark ranges from
New Jersey to Brazil, including the Gulf and the Caribbean Sea (Florida Museum, 2013). This
species inhabits waters from the surface to depths of 275 m and is found close to shore, in bays
and estuaries, preferring water temperatures of at least 22 degrees C (Castro, 1983; Compagno,
1984a). Typically, scalloped hammerhead sharks spend the day close to shore and move to
deeper waters at night to feed (Florida Museum, 2013). Scalloped hammerhead sharks birth
once a year in the summer starting around June in shallow coastal nurseries found from Virginia
to the Gulf (Castro, 1993; McCandless et al., 2002). This species forms large schools when it
migrates seasonally north to south along the eastern U.S. coast (NOAA Fisheries, 1999).

B-10

Scalloped hammerhead sharks consume a wide variety of fishes, as well as invertebrates, and
have been reported feeding only at night (Compagno, 1984a).
NOAA Fisheries (2009) has designated EFH for neonate and juvenile scalloped
hammerhead sharks within the Project area. Neonate and juvenile scalloped hammerhead shark
EFH is designated as shallow coastal areas such as bays and estuaries out to a 25 m isobath in the
Gulf from Texas to the southern west coast of Florida (NOAA Fisheries, 2009).
Bonnethead Shark (Sphyrna tiburo)
The bonnethead shark is managed under the Small Coastal Shark Management Unit
through the Final Atlantic Consolidated Highly Migratory Species FMP (NOAA Fisheries,
2006). The bonnethead shark is limited to warm waters in the Atlantic Ocean ranging from
coastal southern New England south to the Gulf and Brazil, and is most common in the
Caribbean Sea, including Cuba and the Bahamas. In the Pacific Ocean, the bonnethead shark
ranges from southern California to Ecuador (Castro, 1983). Bonnethead sharks inhabit shallow
coastal waters where they are typically associated with sandy or muddy substrates (Castro et al.,
1999). This species inhabits continental and insular shelves, over reefs, estuaries, seagrass beds,
and shallow bays from depths of 10 m to 80 m (Campagno, 1984b). Bonnethead shark nurseries
have been identified in estuaries from South Carolina south along the Atlantic coast into the Gulf
(McCandless et al., 2002). Bonnethead sharks prefer water temperatures warmer than 21 degrees
C and migrate accordingly back and forth to the equator throughout the year. This species
migrates to inshore areas of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia during the summer and
off Florida and the Gulf during spring and fall. During the winter, it moves southward to deeper
waters. This species mates late summer through early fall in shallow waters (Castro, 1983;
Branstetter, 2002; Lombardi-Carlson et al., 2003). Bonnethead sharks prey primarily upon
benthic species, including shrimp, crab, cephalopods, and fish during the daytime (Castro, 1983;
Branstetter, 2002).
NOAA Fisheries (2009) has designated EFH for neonate, juvenile, and adult bonnethead
sharks within the Project area. Neonate, juvenile, and adult bonnethead shark EFH is designated
as shallow coastal waters, inlets, and estuaries in the Gulf along Texas and from eastern
Mississippi through the Florida Keys (NOAA Fisheries, 2009).
Blacktip Shark (Carcharhinus limbatus)
The blacktip shark is managed under the Large Coastal Shark Management Unit through
the Final Atlantic Consolidated Highly Migratory Species FMP (NOAA Fisheries, 2006). This
shark is found worldwide in predominantly tropical seas but occurs seasonally in warmtemperate coastal waters. In the Atlantic, it ranges from southern New England to southern
Brazil, encompassing the Gulf and Caribbean Sea (Garrick, 1982). The blacktip shark is most
abundant off South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida in the summer (Castro, 1983). The blacktip
shark ranges from inshore estuarine waters, including bays and mangrove swamps, to offshore
habitats, but is rarely found at depths greater than 30 m. This species often stays near the
surface. Although often recorded offshore, it is not considered a true oceanic shark species. It
has a wide salinity tolerance but generally does not move far into riverine systems (Compagno,
1984a). Neonate and juvenile blacktip sharks utilize nursery areas and can remain there for up to
a year. Blacktip shark nurseries have been identified in nearshore and estuarine waters from
North Carolina through the Gulf (Castro, 1993; NOAA Fisheries, 1999; McCandless et al.,

B-11

2002). Recent analysis has determined that blacktip sharks in the Gulf and Atlantic nurseries are
genetically distinct and separate from one another. Large schools of blacktip sharks off the coast
of Florida seasonally migrate north to south along the coast up to 1,159 nautical miles. This
species migrates to deeper waters during the winter and utilizes coastal waters of the
southeastern U.S. during the summer. Blacktip sharks give birth to live young in inshore nursery
grounds during late spring to early summer after a 10 to 11 month gestation period. Blacktip
sharks are active mid-water hunters, feeding on benthic and pelagic fishes, cephalopods, and
other invertebrates.
Finetooth Shark (Carcharhinus isodon)
The finetooth shark is managed under the Small Coastal Shark Management Unit through
the Final Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species FMP (NOAA Fisheries, 2006). In the
Atlantic, the finetooth shark is distributed from North Carolina to Cuba and southern Brazil,
including the Gulf (Compagno, 1984a). Not a lot is known about habitat associations of this
species. Finetooth sharks form large schools and are located in waters close to shore to depths of
10 m (Compagno, 1984a). Finetooth shark estuarine nursery areas have been documented from
South Carolina to the Gulf (Castro, 1993; McCandless et al., 2002). Finetooth sharks give birth
to live young from May to June. This species feeds on bony fishes, crustaceans, and
cephalopods (Campagno, 1984a; Florida Museum, 2013).
NOAA Fisheries (2009) has designated EFH for neonates within the Project area.
Neonate finetooth shark EFH is designated as shallow coastal areas such as bays and estuaries
out to a 25 m isobath in the Gulf off of Texas, eastern Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and the
Florida Panhandle (NOAA Fisheries, 2009).
Lemon Shark (Negaprion brevirostris)
The lemon shark is managed under the Large Coastal Shark Management Unit (MU)
through the Final Atlantic Consolidated Highly Migratory Species FMP (NOAA Fisheries,
2010). The species is found in the temperate/tropical regions of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans,
as well as the Caribbean Sea. In the Atlantic, its distribution ranges from New Jersey to southern
Brazil, including the Gulf (Compagno, 1984b; Florida Museum, 2013). Utilization of diverse
habitat is characteristic of the species and includes oceanic waters, coral reefs, mangroves, bays,
sounds, estuaries, and river mouths. The lemon shark is found from surface waters to depths of
90 m (Florida Museum, 2013). Young sharks are typically found utilizing habitats closer to
shore than adults (Campagno, 1984b). Lemon shark nurseries have been recorded in the Florida
Keys, Tampa Bay, Florida, and along the Gulf coast of Texas (McCandless et al., 2002). Lemon
sharks typically inhabit deeper waters during the daytime and move to shallower waters at night
(Florida Museum, 2013). Off Florida, this species also migrates south into deeper water during
the winter (Compagno, 1984b). Lemon sharks mate and give birth to live young during the
spring and summer, from May to September (Compagno, 1984b). Lemon sharks consume a
variety of crustaceans, mollusks, and fishes located over sandy or muddy substrates (Compagno,
1984b; Florida Museum, 2013).
NOAA Fisheries (2009) has designated EFH for adult and neonate lemon sharks within
the Project area. Neonate lemon shark EFH is designated as shallow coastal areas such as bays
and estuaries out to a 25 m isobath in the Gulf between Texas mid-coast and the Florida Keys.

B-12

Juvenile lemon shark EFH is designated as shallow coastal areas such as bays and estuaries out
to a 25 m isobath in areas along Texas and eastern Louisiana (NOAA Fisheries, 2009).
Atlantic Sharpnose Shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae)
The Atlantic sharpnose shark is managed under the Small Coastal Shark Management
Unit through the Final Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species FMP (NOAA Fisheries,
2009). This shark is a subtropical-tropical species found throughout the Atlantic Ocean. The
Atlantic sharpnose shark inhabits the waters of the coast of North America from New Brunswick
to Florida, extending to the Yucatan area in the Gulf (Castro, 1983; Florida Museum, 2013).
This species is a common year-round coastal inhabitant from South Carolina to the Gulf and is a
seasonally abundant migrant off Virginia (NOAA Fisheries, 1999). The Atlantic sharpnose
shark is most abundant in warm-temperate to subtropical waters of the continental shelf, from
inshore areas such as estuaries to the surf zone and out over the shelf in water as deep as 280 m,
but it mostly remains in waters less than 10 m deep (Florida Museum, 2013). This demersal
shark has a broad salinity tolerance and has been found up rivers, such as the Pascagoula River in
Mississippi (Florida Museum, 2013). This species and its nursery areas can also be found in
estuarine habitats (Castro, 1993). The Atlantic sharpnose shark performs inshore-offshore
movements seasonally, moving into deeper offshore waters during winter as water temperatures
fall (Compagno, 1984a; Florida Museum, 2013). Atlantic sharpnose sharks typically mate in late
spring and early summer with females migrating offshore during their pregnancy (Florida
Museum, 2013). This species moves back inshore to give birth to live young in shallow,
protected areas during the late spring to early summer of the following year, from North Carolina
to central Florida (Castro, 1983; 1993). This species feeds on fishes, worms, shrimp, crabs, and
mollusks (Florida Museum, 2013; Branstetter, 2002).
NOAA Fisheries (2009) has designated EFH for neonate, juvenile, and adult Atlantic
sharpnose sharks within the Project area. Neonate, juvenile, and adult Atlantic sharpnose shark
EFH is designated as shallow coastal areas such as bays and estuaries out to a 25 m isobath
within the Gulf between Texas and the Florida Keys (NOAA Fisheries, 2009).
4.0 POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON EFH
Potential effects on EFH associated with the construction and operation of the Project
would primarily consist of increased turbidity; decreased water quality; and increased sediment
disturbance, suspension, and deposition in the area.
Approximately 124.0 acres of open water habitat would be impacted by operation of the
Terminal. Of the 124.0 acres, approximately 95.4 acres is currently aquatic/intertidal habitat
(shallow water) that would be permanently converted to deep water habitat (23.8 acres of the site
is currently classified as deep water and 5.0 acres of open land will be converted to deep water).
Impact on EFH species would depend on the species’ use of deep water habitats. Many of the
species that occupy shallow water habitats may also inhabit the deep water habitats that currently
exist in the adjacent La Quinta Channel and Turning Basin sometime during their life cycle.
Many species reside or migrate through both inshore and offshore areas at different life stages
and during different seasons throughout the year.
Of the 95.4 acres of shallow water habitat that would be dredged, approximately 9.2 acres
are currently submerged aquatic seagrass beds, 5.9 acres are cordgrass salt marsh, 1.0 acre is
emergent marsh and vegetated sand flats, 2.9 acres are unvegetated sand flats, and 6.7 acres are

B-13

black mangrove. The remaining 67.9 acres are unvegetated shallow water. Portions of these
habitats would be permanently converted to open water habitat. These habitats are valuable
habitat types relative to fish and EFH as they provide a food rich environment for productive
foraging and refuge from predators for juveniles and prey species. Alteration of these habitats
can cause a reduction or loss of juvenile or prey species rearing habitats and an alteration in the
timing of life history stages. The primary activities associated with the Project that would result
in alteration and degradation of EFH include dredging, pile driving, increased ship traffic, and
ballast water intake and discharge.
Dredging
As described in section 4.3 of the EIS, Cheniere proposes to use a hydraulic cutterhead
dredging system to remove approximately 4.4 million cubic yards of mostly stiff clays with
interbedded sand and silt layers to create the berthing area and maneuvering basin at the
Terminal. Dredging with a hydraulic cutterhead dredge generally creates less turbidity than
other types of dredges (i.e., mechanical bucket or hopper dredges). With a cutterhead dredge, the
cutter speed can be adjusted to match the sediment properties, thus minimizing turbidity
(Herbich and Brahme, 1984). During operation of the Project, maintenance dredging may be
required every three years. Cheniere estimates that 200,000 cubic yards of material would be
dredged for each occurrence. During the dredging operation, water quality would be affected by
the temporary increase in turbidity surrounding the hydraulic cutterhead of the dredge as well as
around the mixing zone. Disturbance of bottom sediments during dredging can significantly
increase turbidity and down-current deposition of sediments. Very high levels of turbidity can
result in the physical impairment of estuarine species (e.g., turbidity induced clogged gills
resulting in suffocation, or abrasion of sensitive epithelial tissue).
However, the turbidity and the deposition of sediments would be reduced by the tidal
flushing action of Corpus Christi Bay. Tidal flushing in Corpus Christi Bay has been described
as a restricted flow, tidal regime switching from semi-diurnal to diurnal (Ward, 1997). The tides
are wind dominated which results in relatively higher tides in summer and spring with lower
tides in winter and fall because of the prevailing wind. Because of the change in the width to
depth ratio of the La Quinta Channel, overall currents would be expected to be relatively low,
particularly at or near the bottom where dredging would occur.
Based on the general hydraulic characteristics of the site and the proposed depth of
dredging, most of the sediment that would become suspended during the dredging process is
expected to be short term and the water quality would return to background levels a short
distance from the point of disturbance. Therefore, impacts to EFH due to water quality impacts
from dredging are not expected to be significant.
Entrainment of aquatic organisms by dredging machinery can impact EFH species
directly or indirectly through the removal of prey species (e.g., benthic invertebrates) or food
species (e.g., macroalgae), disrupting energy flow and biotic interactions. Entrainment of
benthic organisms during the dredging of the berthing and maneuvering areas is expected,
however, entrainment would not be extensive enough to have a significant impact on the fishery
resources of Corpus Christi Bay. In addition, benthic organisms typically have rapid
recolonization rates that would limit impacts on the biota of these areas.

B-14

Dredging and the direct removal of suitable benthic substrates can impact EFH by
removing suitable cover or settlement structure. Dredging typically homogenizes bottom
substrates, reducing the structural complexity of habitats. Field surveys of the Project area
revealed that the open bay habitats that would be dredged already consist of a homogenous bed
of fine substrates. Dredging of these areas would, therefore, not significantly alter the existing
bottom type, with the exception of vegetated areas, as discussed below.
Dredging can also result in the chemical impairment of the water column due to the
suspension of contaminated sediments. The Final EIS for the Corpus Christi Ship Channel
Improvement Project reported the results of sediments that were sampled and analyzed for
organic and metallic chemicals (COE, 2003). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) EIS
included samples from the La Quinta Channel extension that would overlap the area of the
proposed dredging. In addition, Cheniere collected three sediment cores from the proposed
dredging area and had them analyzed for metals. In the COE final EIS, the results were
compared to the Effects Range Low (ERL), which are used by NOAA as screening levels for
assessing sediment quality. These are conservative concentration levels and are considered the
lowest concentrations where effects on the marine ecology have been observed. These levels are
used to identify sediment that may require additional evaluations before decisions on disposal or
beneficial re-use are made.
In 1985 samples from the La Quinta Channel, arsenic ranged from 12 to 15 milligrams
per kilogram (mg/kg) in all six samples, which is above the ERL of 8.2 mg/kg. Six samples
were taken from the same stations in 1990 and again in 2000, and all metals were below the ERL
levels. Three samples were taken in 2000 from the La Quinta extension and analyzed for metals
and all metals were below the ERLs. The samples taken in 1985 were analyzed for
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides and all detections were below ERL levels. The
samples taken in 1990 and 2000 were analyzed for PCBs, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, and all detections were below ERL levels. The COE concluded that, overall, there
is no indication of current water quality problems in the La Quinta Channel (COE, 2003).
The results of the analysis of Cheniere’s core samples were compared to the Protective
Concentration Levels (PCL) for Tier 1 commercial/industrial soil protective of Class 3
groundwater. All concentrations were below the PCL.
While the existing functions of the permanently impacted seagrass, coastal marsh,
cordgrass salt marsh, vegetated and unvegetated sand flats, black mangrove, and unvegetated
shallow water habitats would be lost, this area would function as open water habitat. Impacts on
EFH resulting from increased turbidity, decreased water quality, and increased sedimentation as
a result of dredging would be short term and limited to the immediate area surrounding the
activity.
Pile Driving
In addition to impacts from dredging during construction of the Project, sound pressure
waves produced during pile driving activities to construct the marine terminal may result in
impacts on nearby fish species with EFH designations, and their prey. Intense sound pressure
waves can affect fish behavior and/or result in the rupturing of swim bladders and internal
hemorrhaging. The intensity of the sound pressure levels produced during pile driving depends
on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the type and size of the pile, the firmness of

B-15

the substrate into which the pile is being driven, the depth of water, and the type and size of the
pile-driving hammer. The degree to which an individual fish exposed to sound waves would be
affected is dependent upon variables such as the peak sound pressure level and frequency as well
as the species, size, and condition of a fish (e.g., small fish are more prone to injury by intense
sound waves than are larger fish of the same species). Depending on the specific conditions at
the site, pile driving activities could generate underwater sound levels great enough to injure
some fish or cause them to be more susceptible to predation. However, in order to reduce
impacts on fish and other aquatic species from pile driving, Cheniere would perform a soft start
in which they would ramp-up pile driving activities to allow mobile species in the area to
relocate to adjacent habitats prior to the primary pile driving activities.
Marine Traffic
Ship and boat traffic associated with construction and operation of the Project would also
generate underwater sounds. Although vessel sounds would not generally be of the intensity
produced from driving steel piles, Project vessels (e.g., LNG carrier ships [LNGCs’], tugs,
construction barges) operating in the La Quinta Channel could result in sounds that illicit
responses in fish. Most research suggests that fish exhibit avoidance behavior in response to
engine noises (International Council for Exploration of the Sea, 1995). At the same time,
research conclusions tend to suggest that since the effects are transient (i.e., once the ship passes,
behavior returns to normal), then the long-term effects on populations are negligible (Stocker,
2001).
Ballast Water
It is expected that any LNGC at the Terminal would be in full compliance with the
domestic requirements for ballast water management as specified in the National Invasive
Species Act of 1996 and international standards that were adopted on February 13, 2004.
Additionally, the Terminal would comply with Port of Corpus Christi Authority (POCCA)
general and specific discharge prohibitions (regulations) currently in place. While taking on
LNG cargo at the Terminal, LNGCs will discharge seawater ballast to maintain stability. In
accordance with International Maritime Organization regulations, LNGCs are required to
undergo mid-ocean ballast water exchange during transit so that the source of the ballast water
discharged at the Terminal would not be from a foreign port but would be from open ocean.
Ballast water is exchanged through seachests and it is estimated to take between 25 and 72 hours
to complete ballast water discharge while at dock depending on the rate of LNG cargo loading.
Ballast discharge is necessary to maintain a constant draft at the berth. Adverse effects on
marine life would be minimized by a number of factors. First, temporary spikes in salinity are
not anticipated to adversely affect fish and other marine organisms. Second, ballast water would
be discharged near the bottom of the waterway, where salinity levels are naturally higher and the
ballast water can enter the saltwater wedge and move toward the open Gulf. Third, as the
LNGCs move in and out of the marine berth, the amount of water displaced by the LNGC (on
average 110,000 tons per vessel) would be circulated into, around, and out of the berth and
would facilitate rapid mixing of any ballast water and flushing of the marine berth on a per ship
basis. The net effect is enhanced and rapid dilution of any ballast water upon departure of the
LNGC. Finally, the amount of freshwater flowing into the Corpus Christi Bay from the Nueces
River, as well as other freshwater sources along the La Quinta Channel, exceeds anticipated
ballast discharge. Thus, the ballast water would be quickly diluted to ambient salinity.

B-16

Therefore, any effects on salinity are expected to be temporary and localized, and are not
expected to have any negative effects on the marine life in and around the Terminal.
If it is necessary for ballast water to be taken on at the Terminal, during cargo delivery,
each LNGC would discharge its entire cargo to LNG storage tanks on shore. As with LNG
export, LNGCs discharging LNG cargo would take on seawater ballast to maintain a constant
draft at the berth. Aquatic species in the immediate vicinity of the ship berths could therefore be
impacted by entrainment during ballast water intake.
Cumulative Impacts
Cumulative impacts result when impacts associated with a proposed project is
superimposed on or added to impact associated with past, present, or reasonably foreseeable
future projects within the area affected by the Project. Although individual impacts of the
separate projects might be minor, the additive effects from all the projects could be significant.
Additional discussion of cumulative impacts is provided in section 4.13 of the Project EIS.
Existing environmental conditions in the Project area reflect extensive changes based on
past projects and activities. For example, substantial impacts have occurred and continue to
occur because of water quality degradation from point and non-point source pollution within
Corpus Christi Bay. Point source discharges from industry, combined with septic tank leachates,
stormwater runoff, and oil and chemical spills contribute to lower water quality and degraded
fishery habitats.
Cumulative effects on marine resources in the area could occur from several planned and
currently in progress projects including the proposed COE La Quinta Ship Channel Extension,
POCCA La Quinta Trade Gateway Terminal, Offshore Wind Power Systems of Texas, LLC
Foundation Test Site, and Voestalpine DRI Plant. All of these projects would involve dredging
activities, which if conducted concurrently with the Project, could result in cumulative impacts
on EFH in the area. The primary short-term impact of dredging is an increase in turbidity.
Turbidity impacts are primarily restricted to the area surrounding the dredging activity and are
temporary. The La Quinta Ship Channel Extension is located directly across from the Terminal
site, and the POCCA La Quinta Trade Gateway Terminal and Voestalpine DRI Plant are located
immediately adjacent to the Terminal site. If dredging for the Terminal is conducted
concurrently with these other projects, short-term impacts to EFH from increased turbidity would
be significant. However, based on the projected schedules of these projects, dredging would
likely not occur concurrently, minimizing the potential for cumulative effects from dredgeassociated turbidity.
Construction of each of these projects, including dredging, would result in long-term
impacts to EFH in the form of habitat loss or conversion. However, the COE requires mitigation
for all permanent impacts to waters of the United States; therefore, similar to the proposed
Project, these other projects would be required to compensate for loss of these habitats through
mitigation as well. For example, the La Quinta Ship Channel Extension is beneficially utilizing
dredge material by creating shallow water habitat partially planted with submerged aquatic
vegetation to compensate for similar habitat lost as a result of dredging.
Although required mitigation would lessen the impacts from these projects to EFH and
aquatic resources as a whole, gradual and cumulative impacts that could result from the
construction and operation of the Project and other projects in the area and within the near future

B-17

would result in some unavoidable adverse effects on the existing environment. For example,
future projects such as the La Quinta Trade Gateway Terminal and the Voestalpine DRI Plant
could potentially contribute to impacts on EFH both from dredging and the potential for
increased ship traffic. However, specific impacts on EFH as a whole would be addressed for
each individual project, and impacts on vegetated components of EFH would be addressed
through compensatory mitigation during Section 404 permitting.
5.0 EFH MITIGATION
Cheniere has attempted to avoid or minimize impacts on coastal resources, including
EFH, by identifying a site for the Terminal that is previously disturbed, adjacent to an existing
deep water shipping channel, and near industrial activity. Because the proposed site is
immediately adjacent to the existing La Quinta Turning Basin and Channel, the need for
dredging would be limited to that required for the Terminal maneuvering basin and berths.
The permanent conversion of wetlands (EFH) as a result of the proposed dredging will
require compensatory mitigation to comply with the COE Section 404(b)1 guidelines. Cheniere
submitted an Aquatic Resources Mitigation Plan (ARMP) for the Project to the COE. This plan
was submitted to the COE as part of the CWA Section 404 permitting process and approved in
2005 (DA Permit 23561). Since 2005, Cheniere has continued to work with the COE to finalize
the ARMP to account for additional wetland impacts associated with the proposed Project.
Cheniere’s proposed conceptual wetland mitigation plan at Shamrock Island was
approved by the COE in 2005 to mitigate for impacts to waters of the U.S. associated with the
previous proposal to construct an LNG import terminal and associated pipeline (Docket Nos.
CP04-37-000, CP04-44-000, CP04-45-000, and CP04-46-000). Mitigation measures for the
previously permitted 12.88 acres of wetland impacts were completed in 2013 and included the
installation of 16 breakwaters bordering the north-western end of Shamrock Island. Construction
of these breakwaters would assist in the preservation of existing habitats including cordgrass,
mangroves, unvegetated sand flats, vegetated sand flats, hard substrates, and uplands.
In response to the COE public notice for Cheniere’s permit application (Permit No.
SWG-2007-01637), several agencies, including NOAA Fisheries, expressed concern regarding
the length of time (50 years) it would take for complete compensatory mitigation to be complete.
The COE addressed these concerns and determined that 50 years to achieve an 8.9:1 preservation
ratio, as proposed in Cheniere’s ARMP, is not an appropriate period to evaluate preservation
values. The COE recommends evaluating the preservation values during a 10-year period,
during which time, conditions affecting the site would be relatively consistent and less likely to
be influenced by sudden episodic events, such as hurricanes. Use of a shorter time period would
lower Cheniere’s estimated preservation ratio and potentially change the habitat types preserved
by the proposed ARMP.
The COE determined that in order to quantitatively evaluate Project impacts on wetland
habitats, it is in the public’s best interest to perform a functional assessment of the Project. A
functional assessment would quantify, in a scientifically sound, reproducible and reasonably
rapid manner, the wetland functions lost and those that would be mitigated for by the Project.
This would allow the COE to verify if the Project is consistent with the COE-EPA Memorandum
of Understanding of Mitigation under the CWA Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines and 33 CFR
332.3(f)(1), and determine if the anticipated impacts would be adequately compensated by the

B-18

proposed mitigation. We expect the COE recommendations to be included in any permit that it
may issue. Pending the results of the functional assessment, increased compensation in the
mitigation area could be required.
6.0 FERC’S VIEW REGARDING EFH
Construction and operation of the Project would have temporary and long-term impacts
on EFH. In general, temporary impacts are not expected to be significant considering the
proposed dredging method and the localized impact of the actions. Dredging of the berthing and
maneuvering basin would temporarily affect EFH by disturbing bottom sediments and increasing
turbidity, which can have adverse physiological effects on finfish and shellfish species.
Hydraulic dredging would also directly affect some benthic species that would be entrained
during dredging. However, considering the nature of the sediments that would be dredged, the
use of hydraulic cutterhead dredging, and the temporary nature of the dredging, these impacts
would not be significant.
Impacts on EFH from the deposition of sediments re-suspended by dredging activities are
expected to be minimal. Considering the hydrologic characteristics of the site and the depth of
excavation, most of the sediment that does become suspended during the dredging process is
expected to settle within or near the dredging footprint as opposed to migrating to adjacent areas.
Field studies of cutterhead dredges indicate that elevated turbidity is limited to the lower portion
of the water column and turbidity levels are at background within several hundred feet of the
cutterhead dredging operation (Herbich and Brahme, 1984). Because of the design of the
channel, suspended sediments would be expected to stay within the confines of the dredged
channel.
With the exception of areas of coastal wetland, dredging of open bay habitat is not
expected to result in a significant alteration of habitat structure, as the area of the bay near the
Terminal generally lacks habitat structure/cover. Also, considering recolonization rates of
potentially affected benthic species and the relatively limited area affected by dredging, these
losses would not be extensive enough to have a significant impact on the fishery resources of
Corpus Christi Bay.
The primary impact on EFH would be the permanent loss of approximately 95.90 acres
of shallow open water habitat, of which 25.67 acres consist of seagrass, coastal marsh, cordgrass
salt marsh, vegetated and unvegetated tidal flats, and black mangrove. This habitat is valuable to
EFH managed species as they provide a food-rich environment for foraging and refuge for
juveniles and prey species. To compensate for this permanent loss of habitat, Cheniere would
implement wetland mitigation designed to avoid a net loss of wetlands as necessary to comply
with the COE’s Section 404(b)1 guidelines.
Based on Cheniere’s proposed impact mitigation measures as well as preparation of the
functional assessment and ARMP to be approved by the COE, we have determined that
constructing and operating the Terminal would not have a significant impact on EFH.

CHENIERE’S FUGITIVE DUST
CONTROL PLAN

Corpus Christi Liquefaction Project
San Patricio and Nueces Counties, Texas
FERC Docket Nos. PF12-3-000

Fugitive Dust Control Plan
1 Objective
The objective of this fugitive dust control plan is to identify potential dust emission sources and
provide guidance to construction and field personnel on measures to avoid the generation of
fugitive dust and control any generated fugitive dust during construction activities associated
with the Corpus Christi Liquefaction Project. It will be the responsibility of Project Contractors
and the Environmental Inspectors to identify all activities generating fugitive dust, implement
feasible dust control measures, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

2 Fugitive Dust Sources
Dust is generated by the mechanical disturbance of granular material exposed to the air. Dust
from open sources is termed “fugitive” because it is not discharged to the atmosphere in a
confined flow stream. The following activities are identified as having potential for generating
fugitive dust.







Vehicle and motorized equipment movement on paved and unpaved surfaces;
Vegetation Removal;
Clearing and Grading;
Soil Stabilization;
Bulk/Piles material loading, unloading, hauling, etc.; and
Abrasive Blasting.

3 Dust Control Measures
3.1 Water Truck
Project Contractors will make all practicable efforts to minimize fugitive dust emissions from
construction activities. The Project will have a water tank and will purchase water from the local
municipality from which the Project’s 80 barrel water truck on site that will load water to spray
areas for dust control.
Areas to be sprayed include most areas within the Project Boundary; for example, but not limited
to:
 Designated access roads;
 Construction Dock and staging areas;
 All designated Staging and Laydown areas; and
 All designated parking areas.

D-1

Corpus Christi Liquefaction Project
San Patricio and Nueces Counties, Texas
FERC Docket No. PF12-3-000
The frequency at which the water truck will spray the Project areas will vary based on weather
and site conditions. For example, in dry conditions, construction traffic may increase the amount
of dust generated on access roads, thus the water truck would be instructed to spray continuously
throughout the workday.
In contrast, if there is light traffic, minimal dust generating activities, and/or wet weather, the
water truck may not be necessary. It will be at the discretion of the Environmental Inspector and
Site Managers to engage water spraying of the site. Corpus Christi will ensure that a water truck
be available at all times during construction. Please refer to Section 4 below for Project
Authority.

3.2 Other dust control measures within and outside of the soil
improvement areas:
3.2.1 Limiting vehicles from tracking “off‐road”, and keeping traffic to
designated roads
Corpus Christi will install proper signage to direct traffic to designated roads. Any traffic
that deviates from designated roads will be redirected to the designated road and the
activity will be reported to the appropriate supervisor for corrective action.

3.2.2 Enforcing a speed‐limit of 15 mph on unsurfaced roads
Corpus Christi will install speed limit signs on all designated access roads. Any
observances of excessive speeds will be reported to the appropriate supervisors for
corrective action, and removal from the Project if necessary. Speeding on the Project Site
will not be tolerated.

3.2.3 Covering open‐bodied haul trucks
The Environmental Inspector, Contractor Supervisors and Project Management will
continuously be observing activities on-site. If there are observances of excessive dust
being generated from open bodied trucks, they will be stopped and asked to reduce
speeds or cover the truck beds as necessary.

3.2.4 Enclosing the work area
For discreet activities such as abrasive blasting, the contractors will be instructed to
enclose the work area to contain any fugitive dust and emissions as per Corpus Christi’s
standard operation procedures.

4 Project Authority
During all phases of Site Preparation and Construction, Corpus Christi will ensure the
appropriate authorities are on site at all times.
