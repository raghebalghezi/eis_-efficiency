The GRASI is a collaborative planning effort between military and civilian leaders designed to ensure the future availability 6 and capacity of regional airspace and training lands for military use and the continued 7 economic prosperity of the Gulf coast. The entire GRASI planning process, goals, objectives, 8 and strategies are in the GRASI Strategic Plan, at http://grasi.leidoseemg.com. 9 This Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) examines the potential environmental impacts resulting from the implementation of the Proposed Action, which is the GRASI 11 Landscape Initiative (GLI) in the region of northwest Florida. The GLI is a U.S. Air Force-led 12 partnership with the State of Florida and federal agencies to expand the capacity of the 13 region to safely host military test and training operations. Specifically, this EIS addresses 14 locations in the Blackwater River State Forest (BRSF) and Tate’s Hell State Forest (THSF) (Figure ES-2) for general training operations, as well as small, noncontiguous land areas throughout 16 the region for permanent and mobile radar emitter sites. 17 ES.1. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS PROCESS (EIAP) 18 The proposed activities addressed within this document constitute a federal action and, 19 therefore, must be assessed in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires federal agencies to consider the environmental consequences of proposed 21 actions in the decision-making process (42 United States Code [USC] 4321, et seq.). The 22 Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) was established under NEPA, 42 USC 4342, et seq., to 23 implement and oversee federal policy in this process. In 1978, the CEQ issued regulations 24 implementing the NEPA process under Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 1500–1508. The Air Force EIAP for meeting CEQ requirements is accomplished via procedures 26 set forth in CEQ regulations and 32 CFR Part 989. This EIS has been prepared in accordance 27 with NEPA and 32 CFR Part 989. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY | APRIL 2014 DRAFT GRASI LANDSCAPE INITIATIVE EIS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY | APRIL 2014 DRAFT GRASI LANDSCAPE INITIATIVE EIS ES.2. PURPOSE AND NEED ES.2.1 Purpose The purpose of the Proposed Action is to analyze the suitability of state lands already identified by state agencies, pursuant to memorandums of agreement under the GRASI Strategic Plan, as potentially available for conducting a variety of nonhazardous military training activities. The intent of the GLI is not to establish new, dedicated-use military ranges but rather to develop additional training flexibility and diversity potentially available through established partnerships and agreements for use when training flexibility at existing military bases is not available. The intent of the GLI, therefore, is to provide military units with compatible locations that can serve as an outlet for training activities when they are otherwise unable to meet their requirements using current military training areas. Specifically, this Proposed Action (the GLI, a component of the GRASI) is designed to develop additional regional training flexibility for nonhazardous military operations. This would be accomplished through two types of partnerships. The Air Force would partner with the State of Florida to obtain permits to use lands that the state has already identified as potentially available for training: BRSF and THSF (Figure ES-2). In addition, the Air Force would partner with the Florida Forest Service (FFS) and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) for use of associated lands for placement of temporary and mobile training radar emitters. ES.2.2 Need The Proposed Action is needed because there is a projected regional shortfall of military training and testing land and airspace in the GRASI region. The demand for the land range and use of restricted areas (RAs) over the Eglin Range Complex creates scheduling conflicts for nonhazardous training. Obtaining the necessary permits to use new areas for nonhazardous training and placing training emitters in remote locations would create flexibility, improving training outcomes through better scheduling and reducing the competing demands on RA. Eglin Air Force Base’s (AFB’s) primary mission is test and evaluation, and training activities sometimes have a lower priority. These measures would allow some mission activities a place to operate when the airspace is already being used by other mission activities. Emitter sites create realistic threat scenarios for pilots and more realistic training scenarios by simulating an integrated air defense system (IADS), which helps with identifying and countering enemy missile or artillery threats from land or sea. ES.3. DECISION TO BE MADE For purposes of this EIS, the decision to be made is whether to implement the Proposed Action (create flexibility by obtaining necessary permits/leases to use emitter sites in northwest Florida and conduct training activities as another permitted user of BRSF and THSF) or the No Action Alternative. The decision to be made also includes how to implement elements of the Proposed Action and the frequency of training activities. Implementation of the No Action Alternative would mean continuing all current training activities at the Eglin Range Complex using training workarounds to try to meet units’ training needs to the maximum extent possible. Using training workarounds are not anticipated to meet all unit training requirements, particularly as the GRASI region becomes subject to greater demands. ES.4. PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES The Proposed Action consists of two main components: establishment and use of emitter training sites on GRASI partner lands and applying to the FFS and FWC to be a permitted user of the northwest Florida state forests for nonhazardous training activities. This Proposed Action may not provide the most comprehensive solution for all training needs, as described in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. Should other partnerships identify additional training locations, they will be considered in conjunction with the appropriate level of additional NEPA analysis. At this time, no other suitable training locations have been identified as potentially available for use and no other elements of the GLI proposal have adequate project definition to warrant inclusion in this EIS. ES.4.1 Proposed Action ES.4.1.1 Emitter Sites A component of the Proposed Action is to establish up to 12 radar, telemetry, and emitter training sites throughout northwest Florida to support development of a simulated IADS to be used for air training. Radar and telemetry emitters are used for tracking aircraft and navigation; training emitters are radar simulator systems designed to help train military personnel to identify and counter enemy missile or artillery threats from land or sea. Types of emitters would vary depending on need, and their use would be determined by constraints associated with the site and respective operational parameters of the specific system. As an example, use of high-powered systems with large safety hazard distances may be restricted at sites in close proximity to populated areas. Emitter training sites identified would utilize FFS and FWC lands via leasing agreements. These sites would accommodate mobile and temporary use; mobile use means that the site would be used for a day with operators on-site, while temporary use may last for several days. Proposed locations are shown in Figure ES-3. The majority of sites identified as part of the screening process are associated with FFS fire spotting towers, while two sites are owned by FWC and one site by Eglin AFB. All sites are either ‘‘improved’’ or ‘‘semi-improved.’’ Not all proposed sites may be used, and only several at any one time would be operational. ES.4.1.2 Training Activities in Northwest Florida State Forests Training activities associated with the Proposed Action consist of utilizing existing areas cleared by the FFS as part of regular forest management activities for helicopter landing and drop zones, use of existing airfields and roadways for aircraft landings, and a number of different land and air training activities. These activities currently occur in the areas between designated test/training sites on the Eglin Range. Specifically, two state forests in northwest Florida, BRSF and THSF, would be leased through agreements with FFS. For the purposes of this EIS, each state forest has been divided into “tactical areas” (TAs), which correlate to each state forest recreational area as shown in Figures ES-4 and ES-5. Training activities may occur in any of the TAs, with consideration of restrictions identified via coordination with the FFS during the planning process, as well as any constraints or mitigations identified in this EIS. Training in the TAs would provide flexibility for those test/training units that are unable to schedule time on the Eglin Range or in the RA due to other higher-priority activities or range congestion. All training activities in the state forests would be conducted per the requirements of Eglin AFB Instruction (EAFBI) 13-212, Range Planning and Operations, Chapter 7 – Environmental Management (December 2010, Interim Change on 9 September 2011), as applicable, and in accordance with the respective state forest management plans. EAFBI 13-212, Chapter 7, is available at http://grasieis.leidoseemg.com/documentation.aspx. The following subsections summarize proposed training activities; more detailed information can be found in Section 2.3.2 of the GLI EIS. These activities would be carried out by units of Air Force Special Operations Command located at Hurlburt Field, units of the 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) located at Eglin AFB, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and support units, and other Department of Defense units. Training activities described under the Proposed Action are not mutually exclusive, and some training activities would occur in support of other activities or subsequent to other training activities. An example would be a training mission involving several helicopters flying from Eglin AFB to a BRSF tactical area Helicopter Landing Zone/Drop Zone (HLZ/DZ) where personnel and equipment would be dropped via an Airdrop or a low-level insertion/extraction. Personnel may then conduct Cross-Country Dismounted Movement (CCDM) training to hardened camp site location or another helicopter landing zone, while along the way bivouacking, Conducting Communications and Surveillance Operations (CCSO), and utilizing expendables. Once reaching their objective, they would be extracted either via another low-level insertion/extraction or Cross-Country Vehicle Movement (CCVM). Aircraft would use existing military operations areas and controlled airspace, as is currently done, to maneuver between Eglin AFB and the state forests. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY | APRIL 2014 DRAFT GRASI LANDSCAPE INITIATIVE EIS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY | APRIL 2014 DRAFT GRASI LANDSCAPE INITIATIVE EIS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY | APRIL 2014 DRAFT GRASI LANDSCAPE INITIATIVE EIS 1 ES.4.1.2.1 Helicopter Landing Zones/Drop Zones Existing cleared areas within the state forests would be utilized as HLZs/DZs for personnel and equipment from various aircraft (either fixed or rotary wing). Several sites located throughout the state forests may be established and utilized at any one time. These sites would be open areas that have already been cleared of tall vegetation by the FFS through regular forest management activities. Table ES-1 details HLZ/DZ activities. 11 Table ES-1.

At BRSF, one existing airfield would be utilized (Munson Airfield, currently  16  designated for public use with no restrictions) and two dirt roadways (one in TA-1 and one in  17  TA-9) are proposed for aircraft operations. At THSF, three dirt roadways are proposed in  18  support of aircraft operations. These roadways are located in TA-2, -6, and -8. Table ES-2  19  details FWALS.  20  Table ES-2.

At BRSF, 7 noise-generating expendables (e.g., blanks) would 8 only be used at hardened camp site locations. At 9 THSF, noise-generating expendables could be used 10 anywhere (pending results of analysis and 11 consideration of use restrictions as identified in this EIS).

It is not likely that this activity would occur at BRSF because it is so close to  5  Eglin AFB. Additionally, because of the requirement within EAFBI 13-212 (Chapter 8) to only  6  conduct this activity on hardened surfaces, and because there would be no hardened surface  7  development at either forest, this activity would likely only occur at local airports in the  8  vicinity of the forests. FARP/HGO activity is included in the EIS as the Air force might need to  9  conduct this activity at BRSF under emergency circumstances.  The Air Force currently  10  conducts these activities on Eglin AFB airfields and at other airports local to THSF. Table ES-9  11  details FARP/HGO activities.  12  Table ES-9.

The operational constraints are components of the Proposed Action and  17  would be implemented as part of the GLI proposal.   The constraints serve to minimize or  18  alleviate adverse impacts to the human and natural environment.  19  In order to ensure that all General Operational Constraints are identified and adhered to by  20  training units, Eglin AFB’s environmental management program has developed “Protection  21  Levels” for areas on the Eglin Range that are utilized for ground training activities. These levels  22  are based on General Operational Constraints and are integral to environmental resource  23  protection. Under the Proposed Action, the Air Force would utilize a similar system tailored  24  for BRSF and THSF; protection levels for the Proposed Action for both ground operations and  25  noise are described in Tables ES-22 and ES-23, respectively, and are applicable to all training  26  locations within the boundaries of the state forests.  Activity outside the boundaries of the  27  state forests is limited to use of public roadways for transportation.  Table ES-22.

Currently there are no GIS data for eagle nests at either forest. However, should a nest be identified, these protections would be applied.  Wood Stork Habitat Buffer  Follow Habitat Management Guidelines for the Wood Stork in the Southeast Region (USFWS, 1990).  500-foot buffer around wood stork feeding/roosting habitat. Currently there are no GIS data for habitat at either forest. However, should habitat be identified these protections would be applied.   Limited Use-1 (LU-1)  Approved Activities: use of star cluster pyrotechnics (hand-held slap flares) only for emergency purposes; use of nonlethal small arms ammunition such as blanks and paintballs (at BRSF approved for paintballs only); see GLI Noise Protection Levels Map for further restrictions on noise-generating expendables.  Dismounted maneuver and incidental and consumptive land disturbance.  Not Approved: use of smokes, flares, or simulators; off-road vehicle use – all vehicles must remain on established roads; land development and point land disturbance outside of previously disturbed roadbeds and road shoulders. LZ/DZ use except on approved FFS sites not requiring additional land development; see Noise Protection Levels Map for further restrictions on LZ/DZ use.  No refueling of vehicles or aircraft allowed.  100 feet around wetlands, water bodies and floodplains; areas exhibiting very limiting soil characteristics (e.g., susceptible to erosion) for HLZ and/or bivouacking; cultural resource areas with inadequate surveys and/or “not cleared” areas; Tate’s Hell Camp Gordon Johnson Historic District.  Limited Use-2 (LU-2)  Approved Activities: use of pyrotechnics (e.g., smoke grenades and GBSs) and nonlethal small arms ammunition such as blanks and paintballs (at BRSF approved for smoke grenades and paintballs only, with GBSs permitted only at hardened camp sites); see GLI Noise Protection Levels Map for further restrictions on noise-generating expendables.  Dismounted maneuver.  Incidental, point, and consumptive land disturbance (includes catholes) outside of previously disturbed roadbeds and road shoulders if approved by FFS.  LZ/DZ use only on approved FFS sites with FFS coordination required for any additional land disturbance; see Noise Protection Levels Map for further restrictions on LZ/DZ use.

As an  4  example, a 200-foot activity buffer around identified red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW) cavity  5  trees is a requirement of EAFBI 13-212.  Just as CCDM at BRSF and THSF is a component of the  6  Proposed Action, so too is the requirement to maintain a 200-foot activity buffer around RCW  7  trees at either BRSF or THSF, since EAFBI 13-212 would be a component of the Proposed  8  Action.  Impact analysis in this EIS considers these requirements as part of the initial impact  9  assessment.  Thus, analysis of impacts to the RCW considers the implementation of the 200 10  foot activity buffer in the initial impact assessment; if potentially adverse impacts are  11  identified, then Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations were developed to minimize or avoid  12  this potential.  13  ES.4.3 No Action Alternative  14  Under the No Action Alternative, the training activities identified under the Proposed Action  15  would continue to occur on Eglin AFB as described and assessed in the Interstitial Area Range  16  Final Environmental Assessment Revision 2 and Eglin AFB Riverine/Estuarine Environmental  17  Assessment. BRSF and THSF would not be utilized, and no new emitter sites would be used.  18  The No Action Alternative would not meet the purpose and need for the Proposed Action, in  19  that there would be continued stress on the Eglin AFB user environment due to conflicts with  20  hazardous and nonhazardous training activities. As use of the Eglin Range increases, these  21  conflicts would become more frequent and problematic. Activities at BRSF, THSF, and the  22  various proposed emitter sites would continue as described in the respective state forest  23  management plans.  24  ES.5. ALTERNATIVE IMPACT ANALYSIS SUMMARY  25  The following provides an impact summary of the analyses presented in the Draft EIS  26  Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6. Details on each specific action and the potential impacts as related to  27  the respective location can be found in these chapters. The significance of impacts was  28  determined by evaluating the context, intensity, and duration of the action (40 CFR 1508.27)  29  and the relative effect on individual resources; context, intensity, and duration factors used in  30  the analyses are described in each respective Chapter 3 resource area discussion. The impact  analyses considers direct, indirect and cumulative impacts on resource along with how both beneficial and adverse impacts affect public safety, the characteristics of the geographic area and proximity of the Proposed Action to sensitive resources, the potential controversial nature of the potential impact, whether possible effects are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks, whether the action may establish a precedent for future actions with significant effects, cumulative impacts, impacts to cultural resources or endangered species, and whether the Proposed Action threatens to violate Federal, State, or local laws or environmental protection requirements. Each of these aspects are addressed as appropriate in the applicable resource area sections and chapters in this EIS.. General criteria for impacts to resource/issue areas are summarized below and are presented relative to individual resource/issue areas at each proposed location in Table ES-24: • Beneficial – Beneficial impacts may occur under any context, intensity, or duration. These generally result in some benefit or overall improvement to the resource impacted by the action. Such impacts may include a reduction in air emissions or restoration of habitats; the scope of the impact directly related to the context, intensity and duration of the impact.  Elimination of baseline air emissions, or restoration of large areas of disturbed wetland may be considered significant beneficial impacts, while a small reduction in baseline air emissions or restoration of a small pocket of wetlands may be considered beneficial but relatively insignificant. Other than providing benefits to Air Force training capabilities, the Air Force has not identified any significant or insignificant beneficial impacts under the Proposed Action. • Adverse – Adverse impacts generally result in detriment or degradation of the impacted resource, the degree or level of impact directly related to the context, intensity, and duration of the impact.  The Air Force has identified the potential for adverse impacts for several resource areas; resources experiencing potential adverse impacts are shaded yellow in Table ES-24.  Adverse impacts can either be significant or insignificant. o Significant – Physical aspects are easily perceptible, and typically endure over the medium-to-long term, with a regional context and a high intensity; however, significant impacts can occur potentially over the short term under any context given a high intensity. Significant adverse impacts are typically not recoverable over the short term, and require long term recovery processes with extensive mitigation or revision of Proposed Action to avoid or minimize impacts.  An example of a significant adverse impact would be destruction of large percentages of wetland areas or degradation of water quality that may affect human health and the environment. o Insignificant – These impacts are typically short-to medium-term impacts under any context or intensity. Beneficial impacts that are not significant in nature may include restoration of small pockets of wetlands.  Adverse but not significant impacts are typically recoverable over the short-to-medium term with mitigations required to minimize level of impact or potential for impact, the extent of mitigation dependent on the identified context and intensity of the impact.  Examples of adverse impacts that are not significant may be short, intermittent increases in noise to transient recreational users that do not affect overall usability of the forest, or the potential for localized, intermittent soil erosion on stream banks due to troop movement over the land-water interface during dismounted movements and amphibious operations. These are recoverable impacts over the short-term through Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations to avoid noise sensitive areas for training in the case of noise impacts, and for soil impacts minimizing the size of troop units conducting ground training activities, rotating land-water interface ingress/egress points, and not using ingress/egress points that show signs of erosion. • Neutral or No Effect – These are impacts that are typically of a low-intensity, such that they are imperceptible regardless of context or duration.  Such impacts, whether beneficial or otherwise, are recoverable over the short term without mitigation and result in no overall perceptible change to the resource.  Resources experiencing neutral or no effects are identified as “green” in Table ES-24. Impacts were evaluated with consideration of implementation of General Operational Constraints inherent to the Proposed Action associated with EAFBI operational procedures and other NEPA-related documents for similar actions occurring on the Eglin Range on similar resources. General Operational Constraints are a prerequisite for implementing the Proposed Action. Once analyses were completed, additional Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations were identified to avoid or minimize adverse impacts to relatively impacted resources. Overall, the Air Force has not identified any significant beneficial or adverse impacts associated with the Proposed Action.  While the Air Force has identified the potential for adverse impacts to various resources, these impacts would be insignificant based on the context, intensity and duration of the identified impacts as described throughout Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6.  Impacts to public health and safety would be either avoided or minimized through implementation of operational constraints and mitigations.  Any unique geographic characteristics (e.g., sensitive habitats, areas prone to erosion, etc.) associated with the proposed emitter or training sites would be avoided, and any potential adverse impacts to the quality of the human environment would be minimal (mainly the potential for occasional annoyance to recreational users from noise). There are no unknown risks or impacts that may be considered controversial in nature associated with emitter site use or training activities (such actions have been extensively analyzed in this EIS and other Air Force documents as referenced in this EIS), and the Proposed Action is not precedent setting because the DoD utilizes public lands throughout the United States for both emitter sites and military training. Adverse impacts to cultural resources and endangered species have been identified; however, these impacts would also be minimized/mitigated through implementation of operational constraints and mitigations as identified through consultation under the National Historic Preservation Act and the Endangered Species Act, respectively. Additionally, the use of emitter sites and conduct of training activities would comply with all Federal, State, and local laws. Finally, the Air Force has not identified any significant potential for cumulative impacts (as discussed in Chapter 7).  Therefore, based on the context, intensity, and duration of impacts identified in this EIS the Air Force has not identified significant beneficial or adverse impacts under the Proposed Action. 1 More detail on impacts can be found in the respective resource-specific discussions provided 2 in the associated EIS sections identified in Table ES-24. 3 Table ES-24.

The Air Force has notified the Florida State Historic Preservation  8  Officer (SHPO), Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), and Native American tribes  9  in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).   A list of  10  agencies and tribes contacted is provided in the Draft EIS Appendix B, Public and Agency  11  Involvement, while ESA and NHPA consultation documentation is provided in the Draft EIS  12  Appendix C, Consultation Documentation.  All completed NHPA consultation documents,  13  including responses and findings from cultural resource consultation agencies, will be  14  provided in the Final EIS.  15  ES.6.  NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE IMPACT ANALYSIS  16  Implementation of the No Action Alternative means that none of the Proposed Action  17  components as described in Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 would occur at the respective locations  18  (emitter sites, BRSF, and THSF). All activities would remain on Eglin AFB, and no new emitter  19  sites would be established. There would be no impacts to the proposed emitter sites, BRSF, or  20  THSF beyond those resulting from normal activities at these locations, such as recreational  21  use and typical forest management activities conducted by the FFS as identified in the  22  respective state forest management plans. Evaluation of the impacts of these activities on the  23  affected environment is beyond the scope of this EIS.  1  Impacts to the Eglin Range and associated airspace would be as described in the Eglin AFB  2  Final Interstitial Range Environmental Assessment Revision 2 (U.S. Air Force, 2013c), the Eglin AFB  3  Riverine/Estuarine Final Programmatic Environmental Assessment (U.S. Air Force, 2004), and the  4  Eglin AFB Final Overland Air Operations Programmatic Environmental Assessment (U.S. Air Force,  2006).   6  ES.7. PROPOSED RESOURCE-SPECIFIC MITIGATIONS  7  Based on the scope of activities associated with the Proposed Action, the inherent General  8  Operational Constraints identified in Section 2.5 of the EIS, and related impact analyses  9  detailed in the EIS, there are no identified Resource-Specific Mitigation impact minimization  procedures necessary for the following resource areas: air quality, solid/hazardous materials  11  and waste, and infrastructure and transportation.    12  Impact analysis of the Proposed Action has identified Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations  13  that would be implemented, in addition to General Operational Constraints in EIS Section 2.5,  14  to further minimize or avoid adverse impacts for the following resources: airspace  management, noise, earth resources, water resources, biological resources, safety, and land  16  use.  These Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations are detailed in Section 2.7 of the EIS.  in  17  most cases impacts would be minimized such that impact significance levels would be  18  reduced from “adverse” (yellow) to “neutral” or “no effect” (green) in Table ES-24.  19  ES.8. CUMULATIVE IMPACTS  Cumulative effects analysis considers the potential environmental impacts resulting from “the  21  incremental impacts of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably  22  foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency or person undertakes such other  23  actions” (40 CFR 1508.7). In this EIS, the Air Force has made an effort to identify actions on or  24  near the action areas associated with the Proposed Action that are under consideration and in  the planning stage at this time.   26  The Air Force evaluated the potential for significant cumulative impacts associated with the  27  Proposed Action. No unmitigatible adverse impacts have been identified for use of emitter  28  sites, thus the Air Force has not identified any correlating potential for cumulative impacts  29  from emitter site use. Although the Proposed Action would result in incremental impacts  when associated with identified past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions at  31  BRSF and THSF, the Air Force does not expect the Proposed Action to result in any significant  32  adverse cumulative impacts.  33  ES.9. OTHER NEPA CONSIDERATIONS  34  ES.9.1 Relationship Between Short-term Use and Long-term Productivity  Short-Term Uses  36  The Proposed Action would have minor short-term effects related to use of resources during  37  land improvements in support of FWALS and HLZs, consumptive use, traveling, use of  38  produced materials, fuels, etc. As a mitigating component of short-term uses of the  environment, the Proposed Action would create economic benefits during training activities in the form of some jobs and the direct and indirect demand for goods and services. Long-Term Productivity Based on analysis of the Proposed Action, the Air Force has not identified any long-term adverse impacts to productivity as a result of unmitigated short-term impacts. The Proposed Action would result in short-term increases in direct and indirect demand for goods and services while training activities occur.  Impacts would be intermittent over the long term as the GLI program is established and implemented. Long-term benefits to the FFS associated with lease fees would be realized through leasing agreements. Short-Term Uses Versus Long-Term Productivity The assessment of effects on long-term productivity is related to whether the project is consistent with long-term regional and local planning objectives. Under the Proposed Action, there would be minor increases in employment, income, and net fiscal benefits and revenues to the FFS and surrounding communities during training activities. Training activities at the state forests would be scheduled to avoid conflict with hunters and other recreational users, thus avoiding impacts to long-term productivity associated with recreational use of the forests. ES.9.2 Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitment of Resources NEPA requires that environmental analysis identify any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources involved in the implementation of the Proposed Action or alternatives. Irreversible and irretrievable resource commitments are related to the use of nonrenewable resources and the effects that the use of these resources could have on future generations. Irreversible effects primarily result from the use or destruction of a specific resource (e.g., energy and minerals) that cannot be replaced within a reasonable time frame. Irretrievable resource commitments involve the loss in value of an affected resource that cannot be restored as a result of the action (e.g., extinction of a threatened or endangered species or the disturbance of a cultural site). Implementing the Proposed Action would require a commitment of natural, physical, human, and fiscal resources. In all of these categories, irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources would occur in the form of utilization of energy resources such as fossil fuels (for transportation, associated with utility use, etc.). While none of the proposed activities involve direct habitat alteration, some biological resources would be directly lost as a result of consumptive use during training activities; however, no sensitive species would be impacted, and the amount of general wildlife species taken would be insignificant when compared with the amount of hunting taking place at each proposed location. Incidental contact (such as a vehicle strike) may also result in incidental mortality to some species; while this cannot be completely avoided, the potential can be minimized by implementation of the General Operational Constraints and Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations identified in the EIS. ES.9.3 Energy Requirements and Conservation Potential of Alternatives and Mitigation Measures Energy requirements associated with the Proposed Action are limited to use of fossil fuels in support of transportation and utility use. Conservation potential for this resource is limited to general energy conservation techniques, such as making sure no lights remain on at hardened camp sites, transportation pooling, etc. ES.9.4 Natural or Depletable Resource Requirements and Conservation Potential While use of natural resources as a component of the training environment would occur at each forest (e.g., consumption training), use of natural resources for the Proposed Action is expected to be “nonintrusive,” in the sense that the goal of the Air Force in implementing the Proposed Action is to avoid to the greatest extent possible adverse impacts to natural and anthropogenic resources and to be compatible with FFS forest management plans. To this end, the Air Force has developed General Operational Constraints and Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations to avoid or minimize impacts on the environment. Consequently, the Air Force would support conservation measures of the FFS through implementation of these requirements. Other than use of fossil fuels as discussed previously, there are no requirements for depletable resources associated with the Proposed Action. How to Make Your Comments Count Commenting on public policy issues or documents as a private citizen can be daunting, especially if the issues are technical.  The most effective comments are those that provide useful information. Comments on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) are used to improve the document and analyses, and to provide decision-makers with relevant information about how the proposed and alternative actions are expected to affect the environment and the public. The more clear, concise, and relevant to the Draft EIS your comments are, the more effective they will be and the more likely it is that they will be utilized to improve the final document and affect agency decisions. Consider the suggestions below to make it easier and more effective to participate. Make your comments as specific as possible, backing up statements with explanations, facts, and references as appropriate. • Establish your authority to comment, whether it is as a concerned citizen, representative of an interest group, or an expert. • Be as specific as possible with your comments and refer to page numbers and paragraphs in the Draft EIS.  If you are recommending changes to the Draft EIS, suggest specific language when possible. • Support statements with details. If, for example, you feel a species was not sufficiently analyzed, focus on the particular problem or issue. Avoid broad statements such as “the document did not adequately analyze the impacts to biological resources.” • Read all relevant portions of the document for your concerns because the potential impacts to resources are likely to be described in more than one section. For example, a change in aircraft sound levels may affect wildlife, sensitive species, land use, aircraft operations, socioeconomics or have environmental justice consequences. These impacts may be described within different sections of a chapter. If you only read one section, you will miss the full impact analysis. If you are presenting your comments verbally, consider these format and style suggestions: • Start by offering general or summary comments. • Use topic sentences and short sentences. • Avoid asking questions. Instead, pose your questions as comments to be considered. • Be respectful of your fellow commentors and agency representatives. Finally, understand comment deadlines and processes. Comments may be submitted at any time throughout the environmental impact analysis process.  For your comments to be considered and responded to in the Final EIS, please submit them by June 23, 2014. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) - A  Disclosure Process Substantive Comments Make a Difference The preparation of a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) document does not determine which alternative to choose. It does not prevent environmental impacts from happening or guarantee the final decisions will be appreciated by anyone.  It does not prohibit any actions.  Simply stated, NEPA is an information disclosure process. Therefore, non-substantive comments that express opinions  or that are pointed, accusatory, or personal will receive reduced or no attention and will not be responded to by the Air Force. However, substantive comments will be responded to in the Final EIS.   Substantive comments: • Question, with fact-based reasons, the accuracy of information in the EIS • Question, with fact-based reasons, the  adequacy of, methodology for, or assumptions used for the environmental analysis • Present new information relevant to the analysis • Present reasonable alternatives other than those analyzed in the EIS that meet the purpose and need statement of the EIS • Cause changes or revisions in one or more of the alternatives • Note where clarifications should be made in the EIS. Stay updated. If you would like to receive information about the EIS and public hearings or meetings, please ask to be included on the EIS mailing list.

To ensure the Air Force has sufficient time to include public input in the preparation of the Final EIS, written comments from the public should be submitted by June 23, 2014. e. Designation: Draft Environmental Impact Statement f. Abstract: This Draft EIS has been prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to analyze the potential environmental consequences of the proposed GLI at Eglin AFB, Florida, and the No Action Alternative. The Proposed Action consists of two main components: obtaining necessary permits to use emitter training sites and areas of northwest Florida state forests for nonhazardous training activities. Training activities would involve some minor land disturbance (no land development), use of wheeled vehicles on established roads only, cross-country troop movements, helicopter and light aviation landings on established landing zones (existing roads and cleared areas), and use of blank ammunition in select areas.  Use of the forests would be accomplished through lease agreements with the FFS, and would initially occur a few times annually, with frequency increasing as the program becomes more established. All training would be conducted in conformance with FFS forest management plans. This EIS analyzes potential impacts associated with airspace, noise, land use, socioeconomics and environmental justice, transportation, utilities, air quality, safety, solid waste, hazardous materials and hazardous waste, physical resources, biological resources, and cultural resources. This EIS also identifies mitigations and best management practices (BMPs) that the proponent could implement to minimize or offset potential adverse impacts. This page is intentionally blank. 1 HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT 2 View this document on-screen in Adobe 3 Acrobat® Reader (available for download at 4 no cost from www.adobe.com). 5 JUMP to a table, figure, or section by clicking on any “hyperlink” to it.  6 Go BACK to the page you jumped from, by holding down the “Alt” key while 7 pressing the “left-arrow” key on the keyboard. 8  9  •  The Executive Summary provides a summary of information in this EIS.  10  •  Chapter 1, Purpose and Need, explains why the proposed action is needed.  11 12  •  Chapter 2, Description of the Proposed Action and Alternatives, describes what activities and alternatives are involved.  13 14  •  Chapter 3, Affected Resource Assessment, identifies what could be affected by the proposed action and talks about regulations and how we assess impacts.  15 16  •  Chapter 4, Emitter Sites Affected Environment/Environmental Consequences, describes the possible effects near proposed emitter sites.  17 18  •  Chapter 5, Blackwater River State Forest Affected Environment/Environmental Consequences, focuses on activities within Blackwater River State Forest.  19 20  •  Chapter 6, Tate’s Hell State Forest Affected Environment/Environmental Consequences, focuses on activities within Tate’s Hell State Forest.  21 22 23  •  Chapter 7, Cumulative Impacts, talks about potential cumulative impacts when combining the proposed action with past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions.  24 25  •  Chapter 8, No Action Alternative Impact Analysis, describes the potential impacts from not implementing the proposed action.  26 27 28 29 30 31  •  Chapter 9, Other NEPA Considerations, compares the proposed short-term use of the environment and resources with their long-term productivity, and describes the commitment of nonrenewable resources, energy requirements and conservation potential of proposed alternatives and mitigation measures, as well as requirements for natural or depletable resources and the potential to conserve environmental resources.  32 33  •  Chapter 10 includes a bibliography; Chapter 11 has a list of preparers; Chapter 12 is an index, and Chapter 13 provides a short glossary.  This page is intentionally blank. 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2 The Gulf Regional Airspace Strategic Initiative (GRASI) region (Figure ES-1) consists of the 3 eastern Gulf of Mexico region, which includes northwest Florida, southern Mississippi, lower 4 Alabama, southern Georgia, and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The GRASI is a collaborative planning effort between military and civilian leaders designed to ensure the future availability 6 and capacity of regional airspace and training lands for military use and the continued 7 economic prosperity of the Gulf coast. The entire GRASI planning process, goals, objectives, 8 and strategies are in the GRASI Strategic Plan, at http://grasi.leidoseemg.com. 9 This Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) examines the potential environmental impacts resulting from the implementation of the Proposed Action, which is the GRASI 11 Landscape Initiative (GLI) in the region of northwest Florida. The GLI is a U.S. Air Force-led 12 partnership with the State of Florida and federal agencies to expand the capacity of the 13 region to safely host military test and training operations. Specifically, this EIS addresses 14 locations in the Blackwater River State Forest (BRSF) and Tate’s Hell State Forest (THSF) (Figure ES-2) for general training operations, as well as small, noncontiguous land areas throughout 16 the region for permanent and mobile radar emitter sites. 17 ES.1. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS PROCESS (EIAP) 18 The proposed activities addressed within this document constitute a federal action and, 19 therefore, must be assessed in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires federal agencies to consider the environmental consequences of proposed 21 actions in the decision-making process (42 United States Code [USC] 4321, et seq.). The 22 Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) was established under NEPA, 42 USC 4342, et seq., to 23 implement and oversee federal policy in this process. In 1978, the CEQ issued regulations 24 implementing the NEPA process under Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 1500–1508. The Air Force EIAP for meeting CEQ requirements is accomplished via procedures 26 set forth in CEQ regulations and 32 CFR Part 989. This EIS has been prepared in accordance 27 with NEPA and 32 CFR Part 989. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY | APRIL 2014 DRAFT GRASI LANDSCAPE INITIATIVE EIS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY | APRIL 2014 DRAFT GRASI LANDSCAPE INITIATIVE EIS ES.2. PURPOSE AND NEED ES.2.1 Purpose The purpose of the Proposed Action is to analyze the suitability of state lands already identified by state agencies, pursuant to memorandums of agreement under the GRASI Strategic Plan, as potentially available for conducting a variety of nonhazardous military training activities. The intent of the GLI is not to establish new, dedicated-use military ranges but rather to develop additional training flexibility and diversity potentially available through established partnerships and agreements for use when training flexibility at existing military bases is not available. The intent of the GLI, therefore, is to provide military units with compatible locations that can serve as an outlet for training activities when they are otherwise unable to meet their requirements using current military training areas. Specifically, this Proposed Action (the GLI, a component of the GRASI) is designed to develop additional regional training flexibility for nonhazardous military operations. This would be accomplished through two types of partnerships. The Air Force would partner with the State of Florida to obtain permits to use lands that the state has already identified as potentially available for training: BRSF and THSF (Figure ES-2). In addition, the Air Force would partner with the Florida Forest Service (FFS) and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) for use of associated lands for placement of temporary and mobile training radar emitters. ES.2.2 Need The Proposed Action is needed because there is a projected regional shortfall of military training and testing land and airspace in the GRASI region. The demand for the land range and use of restricted areas (RAs) over the Eglin Range Complex creates scheduling conflicts for nonhazardous training. Obtaining the necessary permits to use new areas for nonhazardous training and placing training emitters in remote locations would create flexibility, improving training outcomes through better scheduling and reducing the competing demands on RA. Eglin Air Force Base’s (AFB’s) primary mission is test and evaluation, and training activities sometimes have a lower priority. These measures would allow some mission activities a place to operate when the airspace is already being used by other mission activities. Emitter sites create realistic threat scenarios for pilots and more realistic training scenarios by simulating an integrated air defense system (IADS), which helps with identifying and countering enemy missile or artillery threats from land or sea. ES.3. DECISION TO BE MADE For purposes of this EIS, the decision to be made is whether to implement the Proposed Action (create flexibility by obtaining necessary permits/leases to use emitter sites in northwest Florida and conduct training activities as another permitted user of BRSF and THSF) or the No Action Alternative. The decision to be made also includes how to implement elements of the Proposed Action and the frequency of training activities. Implementation of the No Action Alternative would mean continuing all current training activities at the Eglin Range Complex using training workarounds to try to meet units’ training needs to the maximum extent possible. Using training workarounds are not anticipated to meet all unit training requirements, particularly as the GRASI region becomes subject to greater demands. ES.4. PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES The Proposed Action consists of two main components: establishment and use of emitter training sites on GRASI partner lands and applying to the FFS and FWC to be a permitted user of the northwest Florida state forests for nonhazardous training activities. This Proposed Action may not provide the most comprehensive solution for all training needs, as described in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. Should other partnerships identify additional training locations, they will be considered in conjunction with the appropriate level of additional NEPA analysis. At this time, no other suitable training locations have been identified as potentially available for use and no other elements of the GLI proposal have adequate project definition to warrant inclusion in this EIS. ES.4.1 Proposed Action ES.4.1.1 Emitter Sites A component of the Proposed Action is to establish up to 12 radar, telemetry, and emitter training sites throughout northwest Florida to support development of a simulated IADS to be used for air training. Radar and telemetry emitters are used for tracking aircraft and navigation; training emitters are radar simulator systems designed to help train military personnel to identify and counter enemy missile or artillery threats from land or sea. Types of emitters would vary depending on need, and their use would be determined by constraints associated with the site and respective operational parameters of the specific system. As an example, use of high-powered systems with large safety hazard distances may be restricted at sites in close proximity to populated areas. Emitter training sites identified would utilize FFS and FWC lands via leasing agreements. These sites would accommodate mobile and temporary use; mobile use means that the site would be used for a day with operators on-site, while temporary use may last for several days. Proposed locations are shown in Figure ES-3. The majority of sites identified as part of the screening process are associated with FFS fire spotting towers, while two sites are owned by FWC and one site by Eglin AFB. All sites are either ‘‘improved’’ or ‘‘semi-improved.’’ Not all proposed sites may be used, and only several at any one time would be operational. ES.4.1.2 Training Activities in Northwest Florida State Forests Training activities associated with the Proposed Action consist of utilizing existing areas cleared by the FFS as part of regular forest management activities for helicopter landing and drop zones, use of existing airfields and roadways for aircraft landings, and a number of different land and air training activities. These activities currently occur in the areas between designated test/training sites on the Eglin Range. Specifically, two state forests in northwest Florida, BRSF and THSF, would be leased through agreements with FFS. For the purposes of this EIS, each state forest has been divided into “tactical areas” (TAs), which correlate to each state forest recreational area as shown in Figures ES-4 and ES-5. Training activities may occur in any of the TAs, with consideration of restrictions identified via coordination with the FFS during the planning process, as well as any constraints or mitigations identified in this EIS. Training in the TAs would provide flexibility for those test/training units that are unable to schedule time on the Eglin Range or in the RA due to other higher-priority activities or range congestion. All training activities in the state forests would be conducted per the requirements of Eglin AFB Instruction (EAFBI) 13-212, Range Planning and Operations, Chapter 7 – Environmental Management (December 2010, Interim Change on 9 September 2011), as applicable, and in accordance with the respective state forest management plans. EAFBI 13-212, Chapter 7, is available at http://grasieis.leidoseemg.com/documentation.aspx. The following subsections summarize proposed training activities; more detailed information can be found in Section 2.3.2 of the GLI EIS. These activities would be carried out by units of Air Force Special Operations Command located at Hurlburt Field, units of the 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) located at Eglin AFB, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and support units, and other Department of Defense units. Training activities described under the Proposed Action are not mutually exclusive, and some training activities would occur in support of other activities or subsequent to other training activities. An example would be a training mission involving several helicopters flying from Eglin AFB to a BRSF tactical area Helicopter Landing Zone/Drop Zone (HLZ/DZ) where personnel and equipment would be dropped via an Airdrop or a low-level insertion/extraction. Personnel may then conduct Cross-Country Dismounted Movement (CCDM) training to hardened camp site location or another helicopter landing zone, while along the way bivouacking, Conducting Communications and Surveillance Operations (CCSO), and utilizing expendables. Once reaching their objective, they would be extracted either via another low-level insertion/extraction or Cross-Country Vehicle Movement (CCVM). Aircraft would use existing military operations areas and controlled airspace, as is currently done, to maneuver between Eglin AFB and the state forests. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY | APRIL 2014 DRAFT GRASI LANDSCAPE INITIATIVE EIS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY | APRIL 2014 DRAFT GRASI LANDSCAPE INITIATIVE EIS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY | APRIL 2014 DRAFT GRASI LANDSCAPE INITIATIVE EIS 1 ES.4.1.2.1 Helicopter Landing Zones/Drop Zones Existing cleared areas within the state forests would be utilized as HLZs/DZs for personnel and equipment from various aircraft (either fixed or rotary wing).

It is not likely that this activity would occur at BRSF because it is so close to  5  Eglin AFB. Additionally, because of the requirement within EAFBI 13-212 (Chapter 8) to only  6  conduct this activity on hardened surfaces, and because there would be no hardened surface  7  development at either forest, this activity would likely only occur at local airports in the  8  vicinity of the forests. FARP/HGO activity is included in the EIS as the Air force might need to  9  conduct this activity at BRSF under emergency circumstances.

The operational constraints are components of the Proposed Action and  17  would be implemented as part of the GLI proposal.   The constraints serve to minimize or  18  alleviate adverse impacts to the human and natural environment.  19  In order to ensure that all General Operational Constraints are identified and adhered to by  20  training units, Eglin AFB’s environmental management program has developed “Protection  21  Levels” for areas on the Eglin Range that are utilized for ground training activities. These levels  22  are based on General Operational Constraints and are integral to environmental resource  23  protection. Under the Proposed Action, the Air Force would utilize a similar system tailored  24  for BRSF and THSF; protection levels for the Proposed Action for both ground operations and  25  noise are described in Tables ES-22 and ES-23, respectively, and are applicable to all training  26  locations within the boundaries of the state forests.  Activity outside the boundaries of the  27  state forests is limited to use of public roadways for transportation.  Table ES-22.

Currently there are no GIS data for eagle nests at either forest. However, should a nest be identified, these protections would be applied.  Wood Stork Habitat Buffer  Follow Habitat Management Guidelines for the Wood Stork in the Southeast Region (USFWS, 1990).  500-foot buffer around wood stork feeding/roosting habitat. Currently there are no GIS data for habitat at either forest. However, should habitat be identified these protections would be applied.   Limited Use-1 (LU-1)  Approved Activities: use of star cluster pyrotechnics (hand-held slap flares) only for emergency purposes; use of nonlethal small arms ammunition such as blanks and paintballs (at BRSF approved for paintballs only); see GLI Noise Protection Levels Map for further restrictions on noise-generating expendables.  Dismounted maneuver and incidental and consumptive land disturbance.  Not Approved: use of smokes, flares, or simulators; off-road vehicle use – all vehicles must remain on established roads; land development and point land disturbance outside of previously disturbed roadbeds and road shoulders. LZ/DZ use except on approved FFS sites not requiring additional land development; see Noise Protection Levels Map for further restrictions on LZ/DZ use.  No refueling of vehicles or aircraft allowed.  100 feet around wetlands, water bodies and floodplains; areas exhibiting very limiting soil characteristics (e.g., susceptible to erosion) for HLZ and/or bivouacking; cultural resource areas with inadequate surveys and/or “not cleared” areas; Tate’s Hell Camp Gordon Johnson Historic District.  Limited Use-2 (LU-2)  Approved Activities: use of pyrotechnics (e.g., smoke grenades and GBSs) and nonlethal small arms ammunition such as blanks and paintballs (at BRSF approved for smoke grenades and paintballs only, with GBSs permitted only at hardened camp sites); see GLI Noise Protection Levels Map for further restrictions on noise-generating expendables.  Dismounted maneuver.  Incidental, point, and consumptive land disturbance (includes catholes) outside of previously disturbed roadbeds and road shoulders if approved by FFS.  LZ/DZ use only on approved FFS sites with FFS coordination required for any additional land disturbance; see Noise Protection Levels Map for further restrictions on LZ/DZ use.

As an  4  example, a 200-foot activity buffer around identified red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW) cavity  5  trees is a requirement of EAFBI 13-212.  Just as CCDM at BRSF and THSF is a component of the  6  Proposed Action, so too is the requirement to maintain a 200-foot activity buffer around RCW  7  trees at either BRSF or THSF, since EAFBI 13-212 would be a component of the Proposed  8  Action.  Impact analysis in this EIS considers these requirements as part of the initial impact  9  assessment.  Thus, analysis of impacts to the RCW considers the implementation of the 200 10  foot activity buffer in the initial impact assessment; if potentially adverse impacts are  11  identified, then Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations were developed to minimize or avoid  12  this potential.  13  ES.4.3 No Action Alternative  14  Under the No Action Alternative, the training activities identified under the Proposed Action  15  would continue to occur on Eglin AFB as described and assessed in the Interstitial Area Range  16  Final Environmental Assessment Revision 2 and Eglin AFB Riverine/Estuarine Environmental  17  Assessment. BRSF and THSF would not be utilized, and no new emitter sites would be used.  18  The No Action Alternative would not meet the purpose and need for the Proposed Action, in  19  that there would be continued stress on the Eglin AFB user environment due to conflicts with  20  hazardous and nonhazardous training activities. As use of the Eglin Range increases, these  21  conflicts would become more frequent and problematic. Activities at BRSF, THSF, and the  22  various proposed emitter sites would continue as described in the respective state forest  23  management plans.  24  ES.5. ALTERNATIVE IMPACT ANALYSIS SUMMARY  25  The following provides an impact summary of the analyses presented in the Draft EIS  26  Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6. Details on each specific action and the potential impacts as related to  27  the respective location can be found in these chapters. The significance of impacts was  28  determined by evaluating the context, intensity, and duration of the action (40 CFR 1508.27)  29  and the relative effect on individual resources; context, intensity, and duration factors used in  30  the analyses are described in each respective Chapter 3 resource area discussion. The impact  analyses considers direct, indirect and cumulative impacts on resource along with how both beneficial and adverse impacts affect public safety, the characteristics of the geographic area and proximity of the Proposed Action to sensitive resources, the potential controversial nature of the potential impact, whether possible effects are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks, whether the action may establish a precedent for future actions with significant effects, cumulative impacts, impacts to cultural resources or endangered species, and whether the Proposed Action threatens to violate Federal, State, or local laws or environmental protection requirements. Each of these aspects are addressed as appropriate in the applicable resource area sections and chapters in this EIS.. General criteria for impacts to resource/issue areas are summarized below and are presented relative to individual resource/issue areas at each proposed location in Table ES-24: • Beneficial – Beneficial impacts may occur under any context, intensity, or duration. These generally result in some benefit or overall improvement to the resource impacted by the action. Such impacts may include a reduction in air emissions or restoration of habitats; the scope of the impact directly related to the context, intensity and duration of the impact.  Elimination of baseline air emissions, or restoration of large areas of disturbed wetland may be considered significant beneficial impacts, while a small reduction in baseline air emissions or restoration of a small pocket of wetlands may be considered beneficial but relatively insignificant. Other than providing benefits to Air Force training capabilities, the Air Force has not identified any significant or insignificant beneficial impacts under the Proposed Action. • Adverse – Adverse impacts generally result in detriment or degradation of the impacted resource, the degree or level of impact directly related to the context, intensity, and duration of the impact.  The Air Force has identified the potential for adverse impacts for several resource areas; resources experiencing potential adverse impacts are shaded yellow in Table ES-24.  Adverse impacts can either be significant or insignificant. o Significant – Physical aspects are easily perceptible, and typically endure over the medium-to-long term, with a regional context and a high intensity; however, significant impacts can occur potentially over the short term under any context given a high intensity. Significant adverse impacts are typically not recoverable over the short term, and require long term recovery processes with extensive mitigation or revision of Proposed Action to avoid or minimize impacts.  An example of a significant adverse impact would be destruction of large percentages of wetland areas or degradation of water quality that may affect human health and the environment. o Insignificant – These impacts are typically short-to medium-term impacts under any context or intensity. Beneficial impacts that are not significant in nature may include restoration of small pockets of wetlands.  Adverse but not significant impacts are typically recoverable over the short-to-medium term with mitigations required to minimize level of impact or potential for impact, the extent of mitigation dependent on the identified context and intensity of the impact.  Examples of adverse impacts that are not significant may be short, intermittent increases in noise to transient recreational users that do not affect overall usability of the forest, or the potential for localized, intermittent soil erosion on stream banks due to troop movement over the land-water interface during dismounted movements and amphibious operations. These are recoverable impacts over the short-term through Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations to avoid noise sensitive areas for training in the case of noise impacts, and for soil impacts minimizing the size of troop units conducting ground training activities, rotating land-water interface ingress/egress points, and not using ingress/egress points that show signs of erosion. • Neutral or No Effect – These are impacts that are typically of a low-intensity, such that they are imperceptible regardless of context or duration.  Such impacts, whether beneficial or otherwise, are recoverable over the short term without mitigation and result in no overall perceptible change to the resource.  Resources experiencing neutral or no effects are identified as “green” in Table ES-24. Impacts were evaluated with consideration of implementation of General Operational Constraints inherent to the Proposed Action associated with EAFBI operational procedures and other NEPA-related documents for similar actions occurring on the Eglin Range on similar resources. General Operational Constraints are a prerequisite for implementing the Proposed Action. Once analyses were completed, additional Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations were identified to avoid or minimize adverse impacts to relatively impacted resources. Overall, the Air Force has not identified any significant beneficial or adverse impacts associated with the Proposed Action.  While the Air Force has identified the potential for adverse impacts to various resources, these impacts would be insignificant based on the context, intensity and duration of the identified impacts as described throughout Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6.  Impacts to public health and safety would be either avoided or minimized through implementation of operational constraints and mitigations.  Any unique geographic characteristics (e.g., sensitive habitats, areas prone to erosion, etc.) associated with the proposed emitter or training sites would be avoided, and any potential adverse impacts to the quality of the human environment would be minimal (mainly the potential for occasional annoyance to recreational users from noise). There are no unknown risks or impacts that may be considered controversial in nature associated with emitter site use or training activities (such actions have been extensively analyzed in this EIS and other Air Force documents as referenced in this EIS), and the Proposed Action is not precedent setting because the DoD utilizes public lands throughout the United States for both emitter sites and military training. Adverse impacts to cultural resources and endangered species have been identified; however, these impacts would also be minimized/mitigated through implementation of operational constraints and mitigations as identified through consultation under the National Historic Preservation Act and the Endangered Species Act, respectively. Additionally, the use of emitter sites and conduct of training activities would comply with all Federal, State, and local laws. Finally, the Air Force has not identified any significant potential for cumulative impacts (as discussed in Chapter 7).  Therefore, based on the context, intensity, and duration of impacts identified in this EIS the Air Force has not identified significant beneficial or adverse impacts under the Proposed Action. 1 More detail on impacts can be found in the respective resource-specific discussions provided 2 in the associated EIS sections identified in Table ES-24. 3 Table ES-24.

The Air Force has notified the Florida State Historic Preservation  8  Officer (SHPO), Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), and Native American tribes  9  in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).   A list of  10  agencies and tribes contacted is provided in the Draft EIS Appendix B, Public and Agency  11  Involvement, while ESA and NHPA consultation documentation is provided in the Draft EIS  12  Appendix C, Consultation Documentation.  All completed NHPA consultation documents,  13  including responses and findings from cultural resource consultation agencies, will be  14  provided in the Final EIS.  15  ES.6.  NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE IMPACT ANALYSIS  16  Implementation of the No Action Alternative means that none of the Proposed Action  17  components as described in Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 would occur at the respective locations  18  (emitter sites, BRSF, and THSF). All activities would remain on Eglin AFB, and no new emitter  19  sites would be established. There would be no impacts to the proposed emitter sites, BRSF, or  20  THSF beyond those resulting from normal activities at these locations, such as recreational  21  use and typical forest management activities conducted by the FFS as identified in the  22  respective state forest management plans. Evaluation of the impacts of these activities on the  23  affected environment is beyond the scope of this EIS.  1  Impacts to the Eglin Range and associated airspace would be as described in the Eglin AFB  2  Final Interstitial Range Environmental Assessment Revision 2 (U.S. Air Force, 2013c), the Eglin AFB  3  Riverine/Estuarine Final Programmatic Environmental Assessment (U.S. Air Force, 2004), and the  4  Eglin AFB Final Overland Air Operations Programmatic Environmental Assessment (U.S. Air Force,  2006).   6  ES.7. PROPOSED RESOURCE-SPECIFIC MITIGATIONS  7  Based on the scope of activities associated with the Proposed Action, the inherent General  8  Operational Constraints identified in Section 2.5 of the EIS, and related impact analyses  9  detailed in the EIS, there are no identified Resource-Specific Mitigation impact minimization  procedures necessary for the following resource areas: air quality, solid/hazardous materials  11  and waste, and infrastructure and transportation.    12  Impact analysis of the Proposed Action has identified Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations  13  that would be implemented, in addition to General Operational Constraints in EIS Section 2.5,  14  to further minimize or avoid adverse impacts for the following resources: airspace  management, noise, earth resources, water resources, biological resources, safety, and land  16  use.  These Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations are detailed in Section 2.7 of the EIS.  in  17  most cases impacts would be minimized such that impact significance levels would be  18  reduced from “adverse” (yellow) to “neutral” or “no effect” (green) in Table ES-24.  19  ES.8. CUMULATIVE IMPACTS  Cumulative effects analysis considers the potential environmental impacts resulting from “the  21  incremental impacts of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably  22  foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency or person undertakes such other  23  actions” (40 CFR 1508.7). In this EIS, the Air Force has made an effort to identify actions on or  24  near the action areas associated with the Proposed Action that are under consideration and in  the planning stage at this time.   26  The Air Force evaluated the potential for significant cumulative impacts associated with the  27  Proposed Action. No unmitigatible adverse impacts have been identified for use of emitter  28  sites, thus the Air Force has not identified any correlating potential for cumulative impacts  29  from emitter site use. Although the Proposed Action would result in incremental impacts  when associated with identified past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions at  31  BRSF and THSF, the Air Force does not expect the Proposed Action to result in any significant  32  adverse cumulative impacts.  33  ES.9. OTHER NEPA CONSIDERATIONS  34  ES.9.1 Relationship Between Short-term Use and Long-term Productivity  Short-Term Uses  36  The Proposed Action would have minor short-term effects related to use of resources during  37  land improvements in support of FWALS and HLZs, consumptive use, traveling, use of  38  produced materials, fuels, etc. As a mitigating component of short-term uses of the  environment, the Proposed Action would create economic benefits during training activities in the form of some jobs and the direct and indirect demand for goods and services. Long-Term Productivity Based on analysis of the Proposed Action, the Air Force has not identified any long-term adverse impacts to productivity as a result of unmitigated short-term impacts. The Proposed Action would result in short-term increases in direct and indirect demand for goods and services while training activities occur.  Impacts would be intermittent over the long term as the GLI program is established and implemented. Long-term benefits to the FFS associated with lease fees would be realized through leasing agreements. Short-Term Uses Versus Long-Term Productivity The assessment of effects on long-term productivity is related to whether the project is consistent with long-term regional and local planning objectives. Under the Proposed Action, there would be minor increases in employment, income, and net fiscal benefits and revenues to the FFS and surrounding communities during training activities. Training activities at the state forests would be scheduled to avoid conflict with hunters and other recreational users, thus avoiding impacts to long-term productivity associated with recreational use of the forests. ES.9.2 Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitment of Resources NEPA requires that environmental analysis identify any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources involved in the implementation of the Proposed Action or alternatives. Irreversible and irretrievable resource commitments are related to the use of nonrenewable resources and the effects that the use of these resources could have on future generations. Irreversible effects primarily result from the use or destruction of a specific resource (e.g., energy and minerals) that cannot be replaced within a reasonable time frame. Irretrievable resource commitments involve the loss in value of an affected resource that cannot be restored as a result of the action (e.g., extinction of a threatened or endangered species or the disturbance of a cultural site). Implementing the Proposed Action would require a commitment of natural, physical, human, and fiscal resources. In all of these categories, irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources would occur in the form of utilization of energy resources such as fossil fuels (for transportation, associated with utility use, etc.). While none of the proposed activities involve direct habitat alteration, some biological resources would be directly lost as a result of consumptive use during training activities; however, no sensitive species would be impacted, and the amount of general wildlife species taken would be insignificant when compared with the amount of hunting taking place at each proposed location. Incidental contact (such as a vehicle strike) may also result in incidental mortality to some species; while this cannot be completely avoided, the potential can be minimized by implementation of the General Operational Constraints and Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations identified in the EIS. ES.9.3 Energy Requirements and Conservation Potential of Alternatives and Mitigation Measures Energy requirements associated with the Proposed Action are limited to use of fossil fuels in support of transportation and utility use. Conservation potential for this resource is limited to general energy conservation techniques, such as making sure no lights remain on at hardened camp sites, transportation pooling, etc. ES.9.4 Natural or Depletable Resource Requirements and Conservation Potential While use of natural resources as a component of the training environment would occur at each forest (e.g., consumption training), use of natural resources for the Proposed Action is expected to be “nonintrusive,” in the sense that the goal of the Air Force in implementing the Proposed Action is to avoid to the greatest extent possible adverse impacts to natural and anthropogenic resources and to be compatible with FFS forest management plans. To this end, the Air Force has developed General Operational Constraints and Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations to avoid or minimize impacts on the environment. Consequently, the Air Force would support conservation measures of the FFS through implementation of these requirements. Other than use of fossil fuels as discussed previously, there are no requirements for depletable resources associated with the Proposed Action. TABLE OF CONTENTS 1.

NOTE: This document is meant to be an 7 electronic, interactive document, and all maps are identified as thumbnails within the text; 8 clicking on the image will enlarge it for screen viewing.  Those wishing to print the document 9 will find full page maps in Appendix A. 10 This chapter provides background information on the GRASI planning process.  It also 11 discusses the purpose and need for the Proposed Action, the Environmental Impact Analysis 12 Process (EIAP), cooperating agencies, consultations and coordination, decisions to be made, 13 and the scope and format of the EIS. 14 1.2 BACKGROUND, SCOPE, AND HISTORY OF GRASI PLANNING 15 The GRASI region consists of the eastern Gulf of Mexico region, which includes northwest 16 Florida, southern Mississippi, lower Alabama, southern Georgia, and the eastern Gulf of 17 Mexico. The region’s major industries include defense and tourism.  Six major Department of 18 Defense (DoD) installations call the area home: Eglin AFB, Tyndall AFB, Naval Air Station (NAS) 19 Pensacola, Fort Rucker, Hurlburt Field, and NAS Whiting Field.  The 2005 Base Realignment 20 and Closure Act recommendations (which became law on November 9, 2005) assigned F-35 21 Joint Strike Fighters to Eglin AFB, realigned the 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) (7 SFG[A]) 22 to Eglin AFB, moved additional aviation training to NAS Pensacola, relocated the Defense 23 Threat Reduction Agency National Command Region conventional armament research from 24 Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and created an Air Integrated Weapons and Armaments Research, 25 Development and Acquisition, Test and 26 Evaluation Center at Eglin AFB. Further, 27 installations across the region expect growth of 28 preexisting missions and an increase in student 29 populations and training readiness activities. 30 Each base has a need to fly around its airfields 31 and within special use airspace (SUA), as well as 32 transit regularly between both areas to 33 accomplish its mission (Figure 1-1).  SUA is a 34 designated volume of airspace that segregates 35 incompatible military operations from civilian 36 air traffic by limiting access for aircraft 37 not participating in the military operations. Figure 1-1.  GRASI Regional Airspace 38 SUA includes restricted areas (RA), military operations areas (MOAs), alert areas, and warning areas, each characterized by unique requirements for “nonparticipating” aircraft. RA that extends to the ground over a military range allows for the release of munitions from an aircraft for testing and training. Regional growth is not limited to the military; since 1990, the population of the Florida panhandle has increased dramatically. Traffic counts at airports across the region have also steadily risen, and Bay County recently saw the opening of the first international airport (Panama City–Bay County International Airport) built in the last decade.  Because civilian flights require access to safe and navigable airspace, commercial carriers could decide to relocate or reduce operations if the airspace over the region becomes too congested. Businesses that rely on general aviation and business aviation traffic could compete with increased military use. Military planners at Eglin AFB realized that the region needed a strategic vision and a coordinated approach to optimize use of the airspace to better support regional and civilian needs.  The GRASI is a collaborative planning effort between military and civilian leaders designed to ensure the future availability and capacity of regional airspace and training lands for military use and the continued economic prosperity of the Gulf Coast.  Beginning in March 2008, the Department of Defense (DoD) began to discuss plans to address regional training constraints and capacity shortfalls. Eglin AFB initially brought together military stakeholders to conduct a requirements analysis of current and future projected training requirements. Participants in this requirements analysis included members of the 7 SFG(A), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), the Navy, and representatives familiar with training needs of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.  DoD stakeholders documented their training requirements, established a strategic vision, modeled all the airspace in the region, and recorded objectives, which were developed in conjunction with civilian community leadership, for stakeholders to implement. The requirements analysis showed that additional airspace capacity is needed to support greater levels of military training and testing, which are expected to increase through 2017. Without better management and use of airspace to provide additional capacity, the military mission will not be sustainable in the Gulf Coast region. The GRASI established multiple objectives, including adding high-altitude military airspace, rerouting traffic during busy periods, improving management facilities and communication, and expanding the military capacity of the region. The entire GRASI planning process, goals, objectives, and strategies are in the GRASI Strategic Plan, at http://grasi.leidoseemg.com. The GRASI airspace model showed that demand on the military RA is the limiting factor on the growth of testing and training activity.  Further, many of the activities planned or conducted in the RA are tied to nonhazardous ground activities that need not occur on a range.  These activities could be safely conducted outside of range property and SUA.  These nonhazardous activities require only a small ground party or equipment, but without permission to access other areas, DoD has had to conduct these activities in range and airspace reserved for hazardous missions.  To alleviate congestion in RA, the United States Air Force (Air Force) decided to partner with willing public and private owners of large land parcels (over 10,000 acres) to investigate the potential for military use. DoD began the GLI with two strategies: partner with nongovernmental organizations, states, and federal agencies to gain access to new working lands and partner with owners of existing working lands to investigate the potential for military use.  DoD began by reviewing all 1  activities conducted in the limiting RA and documented the numbers and types of operations  2  that are or will be overtaxing the airspace.  3  In 2012, military planners began to identify potential civilian partner organizations that might  4  have the capability and interest in supporting the military mission.  In February 2012, military  5  planners began reaching out to state and local organizations.  Several state agencies, such as  6  the Florida Forest Service (FFS), Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC),  7  Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), and Northwest Florida Water  8  Management District (NWFWMD) expressed interest in supporting the DoD’s need to  9  augment training and testing capabilities. Between October 2012 and March 2013, each of  10  these organizations signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Air Force  11  committing to explore solutions and alternatives for meeting the DoD’s requirements for  12  additional training land and airspace (see Appendix I, Memoranda of Agreement).   13  The MOA between the Air Force and FFS is consistent with the recent legislative amendment  14  to the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act, which authorizes funding for state forestry  15  agencies.  In February 2014, 16 United States Code (USC) Section 2101a(c) was amended by  16  Public Law 113-79, Section 8101. Under this amendment, state foresters develop or update  17  statewide assessments and strategies in coordination, as feasible, with military installations to  18  support, promote, and contribute to their mission activities.  In the planning and  19  implementation of the GLI, the Air Force will work with FFS to accomplish this coordination  20  requirement by evaluating the potential participation and management of state-owned  21  forestlands to support compatible military training activities for Eglin AFB. The Proposed  22  Action in this EIS demonstrates the initiative taken by FFS to support, promote, and  23  contribute to the mission of Eglin AFB.  24  The scope of this EIS addresses the Proposed Action that could be pursued under the current  25  GRASI planning process within the construct of the established agreements.  This GLI EIS,  26  therefore, evaluates the environmental impacts of the Proposed Action that is ready for  27  decision on FFS, FWC, FDEP, or NWFWMD lands that meet the military’s GRASI training needs,  28  namely, establishment and use of emitter training sites and training activities in Blackwater  29  River State Forest (BRSF) and Tate’s Hell State Forest (THSF).  30  While the overarching goals of the GLI address increased flexibility for both hazardous  31  (e.g., air-to-ground live fire testing and training) and nonhazardous test and training activities  32  (e.g., ground maneuvers, helicopter landing zones [HLZs]) throughout the GRASI region,  33  increased flexibility for hazardous activities is in the initial planning stages at this time and, if  34  pursued, would be addressed in separate NEPA documentation. In other words, this EIS does  35  not address proposed actions for hazardous training activity.  It should also be noted that  36  Emerald Warrior (AFSOC training in urban and irregular warfare settings currently occurring in  37  northwest Florida) is not included as part of this Proposed Action.  38  1.3 PURPOSE  39  The purpose of the Proposed Action is to analyze the suitability of state lands already  40  identified by state agencies, pursuant to memorandums of agreement under the GRASI  41  Strategic Plan, as potentially available for conducting a variety of nonhazardous military  42  training activities. The intent of the GLI is not to establish new, dedicated-use military ranges  1 but rather to develop additional training flexibility and diversity potentially available through 2 established partnerships and agreements for use when training flexibility at existing military 3 bases is not available. The intent of the GLI, therefore, is to provide military units with 4 compatible locations that can serve as an outlet for training activities when they are otherwise unable to meet their requirements using current military training areas. The Air 6 Force proposes to pursue this increased flexibility through the GRASI planning process and 7 the partnership agreements with state agencies established in 2012 and 2013.  It is hoped 8 that additional partnerships may be established and other areas identified as potential 9 training sites in the future. Specifically, this Proposed Action (the GLI, a component of the GRASI) is designed to develop 11 additional regional training flexibility for nonhazardous military operations. This would be 12 accomplished through two types of partnerships.  The Air Force would partner with the State 13 of Florida to obtain permits to use lands that the state has already identified as potentially 14 available for training: BRSF and THSF (Figure 1-2).  In addition, the Air Force would partner 16 with FFS and FWC for use of associated lands 17 for placement of temporary and mobile 18 training radar emitters.  Because complete 19 implementation of these two partnerships may not add sufficient regional flexibility, other 21 partnerships and areas are in the initial 22 planning stages but are not defined enough to 23 be evaluated at this time. Such future actions, 24 if and when agreed to and defined in sufficient detail for NEPA analysis, would be evaluated at 26 the appropriate level under separate NEPA 27 documentation. Figure 1-2.  Location of BRSF and THSF 28 1.4 NEED 29 The Proposed Action is needed because there is a projected regional shortfall of military training and testing land and airspace in the GRASI region. The demand for the land range 31 and use of RA over the Eglin Range Complex creates scheduling conflicts for nonhazardous 32 training.  Obtaining the necessary permits to use new areas for nonhazardous training and 33 placing training emitters in remote locations would create flexibility, improving training 34 outcomes through better scheduling and reducing the competing demands on RA. Eglin AFB’s primary mission is test and evaluation, and training activities sometimes have a lower 36 priority. From time to time, training units are unable to obtain the necessary time on the 37 range or in the RA to complete their requirements. As a result, the Air Force needs additional 38 flexibility in the GRASI region to accommodate the increasing levels of testing and training 39 activity required by the current mission. More specifically, additional flexibility for training activities outside Eglin AFB would allow test and training units to accomplish their missions 41 when time on the range or in the RA is not available. 42 As a result, the Air Force needs additional land areas in the GRASI region to accommodate the 43 increasing levels of testing and training activity required by the current mission.  More 1  specifically, additional capacity for training activities outside of the Eglin Range Complex  2  would allow all testing and training units at Eglin AFB to accomplish their missions. Obtaining  3  the necessary permits to use new areas for nonhazardous training that are in proximity to  4  units currently training on Eglin’s Range Complex, as well as placing training emitters in  additional locations, would create flexibility and reduce the demand on RA.  These measures  6  would allow some mission activities a place to operate when the airspace is already being  7  used by other mission activities. Emitter sites create realistic threat scenarios for pilots and  8  more realistic training scenarios by simulating an integrated air defense system (IADS), which  9  helps with identifying and countering enemy missile or artillery threats from land or sea.  In summary, by gaining permitted access to the GRASI landscape (i.e., implementing the GLI),  11  military units would gain much needed flexibility when the land range and RA are not  12  available. Furthermore, they would be able to train in a realistic threat environment that  13  would resemble actual combat scenarios.  14  1.5 DECISION TO BE MADE  For purposes of this EIS, the decision to be made is whether to implement the Proposed  16  Action (create flexibility by obtaining necessary permits/leases to use emitter sites in  17  northwest Florida and conduct training activities as another permitted user of BRSF and THSF)  18  or the No Action Alternative.  The decision to be made also includes how to implement  19  elements of the Proposed Action and the frequency of training activities. Implementation of  the No Action Alternative would mean continuing all current training activities at the Eglin  21  Range Complex using training workarounds to try to meet units’ training needs to the  22  maximum extent possible. Using training workarounds are not anticipated to meet all unit  23  training requirements, particularly as the GRASI region becomes subject to greater demands.  24  1.6 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS PROCESS  The proposed activities addressed within this document constitute a federal action and,  26  therefore, must be assessed in accordance with NEPA, which requires federal agencies to  27  consider the environmental consequences of proposed actions in the decision-making  28  process (42 USC 4321, et seq.).  The intent of NEPA is to protect, restore, or enhance the  29  environment through well-informed decisions by the federal decision maker. The Council on  Environmental Quality (CEQ) was established under NEPA, 42 USC 4342, et seq., to implement  31  and oversee federal policy in this process.  In 1978, the CEQ issued regulations implementing  32  the NEPA process under Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 1500–1508.  The Air  33  Force EIAP for meeting CEQ requirements is accomplished via procedures set forth in CEQ  34  regulations and 32 CFR Part 989.  This EIS has been prepared in accordance with NEPA and 32  CFR Part 989.  36  1.6.1 Summary of Public Scoping Process  37  NEPA and the Air Force’s implementing regulations require the lead agency (in this case, the  38  Air Force) to seek public participation throughout the EIAP. “Scoping” identifies potential  39  issues and alternatives early in an EIS development process. A detailed discussion of the  1  public scoping process, as well as public scoping materials presented at meetings and  2  distributed to the public, is provided in Appendix B, Public and Agency Involvement.  3  The initiation of the scoping process began with the Air Force’s publication of a Notice of  4  Intent (NOI) in the Federal Register on 12 August 2013.  This notice announced the Air Force’s  5  intent to prepare the GLI EIS. The publication of the NOI officially marked the beginning of  6  the scoping period, during which time the Air Force accepted public comments on the scope,  7  or range of issues, to be considered during the preparation of the draft EIS.  The scoping  8  period ended on 12 September 2013.  9  Approximately two weeks prior to the scoping meetings, the Air Force distributed newspaper  10  advertisements in areas potentially impacted by the GLI to announce its intent to prepare an  11  EIS and the associated scoping meetings.  12  The Air Force also established a project website, http://grasieis.leidoseemg.com, to notify the  13  general public of the scoping meetings and EIAP via the Internet. The website also accepted  14  public scoping comments.  The scoping brochure, developed for the scoping meetings, was  15  posted to the project website prior to the scoping meetings and the scoping presentation  16  was posted shortly after the scoping meetings.  A project announcements tab announced the  17  scoping meeting dates and locations, as well as the close of the scoping period and informed  18  the public that the Draft EIS was anticipated to be available for public and agency review early  19  in 2014.  The website also linked to the GRASI website as well as other relevant Air Force  20  websites.  21  The Air Force held three scoping meetings, near BRSF and THSF.  The dates and locations for  22  those meetings are included in Table 1-1, along with the number of meeting attendees, and  23  verbal and written comments received.  24  Table 1-1.  Scoping Meeting Dates, Locations, Attendance, Comment Submittals  25  Table 1-2 summarizes by resource area or EIS topic the public comments provided during the  26  public scoping period at the scoping meetings or in writing to the Air Force. The table also  27  identifies where in the EIS these issue areas are addressed.  28  Development of the comment summaries began with a review of each comment for content;  29  key issues were identified and the comments categorized by EIS topic, such as Purpose and  30  Need, Proposed Action and Alternatives, Suggested New Alternative, or resource area, such as  31  Socioeconomics, Noise, Transportation, Biological Resources, etc.  1  Many of the comments concerned more than one topic and/or  resource  area.   These  2  comments were categorized in all relevant actions/topics to ensure their full consideration  3  during the EIS preparation.   In addition, some commenters provided written as well verbal  4  comments.   Accordingly, the number of comments received is greater than the number of  5  individuals and organizations commenting.  For the GLI EIS, 167 individuals and organizations  6  submitted 1,306 comments.  7  Table 1-2.

The Milton meeting, held on December 11, was attended by  11  131 persons and the Apalachicola meeting, held on December 12, was attended by 52  12  persons.  13  1.7 COOPERATING AGENCY AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL  14  COORDINATION/CONSULTATIONS  15  There are no cooperating agencies associated with this action.  This EIS has been developed  16  by the U.S. Air Force in coordination with other DoD services and GRASI partner organizations,  17  including the FFS and FWC.  18  In August, the Air Force distributed Interagency and Intergovernmental Coordination for  19  Environmental Planning (IICEP) letters to potentially interested Federal, state, and local  1  agencies and government representatives.  Included as an attachment to the IICEP letter was  2  a map of the proposed emitter sites and BRSF and THSF and a flyer advertising the scoping  3  meetings.  The IICEP letter, attachments and distribution list are located in Appendix B, Public  4  and Agency Involvement.  The Air Force completed consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in  6  accordance with Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) on April 8, 2014, and has  7  received concurrence on a finding of “Not Likely to Adversely Affect” sensitive species or  8  habitat (USFWS, 2014).   The Air Force has notified the Florida State Historic Preservation  9  Officer (SHPO), Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), and Native American tribes  in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).   A list of  11  agencies and tribes contacted is provided in Appendix B, Public and Agency Involvement, while  12  ESA  and  NHPA  consultation  documentation  is  provided in Appendix C,  Consultation  13  Documentation.  All completed NHPA consultation documents, including responses and  14  findings from cultural resource consultation agencies, will be provided in the Final EIS.  1.8 DOCUMENT FORMAT 16 This document consists of 13 chapters and nine appendices: 17 • The Executive Summary provides a summary of information in this EIS. 18 • Chapter 1, Purpose and Need, provides background information and identifies the 19 purpose and need for the Proposed Action. • Chapter 2, Description of the Proposed Action and Alternatives, details the 21 Proposed Action and alternatives, discusses the alternative development process, and 22 summarizes the potential environmental impacts associated with the Proposed Action 23 and alternatives. 24 • Chapter 3, Affected Resource Assessment, identifies the resources potentially affected by the different components of the Proposed Action, discusses regulatory 26 drivers and impact assessment methodologies associated with each resource area, 27 and provides a general analysis of impacts to each resource area resulting from 28 Proposed Action components. 29 • Chapter 4, Emitter Sites Affected Environment/Environmental Consequences, provides site-specific resource inventories and impact analyses associated with use of 31 emitters under the Proposed Action. 32 • Chapter 5, Blackwater River State Forest Affected Environment/Environmental 33 Consequences, provides site-specific resource inventories and impact analyses of 34 potential impacts associated with proposed training activities at BRSF. • Chapter 6, Tate’s Hell State Forest Affected Environment/Environmental 36 Consequences, provides site-specific resource inventories and impact analyses of 37 potential impacts associated with proposed training activities at THSF. 38 • Chapter 7, Cumulative Impacts, discusses the potential cumulative impacts 39 associated with the Proposed Action and past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions at BRSF, THSF, and within a regional context. • Chapter 8, No Action Alternative Impact Analysis, assesses potential impacts associated with implementation of the No Action Alternative. • Chapter 9, Other NEPA Considerations, discusses the relationship between short-term use and long-term productivity, irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources, energy requirements and conservation potential of alternatives and mitigation measures, and natural or depletable resource requirements and conservation potential. • Chapter 10, References • Chapter 11, List of Preparers • Chapter 12, Index • Chapter 13, Glossary • Appendices o Appendix A, Printable Maps o Appendix B, Public and Agency Involvement o Appendix C, Consultation Documentation o Appendix D, Air Quality o Appendix E, Earth Resources o Appendix F, Cultural Resources o Appendix G, NEPA Disclosure Statement o Appendix H, Noise o Appendix I, Memoranda of Agreement This page is intentionally blank. 2. DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED ACTION AND ALTERNATIVES 2  2.1 INTRODUCTION  3  The Proposed Action consists of two main components: establishment and use of emitter  4  training sites on GRASI partner lands and applying to the FFS and FWC to be a permitted user  of the northwest Florida state forests for nonhazardous training activities.  This Proposed  6  Action may not provide the most comprehensive solution for all training needs, as described  7  in Sections 1.3 and 1.4. Should other partnerships identify additional training locations, they  8  will be considered in conjunction with the appropriate level of additional NEPA analysis. At  9  this time, no other suitable training locations have been identified as potentially available for  use and no other elements of the GLI proposal have adequate project definition to warrant  11  inclusion in this EIS. This chapter describes the alternative development/screening process  12  and alternatives considered but not carried forward, details the Proposed Action and No  13  Action Alternative, and summarizes impacts to the human and natural environment  14  associated with the Proposed Action as identified in Chapters 3 through 6.  2.2 ALTERNATIVE SCREENING PROCESS/ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BUT NOT  16  CARRIED FORWARD  17  The process for identifying potential locations for emitter sites and training involved three  18  steps: (1) identifying requirements, (2) coordination with state agencies, and (3) evaluation of  19  locations.  2.2.1 Identifying Requirements with Selection Standards  21  To optimize use of public lands, land considered for the GLI must consist of existing state  22  lands that would be compatible with military training. The military use proposed as part of  23  the initiative would not require full-time dedicated military land use nor would it warrant the  24  public cost of funding a new military land acquisition.  Throughout 2011 and 2012, staff from the 96th Test Wing met with military operators  26  (primarily AFSOC, the Joint Strike Fighter operators, and the 7 SFG) to identify basic  27  requirements for conducting nonhazardous operations off the Eglin Range. User groups  28  identified the types of training that would be potentially conducted under the Proposed  29  Action, based on current operations on the Eglin Range and the requirements needed to  conduct the training.  The following requirements for training sites were identified: (a) sites  31  must be located within a 1.5-hour drive (100 nautical miles) or 1-hour flight time (150  32  nautical miles) from Eglin AFB/Hurlburt Field to allow for day-trip training missions; (b) land  33  area must be large enough to conduct DoD training events (preferably 15 square kilometers);  34  (c) land must have available roads and infrastructure for access; (d) training sites should  require minimal to no improvements; (e) area must have available aircraft landing areas that  36  require minimal to no improvements.  1  For radar emitters (see Section 2.3.1), the following requirements (in order of importance)  2  were identified: (a) must be within 2.5 to 3 hours driving distance from Eglin AFB to allow for  3  day-trip mission activity and maintenance; (b) must be at least 0.75 acre in size to  4  accommodate equipment; (c) must be accessible via improved roadways; (d) must be able to  accommodate adequate line of sight (LOS) (e.g., not surrounded by tall trees or utility  6  poles/wires) with minimal improvements; (e) must be able to accommodate utility,  7  communication, and security infrastructure (e.g., power, landlines/fiber optics) with minimal  8  improvements; (f) should not be in close proximity to populated areas to minimize safety  9  concerns and disturbance.  2.2.2 Coordination with State Agencies  11  After site/training requirements were identified, the Air Force met with state land owners and  12  managers, including the Northwest Florida Water Management District (NWFWMD), Florida  13  Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), Florida Park Service, FFS, and the FWC.  14  Through an iterative process consisting of several meetings and discussions with GRASI  partners, the agencies identified particular state lands suitable for training areas and more  16  than 70 potential emitter training sites, which met the minimum DoD requirements for  17  training.  GRASI partner sites that met the DoD training criteria included the BRSF and THSF.   18  In the future, partner organizations and locations would be considered if they are determined  19  to be capable of supporting DoD’s training needs. Use of any additional areas in the future  would be subject to the appropriate level of additional NEPA analysis.  21  2.2.3 Evaluation of Locations  22  The 70 potential emitter training sites (shown in Figure 2-1) were evaluated by the Air Force  23  on a site-specific basis to determine the “best fit” based on the previously discussed emitter  24  requirements.  Sites were ranked based on their compatibility with the requirements  identified; and these 70 sites were narrowed down to the 12 sites identified and assessed in  26  this EIS.  The remaining sites were not carried forward as alternatives because they did not  27  meet one or more of the requirements.  28  With regard to nonhazardous training sites, BRSF and THSF were the only potential sites  29  identified by state agencies currently in a partnership agreement under GRASI with the Air  Force that met the selection standards. Both locations meet all of the identified  31  requirements, with the exception of THSF exceeding the 1.5-hour drive time from Eglin  32  AFB/Hurlburt Field.  However, the location is within the 1-hour flight time, so it has been  33  carried forward as an alternative. Due to driving distance, THSF would be used infrequently  34  for ground training. Figure 2-2 shows a map of lands managed by GRASI partners, as well as  other state and federal lands that fall within 150 nautical miles of Eglin AFB and Hurlburt  36  Field.  As the map shows, the only GRASI partner lands of suitable size for training currently  37  available to support DoD’s training needs are located within THSF and BRSF.  No other viable  38  alternatives for auxiliary training sites were available that met the requirements identified  39  previously; thus, no other alternatives were carried forward for consideration in this EIS.  Figure 2-1.  Potential Emitter Sites Figure 2-2.  Federal and State Lands Within  150-Nautical Mile Radius of Eglin AFB  1  2.2.4 Alternatives Considered but Not Carried Forward for Full Analysis  2  The Air Force initially considered a wide array of alternatives for supporting DoD training land  3  and airspace needs. Alternatives that did not meet the selection standards or minimum  4  criteria for meeting DoD mission requirements were not carried forward for analysis.  These  5  alternatives included the following:  6  • A) Reducing the amount of testing activity on military ranges to accommodate more  7  training on existing DoD lands. Testing activities at the Eglin Range Complex and  8  other DoD installations in the GRASI region are critical activities needed to determine  9  combat effectiveness and capability of DoD systems and equipment.  A reduction in  10  testing could jeopardize the effectiveness of military weapons systems and  11  equipment, as well as the safety and well-being of DoD military members. This  12  alternative was, therefore, not carried forward for consideration, as it would not allow  13  the military to fully meet its training and testing needs.  14  • B) Establishing partnerships with federal landowners to support the GLI.  A national  15  agreement exists between the Department of Agriculture and DoD regarding general  16  use of national forest land for military training. However, the U.S. Forest Service (USFS)  17  and the Air Force have not developed an agreement under the GRASI Strategic Plan to  18  develop suitable training areas at this time. While this may be an option for future  19  training proposals, it is not within the timing and scope of the current proposal.  The  20  Air Force would have to review all of the training requirements and develop a  21  proposal designed for national forest land in light of the legal requirements applicable  22  under all federal laws to those lands.  Then it would still need to work with USFS to  23  identify areas that might be suitable in terms of meeting appropriate selection  24  standards tailored to all of those requirements. This process would require additional  25  time and resources to develop a proposal that could be meaningfully evaluated.  If and  26  when the USFS and the Air Force are able to identify national forest lands that may be  27  available for conducting nonhazardous training, such a proposal would be  28  appropriately evaluated and considered, including a full evaluation of the potential  29  environmental impacts.  • C) Purchasing additional dedicated DoD range lands.  The purchase of new lands to support the Proposed Action does not meet the purpose and need for the GLI proposal. Under the GLI, the Air Force does not require a constantly available, fully dedicated, exclusive military use range. The nonhazardous training requirements do not justify such an acquisition, in part because there is no need for permanent construction.  Since this training would be compatible with other land use activity, it can be conducted on the lands managed by state agencies that have developed agreements under GRASI with the Air Force. DoD and Air Force policy requires the Air Force to pursue a lesser interest in land rather than absolute ownership (fee simple title) when the requirement for the use of land would be limited in time or intermittent, as is the case with the Air Force's GLI proposal (DoDI 4165.71; AFI 32-9001).  Prior to pursuing any purchase of land for training purposes, the Air Force would have to determine that the requirement cannot be satisfied by securing permission to use state or other lands through a long-term, nominal, or low-cost lease or to periodically use such lands under a license or permit. In addition to being unnecessary, acquiring ownership of the property would be too expensive. The process to acquire and establish a new military training range is typically lengthy (5 to 7 years) and resource intensive.  Additionally, any land areas purchased would require a significant amount of overhead funding for management, in terms of administration, security, and infrastructure development. To support nonhazardous training that is compatible with other land use, the purchase of land for a new, dedicated military range would not be an efficient use of resources, consistent with the GRASI Strategic Plan, or cost-effective, particularly during a period of drastic federal budget reductions. • D) Develop additional GRASI partnerships and conduct training outside of the 100-to 150-nautical mile geographic range established by the DoD training community. While there are certainly additional existing GRASI partner lands across the region that could be utilized to support training, if such lands are too remote, then too much training time would be lost in transit to access these areas.  Time is a precious commodity for military trainers. The requirement to spend more than a few hours to get to and from a training area would limit the overall utility of the training location and would not support the DoD training objectives to provide trained and ready forces.  Too much training time would be lost transporting units and equipment to the training site.  Additionally, the further sites are from a unit’s primary basing location, the higher the day-to-day operational costs to train and provide logistical support.  As was stated in Chapter 1, additional GRASI partnerships will be pursued.  If additional partnerships are established that meet the purpose and need in light of DoD selection standards to implement training, then alternatives for GRASI may be developed and evaluated. At this time, no other GRASI partner organizations have entered into an agreement with DoD to identify suitable training areas on lands managed by such organizations. • E) The training capacity of each state forest individually, and in fact, both state forests together still does not fully meet the training requirements identified as part of the GRASI planning process. Therefore, while the operating flexibility of having both 1 forests helps reduce scheduling issues and provides more flexibility for conducting 2 ground training, it still does not completely resolve the anticipated future capacity 3 issues identified by the GRASI airspace model.  Therefore, utilization of each forest as 4 its own alternative was considered but not carried forward, because one forest alone 5 would not support the purpose and need of the Proposed Action. 6 2.3 PROPOSED ACTION 7 2.3.1 Emitter Sites A component of the Proposed Action is to establish up to 12 radar, telemetry, and emitter training sites throughout northwest Florida to support development of a simulated IADS to be used for air training.  Under this training scenario, aircrew would be operating in already-established military SUA, normally at high altitudes. Radar and telemetry emitters are used for tracking aircraft and navigation; training emitters are radar simulator systems designed to help train military personnel to identify and counter enemy missile or artillery threats from Kineto Tracking Mount Emitter land or sea.  The simulated IADS would utilize land, air, and sea space across the Florida panhandle, southern Alabama, and the waters of the Gulf of Mexico to provide a training venue that could be tailored to specific training scenarios. The Eglin Range simulated IADS would provide a well-designed, mutually supporting simulated training capable of providing balanced air defense coverage for detection and engagement across the northwest Florida airspace for all altitudes. One system would provide coverage for another where gaps in coverage are determined. The simulated IADS would provide a Emitter 31 unique, viable, and robust training challenge for 32 United States (U.S.) and coalition assets seeking to assess system and aircrew performance. 33 34 Types of emitters would vary depending on need, and 35 their use would be determined by constraints associated 36 with the site and respective operational parameters of 37 the specific system; as an example, use of high-powered 38 systems with large safety hazard distances (SHDs) may 39 be restricted at sites in close proximity to populated 40 areas.  Typical radar and telemetry units would consist of 41 Kineto Tracking Mount (KTM) and Mobile Cinetheodolite 42 Mount (MCM) systems.  Typical training emitters used 43 would include emitters such as the joint threat emitter 44 (JTE). Joint Threat Emitter 1 Emitter training sites identified would utilize FFS and FWC lands via leasing agreements. 2 These sites would accommodate mobile and temporary use; mobile use means that the site 3 would be used for a day with operators on-site, while temporary use may last for several days. 4 Proposed locations are shown in Figure 2-3 through Figure 2-5.  Figure 2-3.  Location Overview of Proposed Emitter Sites Figure 2-4.  Regional View (West) of Proposed Emitter Sites Figure 2-5.  Regional View (East) of Proposed Emitter Sites 5 The majority of sites identified as part of the screening process 6 are associated with FFS fire-spotting towers, while two sites are 7 owned by FWC and one site by Eglin AFB.  All sites are either 8 “improved” or “semi-improved.” 9 Most can accommodate LOS requirements without 10 improvements; however, at two sites (FFS-8, FFS-9) some minor Typical Semi-improved 11 tree clearing/topping (less than 0.5 acres) would improve LOS. Emitter Site 12 Power generation at each site would be provided either by 13 generator or connection to available utilities. Some sites have available fencing, while others 14 do not and may require fencing if used as a “temporary” site. Any improvements would need 15 to be coordinated with the land owners and identified as part of the lease agreements. 1  Not all proposed sites may be used, and only several at any one time would be operational.  2  Table 2-1 summarizes the proposed emitter locations and their associated details.  In the  3  future, additional potential emitter sites may be proposed at sites required to enhance  4  training in support of new and emerging training requirements.  Potential new sites would be  5  evaluated in the same fashion as those identified in Section 2.2 and would be subject to  6  additional NEPA analyses.  7  Table 2-1.  Summary of Emitter Types and Proposed Locations  FFS = Florida Forest Service; FS = Forestry Site; LOS = line of sight  8  2.3.2  Training Activities in Northwest Florida State Forests  9  Training activities associated with the Proposed Action consist of utilizing existing areas  10  cleared by the FFS as part of regular forest management activities for helicopter landing and  1  drop zones, use of existing airfields and roadways for aircraft landings, and a number of  2  different land and air training activities. These activities currently occur in the areas between  3  designated test/training sites on the Eglin Range and are evaluated in detail in the Interstitial  4  Area Range Final Environmental Assessment Revision 2 (U.S. Air Force, 2013c).   The Air Force  5  proposes to create flexibility by obtaining the necessary permits and leases to use public  6  lands when available for these activities.  Specifically, two state forests in northwest Florida,  7  BRSF and THSF, would be leased through agreements with FFS (Figure 1-2).  For the purposes  8  of this EIS, each state forest has been divided into “tactical areas” (TAs), which correlate to  9  each state forest recreational area as shown in Figure 2-6 and Figure 2-7.   While the FFS  10  further segments each recreational area into smaller management units, this EIS uses the TA  11  level to provide a cohesive, holistic overview of training and associated impacts.  This  12  information can be used for TA and management unit scheduling, as well as future planning  13  and tiering as training locations change over time.  Training activities may occur in any of the  14  TAs, with consideration of restrictions identified via coordination with the FFS during the  15  planning process, as well as any constraints or mitigations identified in this EIS.  Figure 2-6.  BRSF Tactical Areas Figure 2-7.  THSF Tactical Areas 16 Training in the TAs would provide flexibility for those test/training units that are unable to 17 schedule time on the Eglin Range or in the RA due to other higher-priority activities or range 18 congestion. As anticipated growth in military missions continues, training in the TAs could 19 occur at frequencies described in Table 2-2 through Table 2-23. All training activities in the 20 state forests would be conducted per the requirements of Eglin AFB Instruction 21 (EAFBI) 13-212, Range Planning and Operations, Chapter 7 – Environmental Management 22 (December 2010, Interim Change on 9 September 2011), as applicable, and in accordance 23 with the respective state forest management plans.  EAFBI 13-212, Chapter 7 available at 24 http://grasieis.leidoseemg.com/documentation.aspx. 25 EAFBI 13-212, Chapter 7 identifies requirements for protection of natural and cultural 26 resources and waste management.  Additionally, training activities would implement, as 27 appropriate, the terms and conditions identified in the following documents (also available at 28 the above website): 29 • Eglin AFB Interstitial Range Area Biological Assessment (U.S. Air Force, 2012) • USFWS Interstitial Range Area Biological Opinion (USFWS, 2012) • Eglin AFB Red-Cockaded Woodpecker Programmatic Biological Opinion (USFWS, 2013) • Eglin AFB Riverine/Estuarine Programmatic Environmental Assessment (U.S. Air Force, 2004) • Eglin AFB Riverine/Estuarine Biological Assessment (U.S. Air Force, 2004) 30 31 As part of the Proposed Action, Eglin AFB would establish a Landscape Implementation Team (L.I.T.) and a GLI Liaison to coordinate with the FFS in the following capacities: • Developing real property leases/agreements • Developing and implementing a methodology for scheduling training activities • Identifying and implementing funding/reimbursement mechanisms to pay for leases/agreements • Identifying specific operating requirements (e.g., number and sizes of HLZs/drop zones [DZs] needed for a particular year) • Updating and revising training directives and safety procedures to make them applicable to each GLI training site to provide the same level of protections for these resources and their users as if these sites were subject to Eglin Range Complex requirements • Developing addendums/attachments to EAFBI 13-212 Chapter 7 for BRSF and THSF to identify environmental considerations detailed in this EIS • Ensuring compliance with EAFBI 13-212 Chapter 7, and appropriate environmental requirements All mitigations identified in the final Mitigation Plan would be incorporated into an operating agreement with the FFS. For all training activities, operators must adhere to respective state forest management plan requirements.  Such requirements include contacting the respective forest dispatch to identify campground activity for avoidance of inhabited recreational areas.  In addition, no substantive land disturbance (e.g., land clearing, construction, digging of pits) would be allowed, and personnel must collect all waste/used expendables.  These requirements are further detailed in Chapter 3 under the associated resource sections. Minor road improvements may be made to allow for austere aircraft operations in support of Fixed-Wing Aircraft Landing Sites (FWALS); however, these activities would occur in coordination with the FFS and follow FFS requirements. The main groups conducting training in the two state forests consist of multiple units organized under the AFSOC located at Hurlburt Field and the 7 SFG(A) located at Eglin AFB. Other groups may also utilize the BRSF and THSF intermittently as needed.  However, regardless of which groups use these areas for training, the activities, restrictions on use, and associated expendables would be the same. Training activities described under the Proposed Action are not mutually exclusive, and some training activities would occur in support of other activities or subsequent to other training activities.  An example would be a training mission involving several helicopters flying from Eglin AFB to a BRSF tactical area HLZ/DZ where personnel and equipment would be dropped via an Airdrop (AD) or a low-level insertion/extraction. Personnel may then conduct cross-country dismounted movement training to the Short-Term Offender Program (STOP) Camp or another HLZ, while along the way bivouacking, conducting communications and surveillance operations, and utilizing expendables. Once reaching their objective they would be extracted either via another low-level insertion/extraction or cross-country vehicle movement. Aircraft would use existing MOAs and controlled airspace, as is currently done, to maneuver between Eglin AFB and the state forests. As discussed in Sections 1.3 and 1.4, the goal of the GLI is to increase the military flexibility of the region. Use of the forests would take a phased approach, the frequency of use increasing gradually from minimal use up to higher use scenarios as outlined in this document as the administrative procedures for scheduling, control, and monitoring are implemented and the other mission activities at Eglin AFB increases. The intent for implementing GLI training would be to start slowly and increase nonhazardous training utilization of THSF or BRSF to acceptable levels that are compatible with and can be supported by the FFS.  Training would only be implemented to the extent that DoD units need the additional off-base training capacity to support nonhazardous activities. It is important to remember that new lands would not support full training utilization like dedicated military training ranges at Eglin AFB. Because of safety limitations and existing policy, activities using live fire and dudded munitions would not be conducted in proposed GLI training areas. Because of these limitations and increased travel times required to access BRSF and THSF, total use of THSF or BRSF is anticipated to be well below the utilization rates of dedicated military ranges, which are utilized up to 232 days per year. Training utilization rates would be further reduced during hunting season and other times when military use would not be compatible with existing land uses. While training utilization projections would be well below 232 days per year, it is difficult to predict just how frequently units would utilize GLI locations to support their training requirements.  Given this uncertainty, this EIS analysis evaluates impacts based on a “maximum-use scenario” that has been developed for each training activity.  Evaluation of this scenario ensures that impact characterizations are conservative and do not underrepresent potential impacts should there be an occasion where maximum potential use would occur.  Additionally, each maximum-use scenario is applied and analyzed for each forest in the event that one forest is unavailable for a certain type of training due to scheduling issues or other factors; this ensures that each forest is similarly treated in terms of potential impact.  These maximum-use scenarios are detailed in tables accompanying each activity description and are based on existing Eglin AFB usage within the Eglin Range.  Eglin typically operates 232 days per year, accounting for holidays, weekends, etc.  Numbers of personnel used during training activities typically range from 10 to 50 and may involve any number and type of vehicles. Personnel would travel to BRSF either by road or aircraft as part of training. Because of distance (150 to 200 miles depending on route taken), road travel to THSF would be infrequent, and most training activities would be associated with air transport of personnel and equipment to THSF tactical areas. The goal of the analyses in the EIS is to identify potential impact areas and identify constraints associated with their use as related to the training activities described in this chapter. The analyses identify 1) potential impacts associated with training activities, 2) areas that should be avoided for certain activities, and 3) any mitigations or management requirements needed to minimize adverse impacts.  The user constraints and mitigations would be used for planning and scheduling purposes by the L.I.T. in coordination with the FFS.  Avoidance and mitigation requirements would be communicated to the users prior to implementation of the activity. The following subsections detail proposed training activities.  These activities would be carried out by units of AFSOC, units of 7 SFG, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and support units, and 1 other DoD units.  Training activities discussed in this section and evaluated in the EIS would 2 be carried out as part of either small unit training events or larger regional training exercises, 3 such as AFSOC’s Emerald Warrior training exercise.  The Emerald Warrior exercise involves 4 both fixed-and rotary-wing aircraft operations, infiltration and exfiltration of 6-to 12-man 5 teams, airdrops, artillery targeting, and other activities that support special operations 6 requirements.  AFSOC and other joint service units may elect to conduct compatible 7 components of these training actions on THSF or BRSF as part of the GLI Proposed Action. 8 2.3.2.1 Helicopter Landing Zones/Drop Zones Existing cleared areas within the state forests would be utilized as landing sites for helicopters and DZs for personnel and equipment from various aircraft (either fixed or rotary wing).  Landing and drop activities would occur as part of the training activities discussed later in this chapter. HLZs are cleared areas that vary in size depending on the number and type of aircraft being used; a single CV-22 (Osprey) would need about an acre, while two CH-47s would need about 2.75 acres. 19 DZs can be as small as a semicleared 0.3-acre opening 20 or much larger, depending on the quantities/sizes of personnel and equipment being 21 dropped.  Both HLZs and DZs must be free of commonly used infrastructure (e.g., telephone 22 poles, electrical lines).  Several sites located throughout the state forests may be established 23 and utilized at any one time.  It is important to note that these sites would be open areas that 24 have already been cleared of tall vegetation by the FFS through regular forest management 25 activities; no additional land clearing would be necessary for the purpose of the GLI Proposed 26 Action.  While there may be a need for gravel surfaces for vehicle parking, no land 27 development or other improvements would be required by the Air Force.  For the most part, 28 HLZ/DZ locations may change over time based on open area availability and training needs 29 and would likely change from year to year through coordination and planning with the FFS. 30 In contrast, three “permanent” HLZs/DZs would be established near the hardened camp sites 31 at BRSF.  These particular HLZs/DZs would, similarly, not require any additional land clearing 32 or improvements.  These locations are discussed in Section 2.3.2.21.  Table 2-2 lists details of 33 HLZ/DZ activities. 34 Table 2-2.

Establishment, operations, and maintenance as part of regular FFS activities. 1 2.3.2.2 Fixed-Wing Aircraft Landing Sites 2 FWALS involves the use of existing airstrips and 3 dirt roadways for fixed-wing aircraft landings, 4 takeoffs, and touchdowns in support of training activities. 6 Proposed locations for aircraft operations on 7 BRSF and THSF are shown in Figure 2-8 through 8 Figure 2-13, respectively. 9 At BRSF, one existing airfield would be utilized (Munson Airfield, which is currently designated 11 for public use with no restrictions), and two dirt 12 roadways (one in TA-1 and one in TA-9) are 13 proposed for aircraft operations.  14 At THSF, three dirt roadways are proposed for FWALS in support of aircraft operations.  These 16 roadways are located in TA-2, -6, and -8.  17 Aircraft landing activities would be conducted 18 on existing cleared roadways of suitable slope 19 and grade for aircraft landing. Minimal construction would be needed to improve such 21 sites, and construction would mainly include 22 grading, widening, and vegetation clearance to 23 support operations. The roadway landing sites 24 would need to be approximately 30 feet wide by 2,000 feet long. There are two lateral 26 clearance zones associated with each landing 27 site, and the zones run the length of the 28 landing area.  Zone A, which is a graded area 29 (e.g., road shoulder), is 30.5 feet wide and must have no obstacles (e.g., trees and shrubs) 31 higher than 3 feet. Zone B is a 6-foot-wide 32 “maintained area” adjacent to Zone A and must 33 have obstacles no higher than 5 feet. 34 Following improvement of the sites, some maintenance activity would be necessary to grade roads and trim and maintain vegetation. This may be accomplished as part of regular forest 36 road management activities. 37 Road improvements such as widening or compacting may be necessary at each location; the 38 details of these improvements have not yet been identified.  Road widening would be limited 39 to existing shoulder areas and would not involve direct physical impacts to wetlands or surface waters.  There would be no paving or addition of impervious surface at any of the 41 proposed landing sites.  Any needed improvements would be coordinated with the FFS; such 1 improvements may not be approved or may require supplemental environmental impact 2 analysis. Figure 2-8.

At BRSF, noise-generating expendables 5 (e.g., blanks) would only be used at hardened camp 6 site locations (discussed in Section 2.3.2.21).  7 Simulated munitions (consisting of plastic pellets or 8 paintballs, which produce little or no noise) and 9 smoke grenades may be used during training 10 activities described in this chapter in approved areas 11 as discussed in Section 2.5.  At THSF, use of noise12 generating expendables could be used in approved 13 areas as identified in Section 2.5.  14 Exact quantities of expendables per training activity 15 are unavailable. However, the average annual total 16 quantity of expendables used on the Eglin Range in 17 interstitial areas was identified in the Interstitial Area 18 Range Final Environmental Assessment Revision 2 19 (U.S. Air Force, 2013c). That quantity was used as an 20 estimated annual average number of expendables Use of Blanks 21 potentially used under the Proposed Action.  This 22 would conform to the maximum-use scenario as discussed previously; actual numbers of 23 expendables would likely be considerably less, since the state forest areas would only be used 24 as needed. 25 Using the Eglin Range interstitial area expendable amounts, an estimate of expendables has 26 been determined for a single training event based on the number of training events utilizing 27 expendables and associated potential frequency of occurrence; however, expendables may 28 not be used during every event. The overall total number of expendables, regardless of how 29 many events occur in a year, would not exceed the estimated annual quantity.

Aircraft would fly from the  4  surface to approximately 3,000 feet above ground level (AGL) 90 percent of the time and up  5  to 10,000 feet AGL the remaining 10 percent of the time based on training requirements.  6  Table 2-5 lists details of LAPT activities.  7  Table 2-5.

Each helicopter would spend between 30 minutes and 2 hours conducting training activities before returning to the base. About 50 percent of the aircraft’s time is spent flying patterns: 40 percent of that time consists of circling or other pattern work within an approximately 1-mile radius of the HLZ; 10 percent of the time is spent running upwind/downwind patterns or other pattern work within a 2-mile radius of the HLZ.  7 8 9 10 11 12  The remaining 50 percent of the aircraft’s time is spent at the HLZ.  About 80 percent of this time, the aircraft hovers (stationary) at different altitudes depending on the training activity for personnel: 75 feet AGL for practicing hover or rappel activities from the aircraft, between 45 and 35 feet AGL for fast ropes, and at 15 feet AGL for rope ladders.  The remaining 20 percent of time at the HLZ, the aircraft is stationary on the ground with engines running and rotors turning.  13 14  Night operations make up about 50 percent of total sorties, with approximately 20 percent occurring after 10:00 pm.  There is typically no flying on weekends or holidays.  15  2.3.2.6  Temporary Combat Support Areas  TCSA Activity  16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25  Temporary Combat Support Areas (TCSAs) involve set up of logistical and medical tents and equipment around HLZs/DZs and FWALS in support of training activities. Activities include loading/unloading of supplies, set up of tents and other equipment, and providing logistics support and medical treatment of simulated casualties. This may also include use of temporary defensive positions (e.g., sandbag bunkers); digging of foxholes or latrines would not occur.  Table 2-7 lists details of TCSA activities.  26  Table 2-7.

Aircraft would 5 fly at 1,250 feet AGL for static line drops and up to 25,000 feet AGL 6 for free fall drops depending on personnel and equipment type/requirements. Table 2-8 lists details of AD activities.  During an AD, the aircraft typically makes first contact at the DZ, flying between 500 to 1,000 feet AGL, conducts the drop, and then moves to orbit at 5,000 feet AGL, typically offset from the DZ by about 5 to 10 miles with run-in typically at 130 KIAS.

Additionally, EAFBI 13-212 (Chapter 8) requires this activity only be conducted on hardened surfaces and there would be no hardened surface development at either forest.  This activity will likely only occur at local airports in the vicinity of the forests.  FARP/HGO activity is included in the EIS, as the Air Force might need to conduct this activity at BRSF under emergency circumstances. The Air Force currently conducts these activities on Eglin airfields and at other airports local to THSF.  9  2.3.2.10  Cross-Country Dismounted Movements  Cross-Country Dismounted Movements (CCDMs) involve the movement of operators (i.e., personnel) on foot across land areas from one location to another as part of simulated assault and reconnaissance training activities.  CCDM may occur on or off roads or on unimproved trails.  CCDM may also include crossing of streams and wetland areas.

As use of the Eglin Range increases, these  4  conflicts would become more frequent and problematic. Activities at BRSF, THSF, and the  5  various proposed emitter sites would continue as described in the respective state forest  6  management plans.  7  2.5 GENERAL OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS  8  In the context of this document, General Operational Constraints are actions inherent to the  9  Proposed Action (and therefore not technically mitigations), and Proposed Resource-Specific  10  Mitigations are those identified through impact analysis within this EIS to minimize potentially  11  adverse impacts. Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations are discussed in Section 2.7.  12  All training activities in the state forests would be conducted, as applicable, per the  13  requirements of EAFBI 13-212 (Chapter 7, Environmental Management), in accordance with  14  the respective state forest management plans and, as appropriate, the terms and conditions  15  identified in the GRASI Landscape Initiative Biological Assessment (included in Appendix C),  16  Interstitial Area Range Final Environmental Assessment Revision 2, the Interstitial Area Biological  17  Assessment, Eglin AFB Red-Cockaded Woodpecker Programmatic Biological Opinion, and the  18  Eglin AFB Riverine/Estuarine Biological Assessment. Each of these documents is available for  19  reference at http://grasieis.leidoseemg.com/documentation.aspx.  20  Documentation resulting from consultation with the Florida SHPO and the USFWS regarding  21  this Proposed Action is provided in Appendix C, Consultation Documentation.   22  As discussed previously, all the activities under the Proposed Action currently occur on the  23  Eglin Range, and have been evaluated under the documents mentioned previously. In order  24  to ensure that all General Operational Constraints are identified and adhered to by training  25  units, Eglin AFB’s environmental management program has developed “Protection Levels” for  26  areas on the Eglin Range that are utilized for ground training activities; these use levels are  27  based on General Operational Constraints and are integral to environmental resource  28  protection. Under the Proposed Action, the Air Force would utilize a similar system tailored  29  for BRSF and THSF; use levels for the Proposed Action are described in Table 2-24 and are  30  applicable to all training locations within the boundaries of the state forests.  Activity outside  31  the boundaries of the state forests is limited to use of public roadways for transportation.  32  Table 2-24.

Dismounted maneuver and incidental and consumptive land disturbance. Not Approved: use of smokes, flares, or simulators; off-road vehicle use – all vehicles must remain on established roads; land development and point land disturbance outside of previously disturbed roadbeds and road shoulders.

No refueling of vehicles or aircraft allowed.  100 feet around wetlands, water bodies and floodplains; areas exhibiting very limiting soil characteristics (e.g., susceptible to erosion) for HLZ and/or bivouacking; cultural resource areas with inadequate surveys and/or “not cleared” areas; Tate’s Hell Camp Gordon Johnson Historic District  Limited Use-2 (LU-2)  Approved Activities: use of pyrotechnics (e.g., smoke grenades and GBSs) and non-lethal small arms ammunition such as blanks and paintballs (at BRSF approved for smoke grenades and paintballs only, with GBSs permitted only at hardened camp sites) – see GLI Noise Protection Levels Map for further restrictions on noise-generating expendables.  Dismounted maneuver.  Incidental, point, and consumptive land disturbance (includes catholes) outside of previously disturbed roadbeds and road shoulders if approved by FFS. LZ/DZ use only on approved FFS sites with FFS coordination required for any additional land disturbance – see Noise Protection Levels Map for further restrictions on LZ/DZ use. Refueling of vehicles or aircraft allowed only on asphalt or concrete surfaces. Not Approved: off-road vehicle use – all vehicles must remain on established roads.  All areas not covered by other protection levels  BRSF = Blackwater River State Forest; DZ = drop zone; FFS = Florida Forest Service; FNAI = Florida Natural Areas Inventory; GBS = ground burst simulator; GLI = Gulf Regional Airspace Strategic Initiative (GRASI) Landscape Initiative; HLZ= helicopter landing zone; LU-1 = Limited Use-1; LU-2 = Limited Use-2; LZ = landing zone; RCW = red-cockaded woodpecker; THSF = Tate’s Hell State Forest As stated previously, General Operational Constraints are inherent to the Proposed Action, in that they are considered components of the Proposed Action’s implementation.  As an example, a 200-foot activity buffer around identified red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW) cavity trees is a requirement of EAFBI 13-212.  Just as CCDM at BRSF and THSF is a component of the Proposed Action, so too is the requirement to maintain a 200-foot activity buffer around RCW trees at either BRSF or THSF since EAFBI 13-212 would be a component of the Proposed Action.  Impact analysis in this EIS considers these requirements as part of the initial impact assessment.  Thus, analysis of impacts to the RCW considers the implementation of the 200foot activity buffer in the initial impact assessment; if potentially adverse impacts are identified, then Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations were developed to minimize or avoid this potential. Summarized below are the General Operation Constraints that would be implemented as part of the Proposed Action. General Operational Constraints All training activities are required to stay within the defined boundaries of the respective state forests.  Ground activity outside the forest boundaries (e.g., adjacent land parcels, inholdings) is limited to transportation on public roadways. Prior to implementation of the Proposed Action, the Air Force will: 1) Develop a Mitigation Plan identifying Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations to be implemented, responsible parties for mitigation implementation and compliance evaluation, and monitoring mechanisms for evaluation of mitigation effectiveness. 2) Establish an L.I.T. composed of appropriate Eglin agencies and disciplines to coordinate with apposite Eglin agencies and the FFS. The L.I.T. will provide oversight to ensure the following requirements are implemented and the required supporting processes are established for implementation prior to performing any missions identified in the GLI on identified state forest lands: a) Develop real property leases/agreements that incorporate the operational constraints and mitigations identified in this EIS. b) Develop and implement a methodology for scheduling training activities, through existing Eglin organizations, that incorporates operational constraints and mitigations identified in this EIS and addresses any violations of the mitigation plan, including enforcement. c) Develop and implement a methodology to identify specific training areas and corridors prior to ground operations to allow for any natural or cultural resource surveys and protection measures that may be necessary (i.e., RCW surveys). d) Develop and implement a methodology, through coordination with appropriate Eglin agencies and disciplines, for pre-and post-mission surveys of action areas to identify extent of environmental impact to training areas and adjustment of constraints and mitigations as necessary. e) Identify and implement funding/reimbursement mechanisms to pay for leases/agreements and surveys (i.e., pre/post surveys for damage to sensitive species/habitats). 1  f)  Identify specific operating requirements (e.g., number and sizes of HLZs/DZs needed  2  for a particular year).  3  g) Update and revise training directives and safety procedures to make them applicable  4  to each GLI training site to provide the same level of protections for these resources  5  and their users as if these sites were subject to Eglin Range Complex requirements.  6  h) Develop addendums/attachments to EAFBI 13-212 Chapter 7 for BRSF and THSF to  7  identify environmental considerations detailed in this EIS.  8  i)  Ensure compliance with EAFBI 13-212 Chapter 7 and appropriate environmental  9  requirements by identifying the proper Eglin AFB organizations responsible for  10  management of each constraint and mitigation, and ensuring the responsible  11  organization has executed the intent of the applicable requirement.  12  3) Through various existing program offices and current practices, Eglin AFB, with user group  13  support, will:  14  a)  Develop forest-specific guidance  on  environmental  restrictions  and compliance  15  requirements, to include mitigations and operational constraints identified in this EIS  16  and associated consultations (i.e., environmental briefings, EAFBI 13-212 addendum).  17  b)  Coordinate with the FFS to identify time and area constraints for training activities  18  (e.g., avoidance of specific hunting seasons and associated areas) and incorporate  19  these constraints into unit training plans.  20  c)  Determine preferred locations for HLZs/DZs and FWALS, as well as preferred routings  21  for use, by incorporating the noise constraints identified in Table 2-25 into the  22  “aeromapping” system (discussed in Section 3.3, Noise) to identify overflight constraint  23  areas in support of avoiding adverse noise impacts to the public and sensitive species.  24  d)  Determine restrictions on noise-generating expendable use for proposed training  25  activities by incorporating the noise constraints identified in Table 2-25 into each  26  operational training plan to identify noise constraint areas in support of avoiding  27  adverse noise impacts to the public and sensitive species.  28  Table 2-25.  Noise Protection Levels for Proposed Action Operations  Protection Level  Restrictions  Area Covered  Not Approved for HLZs/DZs  No HZLs or DZs permitted.  2,200-foot buffer around camp sites/recreational sites and in/out parcels with residential structures.  RCW Air Operations Buffer  No aircraft operations permitted.  500-foot buffer around RCW trees.  Not Approved for Overflights below 500 feet AGL  No overflights below 500 feet AGL  200-foot buffer around camp sites/recreational sites and in/out parcels with residential structures.  Not Approved for Noise Generating Expendables  No noise generating expendable use allowed; includes blanks and GBSs.  4,000-foot buffer around camp sites/recreational sites and in/out parcels with residential structures.  AGL = above ground level; DZ = drop zone; HLZ = helicopter landing zone; RCW = red-cockaded woodpecker  29  e)  Provide both a visual and written presentation of restrictions as presented in this EIS to  30  unit commanders and training personnel. This can be accomplished through Eglin AFB  Range Safety and Operations Procedures (RSOP) annual briefings, additional site-specific environmental briefings (i.e., BRSF and THSF), and/or through the Eglin AFB Center Scheduling Enterprise (CSE). f) Track briefings, inspections, restrictions, and reports for regulators in accordance with current Eglin procedures. g) Provide ground training units with global positioning system (GPS) coordinates for current RCW buffers. h) Document and resolve any issues related to environmental compliance with the FFS upon notice of any compliance issues. i) Establish a process for notification of locally affected residents prior to training operations. j) Ensure the NOTAM process is utilized for use of FWALS (particularly Munson Airfield) to avoid conflicts with other aviators. k) Establish a submittal, response, and resolution process for local residences to submit complaints or other compliance issues to Eglin AFB.  This can be accomplished through Eglin’s Public Affairs Office. l) Coordinate with the FFS to periodically review and update the affected environment condition of each Proposed Action location and update as necessary the operational constraints and/or mitigations identified in this EIS, as well as any of the GLI Protection Level maps if required. m) Monitor conditions of high-use training areas, including the hardened camp sites, HLZs/DZ, and FWALS to ensure areas are not overused (e.g., show signs of degradation or adverse impact) and do not expand beyond established boundaries. n) Ensure units and operators utilizing emitters are aware of approved site locations for any potentially hazardous emitters. o) Evaluate emitter sites on a regular basis to ensure compatibility with safety requirements identified in this EIS. p) In addition to close examination of the area around proposed new training locations for protected/sensitive species, survey the areas surrounding existing training areas every two years to ensure that no new noise-sensitive land uses have been established. q) Ensure all proposed training activities are within the scope of this EIS. A new AF Form 813 for alterations in the location, timing, or type of activities involved in training operations is required if not previously approved or within the scope of this EIS. r) If an activity has the potential to create significant soil disturbance, a gopher tortoise survey will be completed prior to the activity.  If a gopher tortoise burrow is found during the survey and cannot be avoided, then the tortoise would be relocated in accordance with FWC protocols. Before Training 4) Prior to any training activities, Unit personnel must be cognizant of environmental restrictions by: a) Scheduling through Eglin AFB. b) Review the GLI Protection Level maps prior to mission initiation and incorporate RAs into field maps as necessary, particularly for those areas not marked in the field (i.e., RCW buffers and other sensitive species).  Units will acquire RCW buffer locations from Eglin AFB and either load these into the GPS devices or add to field maps. c) Coordinate with Eglin AFB to schedule an in-briefing on environmental restrictions for Commanders, student trainers, and operational unit personnel prior to first time training at the emitter sites, BRSF and THSF; then at least annually thereafter. d) Coordinate the transport, storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials and waste with Eglin AFB. e) Coordinate with the Eglin AFB Cultural Resources Section for compliance with the Cultural Resource Landscape Initiative Programmatic Agreement, which identifies requirements for certain activities (i.e., ground-disturbing activities) within the prohibited, restricted, and limited use areas as indicated on the GLI Protection Level maps.  Avoidance of these areas is preferred, as activities in these areas may require archaeological survey, mitigations, and consultation with the SHPO.  Once training corridors are identified, these areas must be surveyed for RCW cavity trees before training can begin.  Coordinate with Eglin Natural Resources to ensure that any necessary species surveys are completed prior to ground operations. f) Units must ensure environmental restrictions are communicated to unit personnel that have a ground training requirement, including students, in verbal or written form prior to first time training on BRSF and THSF. g) Conduct maintenance and refueling of aircraft, vehicles, and watercraft at Eglin AFB/Hurlburt Field prior to transport to training areas. During Training 5) During training activities, each unit will adhere to the following constraints: a) Follow restrictions shown on the Protection Levels map (as defined in Table 2-24), and all applicable restrictions detailed in EAFBI 13-212. b) Restrict training to only those tactical training areas, landing/drop zones, and FWALS scheduled by Eglin AFB. c) Per the FFS, during hunting season only night operations are allowed. Night operations may only occur from 2 hours after sunset to 2 hours before sunrise. The GLI Liaison, in coordination with the FFS, will identify associated time constraints on an annual basis. d) In the event of unexpected discovery of cultural resources, cease activity in the immediate vicinity; notify the GLI Liaison and Eglin AFB. e) Leave any artifacts visible on the ground in place; notify the GLI Liaison and Eglin AFB. f) If personnel encounter soil that is discolored or has a chemical odor, immediately cease activity in the area; notify the GLI Liaison and Eglin AFB. g) Fueling of vehicles and aircraft is allowed only in LU-2 areas over asphalt or concrete. h) Immediate response is required for petroleum, oil, and lubricant (POL) spills. Appropriate containment (e.g., drip pans and secondary containment) during refueling operations and spill response actions, including reporting requirements and disposal, are required. POL products cannot be directed to sewer systems or impervious surfaces (such as grass). i) All spills and accidental discharges of petroleum, oils, lubricants, chemicals, hazardous waste or hazardous materials, regardless of the quantity, will be reported. A spill discharge report must be filled out, and the responsible party must provide this spill report to the GLI Liaison and Eglin AFB as soon as possible. Any fire or spill that poses a threat to life, health, or the environment will be reported immediately to the FFS on-site coordinator and to the Eglin AFB Fire Department. The Air Force will also set up Mutual Aid Agreements with the closest fire departments. If the Fire Department declares an emergency condition, they may take control of the situation, including the tasking of the organization’s response detail. Spills over 25 gallons are required to be reported to FDEP (through the GLI Liaison). j) If any federally or state-listed species is found dead or injured, immediately notify the GLI Liaison and Eglin AFB. k) If an indigo snake, gopher tortoise, or black bear is sighted, allow the animal to leave the area undisturbed; notify the GLI Liaison and Eglin AFB. l) Comply with hunting, trapping and fishing regulations as identified by the FFS. The GLI Liaison must coordinate with the FFS to determine any licenses required, take limits, or activities occurring out of season. m) Do not cut down any trees, for any reason. Do not use sensitive vegetation (e.g., protected species) as part of natural resource consumption. Confer with GRASI Liaison and Eglin Natural Resources Section to identify protected vegetation. n) Follow Management Guidelines for the Red-Cockaded Woodpecker on Army Installations (see Eglin AFB Red-Cockaded Woodpecker Programmatic Biological Opinion, 2013, Table 4-2). o) Activities within 200 feet of identified RCW trees will not exceed two hours. p) The GLI Liaison and Eglin AFB must be notified within 24 hours for the following occurrences: a. RCW cavity tree (including wildfire damage) is damaged to the point it is unsuitable for nesting or roosting. b. RCW cavity trees, cavity start trees or the surrounding soils are inadvertently damaged or disturbed during ground maneuvers. Dismounted Maneuver During dismounted maneuver, units will follow these constraints: q)  Follow restrictions identified in Table 2-24 and on the GLI Protection Level maps.  r)  Avoid concentrated troop movements on steep slopes and in wetlands.  s)  Do not step on, fill, or in any way cause a gopher tortoise burrow to collapse.  Land Disturbance t) Point land disturbance is authorized only in LU-2 areas.  Digging is only approved in these areas through coordination with the GLI Liaison and Eglin AFB prior to field activities. u) No land disturbance within 25 feet of gopher tortoise burrows. v) For approved dig activities, fill in holes once training is complete and cover them with pine straw and leaves. Wheeled Vehicles During mounted maneuver, units will follow these constraints: w) Follow restrictions identified in Table 2-24.  Keep vehicles, including ATVs, on established roads at all times – approved roadways are designated by the GLI Liaison and FFS. x) Do not enter Prohibited Areas: these are off-limits to all activities. y) Keep vehicles out of eroded areas, gullies and restoration sites and avoid driving on steep slopes due to erosion potential. z) Disposal/discharge of hazardous materials to the ground or in water is prohibited. Follow Eglin and/or FFS spill prevention and spill response procedures.

Damage must be assessed and necessary corrective  21  measures taken.  22  2.6 ALTERNATIVE IMPACT ANALYSIS SUMMARY  23  The following provides an impact summary of the analyses presented in Chapters 3, 4, 5,  24  and 6.  Details on each specific action and the potential impacts as related to the respective  location can be found in these chapters.  The significance of impacts was determined by  26  evaluating the context, intensity, and duration of the action (40 CFR 1508.27) and the relative  27  effect on individual resources. This process is further detailed in Chapter 3.  28  Impacts were evaluated with consideration of implementation of General Operational  29  Constraints inherent to the Proposed Action associated with EAFBI operational procedures  and other NEPA-related documents for similar actions occurring on the Eglin Range on similar  31  resources, as discussed previously in Section 2.3.2, Training Activities in Northwest Florida State  32  Forests.  General Operational Constraints are a prerequisite for implementing the Proposed  33  Action.  Once analyses were completed, additional Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations  34  were identified to avoid or minimize adverse impacts to impacted resources. All General  Operational Constraints were previously described in Section 2.5; all Proposed Resource 36  Specific Mitigations identified through analyses are provided in Section 2.7.  37  Significance of impacts is determined by considering how the Proposed Action interacts with  38  the various resources in terms of context, intensity, and duration as described in each  39  respective Chapter 3 resource section. Context can be analyzed in terms of society as a whole  1  (human, national), the affected region, the affected interests, and the locality. For instance, in  2  the case of a site-specific action, significance would usually depend upon the effects in the  3  locale rather than across a broad region.  4  Intensity refers to the severity of the identified impact, while duration considers the long-term  and short-term nature of the potential impact.  The impact analyses considers direct, indirect,  6  and cumulative impacts on resources along with how both beneficial and adverse impacts  7  affect public safety, the characteristics of the geographic area and proximity of the Proposed  8  Action to sensitive resources, the potential controversial nature of the potential impact,  9  whether possible effects are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks, whether  the action may establish a precedent for future actions with significant effects, cumulative  11  impacts, impacts to cultural resources or endangered species, and whether the Proposed  12  Action threatens to violate federal, state, or local laws or environmental protection  13  requirements.  Each of these aspects are addressed as appropriate in the applicable resource  14  area sections and chapters in this EIS. General criteria for impacts to resource/issue areas are  summarized below and are presented relative to individual resource/issue areas at each  16  proposed location in Table 2-26:  17  • Beneficial – Beneficial impacts may occur under any context, intensity, or duration.  18  These generally result in some benefit or overall improvement to the resource  19  impacted by the action. Such impacts may include a reduction in air emissions or  restoration of habitats; the scope of the impact is directly related to the context,  21  intensity, and duration of the impact.  Elimination of baseline air emissions or  22  restoration of large areas of disturbed wetland may be considered significant  23  beneficial impacts, while a small reduction in baseline air emissions or restoration of a  24  small pocket of wetlands may be considered beneficial but relatively insignificant.  Other than providing benefits to Air Force training capabilities, the Air Force has not  26  identified any significant or insignificant beneficial impacts under the Proposed  27  Action.  28  • Adverse – Adverse impacts generally result in detriment or degradation of the  29  impacted resource, the degree or level of impact directly related to the context,  intensity, and duration of the impact. The Air Force has identified the potential for  31  adverse impacts for several resource areas; resources experiencing potential adverse  32  impacts are shaded yellow in Table 2-26. Adverse impacts can either be significant or  33  insignificant.  34  o Significant – Physical aspects are easily perceptible, and typically endure over  the medium-to-long term, with a regional context and a high intensity;  36  however, significant impacts can occur potentially over the short term under  37  any context given a high intensity. Significant adverse impacts are typically not  38  recoverable over the short term, and require long term recovery processes with  39  extensive mitigation or revision of Proposed Action to avoid or minimize  impacts.  An example of a significant adverse impact would be destruction of  41  large percentages of wetland areas or degradation of water quality that may  42  affect human health and the environment.   1  o Insignificant – These impacts are typically short-to medium-term impacts  2  under any context or intensity. Beneficial impacts that are not significant in  3  nature may include restoration of small pockets of wetlands.  Adverse but not  4  significant impacts are typically recoverable over the short-to-medium term  with mitigations required to minimize level of impact or potential for impact,  6  the extent of mitigation dependent on the identified context and intensity of  7  the impact.  Examples of adverse impacts that are not significant may be short,  8  intermittent increases in noise to transient recreational users that do not affect  9  overall usability of the forest or the potential for localized, intermittent soil  erosion on stream banks due to troop movement over the land-water interface  11  during dismounted movements and amphibious operations. These are  12  recoverable impacts over the short term through Proposed Resource-Specific  13  Mitigations to avoid noise-sensitive areas for training in the case of noise  14  impacts and, for soil impacts, minimizing the size of troop units conducting  ground training activities, rotating land-water interface ingress/egress points,  16  and not using ingress/egress points that show signs of erosion.  17  • Neutral or No Effect – These are impacts that are typically of a low-intensity, such that  18  they are imperceptible regardless of context or duration.  Such impacts, whether  19  beneficial or otherwise, are recoverable over the short term without mitigation and  result in no overall perceptible change to the resource.  Resources experiencing  21  neutral or no effects are identified as “green” in Table 2-26.  22  Overall, the Air Force has not identified any significant beneficial or adverse impacts  23  associated with the Proposed Action.  While the Air Force has identified the potential for  24  adverse impacts to various resources, these impacts would be insignificant based on the  context, intensity, and duration of the identified impacts as described throughout  26  Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6.  Impacts to public health and safety would be either avoided or  27  minimized through implementation of operational constraints and mitigations.  Any  28  unique geographic characteristics (e.g., sensitive habitats, areas prone to erosion)  29  associated with the proposed emitter or training sites would be avoided, and any  potential adverse impacts to the quality of the human environment would be minimal  31  (mainly the potential for occasional annoyance to recreational users from noise).  There  32  are no unknown risks or impacts that may be considered controversial in nature  33  associated with emitter site use or training activities (such actions have been extensively  34  analyzed in this EIS and other Air Force documents as referenced in this EIS), and the  Proposed Action is not precedent setting because the DoD utilizes public lands  36  throughout the United States for both emitter sites and military training. Adverse impacts  37  to cultural resources and endangered species have been identified; however, these  38  impacts would also be minimized/mitigated through implementation of operational  39  constraints and mitigations as identified through consultation under the NHPA and the  ESA, respectively. Additionally, the use of emitter sites and conduct of training activities  41  would comply with all federal, state, and local laws.  Finally, the Air Force has not  42  identified any significant potential for cumulative impacts (as discussed in Chapter 7).  43  Therefore, based on the context, intensity, and duration of impacts identified in this EIS,  1  the Air Force has not identified significant beneficial or adverse impacts under the  2  Proposed Action.  3  The following section summarizes impacts for each resource area identified in yellow in  4  Table  2-26,  which  represents potential insignificant adverse impacts.   Resources  5  experiencing neutral or no effects are identified as “green” in Table 2-26 and are not  6  discussed in this summary.  More detail on all impacts can be found in the respective  7  resource-specific discussions provided in the associated sections by clicking on the links in  8  the table.  9  Table 2-26.  Summary of Impacts  10  Emitter Sites  11  The potential for adverse impacts has been identified at four proposed emitter sites.  Impacts  12  are associated with the emitter safety hazard distance (SHD) and proximity to inhabited FFS  13  administrative buildings, thus resulting in potential safety issues, land use conflicts, and  14  associated socioeconomic/environmental justice impacts at those particular sites.   However,  15  this impact can be avoided through mitigation actions described in Section 2.7.   16  Training Activities  17  Airspace Management  18  Airspace management impacts would be regional and would include some positive impacts  19  (i.e., reduced scheduling conflicts at Eglin Range) and some negative impacts (i.e., increased  20  air traffic in controlled and uncontrolled airspace over BRSF and THSF).   Impacts  on  21  scheduling and coordination  processes  would be  moderate.  Implementation  of  a  22  coordination process between the Air Force and FFS would avoid potential operational  23  conflicts that otherwise could have been considered severe.  Potential increases in scheduling  24  demand for SUAs over BRSF would be expected to be minor.  At THSF, although the number  25  of sorties using Tyndall MOAs would be expected to increase, about 50 percent of GLI training  operations would occur after sunset when the Tyndall MOAs are not active.  Impacts to ongoing operations would be expected to be minor as the proposed GLI training would not require blocking off a volume of airspace to be used exclusively by Air Force aircraft.  Other operations would be able to continue to transit the area while GLI training is under way. Impacts would last for the entire life of the action, as air traffic tempo over the state forests would remain slightly elevated for as long as GLI training continues to occur.  However, based on analysis of the context and intensity factors as described in Section 3.2.1.2, the Air Force has not identified any significant airspace-related impacts. Noise At BRSF, noise generating expendables would only be utilized at the STOP Camp and SRYA site.  At THSF, noise generating expendables may be used in areas that are not restricted according to operational constraints and mitigations.  Noise associated with aircraft operations and munitions use would result in annoyance to some recreational users and residences. However, based on analysis of the context and intensity factors as described in Section 3.3.1.2, implementation of operational constraints identified in Section 2.5, and identified Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations discussed in Section 2.7, the Air Force has not identified any significant noise impacts that would affect public health or safety.  Safety There is the potential for increased wildfire occurrences associated with training activities – wildfire occurrence could result in adverse impacts to several resource areas.  While the potential for increased wildfire occurrence probability cannot be completely avoided under implementation of the Proposed Action, the constraints and Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations identified in Sections 2.5 and 2.7, respectively, serve to minimize the potential for wildfire probability and provide mechanisms for adequate wildfire response. As a result, based on analysis of the context and intensity factors as described in Section 3.4.1.2, the Air Force has not identified significant impacts that would affect public health or safety. Air Quality Training activities would result in small amounts of air emissions, the majority of which would not result in adverse impacts at either forest. Air emissions from the Proposed Action would not adversely impact public health or safety or negatively affect the quality of the human environment on an action-specific or cumulative basis.  All emissions would be within federal, state, and local guidelines.  Consequently, based on analysis of the context and intensity factors as described in Section 3.5.1.2, the Air Force has not identified significant air quality impacts. Earth Resources There are unavoidable adverse impacts associated with minor soil erosion resulting from roadway use for aircraft operations, HLZ/DZ use, ground movement, and amphibious operations. Land improvement activities would be limited to minor improvement of small road segments (four segments in BRSF, three segments in THSF) for FWALS use and would be limited to existing road beds.  No National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting requirements have been identified.  The intensity of these impacts is minimized through implementation of General Operational Constraints and Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations identified in Section 2.5 and 3.6.4, respectively.  Consequently, based on analysis of the context and intensity factors as described in Section 3.6.1.2, the Air Force has not identified any significant adverse impacts to earth resources. Water Resources Context and intensity factors utilized in water resources analyses are provided in Section 3.7.1.2.  There are unavoidable direct adverse impacts to wetlands and floodplains from incidental surface disturbances (ISDs) associated with ground movement (e.g., troops walking through wetlands) and amphibious operations (e.g., boats landing along the shoreline). However, the Air Force has not identified any significant adverse impacts to water resources under the Proposed Action because the intensity of any of the identified impacts is minimized through implementation of General Operational Constraints and Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations identified in Sections 2.5 and 2.7, respectively.  With the exception of minor land improvement activities on unpaved road segments for aircraft operations no land development activities have been proposed and no United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Section 404 permitting requirements for impacts to wetlands have been identified. Biological Resources Known sensitive species locations and habitat would be restricted to training activities. There are unavoidable adverse impacts to biological resources from incidental disturbances associated with dismounted maneuvers (e.g., potential trampling of a transient species by foot traffic), aircraft noise, and amphibious operations (disturbance along shorelines).  These impacts would be of minor intensity and short-term in duration. Direct unavoidable impacts have also been identified associated with increased wildfire potential resulting from training activities.  The intensity of any of the identified impacts is minimized through implementation of General Operational Constraints and Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations identified in Section 2.5 and 2.7, respectively.  The Air Force completed consultation with USFWS in accordance with Section 7 of the ESA on April 8, 2014, and has received concurrence on a finding of “Not Likely to Adversely Affect” sensitive species or habitat (USFWS, 2014).  A copy of the Biological Assessment and all associated correspondence is included in Appendix C, Consultation Documentation. Therefore, the Air Force has not identified any significant adverse impacts to biological resources under the Proposed Action based on context and intensity factors described in Section 3.8.1.2. Cultural Resources Context and intensity factors utilized in cultural resources analyses are provided in Section 3.9.1.2.  Potential adverse impacts to cultural resources may occur from land disturbance activities, dismounted movement, and amphibious operations due to ground disturbance. Impacts mainly consist of potential disturbance or inadvertent discovery of previously unidentified cultural resources in both surveyed and unsurveyed areas.  Ground disturbing activities would be limited in unsurveyed areas, and known cultural resource locations would be avoided as part of general operations constraints (see Section 2.5).  The Air Force has notified the ACHP, Florida SHPO, and applicable Native American tribes about this Proposed Action. The Air Force is completing a Programmatic Agreement to meet its requirements under Section 106 of the NHPA.  The final PA and results of the consultation process will be included in Appendix C of the Final EIS. 1  Land Use  2  Temporary annoyance to transient recreational users from noise during training activities is  3  unavoidable. Impacts to other recreational users and adjacent landowners would be  4  minimized through implementation of operational constraints identified in Section 2.5, and  5  avoidance of noise-sensitive areas. Minor, short-term small-scale closures of areas (HLZs/DZs,  6  road segments) during training activities represent less than one-half of one percent of the  7  total areas for the forests.  These short-term closures would not preclude use of the forest and  8  access would be allowed once training activities have ceased.  At BRSF, the STOP Camp and  9  SRYA sites are currently not open to the public, and this would not change if the Air Force  10  utilizes these locations. No conflicts with hunters have been identified since day-time training  11  activities would be restricted during hunting season.  While the impacts are adverse because  12  the quality of the recreational experience may be somewhat diminished by these impacts,  13  this would not preclude recreational use or cause general incompatibility, and impacts would  14  be short term.  Therefore, the Air Force does not consider the impacts to be significant based  15  on the context and intensity of identified impacts under factors discussed in Section 3.10.1.2.   16  2.7 PROPOSED RESOURCE-SPECIFIC MITIGATIONS  17  Based on the scope of activities associated with the Proposed Action, the inherent General  18  Operational Constraints identified in Section 2.5, and related impact analyses detailed in this  19  EIS, there are no identified Resource-Specific Mitigation impact minimization procedures  20  necessary for the following resource areas: air quality, solid/hazardous materials and waste,  21  and infrastructure and transportation.   22  Impact analysis of the Proposed Action has identified the following Proposed Resource 23  Specific Mitigations that would be implemented, in addition to General Operational  24  Constraints in Section 2.5, to further minimize or avoid adverse impacts—in most cases  25  impacts would be minimized such that impact significance levels would be reduced from  26  “adverse” (yellow) to “neutral” or “no effect” (green).  27  Emitter Sites  28  At Sites EAFB-1, FFS-5, FFS-6, and FFS-7, where structures currently exist within the proposed  29  SHD but are not residential, would be verified as vacant before allowing the emitter system to  30  be utilized at these emitter locations. If not vacant, the JTE would not be utilized at these  31  locations.  32  At each site continue to monitor the proximity to populated areas to determine constraints  33  associated with the site and respective operational parameters of the specific system.  34  Prior to any land disturbance (e.g., tree clearing) sensitive species surveys would be  35  conducted.  Any identified sensitive species or associated habitat would be avoided.  36  Both Forests  37  The Air Force would post signs collocated with existing Forest Service signage and in Forest  38  Service stations notifying forest users of the potential for encountering training in the forest.  39  This would provide public awareness of training activities in the forest. Users expecting to  encounter training activities and intermittent noise may be more prepared for such encounters and, therefore, less surprised or annoyed by training events. Airspace Management A coordination process would be established by which the Air Force would work with FFS points of contact (POCs) prior to scheduling missions to ensure that FFS operations and recreational aviation activities would not be negatively impacted by GLI training. Noise Aircraft would not operate below 500 feet AGL except while engaged in approaches to, departures from, or training at designated HLZ/DZ, OHO locations, or FWALS. HLZ/DZs would be sited at not less than 2,200 feet from known noise-sensitive locations. Known noise-sensitive locations include campgrounds and privately owned parcels with at least one residential structure. Maneuvers near the HLZ/DZ (i.e., initial approach, departure, circling, and pattern work at less than 500 feet AGL) would not be conducted at distances less than 200 feet from known noise-sensitive locations. OHO locations would not be located within 2,200 feet of known noise-sensitive locations. The full spectrum of HLZ/DZ aircraft training (i.e., LLHI/E, AD, and A/LVL) would only be permitted at FWALS that are remote from all known noise-sensitive locations (i.e., FWALS in TA-1, the northern half of Munson Airstrip, and all FWALS in THSF). Only LAPT would be allowed at the FWALS in TA-9. New FWALS would not be located within 9,300 feet of known noise-sensitive locations if they would also be approved for the full spectrum of HLZ/DZ uses. Earth Resources Clear zones for FWALS would be cleared as part of normal forestry operations; the Air Force would not clear any areas in support of roadway use for aircraft operations.  This limits the potential for adverse impacts associated with soil erosion, and eliminates the need for NPDES or USACE Section 404 permitting. Aircraft operations within poorly suited areas (see Section 3.6.3) can only be established on existing roadways that do not require land disturbance outside the existing road bed or rightof-way.  This limits the potential for adverse impacts associated with soil erosion, and minimizes the need for excessive maintenance. Conduct site fingerprinting of each proposed aircraft operation location to collect the data necessary to develop and implement FWALS project plans.  Site fingerprinting is a data collection, ground-truthing, and reporting process designed to gather and analyze the field data necessary to plan, design, and construct FWALS to fully support the proposed military aircraft training activities.  Site data collection tools and protocols are used during field visits to gather critical roadway and affected area measurements, photopoint records, and soil samples.  Based on validated field features and conditions, determinations can then be made as to site suitability and engineering requirements.  As needed, site project plans could then be developed to meet site construction and operational needs. Utilize sites that are best suited to the intended activity and avoid areas with known constraints or limitations. Temporally and spatially disperse FWALS and HLZ/DZ training to minimize repetitive use impacts to landing zone surface conditions and maximize life cycles. Utilize mission logistics information to plan training events that avoid, to the degree possible, FWALS used during the previous year and HLZ/DZ areas used during the previous two years.  A rest period would promote vegetative growth and allow disturbed areas to recover. Construct and maintain an FWALS drainage system that collects and discharges stormwater runoff in a non-erosive manner. Inspect FWALS following each training mission.  Coordinate immediate repairs of damaged areas with the GLI Liaison and Eglin AFB. Avoid clear zone maintenance during wet soil conditions.  All soils are highly sensitive to mechanical compaction or rutting damage when wet. As needed, install BMPs to minimize soil disturbances (Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services [FDACS] 2008, USACOE 2004 and 2008).  For clear zone sites with extreme rutting damage, physically amend damaged soils with tillage equipment after the soils have dried.  Depending on extent of damage, soil structure amendments could be made with hand tools or motorized tillage equipment.  Areas may also need to be reseeded to native species to reduce bare ground and encourage the establishment of soil protecting ground cover. Avoid HLZ/DZ areas with highly and potentially highly erodible soils and hydric soils.  Soil erosion potentials increase with increasing soil erodibility and wet soil are highly sensitive to damage by compaction and rutting. Maintain at least a 100-foot exclusion buffer around sensitive steephead slopes and closed depression subsidence areas to prevent accelerated soil erosion of slopes and wet soil rutting. As necessary, install temporary metal landing mats for HLZ/DZ landing training activities conducted in wet areas during poor weather conditions. Mats can reduce potentials for soil damage and provide stable platforms for aircraft landings, materials and personnel loading and unloading, and temporary storage. To the degree possible, utilize established walking trails or designated roads during cross county dismounted maneuvers. Avoid cross-county maneuvers through steephead locations.  The steep to very steep slopes of these geologic features are highly prone to accelerated rates of erosion if disturbed. Avoid the use of borrow pits for temporary campsites.  For some pits, additional surface disturbances could increase soil erosion rates or affect the stability of early-stage pit reclamation. Avoid establishing temporary camps within or in proximity to steepheads and closed depression areas. These sites may be sensitive to increases in stormwater runoff of disturbances associated with camp activities. An exclusion zone of at least 100 feet is recommended. Avoid sensitive streambank areas that are overheightened and oversteepened and/or areas exhibiting bank scour and mass failure features. To the degree possible, avoid the repetitive use of the same nonhardened egress and ingress locations within the same year for amphibious operations. For sites where vegetation damage could result in loss of plant cover, reseed with native species to encourage the reestablishment of vegetative cover. Water Resources Use only FFS-approved, designated vehicle water crossings in “Good” or “Fair” condition; no wheeled vehicle training would occur at crossings rated “Poor” until these crossings are approved by the FFS. Report any damaged water crossings identified in the field to the GLI Liaison and Eglin AFB. If off-road vehicle use is required for any reason the respective FFS Management Office would need to be consulted prior to occurrence, and no vehicles would be allowed within 100 feet of a surface water body or wetland as specified by EABFI 13-212. To minimize localized damage potential from foraging and dismounted troop movements, the size of troop units will be kept to small manageable numbers. Troop use would be rotated within and among TAs to prevent concentration of activities in particular locations. Implementation of this mitigation would allow water resources to recover from extended use after intensive training activities. Roads, trails, and stream/wetland crossings would be inspected before and after each training mission to identify maintenance issues that could cause problems if not repaired. Training activities would be shifted or redirected if conditions of roads and stream and wetland crossings require repair or other measures to prevent erosion from impacting surface waters and wetlands. The FFS will be notified of any identified issues. Amphibious operations should use designated landing sites as coordinated through the GLI Liaison and the FFS. To the extent possible, boat landings should occur on established, hardened boat ramps for ingress/egress of amphibious craft. If ingress/egress must utilize natural habitat in wetlands, care should be taken to prevent destruction of wetland vegetation or other activities that might cause shoreline erosion. Ingress/egress points at nonhardened locations for both personnel and watercraft should be rotated to the extent possible to allow sites time to recover from amphibious operations. Biological Resources Identify designated boat landing areas for amphibious operations that occur in Gulf sturgeon and freshwater mussel critical habitat on the Yellow and Ochlocknee rivers, and in Apalachicola Bay and East Bay, preferably with improved surfaces. Develop and implement a process that will notify Eglin Natural Resources of the dates and locations of upcoming training events to support spot surveys/inspections for compliance. When determining preferred locations for HLZs/DZs and fixed-wing aircraft landing sites, ensure incorporation of 1,000 foot buffers around bald eagle nests from 01 October to 15 May, and wood stork feeding/roosting habitat. Annually provide ground training units with global positioning system (GPS) coordinates for bald eagle nests, and wood stork roosting/feeding areas. Survey proposed new training locations (including fixed wing aircraft landing sites and HLZs) for protected/sensitive species, and survey existing training areas at least every 3 years to identify any new sensitive species that have moved into the area. As necessary, update associated operational constraints and GLI Protection Level maps. Prior to any activity that has the potential to create significant soil disturbance, conduct a survey for federally listed plants.  If listed plants cannot be avoided, additional consultation under the ESA is required. Prior to any training activities and once specific training areas and corridors are identified for the upcoming year, these areas must be surveyed for bald eagle nests, and active trees must be marked.  Coordinate with Eglin Natural Resources and the FFS to ensure that any necessary markings are completed prior to ground operations. Prior to any training activities, route requests for land disturbing activities through Eglin AFB and the FFS for approval. Follow guidance provided in the Eglin Environmental Guidebooks regarding approved plant and animal species for camouflage and consumption. Develop materials for military members instructing them to avoid inappropriate handling or consumption of wildlife, and clarify to ground troops that diamondback rattlesnakes are not to be consumed. Prior to any land disturbance (e.g., tree clearing for LOS), sensitive species surveys must be conducted, and any identified sensitive species and associated habitat must be avoided.  If avoidance is not possible, then additional consultation under the ESA is likely to be required. Prior to driving across a low water stream crossing, check for turtles and allow them to clear the crossing before use. Avoid driving on roads with erosion issues; report any erosion issues to the GLI Liaison. Mark identified threatened and endangered plants on user maps and in the field. BRSF Only Noise A/LVL training will not be conducted at the proposed FWALS in TA-9 and aircraft inbound to and outbound from the FWALS would avoid overflying privately owned parcels with residential structures where practicable. Approaches to and departures from the FWALS in TA-2 (Munson Airstrip) would be conducted from/to the north to avoid low overflight of a campground. Aircraft departing Munson/Blackwater would initiate takeoff roll from about the center point of the airstrip.  The Air Force would notify residents within 4,000 feet of the SRYA or former STOP camp prior to use of training munitions. THSF Only Noise Noise generating expendables would not be used within 4,000 feet of noise-sensitive locations (e.g., residences, campgrounds and recreational sites). Figure 6-1 through Figure 6-22 show the areas in which training activities would be restricted. Buffers are established from all privately-owned parcels containing at least one residential structure and all campgrounds. 3. PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT 2 3.1 INTRODUCTION 3 In accordance with 40 CFR 1501.7(3) (Scoping), this chapter focuses on identifying and 4 eliminating from detailed study issues that are not significant or that have been covered by prior environmental review (§1506.3).  Thus, these issues are only discussed briefly here, 6 addressing why they would not significantly affect the human environment and/or where 7 they have been covered under other environmental studies (if applicable).  Each map in this 8 chapter is a “clickable” thumbnail image that will provide full-screen viewing; each map is also 9 available for full-page printing in Appendix A. This chapter details which resource/issue areas would be potentially adversely affected under 11 the Proposed Action, based on preliminary analysis. These resource areas were carried 12 forward for further, location-specific analyses, detailed in Chapters 4, 5, and 6.  The affected 13 resource areas were determined by: 14 • Categorizing the Proposed Action activities into “effectors.” • Identifying the potential interactions between effectors and resource/issue area 16 “receptors.” 17 • Discussing the regulatory drivers associated with each receptor. 18 • Providing the analysis methodologies utilized in this EIS for each resource/issue area 19 receptor. • Defining impact level attributes and potential for significance in each analysis 21 methodology. 22 • Conducting general analysis of emitter activity and training activity effectors to 23 identify potentially adverse impacts on associated receptors and determine those 24 resources/issue areas to be carried forward for location-specific analyses (Chapters 4, 5, and 6). 26 • Identifying any Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations needed to minimize or avoid 27 adverse impacts identified through general analyses. Additional Proposed Resource28 Specific Mitigations were identified in subsequent site-specific analyses, as needed. 29 Utilizing this approach ensures that impacts are discussed in proportion to their significance, with only brief discussion of issues deemed not significant (40 CFR 1502.2 [b] 31 [Implementation]). 32 Effectors and Receptors 33 Assessment of affected resources begins by first categorizing a proposed action into key 34 effectors based on the scope of the proposed activities and the resulting potential environmental interactions.  An effector is an aspect of a training activity that may have an 36 effect on the environment. Each proposed activity comprises these effectors in some form, 37 some more than others.  Once effectors are known, the resources that might be affected are 38 identified as receptors.  As an example, training activities involve varying degrees of land disturbance that interact with several different resources, such as soils and water resources. Land disturbance is considered an effector, and each resource affected by land disturbance activities is considered a receptor. The following have been identified as the key effectors of the Proposed Action: • Land disturbance.  Actions associated with changing the landscape through the disturbance of natural resources further defined by the following: o Land development.  Land clearing, grading, construction, etc. Activity may disturb several hundred square feet or more and may extend from the surface to more than 12 inches below the ground surface. o Point impacts.  Small-scale point impacts, such as placing a tent stake or picket into the ground or digging a small hole.  Disturbance is very localized and extends less than 12 inches below the ground surface. o Incidental surface disturbance.  Small-scale surface disturbance incidental to other training activities, such as personnel walking around an HLZ or FWALS or, generally walking around a specific training site. o Consumption.  Utilization of natural resources through direct consumption (i.e., eating plants or animals). • Ground movement. Movement of troops and vehicles across the training environment further categorized as follows: o Wheeled vehicles.  Utilization of trucks, ATVs, etc., as transport to, from, and on the emitter or training sites. o Dismounted movement.  Walking/running associated with several troops in formation or out of formation across land areas from one location to another. • UoEX.  Utilization of munitions and/or equipment in support of training activities. Overall, use of munitions has the potential for chemical residue to interact with the environment.  For purposes of analysis UoEX has been categorized further based on the unique potential interaction: o Blanks/ground burst simulators (GBSs).  Blanks and GBSs are noise generators and, therefore, have been categorized separately from other expendables. o Smoke grenades.  The main aspect of smoke grenade use is potential for fire hazard; GBSs are also a potential fire hazard. o Other/equipment. Includes use of fuel during refueling operations and typically nonhazardous items such as simulated munitions (consisting of plastic pellets or paintballs, which produce little or no noise and have no fire hazard), generators (includes emitter generators), tents, AD bundles, etc. • Aircraft operations.  Use of fixed-wing and/or rotary-wing aircraft as part of a training activity. • Amphibious Operations. Activities in which the main goal is to interact with, and conduct training within, water resources (boating, shoreline interactions, etc.). 1 • Electromagnetic radiation (EMR). Use of radar emitters.  EMR is categorized separately 2 because it is unique to radar emitter use and has safety implications not related to 3 other effector categories. 4 • Utilities. Associated with radar emitter use and the use of hardened camp sites. 5 Similar to EMR, it is categorized separately because the impacts associated with use of 6 utilities are not relative to other effector categories. 7 Table 3-1 cross-references Proposed Action components with their respective effectors: 8 Table 3-1.  Proposed Action Component Effectors Table 3–1.  Proposed Action Component Effectors, Cont’d Table 3–2.  Proposed Action Affected Receptors, Cont’d A/C = aircraft; Amph = amphibious; DM = dismounted maneuvers; DZ = drop zone; FARP/HGO = Forward Air Refueling Point/Hot Gas Operations; FWALS = Fixed-Wing Aircraft Landing Sites; HLZ = helicopter landing zone; LD = land development; O/Eq. = other/equipment; PI = point impacts; ISD = incidental surface disturbance; Ut. = utilities  1 2 3 4 5  After effectors associated with each training activity were identified, potential receptors were determined based on the scope of each Proposed Action component. Table 3-2 summarizes the resource areas potentially affected by the effectors given in Table 3-1.  Details on how this summary table was derived are provided in the respective resource-specific sections of this chapter (Sections 3.2 through 3.13).  6  Table 3-2.  Proposed Action Affected Receptors  GBS  = ground burst simulator  1  Based on the information in Table 3-2, both emitters and training activities were generally  2  analyzed to determine the potential for adverse impacts and to determine issues to be carried  3  forward for site-specific analysis. This general approach was utilized because, while the  4  locations of activities may differ (e.g., BRSF, THSF), the activities would be the same and the  5  impacts would generally be the same.  Only the exact resources affected would differ.  6  For example, it is known, generally, that CCDM results in trampling of vegetation due to  7  troops traversing the ground surface.  It is also known that, generally, impacts may be adverse  8  if troop units are large in size, movements are concentrated, and activities occur within or  9  near sensitive habitats.  The general analysis in this chapter focuses on identifying these  10  potential issues, then conducting location-specific analysis, as detailed in subsequent  11  chapters, to determine the degree of impact to location-specific resources from the Proposed  12  Action components and associated effectors. This is accomplished by evaluating significance  13  of the impact.  14  NEPA implementing regulations at 40 CFR Part 1502.1 (Purpose) require full and fair  15  discussion of significant environmental impacts; furthermore, 40 CFR 1502.16 (Environmental  16  Consequences) requires a discussion of direct/indirect impacts and their significance. The  17  CEQ, in 40 CFR Part 1508.27, defines “significant” as consideration of both context and  18  intensity of the impact.  19  For purposes of this EIS, the attributes of the impact in terms of type, context, intensity, and  20  duration were considered to determine the level of impact and whether it may be considered  21  significant.  Table 3-3 summarizes the impact attributes utilized in environmental analyses  22  discussed throughout this EIS.  Each attribute is further defined with respect to resource  23  categories in Sections 3.2 through 3.13.  1 Table 3-3.  Impact Attributes Type of Impact  Context  Intensity  Duration  -Direct -Indirect -Cumulative  -Regional or Population Level -Localized  -High -Medium -Low -Neutral  -Beneficial -Adverse  -Long-term -Medium-term -Short-term  2  As discussed in Chapter 2, all training activities at the state forests would be conducted, as  3  applicable, per the requirements of EAFBI 13-212 (Chapter 7, Environmental Management), in  4  accordance with the respective state forest management plans, and the terms and conditions  5  identified in the Eglin AFB Interstitial Area Biological Assessment, Eglin AFB Red-Cockaded  6  Woodpecker Programmatic Biological Opinion, and the Riverine/Estuarine Biological Assessment,  7  as appropriate.  8  This EIS relies heavily on both the analyses and the resultant operational constraints imposed  9  on the training activities within the aforementioned documents, because not only are the  10  activities proposed under the Proposed Action exactly the same as those currently occurring  11  on the Eglin Range, but the natural resources present at both BRSF and THSF are similar to  12  those on the Eglin Range (e.g., red-cockaded woodpeckers, wetlands, stream banks).  These  13  documents detail previous analyses of these activities at Eglin AFB, and they provide an  14  excellent basis for understanding the requirements (i.e., General Operational Constraints) for  15  implementing the Proposed Action and making impact determinations for the proposed  16  training locations. As a result, there are no highly uncertain, unique, or unknown risks  17  associated with the Proposed Action.  Consequently, these documents and previous analyses  18  are incorporated by reference as appropriate to reduce paperwork and extraneous  19  background data in this report (per 40 CFR 1502.1, 40 CFR 1502.21).  20  Additionally, determination of potentially impacted resources includes the assumption that  21  all previously identified General Operational Constraints, as listed in Section 2.5, are inherent  22  to the Proposed Action.  As an example, General Operational Constraint 5(x) requires all  23  vehicles to remain on designated roads. Therefore, impacts to various resources account for  24  this constraint, and analyses were limited only to potential impacts associated with road use  25  of vehicles.  26  3.2 AIRSPACE MANAGEMENT AND USE  27  Within the context of this EIS, the term “airspace management and use” refers to the  28  continued safe and efficient flying operations in the airspace above BRSF and THSF.  Potential  29  “receptors” of airspace management impacts could include ongoing aircraft operations, as  30  well as agencies responsible for scheduling and control of the local airspace.  31  3.2.1  Impact Assessment Methodology  32  The impact assessment for airspace management and use evaluates the potential impacts of  33  the Proposed Action on airspace receptors. Impacts are evaluated according to type, context,  34  intensity, and duration (as described in Section 3.1), as well as the regulatory drivers identified  35  below. Together, these attributes define the potential significance of the impacts.  1  3.2.1.1 Regulatory Drivers  2  Airspace management is defined as the direction, control, and handling of flight operations in  3  the navigable airspace. Navigable airspace is airspace above the minimum altitudes of flight  4  prescribed by regulations under USC Title 49, Subtitle VII, Part A.  Congress has charged the  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) with responsibility for developing plans and policy for  6  use of the navigable airspace in the U.S. and its territories to ensure the safety of aircraft and  7  its efficient use (49 USC § 40103(b); FAA Job Order (JO) 7400.2G).  8  Airspace management considers how airspace is designated, used, and administered to best  9  accommodate the individual and common needs of military, commercial, and general  aviation.  The FAA has defined several airspace categories to accommodate varying types and  11  intensities of flight activity. Controlled airspace, airspace of defined dimensions within which  12  air traffic control (ATC) service is provided, is categorized into five separate classes, Classes A  13  through E. Each class has its own set of rules regarding how operations are to be conducted.  14  Uncontrolled airspace is designated as Class G airspace; it exists in volumes of airspace not  otherwise designated. ATC services for aircraft en route are provided by air route traffic  16  control centers (ARTCCs).  Victor Routes are federally designated airways that act like  17  “highways in the sky” and are commonly used in routing aircraft over long distances.  ATC  18  towers and traffic control (TRACON) or radar approach control (RAPCON) facilities manage  19  descending aircraft operating in their respective terminal areas.  The FAA has designated certain volumes of airspace as SUA in accordance with FAA Order JO  21  7400.8.  RAs are a type of SUA in which flight of nonparticipating aircraft is subject to  22  regulatory restrictions due to hazards such as ongoing aerial gunnery or guided missile  23  testing. Most RAs may be released by the managing agency for use by nonparticipating  24  aircraft when not active.  MOAs are a type of SUA established to separate certain military  training activities from nonparticipating traffic operating under instrument flight rules (IFRs)  26  (i.e., flight procedures that must be used when weather visibility minimums are not met).  27  Aircraft operating under IFRs may be routed through an MOA if ATC can provide guaranteed  28  separation from military training.  Nonparticipating aircraft operating under visual flight rules  29  (VFRs) (i.e., procedures used when visibility minimums are met) are encouraged to exercise  extreme caution when transiting an active MOA. Alert areas are designated to make  31  nonparticipating pilots aware of a high volume of pilot training operations, or an unusual  32  type of aeronautical activity in the area. Pilots are advised to be particularly alert when flying  33  in these areas. Military training routes are designated corridors in which low-altitude, high 34  speed military aircraft operations may be conducted. Routes designated as “instrument  routes” (IRs) are flown under IFRs.  36  Military airspace is managed in accordance with AFI 13-212 and Eglin AFB Instruction 13-212.  37  Compliance with applicable regulations ensures separation of aircraft while conducting  38  combat-realistic training maneuvers.  39  3.2.1.2 Assessment Method  The Proposed Action was considered in the context of existing regulations and procedures for  41  airspace management.  Intensity of impacts was assessed considering the level of effort  42  involved in scheduling and controlling the proposed number of training events, as well as the  43  potential for delays to ongoing flying operations as a result of proposed training.  The  1  duration of training events was one factor in determining expected airspace management  2  issues.  Table 3-4 defines how the impact attributes of context, intensity and duration are  3  applied to airspace management analyses.  4  Table 3-4.

May require overhaul of existing or development of new scheduling/coordination processes to accommodate the change.  Substantively improved or degraded operational efficiency within identified regulatory or regional airspace context.  May result in substantial reduction or increase in flight delays.  Can be associated with substantive decrease/increase in flight operations resulting in comparable improved or degraded airspace availability, establishment of new SUA, or elimination of existing SUA.  Medium Mitigations may be required to avoid adverse impacts, depending on context and duration of the exposure/impact. Unavoidable adverse impacts likely recoverable with BMPs and mitigations.  Moderate improvement or decline in scheduling/coordination processes within the regulatory context or within identified regional airspace.  Impacts can typically be handled through existing scheduling/coordination processes with some changes required.  Moderate improved or degraded operational efficiency within identified regulatory or regional airspace context.  May result in noticeable reduction or increase in flight delays.  Can be associated with a moderate decrease/increase in flight operations resulting in comparable improved or degraded airspace availability or modification of existing SUA. No new SUA would be required.  Low No mitigations required. Adverse impacts are avoidable.  Minimal change to scheduling/coordination processes within the regulatory context or within identified regional airspace. No noticeable impact to existing scheduling/coordination processes.  Slightly improved or degraded operational efficiency within identified regulatory or regional airspace context. No noticeable reduction or increase in flight delays.  Can be associated with a decrease/increase in flight operations that are comparable to existing operations and have no noticeable impact on airspace availability. Would not require modification of existing SUA or new SUA.  Neutral  Overall, no impact to existing scheduling/coordination process.  No impact to efficiency of operations on local or regional scale.  No decrease/increase in flight operations and no impact on airspace availability.  Would not require modification of existing SUA or new SUA.  Duration  Long term  Effect would likely endure for the life of the action.  Medium term  Effect would likely last for a few months to a year.  Short term  Effect would likely last for a few days to weeks.  BMP = best management practice; SUA = special use airspace  5  3.2.1.3  Impact Levels  6  The level  of  impact  associated  with  airspace and potential significance  to  airspace  7  management and use is determined by considering how Proposed Action effectors could  1 interact with airspace in terms of context, intensity, and duration as described in Table 3-4.  2 Table 3-5 explains the impact level categories for airspace management analyzed in this EIS 3 and identified in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. 4 Table 3-5.  Impact Level Categories for Airspace Management Level of  Efficiency of Ongoing  Impact  Scheduling/Coordination Processes  Operations  Adverse  Adverse airspace impacts may result in scheduling and coordination conflicts and issues, the level of impact directly related to the impact attributes described in Table 3-4.  Adverse impacts may be perceived as significant under medium-to-high intensity scenarios at any duration if scheduling and coordination cannot be accomplished using any existing or feasibly implemented system. Uncoordinated activities would be unsafe for Department of Defense personnel or civilians, and new special use airspace would be required and result in major overhaul of ongoing flight procedures. Insignificant noise impacts would likely occur under medium-tolow intensity scenarios of short duration where existing scheduling process can be adjusted or new process implemented to facilitate de-confliction of existing and proposed operations. Proposed scheduling processes in combination with existing scheduling processes would allow continued safe and efficient operations.  Adverse impacts may result in a decline in the efficiency of ongoing operations, the level of impact directly related to the impact attributes described in Table 3-4. Significant impacts may result in frequent, substantial delays of ongoing operations on a local or regional scale. Insignificant airpsace impacts may result in delays of ongoing operations but would not be common.  Neutral / no  Under a neutral or no-effect scenario, existing scheduling processes can handle proposed operations tempos and no coordination is required.  Results in little or no impact to efficiency of operations on local or regional scale.  effect  5  3.2.2  General Emitter Activity Impact Assessment  6  Based on the scope of action described in Chapter 2, emitter site use would not be expected  7  to result in interactions with airspace management. The emitters would not be expected to  8  have any effect on the tempo of military training operations or procedures used to manage  9  current military and civilian operations.   As a result, this issue area has not been carried  10  forward for site-specific analysis in Chapter 4.  11  3.2.3  General Training Activity Impact Assessment  12  Table 3-6 identifies potential interactions between the Proposed Action effectors and airspace  13  management receptors.   Based on the scope of action described in Chapter 2, activities  14  involving land disturbance, ground movement, UoEX, Amphibious Operations, and utilities  15  would not result in potential interactions or impacts to airspace management; these issue  16  areas are identified as “green” in the table below and are not carried forward for site-specific  17  analyses in Chapters 5 (BRSF) and 6 (THSF).  Aircraft operations have the potential for adverse  18  impacts and are, therefore, carried forward for site-specific analyses in Chapters 5 and 6.  19  These areas are shaded yellow in the table below.  Activities shaded in green have little  20  potential to impact public health or safety or the human and natural environment or do not  21  result in potential violations of federal, state, or local regulations; therefore, these activities  22  are not carried forward for detailed analysis in Chapters 5 and 6.  PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT | APRIL 2014 1 Table 3-6.

This coordination process would  5  minimize identified impacts from adverse (yellow) to neutral (green) over the mid-to long  6  term.  7  3.3 NOISE  8  Within the context of this EIS, the term “noise” is considered to be unwanted sound that  9  interferes with normal activities or otherwise diminishes the quality of the environment.   In  10  effect, the resource discussed here is a quiet or locally appropriate sound environment as  1  experienced by humans in general. This component of noise is referred to as a “receptor.”  2  Additional discussion of specific noise impacts on other “receptors” can be found in sections  3  discussing biological resources (noise impacts on wildlife), cultural resources (noise impacts  4  on physical objects and experiential resources), land use (noise impacts on existing land uses),  and socioeconomics/environmental justice (noise impacts on the economy and specific  6  subsets of the population).  7  Sound levels are recorded on a logarithmic decibel (dB) scale, reflecting the relative way in  8  which the ear perceives differences in sound energy levels. The threshold of hearing is 0 dB,  9  typical conversations are held at about 60 dB, and the threshold of discomfort is 120 dB.  Under normal conditions, a person with healthy hearing can detect a 3-dB change in sound  11  level.  12  Sound measurement may be further refined through the use of frequency “weighting.” In  13  A-weighted measurements, sounds at frequencies heard best by the human ear are  14  emphasized. In the case of sonic booms, blast noise, and other impulsive booming noises,  sound is felt as well as heard. With these types of noise, overpressure may be considered  16  more annoying than the sound itself. For this reason, impulsive sounds are measured using  17  C-weighting, which does not attenuate the lower frequencies to the extent that A-weighting  18  does. Sounds measured in these ways are quantified as A-weighted decibels (dBA) or  19  C-weighted decibels (dBC).  Unless otherwise noted, all sound levels referenced in this  document are A-weighted.  21  The sound exposure level (SEL) is a noise descriptor that accounts for both the intensity and  22  duration of an individual noise event. The SEL provides a measure of the total sound exposure  23  for the entire event as if it was compressed into a single second and is useful for predicting  24  certain outcomes, such as awakenings from sleep.  Day-night average sound level (DNL) is a noise descriptor that averages A-weighted sound  26  levels over a 24-hour period, with an additional 10-dB penalty added to noise events  27  occurring between 10:00 PM and 7:00 AM.  The 10-dB penalty compensates for lower  28  background noise levels at night, and the increased potential for annoyance associated with  29  late-night noise events.  The onset-rate adjusted monthly day-night average sound level  further adjusts DNL.  This metric adds a penalty of up to 11 dB to account for the potential  31  startle effects caused by low-altitude, high-speed aircraft and is calculated monthly to  32  account for the high degree of daily variability in the tempo of airspace operations during  33  training.  34  Because munitions noise levels are so strongly influenced by meteorological conditions (e.g.,  winds), the peak noise level reaching a particular location after a particular noise event may  36  vary significantly. The metric “peak noise exceeded by 15 percent of firing events”  37  (PK 15[met]) accounts for weather-influenced statistical variation in received single-event  38  peak noise levels. PK(met) is the peak noise level, without frequency weighting, expected to  39  be exceeded by 15 percent of all firing events.  3.3.1 Impact Assessment Methodology  41  The impact assessment for noise evaluates the potential impacts of the Proposed Action to  42  the existing sound environment and receptors in that environment.  Impacts are evaluated  43  according to type, context, intensity, and duration (as described in Section 3.1), as well as the  1  regulatory drivers identified below.  Together, these attributes define the potential  2  significance of the impacts. The “intensity” of noise impacts is affected by characteristics of  3  the noise (e.g., spectral content, frequency of occurrence, and time of day) as well as  4  characteristics of the listener and the activity being conducted when the noise occurs. Noise  impact analysis addresses the potential for the Proposed Action to result in impacts to public  6  safety and human health as well as the environment from both auditory and nonauditory  7  noise impacts, annoyance, and land use compatibility.  The relationships between noise and  8  biological resources and land use compatibility are addressed in the Biological Resources and  9  Land Use sections of this EIS, respectively, using the results of the noise analysis.  3.3.1.1 Regulatory Drivers  11  Since legal limits on allowable noise levels could, in some cases, reduce the combat  12  effectiveness of military equipment, such equipment has been exempted from federal  13  regulations that impose noise limitations. However, several federal regulations, policies, and  14  studies inform decision-making with regard to noise. DoD recognizes that noise-sensitive  land uses are not compatible with elevated military training noise levels and has adopted  16  guidelines for determining land use compatibility near military installations. According to  17  land use guidelines in DoD Instruction 4165.57, Air Installation Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ),  18  residential and other noise-sensitive land uses are not considered compatible with noise  19  levels greater than 65 dB DNL, unless special structural noise attenuation measures are  installed. Although the Proposed Action would not occur near a military installation, noise  21  levels exceeding these established guidelines are less likely to be considered acceptable.  The  22  United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has indicated that minimal impacts  23  to human health and welfare would occur at levels below 55 dB DNL (USEPA, 1974).   24  The U.S. Army is the DoD service with the lead role in setting munitions noise policy and has  established land use recommendations based on munitions noise levels near training ranges.  26  Army Regulation 200-1 discourages noise-sensitive land uses, such as residential, where small  27  arms firing noise exceeds 87 dB peak and strongly discourages such land uses where levels  28  exceed the 104-dB peak level only 15 percent of the time (PK 15[met]).  The same regulation  29  discourages noise-sensitive land uses, such as residential, where large-arms noise levels  exceed 115 dB PK 15(met) and strongly discourages such land uses where large arms noise  31  exceeds 130 dB PK 15(met).  32  Several Florida Statutes establish limitations on noise generated by ground vehicles and  33  boats.  Florida Statutes 316.272 and 316.293 require vehicles to be equipped with an exhaust  34  system in good working order including muffler, manifold pipe, and tailpiping to prevent  excessive noise.  Under these regulations, vehicles exceeding a gross combination weight  36  rating of 10,000 pounds that were built after 1975 should not exceed 90 dB at a distance of 50  37  feet while operating at greater than 35 miles per hour (mph).  Motorcycles built after 1979  38  should not exceed 82 dBA at a distance of 50 feet while operating at 35 mph.  Florida Statute  39  261.20 requires exhaust noise for all off-highway vehicles (OHVs) manufactured after 1986 to  be less than 96 dBA at a distance of 20 inches.  Florida Statute 327.65 addresses noise  41  exposure to humans from passing boats.  It states that in order to prevent potential  1  annoyance, no vessel should exceed a maximum sound level of 90 dBA at a distance of  2  50 feet.  3  Certain counties within the ROI have enacted ordinances for the abatement of excessive and  4  unnecessary noise.  Okaloosa County, for example, has established maximum sustained noise  levels at residential property lines of 60 dBA during 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM and 55 dBA between  6  10:00 PM and 7:00 AM. Noise generated by aircraft operations, vehicles in compliance with  7  Florida noise statutes, authorized target shooting, and law enforcement training are  8  exempted from these limitations.  Santa Rosa County, Liberty County, and Franklin County  9  ordinances do not contain limitations on noise generated by proposed GLI training or emitter  operations.  11  3.3.1.2 Assessment Method  12  Aircraft noise levels were calculated using the environmental noise mapping software  13  NOISEMAP, version 7.2, and the Rotorcraft Noise Model (RNM). Munitions noise levels were  14  calculated using the Small Arms Range Noise Assessment Model (SARNAM), version 2.6, and  Blast Noise Version 2 Noise Impact Software (BNOISE2™).  GLI training is intended to allow  16  maximum flexibility in mission planning, and several types of aircraft and ground vehicles  17  could be used by various units.  For training events that could use several aircraft and ground  18  vehicle types, the loudest was selected to represent all.  Surrogate noise sources were  19  selected for aircraft types for which noise levels are not included in the standard DoD source  noise databases.  Surrogate noise source selection details are provided in sections discussing  21  each type of training event.  22  As described in Chapter 2, training locations (e.g., HLZ/DZ, FWALS, OHO location) would be  23  selected that meet the physical requirements for training and at which training could be  24  conducted without causing significant noise impacts.  For purposes of this EIS, noise levels  were calculated at various distances from a nominal training location, to determine the  26  distance at which noise drops below impact threshold levels. During the training site  27  selection process, locations closer than these minimum distances to known noise-sensitive  28  locations would not be considered.  29  In addition to considering the location of a training site, approach/departure corridors would  be established for landing and drop zones.  Distances from a nominal routing corridor and  31  maneuver area at which noise would drop below threshold levels are presented. This process  32  of establishing approach/departure corridors is referred to as “aeromapping.”  The site  33  selection and aeromapping process would be followed whenever a new training location  34  (e.g., HLZ or FWALS) is required.  As described in Chapter 2, training locations that are ideal for  training initially become less desirable over time due to vegetation growth and other factors,  36  and so new training locations would occasionally be required.  In addition to close  37  examination of the areas around proposed new training locations, the areas surrounding  38  existing training areas would be surveyed every two years to ensure that no new noise 39  sensitive land uses have been established.  One of the primary benefits of GLI training is that it provides training flexibility so as to avoid  41  scripted, nonrealistic training experiences.  In a flexible training environment, many details,  42  such as aircraft ground tracks, would be variable from one mission to the next. In modeling  1 noise, threshold noise level distances were calculated based on an extremely conservative set 2 of assumptions.  Noise thresholds are based on a high estimate of operations under each 3 applicable operational scenario.  The actual number of operations at each training location 4 would be substantially less, given the relative infrequency of training over the long term, 5 resulting in lower noise levels than those estimated. 6 Table 3-7 defines how the impact attributes of context, intensity, and duration are applied to 7 noise analyses. 8 Table 3-7.  Definitions of Impact Attributes for Noise Resource Categories Attribute  Transient Users  Permanent Residents  Contexts Analyzed  Distributed  Impacts are distributed throughout the entire state forest.  Localized  Impacts are localized within the area surrounding the training location.  Intensity (can be either adverse or beneficial)  High Mitigations required to minimize/avoid adverse impacts, with scope of the mitigations based on context and duration of the exposure/impact. Unavoidable adverse effects may not be recoverable.  Substantive change in the noise environment that relatively improves the user experience or creates annoyance/impacts such that use is permanently or frequently incompatible.  Substantive change in the noise environment that relatively improves quality of life or creates annoyance/impacts such that residential use is incompatible.  Examples include discontinuation of baseline aircraft operations or munitions training or creation of low-level airspace or munitions training areas where there were none previously. The USEPA predicts no impacts to human health and welfare would occur at 55 dB DNL, while DoD land use guidelines identify 65 dB DNL for aircraft noise, 87 dB PK 15(met) for small arms noise, and 62 dB CDNL for explosives noise.  Although DNL does not describe noise level at any given time, a high DNL indicates that noise levels would often be high enough to interfere with activities and cause annoyance.  Medium Mitigations may be required to avoid adverse impacts depending on context and duration of the exposure/impact. Unavoidable adverse impacts likely recoverable with BMPs and mitigations.  Moderate change in the noise environment that relatively improves the user experience or creates annoyance/impacts such that use is occasionally incompatible.  Moderate change in the noise environment that relatively improves quality of life or occasionally creates short-term annoyance.   Examples include reduction or increase in baseline aircraft operations or munitions training.  Low No mitigations required. Adverse impacts are avoidable.  Slight change in the noise environment that has little beneficial or adverse impact on the user experience and does not result in compatibility issues.  Slight change in the noise environment that has little beneficial or adverse impact on residents and does not result in annoyance.  Neutral  No noticeable change in the baseline noise environment.  Duration  Long term  Effect would be recurring for more than a year.  Medium term  Effect would be recurring for a few months to a year.  Short term  Effect would likely last for a few hours.  BMP = best management practice; CDNL = C-weighted day-night level; dB = decibels; DoD = Department of Defense; DNL = day-night level; PK 15 (met) = peak level exceeded only 15 percent of the time; USEPA = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  9  3.3.1.3  Impact Levels  10 11 12  The level of impact associated with noise and the impact’s potential significance is determined by considering how Proposed Action effectors could interact with the existing baseline noise environment and noise resource categories (e.g., context) in terms of intensity  1 (e.g., Proposed Action noise levels), and duration as described in Table 3-7.  Table 3-8 explains 2 the levels of impact for the noise resource categories analyzed in this EIS and identified in 3 Chapters 4, 5, and 6. 4 Table 3-8.  Impact Level Categories for Noise Resources Level of Impact  Permanent Residents and Transient Users (e.g., campers, hunters, and hikers)  Adverse  Adverse noise impacts may result in annoyance, incompatible land uses, or safety issues, the level of impact directly related to the impact attributes described in Table 3-7.  Adverse impacts may be perceived as significant under medium-to-high intensity scenarios at any duration if noise levels exceed USEPA and DoD guidelines and/or result in reduced public safety or incompatible land uses.  Insignificant noise impacts would likely occur under medium-tolow intensity scenarios of short duration resulting in annoyance to some persons in the ROI at certain times; however, noise impacts would be less frequent and/or less intense in comparison to USEPA and DoD guidelines.  Neutral/no effect  Noise levels would be reduced relative to baseline conditions, or noise impacts would be minor enough to be considered negligible by most users.  Noise from training operations may be heard but not for an extended duration.  Noise does not disrupt use of the forest (e.g., camping, hunting).  Noise events would be infrequent and/or not intense, such that people in the ROI rarely take notice.  CDNL = C-weighted day-night average sound level; dB = decibels; DNL = day-night average sound level; DoD =  Department of Defense; PK 15(met) = metric peak noise exceeded by 15 percent of firing events; ROI = region of influence;  SEL = sound exposure level; USEPA = United States Environmental Protection Agency  5  3.3.2 General Emitter Activity Impact Assessment  6  Proposed emitter site locations are shown in Figure 2-3.  The emitters would be located in  7  rural areas, characterized by low-density residential development and agriculture as primary  8  land uses. USEPA has stated 44 decibels (dB) and 51 dB as typical DNL noise levels at a farm  9  area and a low-density residential area, respectively (USEPA, 1974).  Based on measured noise  10  levels in similar settings, ambient noise levels at the proposed emitter locations are assumed  11  to be 45 dB DNL.  12  Minor improvements for security/access would be required at FWC-1, FWC-2, FFS-3, FFS-4,  13  and FFS-8.  Construction of these improvements would result in localized, temporary  14  increases in noise that could be noticed by nearby residents.  However, noise generated by  15  construction of fences and gates would be temporary in nature, and the Air Force does not  16  expect these activities to result in adverse noise impacts.  17  Site FWC-2 does not have a connection to electrical utilities available on-site, so a generator  18  would be used to power the emitter.  The nearest residence to FWC-2 is more than 2,000 feet  19  away.  At this distance, a typical generator would create noise at about 49 dB while running  20  (Federal Highway Administration [FHWA], 2006).  Operation of the generator would be in  21  compliance with all applicable regulations relating to noise. Generator noise would be  22  localized, low intensity, and brief. While it may be audible when ambient noise levels are low,  23  the Air Force does not expect the noise to be disruptive at any noise-sensitive locations.  24  Emitter locations with electrical utility connections available would generate minimal noise  25  while operating.  26  Therefore, based on the context and intensity of identified impacts, the Air Force has not  27  identified the potential for adverse impacts to public health or safety or the natural  28  environment from noise or violations of federal, state, or local regulations associated with  1 emitter activity and this resource has not been carried forward for site-specific analysis in 2 Chapter 4. 3 3.3.3 General Training Activity Impact Assessment 4 Both state forests are used for recreational activities, such as camping, hiking, hunting, fishing, and horseback riding, as well as for commercial activities such as logging.  Ground 6 vehicles, including passenger vehicles and heavy trucks, use the roads and trails at BRSF and 7 THSF.  Only electric or hand-powered boats are allowed on the recreational lakes at BRSF, but 8 gas-powered motor boats are used in other bodies of water at both forests.  Privately held 9 parcels of land in the forests are used for agriculture and low-density residential development. USEPA has stated 44 dB and 51 dB as typical DNL noise levels at a farm area 11 and a low-density residential area, respectively (USEPA, 1974). Based on noise levels 12 measured in similar settings, ambient noise levels (i.e., while military training is not under 13 way) at the forests are assumed to be 45 dB DNL. 14 Social surveys suggest that at noise levels below 45 dB day-night average sound level for subsonic noise (DNLmr), less than 1 percent of the affected population can be expected to 16 become highly annoyed, while at 65 dB DNLmr, about 7 percent of the population can be 17 expected to become highly annoyed by the noise. 18 GLI training would be conducted in preparation for covert missions where the chances of 19 survival and success are maximized by avoiding detection.  Training would be as similar to real-world missions as possible.  The following characteristics of the proposed missions are an 21 important factor in determining the patterns of noise and noise impacts. 22 • Avoid inhabited areas.  Avoidance of inhabited areas is in keeping with a “good 23 neighbor” policy and also provides realistic training for avoiding detection during real24 world contingency operations. • Use cover of darkness. Approximately 50 percent of the proposed training missions 26 would be conducted after dark. Although late-night missions are avoided to the 27 extent practicable, an estimated 20 percent of total missions would take place at least 28 partially after 10:00 PM and before 7:00 AM.  As mentioned in Section 3.3.1, noise events 29 during this time period are assessed a 10-dB penalty in calculating the DNL metric to account for additional annoyance caused by late-night noise.  During hunting season, 31 night operations would only occur two hours after sunset to two hours before sunrise. 32 • Aircraft use of low altitudes.  Low-altitude flight minimizes the chances of detection. 33 Lower-altitude flights are louder for people directly overflown, but noise levels drop 34 off relatively rapidly with lateral distance from the aircraft. Aircraft Operations 36 Appendix H, Section H.3.1.5 provides a detailed description of assumptions used in noise 37 modeling, with operational numbers based on the details provided in Chapter 2.  LAPT, 38 LLHI/E, AD, A/LVL, FARP, and OHO would involve aircraft maneuvering to designated 39 locations followed by training and then departure. Aircraft maneuvering to or from designated training locations would operate at low altitudes most of the time and would 1  conduct approximately 50 percent of operations after dark for reasons discussed above; the  2  percent of total operations that would occur at least partially between 10:00 PM and 7:00 AM  3  would vary by season.   Aircraft operations in noncongested areas and away from known  4  persons, structures, or vehicles are permitted below 500 feet AGL, in accordance with FAA  5  and Air Force regulations (14 CFR Part 91, 91.119, AFI 13-201 v3).  However, it is not possible  6  to know at any given time where all of the users of each forest are located.  To minimize the  7  likelihood of low-altitude overflights, an aircraft conducting GLI training would not operate  8  below 500 feet AGL except while descending to or climbing away from designated training  9  locations (e.g., HLZs/DZs, OHO locations, and FWALS).   While operating at 500 feet AGL,  10  aircraft that would commonly be used in GLI training would typically generate noise levels  11  less than 95 dB SEL, even if they were to directly overfly a listener (Table 3-9).  An SEL of 95 dB  12  has been adopted as a voluntary noise exposure limit for aircraft operating on Eglin Range  13  (Air Force, 2004).   Direct overflights by aircraft maneuvering to or from designated training  14  locations above 500 feet AGL would be infrequent because flight tracks would vary from one  15  mission to the next.  16  Aircraft types other than those listed in Table 3-9 would also participate in training exercises  17  but less frequently.  These other aircraft would have similar missions and generate similar  18  noise levels to those listed in Table 3-9.   19  Table 3-9.

Used standard acoustical conditions (59 degrees Fahrenheit and 70 percent relative humidity). 20 Assuming each mission spends an hour maneuvering to and from the training location and 21 that flight tracks are distributed evenly across the forest area over time, the noise level 22 generated by aircraft maneuvering to and from training areas would be below 45 dB DNLmr.  23 The CH-47D Chinook was used as a surrogate noise source for multiple aircraft types for the 24 purposes of this analysis. 1 Landings and takeoffs from dirt FWALS would be conducted by light propeller-driven aircraft 2 as part of LAPT.  Table 3-10 lists noise levels generated by an aircraft representative of LAPT 3 aircraft during landings and takeoffs.  Table 3-11 lists typical altitudes during approach and 4 departure operations for a standard flight profile of a representative aircraft (i.e., C-23 Sherpa).  5 During arrival operations, the aircraft is assumed to descend at 300 feet per nautical mile and 6 to reach the runway threshold (i.e., the end of the FWALS) at 50 feet AGL.  During approaches, 7 aircraft generally use very low engine power settings, and noise levels are relatively low 8 (see Table 3-10).  Altitudes during departure would depend on where the aircraft rotates 9 (i.e., becomes airborne).  Aircraft typically use full power during departure so that they can 10 climb as quickly as possible and, thus, generate higher noise levels than during approach. 11 Table 3-10.

Assumes 300 feet descent for each nautical mile traveled horizontally.  *2.  Assumes standard climb-out profile for surrogate aircraft, the C-23 Sherpa.  13  LAPT sorties would be conducted five times per day, 232 days per year.   Each sortie could  14  include up to four aircraft but would normally include only one aircraft.  Aircraft would  15  typically only make one approach to any given FWALS.  For the purpose of this analysis, the C 16  23 Sherpa was used a surrogate noise source representing multiple aircraft types, and all  17  operations were assumed to follow a single flight path, effectively concentrating noise to the  18  greatest extent possible.   It was also assumed that runways are used with equal frequency  19  and 20 percent of operations were assumed to occur after 10:00 PM.  20  Light propeller-driven aircraft are quiet compared with most other aircraft used by the  21  military.  Individual overflights by these aircraft at low altitude may be disruptive and  22  annoying to residents or transient users of the areas surrounding the FWALS.   However,  23  overflights of light aircraft would be infrequent, and noise generated would be similar to  24  other propeller-driven aircraft noise heard in the area currently.  Operations by rotorcraft such  25  as the CV-22 are generally louder than light propeller-driven aircraft, and A/LVL training  would only be conducted at locations that are relatively remote from known noise-sensitive locations. When conditions at the FWALS become less than ideal for training (e.g., when growth of surrounding trees make landing and takeoff unsafe), the FWALS would no longer be used. New FWALS would be sited in areas at least 9,300 feet from campgrounds or privately owned parcels with residential structures.  At this distance, noise impacts associated with operations at the new FWALS would be expected to be minimal, even under a scenario where all LAPT training and one-fifth of total A/LVL training occurs at a single FWALS. As described in Section 2.3.2.1, HLZ/DZs would be established but then replaced as needed when vegetation height or other conditions become less than ideal for training.  Therefore, noise impacts were calculated relative to a nominal HLZ/DZ without any fixed location.  There would be about one training event per day at each HLZ/DZ, including LLHI/E, AD and A/LVL, once GLI training is at full capacity.  Under normal circumstances, training events at HLZs/DZs would include one or two aircraft.  Approximately 20 percent of training events are expected to occur after 10:00 PM.  Noise levels were calculated for a scenario where about 20 percent of total LLHI/E and AD training events are conducted at each nominal HLZ/DZ.  A/LVL training would also be conducted at FWALS, meaning that a lower percentage of total operations (13 percent) would be conducted at any given HLZ/DZ. The MV-22 was used as a surrogate aircraft noise source for multiple aircraft types that would conduct LLHI/E and A/LVL operations at the HLZs/DZs. C-130 aircraft would be the most common aircraft type conducting AD training at HLZs/DZs and was used as the noise surrogate for this type of training.  C-17 aircraft would conduct AD training only two to three days per year.  Noise levels reflect a worst-case scenario where all operations are concentrated on a single flight path and hover location.  In fact, approaches and departures would be distributed across multiple flight paths, and hover would occur anywhere within the HLZ. This distribution would result in lower time-averaged noise levels at any given location than those calculated.  Noise levels greater than 55 dB DNL could occur at up to 2,200 feet laterally from the HLZ/DZ and up to 200 feet laterally from approach/departure paths.  To avoid excessive annoyance, HLZ/DZs and HLZ/DZ approach and departure paths would be greater than these distances from known noise-sensitive locations (e.g., campgrounds, privately owned parcels with residences). OHO would take place at surveyed locations in open water up to once per month. Training events could include up to four aircraft, but one or two aircraft per event would be typical. For the purposes of this analysis, it was assumed that all OHO operations would take place at a single location.  Because the frequency of OHO operations is low relative to other types of GLI training, time-averaged noise levels generated would be low, dropping to below 55 dB DNL at a distance of approximately 400 feet from a single nominal hover location. However, individual OHO operations could be highly disruptive and annoying to people located nearby.  The noise level of a CV-22 hovering at 80 feet AGL drops to about 74 dB across water at a distance of about 2,200 feet.  Water absorbs very little sound energy and, therefore, sound waves traveling across water lose less intensity than sound waves traveling across land. To avoid excessive disturbances caused by hovering rotorcraft noise, OHO hover locations 1  would not be sited less than 2,200 feet (i.e., the same distance applied to HLZ/DZs) from  2  known noise-sensitive locations.  3  Munitions Use  4  Approximately 8,000 blank 7.62-millimeter (mm) (M240) and 10,000 5.56-mm (M4) rounds  5  would be fired per training event.  In total, 576,000 blank 5.56-mm rounds and 196,200 blank  6  7.62-mm rounds would be fired annually.  At BRSF, noise-generating expendables would only  7  be used at hardened campsites.  Blank rounds do not fire a bullet and are quieter than live  8  rounds.  Many of these rounds would be fired indoors, and would generate limited noise  9  outside. As described in Army Regulation 200-1, noise-sensitive land use where small arms  10  noise exceeds 87 dB PK 15(met) is discouraged, and noise-sensitive land uses where small  11  arms noise exceeds 104 dB PK 15(met) is strongly discouraged. Table 3-12 lists distances from  12  the training location at which gunfire noise levels drop below these threshold levels.  Noise  13  levels were calculated for a position 90 degrees to the right of the line of fire.  14  Approximately two to five ground-burst simulators would be used during each training event,  15  for a total of 5,172 ground burst simulators used annually.  Ground burst simulators were  16  assumed to be used with equal frequency at the former STOP Camp and SRYA.  Army  17  Regulation 200-1 discourages noise-sensitive land use where explosives noise exceeds 62 dB  18  CDNL and strongly discourages noise-sensitive land uses where noise from explosives  19  exceeds 70 dB CDNL. Table 3-12 lists the distances from location of detonation at which peak  20  noise levels drop below threshold levels.  21  Table 3-12.

Ground vehicles would also be used to transport support personnel and equipment to training locations. Table 3-13 lists noise levels for heavy trucks such as a 2.5–ton truck and HMMWVs.  Ground vehicle training would make use of a wide variety of vehicles.  Smaller vehicles, such as minibikes, would generally be expected to be quieter than HMMWVs or heavy trucks.  Table 3-13.

Navy, 2003   2  Ground vehicles using roads and trails on the forests include passenger vehicles as well as  3  heavy trucks used for industrial activities, such as logging. Noise generated by ground vehicle  4  operations conducted as part of GLI training may be annoying to persons in the forests or  5  private inholdings, particularly when it occurs at night, generating impacts that would be  6  considered moderate. Noise impacts would be localized to the area where ground vehicles  7  are operating and would be limited to the duration of the training event.  8  Amphibious Operations  9  Amphibious Operations (AO) training events would involve up to six watercraft equipped  10  with engines ranging from 35 to 200 horsepower (hp).  When operated at full throttle,  11  outboard engines generate noise that is often considered intrusive. For example, twin 225-hp  12  engines often generate noise louder than 100 dB at 10 feet from the motors (Rudow, 2004).  13  While training for covert missions and operating in relatively confined bodies of water, boats  14  would not be expected to use full throttle often.  AOs would be expected to occur only about  15  10 times per year and would be distributed among several water bodies at each forest.  16  Impacts would be localized to the body of water in which training is taking place and would  17  last only for the duration of the training event. Noise impacts from AOs would be considered  18  moderate in intensity.  19  3.3.3.1 General Training Activity Impact Assessment Summary  20  Based on the scope of action described in Chapter 2, all of the training activities would have  21  at least some interaction with noise receptors. Table 3-14 identifies potential interactions  22  between the Proposed Action effectors and noise receptors.  The location of transient users in  23  the state forests at any given time is not known, and some users would be exposed to  24  elevated noise levels. However, application of mission planning procedures, as identified in  25  Section 2.5, would reduce the exposure as much as is practicable.  26  Based on the general training activity impact assessment described previously, activities  27  associated with munitions use and aircraft operations could cause adverse impacts and are,  28  therefore, carried forward for site-specific analyses in Chapters 5 (BRSF) and 6 (THSF). These  29  activities are shaded yellow in the table below. Activities shaded in green have little potential  30  to impact public health or safety or the human and natural environment or do not result in  31  potential violations of federal, state, or local regulations. Therefore; these activities are not  32  carried forward for detailed analysis in Chapters 5 and 6.  1 Table 3-14.  Receptor and Effector Interactions for Noise Table 3-14.

Boats used in GLI training would not be expected to differ  substantially in noise signature from boats using the water bodies currently. Thus, the increase in  use associated with the Proposed Action would not be expected to result in a noticeable increase in  noise. This issue area has not been carried forward for site-specific analysis.  Utilities  Utilities usage would not increase the baseline noise environment and, thus, would have no effect.  This issue area has not been carried forward for site-specific analysis.  dB = decibels; DZ = drop zone; FFS = Florida Forest Service; GBS = ground burst simulators; GLI = GRASI Landscape Initiative; HLZ = helicopter landing zone; OHO = overwater hoist operations; SRYA = Santa Rosa Youth Academy; STOP = Short-Term Offender Program 1 3.3.4 Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations 2 The following mitigations to minimize adverse noise-related impacts have been identified 3 based on the general impact analyses conducted in Section 3.3: 4 • Aircraft would not operate below 500 feet AGL except while engaged in approaches 5 to, departures from, or training at designated HLZ/DZ, OHO locations, or FWALS. 6 • HLZ/DZs would be sited at not less than 2,200 feet from known noise-sensitive 7 locations. Known noise-sensitive locations include campgrounds and privatelyowned 8 parcels with at least one residential structure. 9 • Maneuvers near the HLZ/DZ (i.e., initial approach, departure, circling and pattern work 10 at less than 500 feet AGL) would not be conducted at distances less than 200 feet from 11 known noise-sensitive locations. 12 • OHO locations would not be located within 2,200 feet of known noise-sensitive 13 locations. 14 • The full spectrum of HLZ/DZ aircraft training (i.e., LLHI/E, AD, and A/LVL) would only be 15 permitted at FWALS that are remote from all known noise-sensitive locations (i.e., 16 FWALS in TA-1, the northern half of Munson Airstrip, and all FWALS in THSF). Only 17 LAPT would be allowed at the FWALS in TA-9. 18 • New FWALS would not be located within 9,300 feet of known noise-sensitive locations 19 if they would also be approved for the full spectrum of HLZ/DZ uses. 20  3.4 SAFETY  21  This section addresses safety associated with activities conducted by Eglin AFB as they relate  22  to the Proposed Action.  Discussed are safety issues associated with flight-based operations,  23  including operations around HLZs/DZs and related training, such as ADs.   This section also  24  details potential safety impacts of ground-and water-based training activities, including BD  25  and AOs, and the potential for training-related fires.  1 In addition, this section addresses safety impacts related to EMR emissions from the use of 2 training emitters.  EMR emissions are characterized as the emissions of non-ionizing EMR 3 within the radio frequency (RF) and infrared/visual/ultraviolet spectrum used by man-made 4 emitters, including radar systems, telemetry systems, and training emitters. Radar systems and training emitters are considered EMR emitters, and telemetry systems can transmit data 6 by way of microwave data links. The microwave transmitters are considered the only EMR 7 sources associated with telemetry systems. Due to the potential for hazardous human 8 exposure to EMR emissions under the Proposed Action, potential safety issues were analyzed 9 and, where appropriate, measures to reduce the potential for impacts were identified. These mitigations are discussed in Section 3.4.4. 11 3.4.1 Impact Assessment Methodology 12 The impact assessment methodology for safety comprises a review of regulatory drivers 13 affecting safety; analysis of the Proposed Action and how it could pose safety risks; and 14 evaluation of the significance of potential impacts in terms of type, context, duration, and intensity. These factors are detailed below. 16 3.4.1.1 Regulatory Drivers 17 The primary standards and regulations that apply to safety as it relates to the Proposed Action 18 are summarized below. 19 • Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSA), USC, Title 29, Chapter 15:  The OSA is the primary federal law that governs occupational health and safety in the private sector 21 and federal government in the United States.  Its main goal is to ensure that employers 22 provide employees with an environment free from recognized hazards, such as 23 exposure to toxic chemicals, excessive noise levels, mechanical dangers, heat or cold 24 stress, or unsanitary conditions. (Note: Under Title 29 CFR 1960 series, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards do not apply to military-unique 26 workplaces, operations, equipment, and systems.  However, according to DoD instruction, 27 they will be followed insofar as is possible, practicable, and consistent with military 28 requirements.) 29 • Forest Protection, Florida Statutes, Title XXXV, Chapter 59:  Among other things, this regulation establishes fire safety measures and fire response procedures at state31 owned forests/parks. 32 • Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 6055.1, DoD Safety and Occupational Health 33 (SOH) Program, dated 19 August 1998:  Establishes occupational safety and health 34 guidance for managing and controlling health and safety risks for DoD personnel and operations worldwide during peacetime and military deployments.  It specifically 36 addresses risk management, aviation safety, ground safety, radiation safety, traffic 37 safety, occupational safety, and occupational health. 38 • AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection and Health 39 (AFOSH) Program, dated 1 June 1996:  Identifies occupational safety, fire prevention, and health regulations governing Air Force activities and procedures associated with 41 safety in the workplace. 1 • Air Force Manual 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards, dated 12 January 2011: 2 Regulates and identifies procedures for explosives safety and handling as well as 3 defines requirements for ordnance quantity distances, safety buffer zones, and storage 4 facilities. 5 • AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations, dated 10 May 2007: Requires a 6 survey for safety and environmental considerations of all potential HLZs before use. 7 • AFOSH Standard 48-9, Electro-Magnetic Frequency (EMF) Radiation Occupational Health 8 Program:  Establishes occupational safety and health guidance for managing and 9 controlling the reduction of RF exposure. 10 • Eglin Air Force Base Instruction (EAFBI) 13-212, Range Planning and Operations, dated 11 20 December 2010:  Establishes procedures for the execution of operations within the 12 Eglin Test and Training Complex.

For example, the analysis evaluated whether proposed aircraft training activities 26 would pose any new or unique risks to military personnel or the general public over those 27 currently experienced at the proposed training and emitter locations. Likewise, the analysis 28 evaluated whether current practices would be adequate to prevent wildland fires from the 29 proposed Use of Expendables. 30 Table 3-15.

The level of impact associated with safety  4  and the impact’s potential significance is determined by considering how Proposed Action  5  effectors could interact with the safe operation of aircraft/equipment and the safety of  6  military personnel, the public, or property in terms of context, intensity, and duration as  7  described in Table 3-15.  Table 3-16 explains the impact level categories for safety analyzed in  8  this EIS and identified in Chapters 4, 5, and 6.  9  Table 3-16.  Impact Level Categories for Safety  Level of Impact  Safety Receptors  Adverse  Adverse safety impacts may result in hazards to military personnel or the general public, the level of impact directly related to the impact attributes described in Table 3-15.  Adverse impacts may be perceived as significant under high-intensity scenarios of any duration if safety procedures could not be expected to adequately reduce the risk and risks could result in loss of life and/or property. Insignificant safety impacts may occur under medium-intensity scenarios of any duration where safety hazards to military personnel and the public are potentially increased over the baseline condition but could be mitigated by minimal modification of established safety procedures.  Neutral/no effect  Activities do not pose a potential risk for injury to military personnel or the general public or cause damage to property. Established procedures adequately control safety risks or improve the safety condition of military personnel or the general public.  10  3.4.2  General Emitter Activity Impact Assessment  11  As it relates to EMR, human exposure is defined as exposure to hazardous levels of EMR that  12  would result in adverse biological effects.  These hazard safety levels, referred  to  as  13  permissible exposure limits (PELs), are used to develop safety standards for the operation and  14  maintenance of EMR emitters.  15  EMR exposure from an emitter source depends on several factors related to the operational  16  parameters of the emitter, including the type of emitter, the system power density, the  17  location of the emitter, and its proximity to anthropogenic and biological (plants or animals)  18  organisms.  The potential impacts from radar systems and microwave transmitters can be  19  assessed using hazard areas.   Human hazard areas are based on exposure levels, and are  20  regulated, maintained, and controlled by 96 AMDS/SGPB to ensure that the general public  21  and military personnel are not exposed to hazardous levels of EMR.  The height of the radar  22  system is also considered to understand how high above the ground the hazard exists.   In  23  general,  radar  systems are frequently equipped  with  a  mitigating measure (elevation  1  interlock) that shuts the system down if the radiating beam drops below horizontal, reducing  2  the chance of exposure to terrestrial organisms (U.S. Air Force, 2003).  3  Three types of emitter systems would be utilized under the Proposed Action: the KTM system,  4  the MCM system, and the JTE.  The MCM and KTM systems do not emit EMR.  The JTE does  emit EMR and, therefore, could adversely impact humans.  JTE systems have three primary  6  components: the threat emitter unit (TEU) radar emitters, the TEU pedestal emitters, and the  7  command and control unit (C2U) identification, friend or foe (IFF) antenna. Each component  8  presents the potential for EMR exposure to anthropogenic receptors.  9  Based on a JTE systems safety hazard analysis (SSHA) report, personnel must maintain at least  400 feet from the TEU radar emitters, TEU pedestal emitters, and C2U antennas during  11  operation to comply with the OSHA radiation limit of 10 milliwatts per square centimeter  12  (mW/cm2).  Encroaching within the 400 feet hazard area can result in adverse effects to  13  humans.  Additionally, EEDs must maintain a safe distance of 268.7 feet, and fuel must be  14  stored no closer than 198.3 feet from the JTE to comply with the 5-mW/cm2 radiation limit  (MTC and Northrop, 2008).  The human hazard area was overlaid at each of the proposed  16  emitter sites to determine the anthropogenic receptors potentially affected by EMR exposure.  17  Table 3-15 defines the level of impacts that could potentially occur from EMR exposure.  18  Based on the scope of action described Chapter 2, EMR exposure from emitter activities could  19  impact the following receptors that may be proximate to the proposed emitter sites:  members of the general public, FFS resident staff, FFS daily staff, and sheriff department staff  21  (see Table 2-1 in Chapter 2).  The MCM and KTM systems do not radiate EMR; therefore, no  22  significant or adverse effects would occur.  Adverse impacts would occur if the JTE emitter’s  23  safety hazard area interferes with areas open to the general public.  However, as part of the  24  Proposed Action, emitters would be placed in accordance with the SHDs described in the  2008 SSHA report to avoid populated areas (habitable buildings, recreation sites, etc.) and  26  comply with the OSHA radiation limits.  The emitter sites would also be fenced, or have other  27  security measures in place to prevent unauthorized personnel from entering the safety  28  hazard areas.   29  The use of emitters and associated EMR exposure could also impact biological resources  (Section 3.8), land use (Section 3.10), and socioeconomic resources (minority and low-income  31  populations) (Section 3.11).  Potential impacts to these resource areas are discussed in the  32  respective sections.  EMR exposure is not expected to impact any other resource areas.  Site 33  specific emitter use is further detailed in Chapter 4.  34  During the scoping period for this Proposed Action, members of the public expressed safety  concerns over the interaction between emitters and in-flight pilot instrumentation.  The use  36  of training emitters would not impact civil air traffic or the ATC system.  Training emitters  37  transmit at a specific frequency to simulate a threat. Civil air traffic would only detect the  38  threat if the aircraft receiver were tuned to the emitter frequency.  39  3.4.3 General Training Activity Impact Assessment  Based on the scope of action described in Chapter 2, the following proposed activities would  41  cause impacts only at a very low to neutral level.  Therefore, these are not discussed further in  42  this document:  land disturbance, ground movement (dismounted movement), and utilities  43  usage. These activities are conducted on a day-to-day basis and would result only in minor  potential impacts to safety that would be mitigated through General Operational Constraints identified in Section 2.5. The following training activities could result in potential safety impacts, and are discussed in greater detail in this document: ground movement (i.e., operations with wheeled vehicles), UoEX, aircraft operations (i.e., general flight operations, HLZs/DZs, LLHI/Es, ADs, FARP/HGO, and AOs. The main safety issue to the general public is associated with an increase in the potential for wildfires caused by various training activities.  Because activities would occur at a state forest, the FFS has the primary responsibility for prevention, detection, and suppression of wildfires wherever they may occur. The FFS provides leadership and direction in the evaluation, coordination, allocation of resources, and monitoring of wildfire management and protection. To minimize the potential for fires from the Use of Expendables and general training activities (such as idling vehicles and aircraft), before a mission begins, units would obtain the daily fire danger rating and coordinate with FFS personnel to ensure that adequate fire response is available if needed.  Under Florida law, it is unlawful for any person to set fire to, or cause fire to be set to, any wildlands or to build a campfire or bonfire or to burn trash or other debris within the designated area of a severe drought emergency unless a written permit is obtained from the division or its designated agent.  Units would also appoint a fire marshal on a daily basis while in the field to ensure all personnel have been trained concerning the safe use of incendiary devices and to supervise the immediate suppression of fires. All fires would be reported as soon as possible to the FFS and to local fire department, as necessary. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) and associated General Operational Constraints in Section 2.5 prescribe the regulations and general precautions to be taken in the Use of Expendables and energy-producing equipment, as well as the use of training/maneuver areas, airspace, and landing and drop zones.  Safety procedures associated with routine training operations are designed to minimize or altogether eliminate risks to the public. These procedures would be implemented through the individual organization, based on its specific training protocols/guidance.  Potential impacts related to proposed activities and existing safety procedures to minimize these impacts would be applied at both BRSF and THSF and are discussed below. Ground Movement (Wheeled Operations) Routine vehicle operations would be conducted in accordance with established traffic laws and would present minimal risks. However, NVG/BD is considered a high-risk training event. To perform NVG operations at Eglin AFB, a risk management plan must be prepared in accordance with the unit’s command policy statement for each exercise utilizing NVGs; this same procedure would be applied at BRSF and THSF. BD must occur only on roads designated for this use and that are closed to the public. Additionally, commanders must establish NVG speed limits consistent with weather, terrain, and the NVG driving skill level of all soldiers participating as assessed in the risk management plan.  However, speed limits would not exceed 15 miles per hour. Commanders must also ensure driver/operators that have not driven under NVG conditions in the past six months receive organizational refresher training prior to participating in NVG driving operations. Finally, trainers must ensure that safety briefings include a review of NVG limitations (especially the restriction of peripheral vision), limits in seeing through obscurants (smoke, fog, dust), and the need for preventive maintenance. Use of Expendables Ground-burst simulators and smoke cartridges would be employed as part of proposed activities.  Ground-burst simulators replicate the detonation of artillery and mortar projectiles or artillery-type rockets.  They typically produce a high-pitched whistle that lasts two to four seconds and then detonate with a loud report and brilliant flash. Smoke cartridges are used by ground soldiers to signal aircraft.  They are designed to produce a smoke cloud that lasts up to 30 seconds.  The devices operate by burning and/or detonating a small pyrotechnic charge.  Safety procedures are currently in place to prevent potential injuries associated with loud noises or with flying debris generated during detonation of these devices.  These procedures include training personnel in the proper use of these devices and the implementation of applicable safety or exclusion zones, depending on the type of pyrotechnics used. UoEX also poses a danger for causing a fire; the major causes of forest fires at Eglin AFB are incendiary training aids such as flares, blanks, simulators, pyrotechnics, and smoke grenades, as well as incendiary ammunition and incendiary and smoke devices dropped from aircraft. Other causes fires not related to training aids are typical causes of wildfires at locations outside of military testing and training areas. These include careless use of cigarettes and matches, improper control of campfires, and vehicle ignition/idling on dry grass. The potential for wildfire at both BRSF and THSF would increase over the baseline condition due to the Use of Expendables. At Eglin AFB, climatic conditions may dictate restrictions on the types of munitions to be fired during portions of the year to minimize the danger of fires, and this would be applied at BRSF and THSF in coordination with state forest managers in conjunction with state forest fire ratings.  Since 2009, approximately 300 fires have occurred at Eglin AFB as a result of military mission activities; it is unknown exactly how many are related to the Use of Expendables. Before a mission begins, units must obtain the daily fire danger rating by visiting the Eglin AFB Environmental Management Homepage. Adherence to these pyrotechnics restrictions is mandatory. Fire ratings for operations are listed below. • Fire danger low – No restrictions on missions. • Fire danger moderate – No restrictions on pyrotechnics. A fire watch must be posted for at least 20 minutes after completing the use of pyrotechnics. • Fire danger high – Use caution with pyrotechnics. Post a fire watch for a minimum of 30 minutes after completing use of pyrotechnics. Extra precautions required for campfires. • Fire danger very high – Restrict pyrotechnics to hand-thrown simulators or smoke grenades. No flares of any type.  Use simulators or grenades only on roads or in pits. Cleared areas for pyrotechnics should be a minimum of 1.5 times the blast radius. No campfires. • Fire danger extreme – No pyrotechnics allowed without prior approval from the Wildland Fire Program Manager (WFPM) or designee at the Eglin AFB Natural Resources Section. All training activities would adhere to General Operational Constraints identified in Section 2.5, which include coordination with the each respective FFS forest dispatch to obtain the current fire rating for the respective forest prior to training.  Units must also appoint a fire marshal on a daily basis (eligible personnel must have a minimum rank of a noncommissioned officer or equivalent rank) while in the field to ensure all personnel have been trained concerning the safe use of incendiary devices and to supervise the immediate suppression of fires.  All fires must be reported as soon as possible to the L.I.T. and respective forest operations center. Aircraft Operations Eglin AFB has well-established procedures for proposed training operations, including the use of HLZs/DZs, low-level insertions, ADs, LAPT, and OHO. These procedures would be utilized for training activities under the Proposed Action. These procedures include ensuring that during LAPT operations, any roads used for landing are closed to all vehicle traffic. Procedures also include mandatory use of a landing zone controller (LZC)/drop zone controller (DZC) for all helicopter operations, and during hours of darkness for fixed-wing air-land operations.  LZC/DZC personnel would be responsible for all activities on and immediately above the landing zone/drop zone (LZ/DZ).  The LZC/DZC would attend the crew briefing to discuss issues such as position of block letters, runway lighting, radio frequencies, etc. As a minimum, the LZC/DZC must coordinate with the aircrew prior to the aircrew departing for the aircraft.  Ambulance and crash rescue support must also be coordinated during the scheduling process. The LZC/DZC would coordinate a drop/landing zone closure plan to include temporary obstructions (cones) and signage.  The LZC/DZC would also implement the access control plan and ensure the area is safe for operations. Established procedures require that the LZC/DZC contact the Range Operations Control Center (ROCC) at least 30 minutes before operations begin to take responsibility for the area, to ensure that the airspace/mission has been activated. Prior to making this call, the LZC/DZC would ensure the range/area closure plan has been implemented and all nonparticipating personnel are clear of hazardous operations.  The LZC/DZC would maintain two-way radio communication with the drop aircraft and with Eglin AFB Mission Control.  In the event of radio communication failure, a single red smoke grenade or other established visual signal would be used to indicate “no drop” and operations would be suspended until air-to-ground communications are reestablished. When helicopter operations are being conducted at a remote site not involving a mission profile, the Eglin Radar Control Facility (ERCF) issues visual flight rules (VFR) traffic advisory information on a workload permitting basis to all aircraft transiting the area occupied by the helicopter, to include operation area and corresponding altitudes, if known.  The transient altitude for all rotary wing aircraft across VFR corridors shall be at or below 500 feet AGL unless otherwise directed by Eglin AFB Mission Control. Over the last 15 years, approximately 42 fatal overland aircraft mishaps occurred in northwest Florida (extending from Tallahassee to Pensacola).  All of these mishaps were associated with general aviation (nonmilitary aircraft) (National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB], 2013). There have been no fatal overland mishaps involving military aircraft, and there are no recorded mishaps associated with collisions between general aviation and military aircraft. Over the same period, there have been a few nonfatal aircraft mishaps involving military aircraft.  The most significant of these were a June 2012 crash of a Bell-Boeing CV-22B Osprey during a routine training mission on the Eglin AFB reservation, and a November 2012 crash of a Tyndall AFB F-22 fighter just south of Panama City. To minimize the potential for mid-air collisions or near misses with other aircraft in the region when conducting HLZ/DZ, LAPT, or other similar training, the ERCF would issue a VFR traffic advisory to all aircraft transiting the area being used by the military.  Eglin AFB would continue to implement its Mid-Air Collision Avoidance (MACA) Program. This program is designed to help increase military pilot awareness of the training airspace and activities. Implementation of established procedures would ensure that the potential for mishaps involving military aircraft continues to be extremely low. Consequently, negligible impacts would be anticipated from implementation of the proposed action with respect to aircraft mishaps. Also, all units conducting FARP/HGO must have the fire department available during these training activities. A fire truck must be located a maximum of 1,000 feet from the fueling site, in plain view, and in direct communication with the team controlling the operation. No later than 30 minutes prior to scheduled operations, the fire truck would be on scene and notified by the on-scene commander when the aircraft arrives. All operations would take place over concrete or asphalt surfaces. For OHO activities the training unit, in conjunction with the organizational safety officer, must evaluate each operation in or over water (to include a risk analysis) to determine required safety measures based on type of operations, existing or expected conditions, and existing policy. The V-22 (Osprey) also poses a greater risk of starting wildfires than other aircraft. The V-22 rotates its engines to a vertical position for takeoffs and landings.  If the aircraft is operating over very dry vegetation, the hot downwash from the engines has the potential to cause a brush fire underneath.  For example, in June 2013, a Marine MV-22 started a grass fire at the Dare County Bombing Range in North Carolina.  It is unknown if the fire occurred during takeoff or landing.  The fire caused minor damage to the aircraft, and the burning vegetation had been contained before the Fire Department arrived (Jacksonville Daily News, 2013). To avoid potential wildfires, as part of normal operational constraints, V-22 operations would be restricted on days with high or greater fire danger, or alternatively, additional fire response personnel would be made available to extinguish any small fires before they could spread. Amphibious Operations These include AOs by boats/personnel.  As part of general operating constraints identified in Section 2.5, all land-water transitions involving boats coming ashore must use approved boat landing sites.  Water operations must also include a boat operator and a qualified safety swimmer for every boat.  Medical coverage must be in place prior to OHO or personnel ADs 1  into  the water.   If  medical personnel are  not in  the same safety boat as the DZC,  2  communications must be ensured.  3  Implementation of the procedures described above,  as  they relate to specific training  4  activities, would minimize or eliminate potential adverse impacts to safety.  5  3.4.3.1  General Training Activity Impact Assessment Summary  6  Table 3-17 summarizes potential interactions between Proposed Action effectors and safety  7  resource effectors.  Based on the general training activity impact assessment described  8  previously, activities associated with UoEX could cause adverse impacts and are, therefore,  9  carried forward for site-specific analyses in Chapters 5 (BRSF) and 6 (THSF).  These activities  10  are shaded yellow in the table below.  Activities shaded in green have little potential to  11  impact public health or safety or the human and natural environment or do not result in  12  potential violations of federal, state, or local regulations.

This component is referred to as a “receptor.”  Air quality is  7  affected by three primary sources of air pollutants: stationary (factories or power plants),  8  mobile (cars, planes, trains), and natural (windblown dust or volcanic eruptions).   The air  9  quality assessment considers the six criteria pollutants primarily from mobile sources and  10  munitions as well as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  11  3.5.1  Impact Assessment Methodology  12  The impact assessment for air quality evaluates the potential impacts of the Proposed Action  13  on air quality.   Impacts to air quality resources are evaluated according to type, context,  14  intensity, and duration (as described in Section 3.1), as well as regulatory drivers identified  15  below. Together, these attributes define the potential significance of the impacts.  1  3.5.1.1 Regulatory Drivers  2  Laws and regulations applicable to the Proposed Action for air quality and greenhouse gases  3  are summarized in this section.  4  Air Quality  Air quality is determined by the type and amount of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere,  6  the size and topography of the air basin, and the prevailing meteorological conditions.  The  7  severity or nonseverity of a pollutant’s concentration in a region or geographical area is  8  determined by comparing it with federal and/or state ambient air quality standards. Under  9  the authority of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the USEPA has established nationwide air quality  standards to protect public health and welfare with an adequate margin of safety.  11  The baseline standards for pollutant concentrations are the National Ambient Air Quality  12  Standards (NAAQS) and state air quality standards.  These standards represent the maximum  13  allowable atmospheric concentration that may occur and still protect public health and  14  welfare.  Further discussion of the NAAQS and state air quality standards are included in  Appendix D, Air Quality.   16  Based on measured ambient air pollutant concentrations, the USEPA designates whether  17  areas of the U.S. meet the NAAQS.  Those areas demonstrating compliance with the NAAQS  18  are considered “attainment” areas, while those not compliant are known as “nonattainment”  19  areas.  Those areas that cannot be classified on the basis of available information for a  particular pollutant are “unclassifiable” and are treated as attainment areas until proven  21  otherwise.  22  Greenhouse Gases  23  GHGs are chemical compounds in the earth’s atmosphere that trap heat in the atmosphere,  24  thus regulating the earth’s temperature.  Gases exhibiting greenhouse properties come from  both natural and human sources.  Water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and  26  nitrous oxide (N2O) are examples of GHGs that have both natural and man-made sources,  27  while other gases such as those used for aerosols are exclusively man-made.   28  The six primary GHGs, which are internationally recognized and regulated under the Kyoto  29  Protocol, are CO2, CH4, N2O, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur  hexafluoride (SF6).  There are other GHGs, such as water vapor and ozone, but for purposes of  31  this EIS, GHGs are defined in accordance with Section 19(i) of Executive Order (EO) 13514 as  32  the aforementioned primary six GHGs.  33  These six key GHGs have been found to threaten public health and welfare (USEPA’s  34  Endangerment Finding). The state of Florida has taken steps to reduce GHG emissions over a  10-year period by adopting maximum emission levels for electric utilities and adopting  36  California motor vehicle emission standards.  Detailed discussions of GHG regulations are  37  included in Appendix D, Air Quality.   1  3.5.1.2 Assessment Method  2  Air Quality  3  To evaluate air emissions and their impact on the overall region of influence (ROI), the  4  emissions associated with the project activities were compared with the total county  emissions on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis, using the USEPA’s 2008 National Emissions  6  Inventory (NEI) data (USEPA, 2012).  The county data include emissions data from point  7  sources, area sources, and mobile sources.  “Point sources” are stationary sources that can be  8  identified by name and location.  “Area sources” are point sources of emissions too small to  9  track individually, such as individual homes, small office buildings, or diffuse stationary  sources (e.g., wildfires or agricultural tilling equipment). “Mobile sources” are vehicles or  11  equipment with gasoline or diesel engines, e.g., an airplane or a ship.  Two types of mobile  12  sources are considered: on-road and nonroad. On-road mobile sources are vehicles such as  13  cars, light trucks, heavy trucks, buses, engines, and motorcycles. Nonroad sources are aircraft,  14  locomotives, diesel and gasoline boats and ships, personal watercraft, lawn and garden  equipment, agricultural and construction equipment, and recreational vehicles (USEPA, 2009).  16  Potential impacts to air quality are evaluated with respect to the extent, context, and intensity  17  of the impact in relation to relevant regulations, guidelines, and scientific documentation.  18  Table 3-18 defines how these impact attributes are applied to air quality and greenhouse  19  gases.  For a conservative analysis, the affected counties were selected as the ROI instead of the  21  USEPA-designated Air Quality Control Region (AQCR), which is a much larger area. Calculated  22  air emissions were compared with the annual total emissions of Okaloosa and Santa Rosa  23  Counties for BRSF activities.   For operations on THSF, calculated air emissions were compared  24  with the annual emissions for Franklin County.  The Air Conformity Applicability Model (ACAM) Version 4.5.0 was also utilized to provide a  26  level of consistency with respect to emissions factors and calculations. The ACAM provides  27  estimated air emissions from proposed federal actions in areas designated as nonattainment  28  and/or maintenance for each criterion and precursor pollutant, as defined in the NAAQS.  The  29  ACAM provided user inputs for construction, grading, and paving activities; these inputs were  then used to calculate emissions. Aircraft operations, vehicles, and munitions were calculated  31  using emission factors and calculation methods from AP-42 and the Air Emissions Guide for Air  32  Force Mobile Sources. The air quality analysis focused on emissions associated with the  33  construction activities, flight operations, munitions, and vehicle use.  34  Greenhouse Gases  The potential effects of GHG emissions from the Proposed Action are by nature global. Given  36  the global nature of climate change and the current state of the science, it is not useful at this  37  time to attempt to link the emissions quantified for local actions to any specific climatological  38  change or resulting environmental impact. Nonetheless, the GHG emissions from the  39  Proposed Action and alternatives have been quantified to the extent feasible in this EIS for  information and comparison purposes.  1  On February 18, 2010, the CEQ released its Draft NEPA Guidance on Consideration of the  2  Effects of Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions, which suggests that proposed  3  actions that would be reasonably anticipated to emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon  4  dioxide equivalent (CO2e) GHG emissions should be evaluated by quantitative and qualitative  5  assessments.   This is not a threshold of significance but a minimum level that would require  6  consideration in NEPA documentation. The purpose of quantitative analysis of CO2e GHG  7  emissions in this EIS is for its potential usefulness in making reasoned choices among  8  alternatives. Table 3-18 defines how the impact attributes of context, intensity, and duration  9  are applied to air quality analyses.  10  Table 3-18.  Definitions of Impact Attributes for Air Quality Categories  Attribute  Air Quality  Greenhouse Gases  Contexts Analyzed  Regional/population  Air Quality Control Region (AQCR); impacts to populations.  Localized  County level area effects; impacts to small segments of affected population or individuals.  Intensity (can be either adverse or beneficial)  High  Substantive change in emissions in the region exceeding local air quality guidelines.  Change in regional greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions greater than 25,000 metric tons (27,557 tons).  Medium  Moderate change in emissions in the region near local air quality guidelines.  Moderate change in regional GHG emissions near local air quality guidelines.  Low  Slight change in emissions within local air quality guidelines.

Table 3-19  16  explains the levels of impacts for air quality analyzed in this EIS and identified in Chapters 4, 5,  17  and 6.  18  Table 3-19.  Impact Level Categories for Air Quality  Level of Impact  Air Quality  Greenhouse Gases  Adverse  Adverse impacts are associated with increases in air pollutant emissions such that emissions are comparable to air quality emission standards.  Significant adverse impacts may occur under longto medium-term, high-intensity impacts that result in exceedence of regional air pollutant emission guidelines and standards. Insignificant impacts may result from short-to medium-term, medium-intensity impacts that increase the regional air pollutant emissions but within regional air pollutant guidelines and standards.  Neutral/no effect  Short-term impacts that result in minimal increase in regional air pollutant emissions.  GHG = greenhouse gas BRSF = Blackwater River State Forest; PM = particulate matter; ROI = region of influence 1 3.5.2 General Emitter Activity Impact Assessment 2 Based on the scope of action described in Chapter 2, emitter site use would not result in 3 significant adverse impacts to air quality, because the emitter sites are located across a large 4 area and would only produce small amounts of air pollutant emissions to the region from 5 generator use. The use of temporary emitter sites would have no impacts to air quality at sites 6 that have access to power. Transport of emitters to the sites and the use of generators would 7 produce small amounts of emissions and would be expected to result in short-term impacts. 8 Air emissions associated with emitter use are provided in Chapter 4, Section 4.5. 9 3.5.3 General Training Activity Impact Assessment 10 Air emissions would result from the following activities: land disturbance associated with land 11 development for use of roadways for aircraft operations, ground movement (wheeled vehicle 12 use), expendable use (training munitions), aircraft operations, and AO. Because the 13 movements and use of each of the locations is not known, it was assumed that the maximum 14 use of vehicles, expenditures, aircraft, and personnel would be used during each event. 15 Land Disturbance 16 Land disturbance emissions would result from the improvement of roadways for aircraft 17 operations.

Each of these earth resource components is referred to  13  as a “receptor.”   Geologic resources are consolidated or unconsolidated earth materials,  14  including ore and aggregate materials, fossil fuels, and significant landforms.  Soil is a natural,  15  three-dimensional material composed of solids (minerals and organic matter), liquid, and  16  gases that occurs on the land surface.   Soil is characterized by horizons or layers that are  17  distinguishable from the parent material, either as a result of additions, losses, transfers,  18  and/or transformations of energy and matter or the ability to support rooted plants in a  19  natural environment (USDA, 2010).  1  3.6.1 Impact Assessment Methodology  2  The impact assessment for earth resources evaluates the potential impacts of the Proposed  3  Action on geology and soils.  Impacts to these resources are evaluated according to type,  4  context, intensity, and duration (as described in Section 3.1), as well as the regulatory drivers  identified below. Together, these attributes define the potential significance of the impacts.  6  3.6.1.1 Regulatory Drivers  7  For this assessment, regulations relating to earth resource impact potentials are primarily  8  associated with the effects of soil detachment (erosion) and deposition of materials  9  (sedimentation) on aquatic resource water quality and habitats, prime farmland soils, and  erodible land.  For more information on federal and state water quality regulations refer to  11  Section 3.7.1.1, Water Resources, Regulatory Drivers. Laws and regulations applicable to the  12  Proposed Action for earth resources are summarized below.  13  • Prime farmland soils are protected under the Farmland Protection Policy Act (FPPA) of  14  1981.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines prime farmland soils as those best  suited to food, feed, forage, fiber, and oilseed crops.  Farming these soils produces the  16  highest yields with minimal energy and economic resources expenditures and the  17  least environmental damage. They are generally fertile, are not excessively erodible or  18  saturated by groundwater of flooding during the growing season, and slope generally  19  from 0 to 5 percent (USDA NRCS, 1995).  For more information on prime and unique  farmlands see:  21  http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_99/7cfr657_99.html.  22  • “Erodible land” is defined by the Sodbuster, Conservation Reserve, and Conservation  23  Compliance parts of the Food Security Act of 1985 and the Food, Agriculture,  24  Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990.  Determinations for highly erodible land are  based on an erodibility index as defined in the National Food Security Act Manual.   26  Policy and procedures for developing and maintaining highly erodible land are given  27  in Part 511 of the manual:  28  (ftp://ftp.tx.nrcs.usda.gov/NHQ/programs/Appeals%20Training/FSANRCS_NAD_POLIC  29  Y/NFSAM_HEL_common.pdf).  The Proposed Actions would comply with established Division of Forestry and Air Force  31  resource management plans and instructions (e.g., EAFBI 13-212, Range Planning and  32  Operations, Chapter 7 – Environmental Management).  These documents include planning  33  goals and activity directives relating to the management of earth resources and practices to  34  minimize and mitigate impacts.  1  3.6.1.2 Assessment Method  2  The assessment entailed evaluating impacts from the Proposed Action to earth resources on  3  BRSF and THSF.  The assessment focused on potential physical and chemical damage to  4  geology and soils and subsequent impacts to water resources, such as sedimentation from  accelerated soil erosion and/or water contamination.  6  Physical damage includes disturbances to the structural and/or biological properties of soil or  7  geologic features that compromise their natural condition and function.  Examples include  8  compaction, rutting, accelerated (human-induced) soil rill and gully erosion, and generation  9  of dust or mud. Chemical damage occurs when resources are chemically or biologically  altered due to the introduction of organic and inorganic materials (e.g., contamination of soil  11  and geologic features from chemical fluid leaks or spills).  12  Soil erosion is a three-phase process of detachment, transport, and deposition of surface  13  materials by water flowing over land.  Erosion is difficult to control and easily accelerated by  14  humans.  Accelerated erosion caused by humans occurs at rates much greater than under  natural erosion conditions.  Large quantities of eroded soil sediment delivered to streams can  16  adversely affect channel morphology, degrade aquatic species habitats, and impair water  17  quality.  Such sedimentation increases water column turbidity, alters water chemistry  18  parameters, and introduces chemical contaminants and other pollutants.  19  Geologic Resources Addressed  Karst Terrain  21  Karst terrain is formed by the dissolution (chemical solution) of underlying soluble carbonate  22  rocks—primarily limestone and dolomite—by surface water and/or ground water.  This  23  unique landscape is characterized by rapid permeability, as water flows through  24  interconnected subsurface voids. As weakly acidic stormwater migrates through soils and  rock fractures, it dissolves bedrock materials, creating solution pipes, cavities, caverns, and  26  sinkholes. Karst sinkholes occur when cavities, caverns, and/or solution pipes cause the  27  collapse of overburden materials into subsurface voids, creating depressions that can range  28  from a few feet to hundreds of feet in diameter.  Because of their high permeability and lack  29  of a natural filtration system, karst areas are particularly vulnerable to pollution.  In northwest  Florida, sensitive karst terrain frequently serves as recharge for the Floridan aquifer system.  31  Thus, pollution of karst areas could expose drinking water aquifers to contamination  32  (NWFWMD, 2010b; Southwest Florida Water Management District, 2007; Tihansky and  33  Knochenmus, 2001; Lane, 1986).  34  Closed Depressions  A closed depression is a landform where the hill slopes encircle a common sediment  36  depository, and the sediment eroded from the surrounding hill slopes is trapped in the  37  system.  These ground depression sinks function as reservoirs for stormwater runoff and  38  groundwater seepage and may hold water for extended periods of time.  Soil Resources Addressed Soil Inventories Soils were inventoried for Proposed Action locations; highly erodible, potentially highly erodible, and hydric soils (associated with wetlands and floodplains) are identified. Some shallow gradient terraces, flats, depressions, and floodplain wetlands that exhibit fluctuating near-surface water tables and/or frequent-to-occasional flooding exhibit wet soil conditions are classified as hydric soils. These soils are under conditions of saturation, Wetland Hydric Soils (Photo by Mike Rainer) flooding, or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic (lacking oxygen) conditions in the upper part (USACE, 1987) (see photo of Wetland Hydric Soils).  Due to fluctuations in surface and subsurface hydrology, some hydric soils may have nonhydric phases. Hydric soils are used as an indicator to identify and classify jurisdictional wetlands (see Section 5.7.1).  In addition, prime farmland areas were identified. Timber production qualifies as farmed land under the Farmland Protection Policy Act (see Section 3.6.1.1, Regulatory Drivers), whereas urban areas or built-up land of 10 acres or more are not considered prime farmland. Erodible Soils The Natural Resources Conservation Service estimates which soils are highly erodible or potentially highly erodible due to sheet and rill erosion.  These estimates are primarily based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE).  This model utilizes soil, topography, rainfall, and land cover management variables to predict soil erodibility. A “highly erodible” soil has a maximum potential for erosion that equals or exceeds eight times the tolerable erosion rate.  In addition to the dominance of sandy soil, extensive areas that are moderately to steeply sloped strongly affects the erodibility of forest soils. Soil erodibility is only one component of the soil erosion process. The disturbance or loss of vegetative cover determines the extent to which erodible soils become erosive and exhibit sheet, rill, and/or gully features that can generate and transport sediment.  Depending on site variables, sediments may remain on-site or be transported great distances. Natural Soil Erosion Sources Natural erosion sources are those that occur as part of natural processes.  Human interaction tends to accelerate or exacerbate natural erosion processes. Streambanks Under natural conditions, streambank instabilities occur as a result of channel entrenchment and scouring of bendway cutbanks.  Bank retreat primarily results from mass failure of overheightened and oversteepened banks. Scour of the riverbed and bank toe increases the bank height and slope angle, decreasing its stability.  Noncohesive bank materials, such as sandy soils, tend to fail from bank slides and sloughing as the soil particles lose their shear strength because of saturation.  Site-specific failure mechanisms depend on the topography (height and steepness) and stratigraphy of the bank and the physical properties of the bank soils (Shields et al. 1995). Sources of streambank instabilities include highly permeable and erodible characteristics of sandy geologic formations and human-induced sedimentation associated with land uses such as silviculture, borrow pits, unpaved road crossings, and other activities (Hollie et al., 2010).  Heavy sediment loading of streams can reduce channel depth, which can widen the stream and increase channel flows, putting greater pressure on streambanks and resulting in accelerated bank erosion.  Unstable streambanks are also sensitive to human ingress and regress activities that could increase soil loss. Steepheads Steepheads are self-sustaining ecosystems created from the bottom up by a process known as “spring sapping.”  These springs give rise to many small streams and create small box canyons that are notched into the edges of the flat uplands.  Their formation begins with valley-head soil erosion at the point of groundwater discharge, followed by headwall slumping that creates a semicircular box canyon configuration.  The sandy clays near the surface remain vertical, while the underlying softer sands near the spring wash away. Typically, northwest Florida steepheads range from 50 to 70 feet deep and 100 to 200 feet wide and have side slopes with gradients exceeding 50 percent (Photo: Steephead Box Canyon Slopes). Because of their steep slopes, steephead canyons are highly susceptible to human-induced surface erosion. As exemplified in the photos below (Eroded Steephead Slopes, Santa Rosa County, Florida 1930 and Okaloosa County, Florida, 2005), ground disturbances that remove vegetative cover and/or concentrate surface runoff can cause catastrophic gully erosion that may damage or destroy these unique ecosystems. Eroded Steephead Slopes, Santa Rosa County, Florida, 1930 (State Archives of Florida) and Okaloosa  County, Florida, 2005 (Photo by Mike Rainer)  1  Gulf Coastline Erosion  2  Beach erosion (shoreline retreat) and sediment accretion (shoreline advance) are ongoing  3  natural processes along the Gulf of Mexico coastline. The dynamic coastal environment of  4  beaches and sand dunes is subject to drastic changes, particularly during tropical storms and  5  hurricanes.  During these events, extensive amounts of soil materials are subject to  6  suspension, transport, and deposition by high winds, storm surge, tides, waves, and  7  nearshore circulation. In extreme cases, enough beach sand may be eroded to expose  8  ancient tree stumps.  9  Accelerated Soil Erosion Sources  10  Accelerated erosion sources are those that result from human interaction with earth  11  resources.  12  Borrow Pits  13  Borrow pits are open mines used primarily as sources of sand and clayey materials for  14  unpaved road maintenance and reconstruction (Hollie et al., 2010).  These pits are potential  15  sources of severe soil erosion and sedimentation.  This fact is due to their state of perpetual  16  surface disturbance, bare surface conditions, common location in proximity to waterways,  17  accumulations of loose soil materials, and exposure of relatively impervious soil layers.  18  Unpaved Roads and Crossings  19  Places where roads cross streams and wetlands are representative of human imprinting on  20  the landscape and the resulting impacts on natural resources.  In particular, unpaved roads  21  and crossings severely impact aquatic ecosystems. Crossings allow contaminants and  22  sediments suspended in stormwater runoff to discharge directly into receiving waters.  23  Sedimentation caused by unpaved road crossings can result in violations of environmental  24  laws governing water quality, listed species, and their habitats.  In some cases, impacts from  25  such sedimentation are catastrophic to aquatic ecosystems.  26  Table 3-27 defines how the impact attributes of context, intensity, and duration are applied to  27  earth resource analyses.  1 Table 3-27.  Definitions of Impact Attributes for Earth Resources Attribute  Earth Resources  Contexts Analyzed  Regional  Sediment generated by the disturbance source rill and/or gully erosion features is discharged off-site onto adjacent land areas, water bodies, and/or watershed streams, and/or karst disturbance creates a subsidence closed depression or sinkhole incident that could adversely impact basin-or subbasin-level hydrology.  Localized  Soil damage alters surface/geohydrology patterns; sediment generated by sheet/rill erosion remains on-site in close proximity to the disturbance source and is not discharged into water resources, and/or impacts to hydrology from karst disturbance are limited to the immediate watershed area.  Site-specific  Soil compaction/rutting damage, erosion and sediment, and/or karst area disturbances would affect a relatively small area, may not affect the immediate surroundings, and would not extend beyond the site of disturbance.  Intensity (can be either adverse or beneficial)  High  Impact site disturbances are extensive: 1) prominent areas of compacted/rutted soil and/or gully features would deliver sediment off-site that may smother terrestrial vegetation or is discharged into water resources, a violation of state and/or regulations; 2) physical damages would alter existing karst topography and geohydrology and could lead to the development of closed depressions or sinkholes; and/or 3) soil contamination would create toxic site conditions and contaminants would likely move off-site and/or into groundwater.  Mitigations are required to avoid impact effects.  Medium  Impact site exhibits any or all of the following:  1) Prominent area(s) of compaction/rutting and/or gully features are present; however, generated sediment primarily remains on-site. 2) Disturbance would alter existing karst area surface and surface landform topography. 3) Soil contamination would alter soil chemistry and diminish soil productivity and/or biology. Mitigations may be required to avoid impact affects.  Low  Impact site exhibits: 1) soil compaction/rutting damage and/or sheet/rill erosion features are present but would quickly stabilize or be mitigated by on-site personnel or consultations with regulatory agencies; 2) karst area disturbances would be limited to the surface and would not alter existing karst topography or geohydrology; and/or 3) contamination may affect soil biology, but soil chemistry and productivity would not be altered.  Constraints and/or mitigations may be required.  Neutral  Impact site exhibits: 1) small areas of ground disturbance and the effects of erosion are imperceptible; no distinguishable erosion features would form; 2) site disturbance would not affect or alter existing karst topography or geohydrology; and/or 3) soil contamination would not alter site soil chemistry, biology, or productivity. No mitigations are required.  Duration  Long term  Effect of gully soil erosion features and/or karst area disturbance and contamination effects would persist for the duration of the program or beyond.  Medium  Effect of rill and/or gully soil erosion features and karst area disturbance and contamination effects would stabilize within months to years.  Short term  Effect of sheet and/or rill soil erosion features and karst area disturbance would stabilize within weeks to months.  2  3.6.1.3  Impact Levels  3  The level of impact associated with earth resources and the impact’s potential significance is  4  determined by considering how Proposed  Action  effectors  could  interact  with  earth  5  resources in terms of context, intensity, and duration as described in Table 3-27.   Table 3-28  6  explains the impact level categories for earth resources analyzed in this EIS and identified in  7  Chapters 4, 5, and 6.  Table 3-28.  Impact Level Categories for Earth Resources Attributes  Earth Resource Impact Evaluation Criteria  Adverse  Adverse impacts to earth resources may result in physical and chemical damage to geology and soils and subsequent impacts to water resources, such as sedimentation from accelerated soil erosion and/or water contamination. The level of impact would be directly related to the impact attributes described in Table 3-27.  Adverse impacts may be perceived as significant under high-intensity scenarios of any duration when the effect(s) are only partially reversible or irreversible with mitigation.  Insignificant impacts may occur under medium-to low-intensity scenarios of short duration where disturbances would be limited to the surface and soil chemistry and productivity would not be altered. Impact affects could be reversed with appropriate mitigation measures.  Neutral/no effect  Ground disturbances would be limited to small areas with imperceptible erosion. Karst topography, geohydrology, and/or site soil chemistry, biology, or productivity would not be altered or affected.  2  3.6.2 General Emitter Activity Impact Assessment  3  Based on the scope of action described in Chapter 2, emitter site use would not be expected  4  to result in impacts to earth resources. The proposed emitter sites are located on existing  5  developed sites that have established access and operational utilities.  Expenditure of EMR  6  and entry, positioning, and removal of mobile radar equipment would have no impact on  7  earth resources. There may be site-specific, neutral land development and point disturbance  8  impacts associated with tree clearing and installation of fencing at some locations.  However,  9  any land development activities may potentially occur at only two sites and would be less  10  than half an acre in size.  The scope of potential land development activities at these sites  11  would be minor, and insignificant. Emitter site activities have little potential to impact public  12  health or the human and natural environment or do not result in potential violations of  13  federal, state, or local regulations. Therefore, these activites are not carried forward for site 14  specific analysis in Chapter 4.  15  3.6.3 General Training Activity Impact Assessment  16  Point impacts, consumption, and incidental land disturbance would have no adverse impact  17  on soils. Point impacts and ISD could increase the potential for soil compaction and  18  accelerated soil erosion.  It is anticipated that physical damage impacts to earth resources  19  associated with point impacts and ISD would be insignificant, unlikely, short-term, site 20  specific, and neutral. Consumption activities would result in negligible site-specific physical  21  damage to earth resources. Digging would be limited to point impact removal of individual  22  plant roots by training personnel. Disturbances from point impacts, ISD, and consumption  23  would be expected to recover naturally. HLZ activities would utilize sites previously cleared  24  by the FFS and would not be expected to have an adverse impact on soils.  These activities are  25  not addressed further in the analysis.  26  Land Disturbance  27  Land development associated with aircraft operations on unpaved roads has the potential for  28  adverse soil erosion impacts.  29  Military fixed-wing aircraft landing requirements include a 30-foot-wide landing zone (15 feet  30  each side of the FWALS centerline) and a 27-foot-wide Zone A (edge of landing zone to the  31  edge of Zone B), an exterior Zone B that is 6 feet wide from the edge of Zone A (AFSOC, 2011),  32  and an FWALS length of 2,000 feet. The total FWALS footprint (including roadway) would be  approximately 4.4 acres.  Other than road maintenance grading and roadside bushhogging, no additional ground activities have been identified to modify or reconstruct existing roadway and roadside areas to meet military FWALS standards and requirements. To convert these roads into FWALS that meet AFSOC standards (AFSOC, 2011), the existing roadways would have to be rebuilt.  This would include: • Widening the roadway an additional 12 feet for the landing zone. • Establishing roadside graded and maintained clear areas (Zones A and B). • Reconstructing the roadway subgrade and surface grade to aircraft landing zone design standards. Based on military FWALS landing zone requirements (1.38 acres), the estimated roadway size, and the above analysis scenario (0.8 acres), approximately 0.6 acres of potentially semi-disturbed roadside soils could be impacted during construction (roadsides are typically bush hogged as part of normal management operations).  The total area of FWALS lateral clearance zones would be about 3 acres – these zones would be cleared as part of normal forestry operations; the Air Force would not clear any areas in support of aircraft operations.  Given that potential land disturbance associated with aircraft operations would be less than 1 acre and would occur within established roadbeds, no NPDES permitting requirements have been identified. Land improvement activities would be conducted within the disturbed roadway and roadside area soils. Landing zone stabilization may include road soil excavation to design depth and reconstruction of the subgrade and surface grade to engineered specifications.  Based on site conditions, the depth of soil excavations could range from 0 to 24 inches.  Imported soil and/or aggregate fill materials may be required to stabilize the landing zone subgrade and surface course. The scope and extent of reconstruction would depend on site-specific features and conditions. For purposes of analysis, the suitability for roads (natural surface) rating system developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service was used as a comparable alternative, since the proposed FWALS would be constructed on existing unpaved roads.  The ratings are based on slope, rock fragments on the surface, plasticity index, content of sand, the soil’s designation per the Unified Soil Classification System, depth to water table, ponding, flooding, and the hazard of soil slippage.  Suitability rating classes include the following: • Well suited indicates that the soil has features that are favorable for the specified kind of roads and has no limitations. Good performance can be expected, and little or no maintenance is needed. These are associated with LU-2 areas.  Improvements in these areas may involve land disturbance activities outside the roadbed as identified previously, but no land clearing would occur; any land disturbance would require approval and coordination with the FFS. • Moderately suited indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified kind of roads. One or more soil properties are less than desirable, and fair performance can be expected. Some maintenance is needed.  These are associated with LU-2 areas.  Improvements in these areas may involve land disturbance activities outside the roadbed as identified previously, but no land clearing would occur; any land disturbance would require approval and coordination with the FFS. • Poorly suited indicates that the soil has one or more properties that are unfavorable for the specified kind of roads. Overcoming the unfavorable properties requires special design, extra maintenance, and costly alteration.  These are associated with Prohibited, Restricted, and LU-1 areas.  Aircraft operations within these areas can only be established on existing roadways that do not require land disturbance outside the existing road bed or right-of-way.  This limits the potential for adverse impacts associated with soil erosion, and minimizes the need for excessive maintenance. Proposed HLZ/DZ-based aircraft landing activities include A/LVL and LLLHI/Es training at existing cleared areas, primarily clearcuts, in various locations at both forests (see Section 2.3.2.1).  All forest tactical areas are candidate locations.  No landing strips, helicopter pads, or other construction activities would be required to prepare selected sites.  For safety and operational reasons, aircraft landings would take place on relatively level ground that is less prone to unstable soil conditions and soil erosion than steeper sites. Clearcuts often exhibit extensive coverage by young vegetative growth, woody debris, slash, and near-ground-level tree stumps for several years after harvesting.  If root raking is not conducted in preparation for replanting, ground stabilizing root systems of woody trees and shrubs generally remain intact. The type and density of organic matter varies between site locations and generally depends on the pre-harvest timber basal area, available seed sources, soil productivity and bulk density, and post-harvest management practices.  As needed, the FFS implements silviculture BMPs to repair damaged areas, improve soil stability, and promote plant growth following timber harvesting. Potential impacts to earth resources include soil compaction, rutting, and erosion.  Areas prone to physical damage from compaction are the undisturbed ground adjacent to the existing roadway that could be incorporated into the landing zone.  The effects of undisturbed ground compact would extend for the life of the FWALS landing zone.  After FWALS improvement, affected roadways would continue to function as components of the forest road network.  Soil rutting would most likely occur within the lateral clearance zones during maintenance activities under saturated soil conditions.  Since area slopes are relatively minor and there are no road-stream crossings within the proposed footprint, construction-induced soil erosion would be limited to the immediate area and would not likely affect water resources. Ground Movement Wheeled Vehicles All wheeled-vehicle movements would be conducted on existing roads within all use areas with noted general and site-specific constraints and mitigations identified in Sections 2.5, 2.7, and 3.6.4, respectively.  Therefore, no impacts to off-road areas would occur.  The stabilized asphalt and concrete surfaces of paved roads would not be adversely impacted by mounted troop vehicle movements; therefore, they were excluded from further analysis. Proposed use of unpaved roads and crossings could degrade and destabilize unpaved road soil or aggregate surfaces, which could increase soil erosion and sedimentation.  However, the proposed mission frequency of three training events per quarter would likely not exceed the carrying capacity of available unpaved roads or be greater than the current level of vehicle use.  The BRSF uses standard unpaved road and roadside best management practices (BMPs) to repair and stabilize roads (FDACS, 2013). Vehicle traversing of low-water crossings could destabilize road approach slopes and increase soil erosion.  Based on available evidence, most low-water crossings at BRSF are unimproved; where improvement does occur, it likely is limited to lining the streambed with rocks. In some cases, the section of the road close to the stream may be amended with gravel or crushed rock to reduce soil loss and road degradation.  Because of stream proximity, road bank soils dislodged by vehicle wheels could readily enter the waterway as sediment. Generally, the potential sources of sediment are limited to the portions of the road in immediate contact with the water course and the distance of road slopes from the gradient crest to the stream. Driving through a stream also mobilizes streambed sediments. Dismounted Movement Dismounted troop movements include on-and off-road maneuvers and bivouac, hardened camp, and assembly area field operations associated with CCDM, B/AA, HCSU, and TCSA. During CCDM training, troops move on foot cross-country, whereas the other three training events involve troop movements within temporary or established camps. Dismounted movement may occur in all use areas (except prohibited and restricted use areas), with noted constraints and mitigations identified in Sections 2.5, 2.7, and 3.6.4, respectively (e.g., establishment of bivouac areas utilizing tent stakes may only occur in LU-2 areas). All tactical areas are potentially affected by dismounted troop movements. Ground disturbance or trampling during troop movement can result in soil compaction, increasing soil bulk density (reduced soil pore space), decreasing rate of water infiltration into soil, increasing stormwater runoff and soil erosion potentials, and reducing vegetation germination and growth.  As activity becomes concentrated into smaller areas, the potential for soil damage tends to increase. Numerous investigations of recreational sites have found that concentrated foot traffic can significantly increase soil bulk density.  As with vehicles, soil damage is most severe under wet soil conditions (Whitecotton et al., 1999; Whitecotton et al., 2000).  Reduced infiltration rates are one of the most detrimental consequences of trampling-induced soil compaction (Cole, 1982).  Studies have shown that trampling impacts are generally most prevalent in the upper 6 inches of soil (Whitecotton et al., 2000). Use of developed recreational camp sites can result in the loss of soil protecting ground cover and initiate transitions to disturbance-tolerant plant communities (LaPage, 1967). Based on the anticipated number of troops, extent of available area, and intensity of trampling, bivouacs and assembly areas, combat support areas, and hardened camp sites are rated as low-moderate-, and high-use activities, respectively.  Except for hardened sites, the location of camp sites could change as needed.  For all but the hardened camp sites, disturbances would be limited to driving tent stakes into the ground; no other digging or ground disturbance would occur.  Since hardened camp facilities have previously been constructed, no additional ground disturbances are anticipated.  During cross-county maneuvers, soldiers could move through wetlands and/or cross streams and would likely use established roads and trails as needed.  All support vehicles would remain on designated roads.  Dismounted Troop Movements Determination:  Troop movements would impact forest soil and/or geologic resources.  Impacted areas would likely exhibit increased soil bulk densities and reduced infiltration that could increase soil erosion.  Under the Proposed Action, it is anticipated that: • Cross-country maneuver impacts would be adverse, probable, short term, site specific, neutral, fully reversible, and insignificant.  • Temporary low-use bivouac and assembly area impacts would be adverse, unavoidable, short-term, low intensity, fully reversible, and insignificant.  • Temporary moderate-use TCSA impacts would be adverse, unavoidable, medium term, localized, fully reversible, and insignificant.  Soil compaction impact mitigations may be required for moderate-use camp sites (see Section 3.6.4). • Permanent, high-use hardened camp site impacts would be adverse, unavoidable, medium-term, localized, fully reversible, and insignificant.  Since these are permanent, maintained facilities, no additional mitigations would be required. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service has developed a system to rate the suitabilities and limitations for establishing bivouac areas.  The interpretation identifies topographic and soil properties that affect the ease of establishing bivouac sites.  In developing bivouacs, slope, soil properties, wetness, and depth to cemented soil pans are primary concerns: • Not limited – The soil has features very favorable for the specified use; good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. • Somewhat limited – The soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use.  Limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation procedures; these are associated with LU-2 areas. • Very limited – The soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures.  Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected; these are associated with Prohibited, Restricted, and LU-1 areas. Constraint areas where mission impact-induced earth resource effects are most likely to occur include closed depressions, steepheads, and hydric and erodible soils.  Steepheads and closed depressions represent locations where steep slopes and sustained wet soil conditions are sensitive to soil disturbances from troop movements. These would mostly likely occur. Recommendations to minimize impacts to earth resources are presented in Section 3.6.4. Expendable Use For comparative analysis, the proposed mission impacts of expendable use on earth resources were examined against those detailed in the Interstitial Area Range Final Environmental Assessment Revision 2 (U.S. Air Force, 2013c). Based on the similarity between the types and number of expendables, it is anticipated that earth resource impacts from exposures to the munitions expenditures under the Proposed Action would be insignificant, possible, short-term, site-specific, and neutral. Therefore, munitions use has not been carried forward for further site-specific analysis. Fueling operations are prohibited in all areas except LU-2 areas.  FARP/HGO activities may only occur on hardened surfaces (e.g., concrete or asphalt), and are not likely to occur in the forests. Impacts could result from accidental fuel spills during equipment refueling due to equipment failures or human error.  Incidental engine and equipment leaks may also occur during normal operations.  Introduction of fuels into the soil could contaminate the soil and groundwater. Such contamination could create soil conditions toxic to vegetation, both in establishment and growth.  Subsequent loss or decreased vigor of vegetative cover could increase soil susceptibility to ground disturbance (erosion, compaction, and/or rutting). Contamination of water resources and impacts from hazardous materials are discussed in Sections 5.7.2 and 5.12.2, respectively. Although spills and leaks could occur, it is anticipated that spills during refueling would be rare, since refueling is conducted under strenuous process protocols for safety and accident prevention. Best practices to prevent and rapidly respond to spills, as outlined in the Eglin Air Force Base Oil and Hazardous Substance Contingency Plan, would be implemented during refueling to prevent accidents and reduce impacts.  In addition, each MFT carries a copy of an oil spill response plan. Personnel verify proper operation of tanker truck level gauges, pumps, hoses, and valves prior to transferring fuel.  During product transfer, drip pans are placed under connections and personnel note the proximity of any roadside drains along established FWALS.  MFTs are equipped with vehicle brake systems that prevent the vehicle from departing before fuel hoses are disconnected.  In the event that a spill does occur, MFTs are equipped with spill kits that can be used to absorb and remove any fuel spilled during product transfer. Aircraft Operations During training events, aircraft landing wheels or struts would rest on the surface and disperse the full weight of the aircraft at these contact points. Depending on the aircraft, the fully loaded weight can range from a few thousand to tens of thousands of pounds.  For comparison, the loaded weight of a loaded CV-22 Osprey is approximately 47,500 pounds and the operational weight of a wheeled logging skidder ranges from 45,500 to 51,500 pounds. During HLZ/DZ, A/LVL, and LLHI/E aircraft landings, soil compaction or rutting could occur at the aircraft wheel or strut ground contact points.  The extent of soil damage from compaction or rutting would increase under wet soil conditions (Xu et al., 1999), particularly in areas with hydric soils where seasonal high water tables are near the surface.  Low soil moisture content is likely instrumental in reducing soil compaction. Under comparable conditions, silt and clay soils generally compact more severely than sandy soils (Amup, 1998). The infrequent occurrences and distribution of aircraft landing events at various forest locations would minimize repeated impacts at site-specific contact points. Accounting for soil trafficking impacts associated with timber clearcut logging, aircraft landing-induced disturbances would not be considered detrimental. Landing site damage would likely recover through natural attenuation, and site vegetative cover and soil productivity would likely not be diminished.  After about five years, the density and height of woody vegetation of some sites may hamper performance during some training activities, and troops may stop using these sites. Mission-related impacts to earth resources are more likely in certain constraint areas.  Such areas include closed depressions, steepheads, and hydric and erodible soils. These areas PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT | APRIL 2014  1  represent locations where steep slopes and sustained wet soil conditions are most sensitive  2  to soil disturbances from landings.  Recommendations to minimize constraint area impacts  3  are presented in Section 3.6.4.  4  In extreme cases, structural damage to soils may occur.  This damage requires intervention to  accelerate site recovery from rutting, encourage revegetation, and prevent erosion.  This  6  uncommon condition may occur during landings of fully-loaded aircraft during wet periods  7  when the surface soil is saturated or on hydric soils when water tables are within 6 inches of  8  the surface.  Determinations of damage requiring site repair would be made by on-site  9  personnel.  Land suitabilities and limitations for HLZs are the same as those identified previously under  11  Dismounted Movement.  The interpretation identifies topography, soil properties, and  12  flooding or ponding that may restrict the periods when the HLZ could be used.  13  Amphibious Operations  14  Boat and troop egress and ingress activities would occur along the banks and shorelines of  available training areas within all use areas (except prohibited areas and RAs), at sites  16  designated by the GLI Liaison and the FFS. Activities would occur with consideration of the  17  General Operational Constraints discussed in Section 2.5. During training events, foot traffic  18  and movement of boats in and out of the water would be concentrated in a relatively small  19  area at the water edge.  AO could disturb soils and trample vegetation, resulting in conditions  that may result in accelerated bank erosion. Whether over natural ground or constructed  21  boat launch, areas repeatedly used would be more prone to exhibit adverse effects on soils.  22  In shallow areas, boat operations can also disturb bank and stream bottom sediments,  23  thereby increasing water column turbidity.  24  On streambanks and shorelines with established vegetation and stable grades (not  overheightened or oversteepened), impacts would consist of minor disturbances that, in  26  most cases, would naturally recover.  Operations conducted at hardened boat launches  27  would not likely increase streambank degradation or soil loss.  28  3.6.3.1 General Training Activity Impact Assessment Summary  29  Based on the scope of action described in Chapter 2, all training activities except for OHO  would have at least some interaction with earth resources. Table 3-29 identifies potential  31  interactions between Proposed Action effectors and earth resource receptors carried forward  32  for detailed analyses in Chapters 5 and 6 (highlighted yellow).  Activities shaded in green have  33  little potential to impact public health or the human and natural environment or little  34  potential to result in violations of federal, state, or local regulations.  Therefore, these activities  are not carried forward for detailed analysis in Chapters 5 and 6.  PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT | APRIL 2014 1 Table 3-29.

Site fingerprinting is a data collection,  8  ground-truthing, and reporting process designed to gather and analyze the field data  9  necessary to plan, design, and construct FWALS to fully support the proposed military  aircraft training activities.  Site data collection tools and protocols are used during field visits to gather critical roadway and affected area measurements, photopoint records, and soil samples.  Based on validated field features and conditions, determinations can then be made as to site suitability and engineering requirements. As needed, site project plans could then be developed to meet site construction and operational needs. • Utilize sites that are best suited to the intended activity and avoid areas with known constraints or limitations. • Temporally and spatially disperse FWALS and HLZ/DZ training to minimize repetitive use impacts to landing zone surface conditions and maximize life cycles. Utilize mission logistics information to plan training events that avoid, to the degree possible, FWALS used during the previous year and HLZ/DZ areas used during the previous two years.  A rest period would promote vegetative growth and allow disturbed areas to recover. • Construct and maintain an FWALS drainage system that collects and discharges stormwater runoff in a non-erosive manner. • Inspect FWALS landing zones following each training mission.  Coordinate immediate repairs of damaged areas. • Avoid clear zone maintenance during wet soil conditions.  All soils are highly sensitive to mechanical compaction or rutting damage when wet. • As needed, install BMPs to minimize soil disturbances (FDACS, 2008; USACOE, 2004; USACOE, 2008).  For clear zone sites with extreme rutting damage, physically amend damaged soils with tillage equipment after the soils have dried.  Depending on extent of damage, soil structure amendments could be made with hand tools or motorized tillage equipment.  Areas may also need to be reseeded to native species to reduce bare ground and encourage the establishment of soil protecting ground cover. • Avoid HLZ/DZ areas with highly and potentially highly erodible soils and hydric soils. Soil erosion potentials increase with increasing soil erodibility and wet soil are highly sensitive to damage by compaction and rutting. • Maintain at least a 100 foot exclusion buffer around sensitive steephead slopes and closed depression subsidence areas to prevent accelerated soil erosion of slopes and wet soil rutting. • As necessary, install temporary metal landing mats for HLZ/DZ landing training activities conducted in wet areas during poor weather conditions.  Mats can reduce potentials for soil damage and provide stable platforms aircraft landings, materials and personnel loading and unloading, and temporary storage. • To the degree possible, utilize established walking trails or designated roads during cross county dismounted maneuvers. • Avoid cross county maneuvers through steephead locations.  The steep to very steep slopes of these geologic features are highly prone to accelerated rates of erosion if disturbed.  These areas are within LU-1 areas and would be identified by the L.I.T. 1 • Avoid the use of borrow pits for temporary campsites.  For some pits, additional 2 surface disturbances could increase soil erosion rates or affect the stability of early3 stage pit reclamation. 4 • Avoid establishing temporary camps within or in proximity to steepheads and closed depression areas. These sites may be sensitive to increases in stormwater runoff of 6 disturbances associated with camp activities. An exclusion zone of at least 100 feet is 7 recommended. These areas are within LU-1 areas and would be identified by the L.I.T. 8 • Avoid sensitive streambank areas that are overheightened and oversteepened and/or 9 areas exhibiting bank scour and mass failure features. These areas are within LU-1 areas and would be identified by the L.I.T. 11 • To the degree possible, avoid the repetitive use of the same egress and ingress 12 locations within the same year for AO.  13 • For sites where vegetation damage could result in loss of plant cover, reseed with 14 native species to encourage the reestablishment of vegetative cover. 3.7 WATER RESOURCES  16  Water resources include surface waters, ground water, wetlands, and floodplains. Each water  17  resource is referred to as a “receptor.”  18  Surface Water  19  Surface waters are any waters that lie above ground water, such as streams, springs, ponds,  lakes, rivers, bayous, and bays. Most of the streams in the GRASI region are classified as  21  seepage streams, or blackwater streams. Seepage streams are clear to lightly colored and  22  originate from shallow ground water that has percolated through deep, sandy, upland soils.  23  Blackwater streams are nutrient-poor streams that characteristically have tea-colored waters  24  laden with tannins, particulates, and dissolved organic matter and iron from swamps and  marshes that feed into the streams. Base flow in most streams originates from shallow ground  26  water discharge. Most rainfall quickly infiltrates the porous, sandy soils in the area with little, if  27  any, surface runoff.  28  Ground Water  29  Ground water includes the subsurface water resources and is commonly used for potable  water consumption, agricultural irrigation, and industrial applications.  Aquifers may be  31  unconfined (open to the surface) or confined (separated from the surface by impermeable  32  layers of rock or sediments). Unconfined aquifers are generally more susceptible to  33  contamination from surface spills. Although overall water quality in northwest Florida is quite  34  good, non-point source pollution from agriculture, silviculture, and construction runoff is a  growing concern (FDEP, 2001; FDEP, 2002; FDEP, 2004).  36  Wetlands  37  Wetlands are areas of transition between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water  38  table is usually at or near the surface or the land is covered by shallow water (Mitsch and  39  Gosselink, 1993). The term “wetlands” describes marshes, swamps, bogs, and similar areas.  1  Local hydrology and soil saturation largely affects soil formation and development, as well as  2  the plant and animal communities found in wetland areas (USEPA, 2003).  3  Floodplains  4  Floodplains are lowland  areas  adjacent to surface water bodies (e.g., rivers, lakes, and  5  wetlands), where flooding events periodically cover low-lying areas with water. Floodplain  6  vegetation and soils act as water filters, intercepting surface water runoff before it reaches  7  lakes, streams, or rivers, and store floodwaters during flood events. This filtration process aids  8  in the removal of excess nutrients, pollutants, and sediments from the water.  9  3.7.1  Impact Assessment Methodology  10  The impact assessment for water resources evaluates the potential impacts of the Proposed  11  Action effector impacts to  water  resources.   Impacts to water resources are evaluated  12  according to type, context, intensity, and duration (as described in Section 3.1), as well as the  13  regulatory  drivers identified  below.   Together,  these  attributes  define the potential  14  significance of the impacts.  15  3.7.1.1  Regulatory Drivers  16  Regulatory drivers affecting water resources include a number of federal laws, Air Force 17  specific regulations and instructions, state laws, and Eglin AFB instructions and policies.  18  Table 3-30 summarizes the most important regulatory drivers affecting water resources that  19  could be affected by the Proposed Action.  20  Table 3-30.

Includes Dredged or Fill Permit Program; Section 404 regulates development in streams and wetlands by requiring a permit from the USACE for discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters. A Section 401 water quality certification is required from the state as well.  Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)  42 USC 300f et seq.; 1997  Requires the promulgation of drinking water standards, or maximum contaminant levels, which are often used as cleanup values in remediation; establishes the underground injection well program; and establishes a wellhead protection program.  Floodplain Management  Executive Order 11988; 24 May 1977  Directs federal agencies to restore and preserve floodplains by performing the following in floodplains not supporting development:  evaluating effects of potential actions; allowing public review of plans; and considering in land and water resource use.  Table 3-30.  Relevant Laws, Regulations, and Policies: Water Resources, Cont’d Law or Regulation  Citation  Summary  Protection of Wetlands  Executive Order 11990; 24 May 77  Requires federal agencies to minimize the destruction, loss, or degradation of wetlands and to preserve and enhance the natural and beneficial values of wetlands in their activities.

As part of the Proposed Action, the measures in EAFBI 13-212 would be observed  5  during GLI training activities.  For purposes of this EIS, analysis of impacts to water resources  6  assumed  that avoidance measures in  EAFBI  13-212  would be  observed and properly  1  implemented as part of the Proposed Action. If necessary, additional potential mitigations or  2  impact minimization measures were identified as part of the analysis.  3  The impacts analysis assessed the potential for the Proposed Action to interact with known  4  water resources at BRSF and THSF.  The impact from these interactions may be direct, indirect,  5  or if combined with other actions, cumulative.    To inventory the water resources at BRSF and  6  THSF, the Air Force accessed information from the state and federal agencies with regulatory  7  oversight and/or resource management responsibility for these resources.  Each of the  8  previously identified water resources categories may be impacted differently by one or more  9  of the proposed training activities. There are also specific regulations that must be considered  10  for analyzing impacts to water resources.  11  The Air Force has conducted a Coastal Consistency Determination in accordance with the  12  Coastal Zone Management Act (see Appendix C, Consultation Documentation), with a finding  13  that the Proposed Action is consistent with the Act and its provisions.  The State of Florida will  14  review the  Coastal  Consistency Determination  as  part  of  the  NEPA  process; any  15  correspondence received in this regard will be included in the Final EIS.  16  Table 3-31 defines how the impact attributes of context, intensity, and duration are applied to  17  water resource analysis.  18  Table 3-31.

Table 3-32  5  explains the impact level categories for water resources analyzed in this EIS and identified in  6  Chapters 4, 5, and 6.  7  Table 3-32.  Impact Level Categories for Water Resources  Level  of  Impact  Surface Water  Ground Water  Wetlands  Floodplains  Adverse  Adverse impacts may result in degradation to surface water, the level of impact directly related to the impact attributes described in Table 3-31. Adverse impacts may be perceived as significant under high-intensity scenarios over a longterm duration where there is substantive contamination through sedimentation and/or chemical interactions.  Insignificant impacts may occur under medium-to low-intensity scenarios of a short-term or temporary duration and lesser amounts of sedimentation and/or chemical contamination.  Adverse impacts may result in degradation to ground water availability and/or quality, the level of impact directly related to the impact attributes in Table 3-31. Impacts may be perceived as significant under high-intensity scenarios with long-term use/drawdown of supplies or contamination. Insignificant impacts may occur under medium-to low-intensity scenarios with a short-term duration of increased ground water use/drawdown or smaller amounts of contamination.  Adverse impacts may result in direct or indirect degradation to jurisdictional wetland habitat and/or functions, the level of impact directly related to the impact attributes in Table 3-31. Impacts may be perceived as significant under high-intensity scenarios of any duration with contamination of entire wetland areas or loss of entire wetlands. Insignificant impacts may occur under medium-to low-intensity scenarios of any duration that result in small amounts of contamination of wetland area segments or partial loss of wetland area/vegetation.  Adverse impacts may result in loss of floodplain area and/or function, the level of impact directly related to the impact attributes in Table 3-31.  Impacts may be perceived as significant under high-intensity scenarios of any duration resulting in loss of large areas of floodplain area and/or function.  Insignificant impacts may occur with only localized, segmental disturbance of floodplain area that does not necessarily result in overall loss of floodplain functionality.  High-intensity impacts are typically only recoverable through long-term natural processes and/or substantive mitigations, while lesser impacts are recoverable over the short to medium term through natural processes or with minor mitigation.  Neutral/  Actions that improve or protect water resources or result in no noticeable change.  no  effect  1  3.7.2 General Emitter Activity Impact Assessment  2  Based on the scope of action described in Chapter 2, emitter site use would not be expected  3  to result in impacts to water resources. Use of fuels for generators would require  4  implementation of Air Force spill control and response procedures to minimize  surface/ground water interactions from any spills.  The proposed use of emitter sites would  6  not involve any land disturbance activities within or near water resources. As a result, given  7  the negligible potential for interactions/impacts to water resources and the negligible  8  potential to impact public health or the human and natural environment,  and the fact that  9  this activity would not result in potential violations of federal, State, or local regulations, this  Proposed Action component is not carried forward for detailed analysis in Chapter 4.  11  3.7.3 General Training Activity Impact Assessment  12  Land Disturbance  13  Land disturbance due to land improvement activities is a potential impact for all water  14  resources in each tactical area.  It is unlikely that land improvement activities would have any  direct effect on surface water resources since these activities would not be allowed near  16  surface waters, wetlands, or floodplains under LU-1 protection levels. However, land  17  improvement activities could potentially have indirect effects on these resources through soil  18  erosion and migration into streams, wetlands, or floodplains. Suspended sediment in surface  19  waters can adversely affect water quality by reducing clarity. Likewise sediments deposited in  streams can alter flow patterns and disrupt stream flow.  21  Use of heavy equipment for land-clearing activities could also have potential indirect effects  22  on water resources; however, there would be no land clearing activities associated with the  23  Proposed Action. The Air Force would utilize areas previously cleared by the FFS as part of  24  normal silvicultural activities. Heavy equipment may be utilized as a component of road  compacting and general improvements for FWALS development.  The heavy equipment  26  could be a source of contamination to water resources if there are any leaks or spills of fuels,  27  hydraulic fluids, or other petroleum products used for the operation or maintenance of this  28  equipment and those fluids migrated into surface water, groundwater, wetlands, or  29  floodplains.  Furthermore, standard stormwater pollution prevention measures such as silt fences and  31  sediment detention basins and chemical spill prevention measures would prevent migration  32  of sediment and other potential contaminants into water resources. Therefore land  33  improvement activities would not be expected to have any significant adverse effects on  34  water resources at either forest. No filling or disturbance of wetlands or floodplains is  proposed, and no USACE Section 404 permitting requirements have been identified.  36  Land disturbance due to NRC is a potential impact for surface waters and wetlands in all  37  tactical areas.  Potential effects from removal of water, animals, and plants from surface water  38  and wetlands would be direct, but on a minor scale. Disturbance would be limited to  39  localized disturbance of surface water, sediments, and shorelines of surface waters and  1  wetlands, which can temporarily suspend sediments and diminish water clarity.  Disturbance  2  from consumption would be temporary and limited to localized areas; these effects would  3  quickly diminish once foraging troops moved out of the area and would be negligible.  4  Ground Movement  Ground movement activities that could affect water resources include wheeled vehicle use  6  and CCDM.  Ground movement would not be expected to impact floodplains because  7  wheeled vehicles would remain on established roadways, and foot traffic would not impact  8  the functionality of a floodplain.  9  Wheeled vehicle use for ground movement is a potential impact for water resources in all  tactical areas.  Wheeled vehicle use would not have any direct effect on surface water  11  resources since vehicles would not be allowed direct access to any surface waters or wetlands  12  under the LU-1 protection level. Vehicle use would be restricted to existing roads and trails  13  and approved, existing crossing locations in streams and wetlands. If off-road vehicle use is  14  required for any reason the respective FFS Management Office would need to be consulted  prior to occurrence, and no vehicles would be allowed within 100 feet of a surface water body  16  or wetland as specified by EABFI 13-212.  17  Wheeled vehicle activities could potentially have indirect effects on water resources. Routine  18  use of the existing dirt road network that extends throughout the tactical areas is a regular  19  contributor to roadway erosion, and a recognized problem affecting some streams and  wetlands (Florida Division of Forestry [FDOF], 2000). Leaks of fuel and other vehicle fluids  21  would also be a potential indirect source of contamination to water resources as described  22  under land improvement effects. Some indirect effects to water resources from roadway  23  erosion are likely and assumed to occur.  While the potential for these occurrences are  24  inherent to vehicle use (whether for the military, the FFS, or civilians) and unavoidable,  implementation of standard vehicle maintenance and spill prevention SOPs would minimize  26  the potential for occurrence to a negligible level.  27  Dismounted troop movement is a potential impact for surface water and wetland resources in  28  all tactical areas.  Potential effects would be direct, but on a minor scale.  Large groups or  29  heavy repeated use of a particular area can cause stream banks or shorelines to erode,  indirectly affecting water clarity, stream course, and rate of flow. Rotation of any stream or  31  water body ingress/egress areas would serve to minimize the potential for any medium to  32  long-term impacts associated with shoreline erosion, and units would be advised to avoid any  33  noticeably eroded shorelines. Over the short term sediments in fast-flowing streams typical of  34  those found on the forests would settle rapidly and water clarity would return, causing the  streams to return to their former state once units had moved on.  36  Expendables  37  Pyrotechnics (including smoke grenades) and fueling operations are prohibited within LU-1  38  protection areas associated with surface waters and wetlands.  Use of blanks and paintballs  39  would not be expected to result in adverse impacts to water resources because any brass  casings or other debris would be picked up as part of general operating constraints identified  PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT | APRIL 2014  1  in Section 2.5.  While fueling activities would only be allowed in LU-2 protection areas there is  2  a risk of fuel spills when handling large quantities of fuel and any fuel spills may migrate  3  quickly into adjacent water resource receptors and contaminate surface water, groundwater,  4  wetland sediments, and floodplain soils.  Where fueling would occur, activities are covered  under several SOPs and AFIs as described in Section 3.12, Solid and Hazardous  6  Materials/Waste, and implementation of these requirements would serve to minimize the  7  potential for spills to occur or impact surface waters. Provided SOPs and EAFBI instructions  8  are implemented the Air Force anticipates no adverse impacts from fueling operations.  9  Amphibious Operations  AO may potentially impact surface waters and associated shorelines throughout the forest  11  areas, as personnel may use any of the surface waters.  Potential effects of AO would include  12  disturbance of streambeds and shorelines from the loading and unloading of watercraft and  13  movement of watercraft on the surface waters, as well as ingress/egress of troops over the  14  land/water interface as discussed in detail in the Riverine/Estuarine Programmatic  Environmental Assessment (U.S. Air Force, 2004). AO would adhere to the General Operational  16  Constraints and mitigations identified in Section 2.5 associated with EAFBI 13-212 Section  17  7.2.9.  Impacts to water resources would be minimized to less than adverse by limiting activity  18  to designated landing zones and by rotating landing zones when these areas show signs of  19  erosion.  There is potential for release of fuel from watercraft to surface waters, however this  potential is inherent in watercraft use (whether military or civilian).  Such potential for adverse  21  impacts are minimized to a negligible level by implementation of SOPs for watercraft  22  maintenance and spill prevention procedures as identified in Section 3.12, Solid and  23  Hazardous Materials/Waste.  24  3.7.3.1 General Training Activity Impact Assessment Summary  Based on the scope of action described in Chapter 2, many training activities would have at  26  least some interaction with one or more water resource categories. Table 3-33 identifies  27  potential interactions between Proposed Action effectors and water resource receptors.  28  Items shaded yellow have been carried forward for site-specific analyses in Chapters 5 (BRSF)  29  and 6 (THSF).  Activities shaded in green have little potential to impact the human and natural  environment or do not result in potential violations of federal, state, or local regulations.  31  Therefore, these activities are not carried forward for detailed analysis in Chapters 5 and 6.  PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT | APRIL 2014 1 Table 3-33.  Receptor and Effector Interactions for Water Resources Table 3-33.  Receptor and Effector Interactions for Water Resources, Cont’d BMP = best management practice; GBS = ground burst simulator 1 3.7.4 Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations 2 General Operational Constraints to minimize impacts to water resources are identified in 3 Section 2.5, and have been described in the analyses.  These would be inherent to the 4 Proposed Action.  Additional action-specific operational constraints or mitigations have been 5 identified that would further minimize impact potential or the severity of identified impacts: 6 • To minimize localized damage potential from foraging and dismounted troop 7 movements, the size of troop units will be kept to small manageable numbers. Troop 8 use would be rotated within and among TAs to prevent concentration of activities in 9 particular locations. Implementation of this mitigation would allow water resources to 10 recover from extended use after intensive training activities. 11 • Roads, trails, and stream/wetland crossings would be inspected before and after each 12 training mission to identify maintenance issues that could cause problems if not 13 repaired. Training activities would be shifted or redirected if conditions of roads and 14 stream and wetland crossings require repair or other measures to prevent erosion 15 from impacting surface waters and wetlands. The FFS will be notified of any identified 16 issues.  Wheeled vehicle training would only occur on crossings rated as good or fair 17 condition; no wheeled vehicle training would occur at crossings rated Poor until these 18 crossing are approved by the FFS. 19 • The potential for spills during land improvement activities, vehicle use, and FARP/HGO 20 can be mitigated through training and use of spill prevention protocols, trained 21 response equipment and personnel, use of and secondary containment during 22 refueling activities (FARP/HGO). 23 • Amphibious landings would utilize designated ingress/egress points identified 24 through coordination between the GLI Liaison and the FFS.  To the extent possible AO PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT | APRIL 2014 1 should use established, hardened boat ramps for ingress/egress of amphibious craft. If 2 ingress/egress must utilize natural habitat in wetlands, care should be taken to avoid 3 destruction of wetland vegetation or other activities that might cause shoreline 4 erosion. Ingress/egress points for both personnel and watercraft should be rotated to the extent possible to allow sites time to recover from AO. 6 The USFWS, as part of the ESA Section 7 consultation process (USFWS, 2014), has 7 recommended the following conservation measure: avoidance of “Good” and “Poor” rated 8 vehicle water crossings for training use in order to protect the better crossing sites and 9 minimize further degradation of the sites in poor condition. 3.8 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES 11 Within the context of this EIS, the term “biological resources” refers to the vegetation, wildlife, 12 protected species, sensitive habitats, and invasive plant and animal species associated with 13 the land areas proposed for use.  Each biological resource component is referred to as a 14 “receptor.” 3.8.1 Impact Assessment Methodology 16 The impact assessment for biological resources evaluates the potential impacts of the 17 Proposed Action to biological resources. Impacts to biological resources are evaluated 18 according to type, context, intensity, and duration (as described in Section 3.1), as well as the 19 regulatory drivers identified below. Together, these attributes define the potential significance of the impacts. 21 3.8.1.1 Regulatory Drivers 22 Laws and regulations applicable to the Proposed Action for biological resources are 23 summarized below. 24 • ESA of 1973 (16 USC 1531 to 1544; 1997–Supp): Provides for the conservation of endangered and threatened species and the ecosystems on which they depend and, 26 per Section 7 of the act, requires federal agencies to consult with the USFWS and/or 27 National Marine Fisheries Service if impacts to federally listed species are possible. 28 • AFPD 32-70: Directs the implementation of the ESA. 29 • AFI 32-7064: Details how to manage natural resources in such a way as to comply with federal, state, and local laws and regulations and calls for the protection and 31 conservation of state-listed species when not in direct conflict with the military 32 mission. 33 • EAFBI 13-212, Chapter 7: Identifies requirements for protection of natural and cultural 34 resources and waste management. • BEPA (16 USC 668–668d): Prohibits the taking or possession of and commerce in bald 36 eagles. 37 • Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 USC 703-712; 1997-Supp) and EO 13186, Responsibilities 38 of Federal Agencies to Protect Migratory Birds: Protects migratory birds and their 1 habitats and establishes a permitting process for legal taking. The Armed Forces are 2 exempted from the incidental taking of migratory birds during military readiness 3 activities (such as those described in this EIS), except in cases where an activity would 4 likely cause a significant adverse effect to the population of a migratory bird species. • Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972: Establishes a comprehensive federal 6 plan to conserve marine mammals. 7 • EO 13112, Invasive Species: States that no federal agency shall authorize, fund, or carry 8 out actions that it believes are likely to cause or promote the introduction or spread of 9 invasive nonnative species in the U.S. or elsewhere. 3.8.1.2 Assessment Method 11 As stated in Chapter 2, the Air Force currently abides by conservation measures detailed in 12 the Final Formal ESA Section 7 Consultation for Interstitial Area Activities at Eglin Air Force Base, 13 Florida (USFWS, 2012), which addresses all protected interstitial species on Eglin. Additionally, 14 the USFWS has issued a separate biological opinion for the red-cockaded woodpecker, which was received August 14, 2013.  The conservation measures are designed to avoid or minimize 16 impacts to protected species from training activities.  Eglin AFB range users also observe 17 procedures in EAFBI 13-212, which incorporates consultation conservation measures but also 18 ensures environmental stewardship in general.  Measures specified in EAFBI 13-212 and Eglin 19 Interstitial ESA consultations, where applicable, are included in GLI training components as part of the Proposed Action.  For purposes of this EIS, analysis of impacts to biological 21 resources assumed that avoidance measures in EAFBI 13-212 and conservation measures 22 identified in the previously mentioned consultations would be implemented as part of the 23 Proposed Action.  If necessary, additional potential mitigations or impact minimization 24 measures were identified as part of the analysis. The impacts analysis assessed the potential for the Proposed Action to interact with known 26 natural resource communities or species.  The impact from these interactions may be direct, 27 indirect, or if combined with other actions, cumulative. To provide a general inventory of the 28 natural resources at BRSF and THSF, the Air Force accessed information from the state and 29 federal agencies with regulatory oversight for these resources and, where available, obtained data and publications on species and community types and locations. Biological resources 31 were categorized as vegetation, wildlife, protected species, sensitive habitats, and invasive 32 species. Each of these categories may be impacted differently by one or more of the 33 proposed training activities. For example, protected species and habitats have a greater 34 sensitivity to impacts than nonprotected vegetation and wildlife. Likewise, there are specific regulations that must be considered for analyzing impacts to protected species and habitats. 36 Table 3-34 defines how the impact attributes of context, intensity, and duration are applied to 37 biological resource analyses. PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT | APRIL 2014 1 Table 3-34.

The small footprint of the emitter equipment and the use of improved  6  and semi-improved areas would not damage native vegetation or displace wildlife.  Exposure  7  to potentially harmful levels of EMR is highly unlikely, given that wildlife are not likely to  8  approach areas where humans are active and wildlife are not likely to continuously remain  9  within the hazard distance.  Emitter site activities have little potential to impact the natural  PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT | APRIL 2014 1 environment or do not result in potential violations of federal, state, or local regulations. 2 Therefore, these activities are not carried forward for detailed analysis in Chapter 4. 3 3.8.3 General Training Activity Impact Assessment 4 Based on the scope of action described in Chapter 2, all training activities would have at least some interaction with one or more biological resource categories. 6 Per general operation constraints identified in Section 2.5, sensitive species and habitat 7 would be protected, and aspects of EAFBI 13-212 and Eglin AFB sensitive species 8 consultations would be implemented as part of the Proposed Action.  Hence, the following 9 activities would not be expected to result in adverse impacts and are not discussed further in this chapter: 11 • Land disturbance (point impact, ISD): These activities are not likely to result in 12 potential impacts associated with displacement or mortality of nonsensitive biological 13 resources. These activities may result in short-term impacts that are recoverable 14 without mitigation (e.g., placing a stake in the ground).  As a result, the Air Force anticipates no adverse effect to biological resources from these activities. 16 • UoEX (other/equipment): Intermittent use of generators may result in minor, localized 17 temporary noise disturbance to wildlife but would not otherwise interact with flora or 18 fauna.  The Air Force expects no effect to wildlife from the temporary noise associated 19 with generator use. • Utilities: Utilities usage would not interact with flora or fauna and, therefore, would 21 not impact biological resources. 22 Vegetation 23 Aircraft operations would not be expected to have any impact on vegetation. 24 Land Disturbance Land disturbance associated with minor improvements to HLZs and FWALS, as well as other 26 aircraft operations, would result in minor surface disturbance, causing either trampling or 27 vegetation removal. Such impacts would be short term and recoverable, as use of HLZs and 28 FWALS rotates. Mitigations associated with land development practices (e.g., soil erosion 29 prevention) may be required.  Consumption of vegetation would result in direct physical impacts to vegetation, but these impacts would be very localized and intermittent and would 31 not be expected to adversely impact the overall vegetative environment of the forest. These 32 potential impacts apply to all tactical areas where land development may occur. 33 Ground Movement 34 All activities involving wheeled vehicles would occur on designated roads and established crossing points utilized by the FFS.  While water crossings could interact with aquatic 36 vegetation at designated crossings, the Air Force would coordinate with the FFS to ensure 37 that degraded crossings either are not utilized or are reported.  CCDM may result in trampling 38 of vegetation as personnel walk through the forest. However, these impacts would be 39 localized and recoverable over the short term. Personnel would rotate utilization, thus further minimizing potential adverse impacts. Expendable Use Indirect impacts from wildfires started by expendables would have both adverse and potentially beneficial impacts to vegetation. Generally, controlled fire can be beneficial to ecological communities and species by maintaining the grassy understory and preventing mid-story encroachment.  However, wildfires can damage the habitats of species that rely on these communities.  The FFS utilizes a fire management program that includes wildfire prevention, detection and suppression, and prescribed burning. Amphibious Operations There would be potential adverse impacts to shoreline and aquatic vegetation due to trampling/rutting associated with landing of watercraft along shorelines.  Impacts would be short term and recoverable through mitigations such as rotation of established boat landing sites. Wildlife Wildlife could be directly impacted by land disturbance, temporary disturbance and displacement from ground movement and vehicle and boat collisions, and noise and wildfire from UoEX. Land Disturbance Some incidental impacts may occur during fixed-wing aircraft landing site improvements due to trampling or crushing from equipment.  However, activities would occur within existing roadbeds, and most species would move from the area during equipment use; these areas are currently disturbed as part of regular road maintenance by the FFS.  Impacts would be incidental, and given the scope of activities (only occurring at a few locations and within small road segments) the potential for impact is minimal. During training, some wildlife such as birds, reptiles, and small mammals would be consumed by troops.  However, the amount consumed would not be enough to decrease a population or have regional impacts and would not be considered significant given the extent of public use and hunting in the state forests. Consumption levels would be minimal, and be less than wildlife takes from recreational hunters. Ground Movement Vehicles would operate on established roads under 35 miles per hour (mph), which should reduce the chance for collision. The number of vehicles that would be used, and the proposed frequency, results in only a small increase in the baseline traffic on local roads; as a result, the potential for a roadway collision would be considered similar to the baseline condition. Ground troop movement is unlikely to impact wildlife in any appreciable manner, as wildlife generally avoid persons walking through the forest, similar to hikers that currently use the forest.  Troop sizes would be relatively small (Section 2.4) and the chances for trampling of wildlife would be negligible. Expendable Use Expendables would generate noise and smoke that would temporarily disturb or displace wildlife, and there would be a potential for these items to start wildfires. Wildlife could also be disturbed by noise produced during small arms fire and use of ground-burst simulators.  Individuals could be startled by the firing of 5.56-mm and 7.62-mm inert rounds, with reactions similar to those described for overflight noise.  The 7.62-mm rounds would be the more impactive of the two sizes, producing noise levels of 102 dB at 1,000 feet from the firing point.  There is the potential for nesting birds to be startled enough to displace an egg or nestling from their nest or even abandon their nest. However, most animals (including birds) in the immediate vicinity of ground training operations would be aware of human presence and may move some distance away before munitions were fired, thus exposing fewer individuals to noise effects.  Ground-burst simulators would produce substantially greater noise levels, potentially resulting in physiological harm (hearing effects) or behavioral effects to species in the immediate vicinity.  Noise levels associated with munitions use are provided in Section 3.3. Expendables would also produce a potential increase in wildfire occurrences.  With the exception of some protected species on Eglin AFB that are monitored by Eglin Natural Resources, the impacts to wildlife from mission wildfires at Eglin have not been quantified. As fire is routinely employed by natural resource managers at both Eglin and by the FFS for ecological management, it is both beneficial and necessary for some habitats but can be detrimental under the wrong conditions (FDACS, 2007; U.S. Air Force, 2013a). To minimize the potential for wildfires, training groups would follow general operation constraints identified in Section 2.5; for example, during days with low fire danger, there are no restrictions on missions, but on days with extreme fire danger, no pyrotechnics are allowed without prior approval from the Eglin WFPM. The Air Force would work with the FFS to develop a similar approval process. Expendables can also produce chemical residue that could potentially impact wildlife through direct contact, ingestion, inhalation, or bioconcentration.  The most likely opportunity for such exposure would be immediately after the smoke has been dispelled. However, wildlife would most likely leave the area during training exercises, thereby reducing the likelihood of direct exposure. The potential for ingestion or inhalation of particles in sufficient amounts to cause harm is also low, due to wind-driven distribution of smoke particles. Aircraft Operations Aircraft would generate noise that would temporarily disturb or displace wildlife.  The potential effects of aircraft overflight on animals have been investigated to varying degrees, depending on the species.  A substantial literature synthesis report was compiled and published in 1998 as a cooperative effort between the USFWS and the Air Force Engineering and Services Center at Tyndall AFB, Florida (Manci et al., 1988).  A review of available literature of the effects of aircraft noise on domestic animals (among other types of animals) is also provided by NoiseQuest (2013). The following information is derived from these sources, except where otherwise noted. Animal response to aircraft noise is influenced by many variables such as aircraft size, speed, proximity, and engine noise level, among others.  In addition, response may differ according to aircraft type (fixed wing versus rotary wing).  Noise effects may be categorized as primary, secondary, and tertiary.  Primary effects include direct physical auditory impacts such as eardrum rupture and hearing threshold shifts.  Secondary effects include stress, behavioral changes, and decreased ability to perform functions such as obtaining food.  Tertiary effects include population decline and habitat destruction. Stress and associated behavioral changes may be among the more commonly observed effects of noise.  A sudden or unfamiliar sound may act as an alarm, activating the sympathetic nervous system and triggering short-term physiological reactions (fight-or-flight response). These reactions cause energy reserves to be used, may interrupt important behaviors, and may result in injury (trampling, etc.).  Conversely, wildlife may become habituated to repeated noise and show no observable response over time. While birds, small mammals, and reptiles may experience noise and associated effects to varying degrees, such species occurrences are expected to be insignificant based on the condition of the HLZs (i.e., disturbed agricultural fields) and the extent of use under the Proposed Action.  Of most concern are domestic livestock near HLZ locations. Noise produced by aircraft overflights and helicopter hovering would likely disturb wildlife on the LZs/HLZs and nearby vicinity.  The potential for impacts due to overflights would be greater than that associated with hovering.  Birds may react by exhibiting a startle response. Based on previous studies, and depending on the species and type of activity at the time of exposure, response could range from simply looking toward the aircraft to flushing (and associated energy expenditure) or other effects such as interruptions of nesting or breeding and abandonment of young.  Raptors would probably have the least potential for behavioral reactions, while waterfowl and some passerines would be more likely to be affected. Low-level flights would likely disturb or cause a startle reaction in mammal species.  Although the effects on some comparatively large mammals specifically found in the area (e.g., deer, black bears) are uncertain, it may be assumed that noise levels greater than 90 dB would cause at least some behavioral reaction such as freezing or fleeing.  Various effects, including startle effects and potential changes in habitat use, could occur in smaller mammal predators such as coyotes and foxes.  Although effects to small mammals such as squirrels, mice, and rats have been suggested at noise levels from 69 to 115 dBA, based on discussion provided in U.S. Air Force (2001), the effects are likely to be small. In general, although wildlife species may exhibit startle or escape responses to aircraft overflight, these responses are not necessarily detrimental long-term to a species, nor is reaction to aircraft noise alone enough to imply adverse effect. Animals react to a variety of external stimuli.  Most affected individuals would likely resume normal activities soon after training events are completed.  Low-level aircraft flight noise is not expected to significantly affect the overall health or viability of wildlife populations. Short-term startle effects due to visual sightings of aircraft could cause temporary displacement of individuals inhabiting areas surrounding the LZs/HLZs. However, animal species would likely habituate to aircraft presence over time, given the ongoing tempo of day-to-day training.  Some degree of habituation may already exist for some individuals because a variety of aircraft overflights by civilians, the FFS, and the military currently occurs in the forest regions.  Long-term reactions or significant behavior modifications are not expected from visual aircraft sightings. Amphibious Operations Aquatic wildlife may be directly impacted by a boat or indirectly impacted by disturbance or harassment during amphibious operations, but usage of the water areas would be similar to current recreational and commercial use and, therefore, would not be significant. Protected Species Impacts to protected species are similar in nature to those described previously for vegetation and wildlife.  Protected species could be directly impacted by vehicle collisions, land disturbance, and expendables (from wildfire), but the impacts are not anticipated to be significant because known species would be protected. Further, the effector mechanisms of noise and human activity related to military training are not unlike that of recreational PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT | APRIL 2014 1 hunting, logging, and other human activities that have been conducted at the forests for 2 many years. Thus, some species may have acclimated to noise and other disturbances. 3 Noise and human presence could disrupt feeding, breeding, and nesting activities, but the Air 4 Force would observe management practices as specified in EAFBI 13-212 that protect wildlife and minimize disturbance from noise and human contact. Such measures include 6 establishing buffer areas around known RCW habitats.  In addition, the Air Force would 7 familiarize troops with protected species, such as the Florida black bear and indigo snake, so 8 these animals would not be inadvertently injured or consumed during training.  Areas 9 potentially slated for ground disturbance, such as road widening, would be cleared of gopher tortoise burrows, and the animals would be relocated. 11 Wildfires can harm protected species, or their habitats. Fire response can involve heavy 12 equipment, such as fire plows, which can cut tree roots or, in wetland areas, change the 13 hydrology (water occurrence and flow) upon which protected species depend. The Air Force 14 would observe the FFS fire hazard index, which would minimize the potential for wildfire, and would not use expendables near sensitive habitats. 16 Sensitive Habitats 17 Impacts to sensitive habitats are similar in nature to those described previously for vegetation 18 and wildlife.  Known sensitive habitats would be protected, and areas potentially slated for 19 ground disturbance would be cleared of gopher tortoise burrows, which would be relocated if necessary. 21 Invasive Species 22 Invasive species can be spread or introduced directly as units, vehicles, vessels, and 23 equipment move from one area of the forest to another and from other parts of the country. 24 Because humans can act as vectors for the spread of invasive species, vehicle traffic and ground movements by troops could introduce and spread invasive species. 26 To reduce the potential of spreading invasive species, vehicles and equipment would be 27 cleaned before and after use in accordance with Armed Forces Pest Management Board 28 Technical Guide No. 31 Retrograde Washdowns: Cleaning and Inspection Procedures (U.S. Army, 29 2012). Vehicles and boats would not be used in areas with known invasive species problems. Impacts to native vegetation from invasive species would not be significant. 31 Wildfire can create conditions that enable fast-growing invasive species to colonize burned 32 areas and become established before native vegetation. Wildfires caused by expendables 33 may also impact invasive species.  Wildfires may provide an opening for invasive species to 34 spread. Conversely, invasive species may be killed in wildfires, thereby benefitting the health of the forest. 36 3.8.3.1 General Training Activity Impact Assessment Summary 37 Table 3-36 identifies potential interactions between Proposed Action effectors and biological 38 resource receptors. Activities shaded in green have little potential to impact the natural 39 environment or result in potential violations of federal, state, or local regulations.  Therefore, these activities are not carried forward for detailed analysis in Chapters 5 and 6. Activities 41 shaded yellow have the potential for adverse impacts and are carried forward for site-specific 42 analysis in Chapters 5 and 6. Table 3-36.

These would be inherent to the 4 Proposed Action. Additional Resource-Specific Mitigations have been identified that would further minimize impact potential or the severity of identified impacts; these are also included 6 in the ESA Section 7 Consultation located in Appendix C: 7 • The USFWS, as part of the ESA Section 7 consultation process (USFWS, 2014), has 8 recommended the following conservation measures: no low-water crossings or water9 related training within 2 miles of the Blackwater River fish hatchery; avoidance of “Good” and “Poor” rated vehicle water crossings for training use in order to protect the 11 better crossing sites, and minimizing further degradation of the sites in poor 12 condition. 13 • Develop and implement a forest-specific process that will notify Eglin Natural 14 Resources of the dates and locations of upcoming training events to support spot surveys/inspections for compliance. 16 • Survey proposed new training locations (including fixed wing aircraft landing sites and 17 HLZs) for protected/sensitive species, and survey existing training areas at least every 18 3 years to identify any new sensitive species that have moved into the area. As 19 necessary, update associated operational constraints and GLI Protection Level maps. • Mark identified threatened and endangered plants on user maps and in the field.Prior 21 to any activity that has the potential to create significant soil disturbance, conduct a 22 survey for federally listed plants.  If listed plants cannot be avoided, additional 23 consultation under the ESA is required. 24 • Prior to any training activities and once specific training areas and corridors are identified for the upcoming year, these areas must be surveyed for bald eagle nests, 26 and active trees must be marked. Coordinate with Eglin Natural Resources and the 27 FFS to ensure that any necessary markings are completed prior to ground operations. 28 • Prior to any training activities, route requests for land disturbing activities through 29 Eglin AFB and the FFS for approval. • Follow guidance provided in the Eglin Environmental Guidebooks regarding approved 31 plant and animal species for camouflage and consumption.  Develop materials for 32 military members to avoid inappropriate handling or consumption of wildlife, and 33 clarify to ground troops that diamondback rattlesnakes are not to be consumed. • Prior to any land disturbance (e.g., tree clearing for LOS), sensitive species surveys must be conducted, and any identified sensitive species and associated habitat must 36 be avoided.  If avoidance is not possible, then additional consultation under the ESA is 37 likely to be required. 38 • Prior to driving across a low water stream crossing, check for turtles and allow them to 39 clear the crossing before use. • Avoid driving on roads with erosion issues; report any erosion issues to the GLI Liaison. 1  3.9 CULTURAL RESOURCES  2  Cultural resources consist of prehistoric and historic sites, structures, artifacts, and any other  3  physical or traditional evidence of human activity considered relevant to a particular culture  4  or community for scientific, traditional, religious, or other reasons.  Each cultural resource  component is referred to as a “receptor.”  6  As defined under 32 CFR 800 (l)(1), “Historic Property means any prehistoric or historic district,  7  site, building, structure, or object included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register  8  of Historic Places (NRHP) maintained by the Secretary of the Interior. This term includes  9  artifacts, records, and remains that are related and located within such properties. The term  includes properties of traditional religious and cultural importance to an Indian tribe or Native  11  Hawaiian organization and that meet the National Register criteria.”  12  The cultural resources sections in this EIS describe known historic properties within the  13  affected areas that are potentially eligible for the NRHP and evaluate whether elements of the  14  Proposed Action would potentially affect these resources. They include any archaeological  resources considered eligible, potentially eligible, or currently listed on the NRHP. This may  16  include historic structures, historic districts, any known historic cemeteries, traditional cultural  17  properties (TCPs), or sacred sites (SSs).  18  3.9.1 Impact Assessment Methodology  19  The impact assessment for cultural resources evaluates the potential impacts of the Proposed  Action to cultural resource receptors.  Impacts to these resources are evaluated according to  21  type, context, intensity, and duration (as described in Section 3.1), as well as the regulatory  22  drivers identified below. Together, these factors define the potential significance of the  23  impacts.  24  3.9.1.1 Regulatory Drivers  Attention to cultural resources is necessary for the Air Force to comply with a host of federal  26  laws, regulations, and EOs, including:  27  • The NHPA of 1966, as amended.  Under NHPA, the Air Force is required to consider the  28  effects of its undertakings on historic properties listed or eligible for listing on the  29  NRHP and to consult with interested parties regarding potential impacts per 36 CFR.  The regulatory NHPA Section 106 compliance process consists of four primary stages.  31  These include initiation of the Section 106 process (36 CFR 800.3); identification of  32  historic properties (36 CFR 800.4), which includes identifying historic properties  33  potentially affected by a proposed action; assessment of adverse effects  34  (36 CFR 800.5), which determines whether the action would affect historic properties  and if effects to those properties might be adverse; and resolution of adverse effects  36  (36 CFR 800.6) between affected and consulting parties such as the SHPO, the Advisory  37  Council on Historic Preservation, Indian tribes, and interested individuals. Additional  38  stipulations are provided for in the NHPA should efforts fail to resolve adverse effects  39  during this process (36 CFR 800.7).  PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT | APRIL 2014 1 • The DoD frames its Native American and Alaska Native Policy of 20 October 1998 in 2 terms that emphasize the responsibility of DoD personnel to consult with tribal 3 governments on a government-to-government basis very early in the decision-making 4 process.  This policy memorandum requires an effort to increase understanding between tribes and DoD personnel and to assess tribal positions on issues with 6 the potential to significantly affect protected tribal resources, tribal rights, and 7 Native American lands (DoD, 1998).  Also applicable is DoDI 4710.02, DoD Interactions 8 with Federally Recognized Tribes, of September 14, 2006. This DoDI strengthens and 9 elaborates on the 1998 policy. • The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) of 1990 (25 11 USC 3001 et seq., as amended) addresses the protection of Native American burial 12 sites and regulates the removal and study of human remains, funerary objects, sacred 13 objects, and items of cultural patrimony on federal and tribal lands or by institutions 14 receiving federal funding. • DoD Instruction 4715.03, Environmental Conservation Program, DoD Instruction 16 4715.16, Cultural Resources Management, and AFI 32-7065, Cultural Resources 17 Management, outlines and specifies procedures for Air Force cultural resource 18 management programs. 19 Other federal laws and regulations governing cultural resources include: • Antiquities Act of 1906 21 • Historic Sites Act of 1935 22 • Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974 23 • Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 24 • American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 • 36 CFR 79, Curation of Federally Owned and Administered Archaeological Collections 26 • 43 CFR 7, Protection of Archaeological Resources 27 • 36 CFR 60, NRHP 28 • 36 CFR 63, Determinations of Eligibility for Inclusion in the National Register 29 Cultural resource-related EOs that may govern the Proposed Actions include: • EO 11593, Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment 31 • EO 13007, Indian Sacred Sites (SSs) 32 • EO 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments 33 • EO 13287, Preserve America 34 3.9.1.2 Assessment Method As stated in Chapter 2, the Air Force currently requires activity restrictions and limitations, as 36 well as avoidance and mitigation measures, to protect cultural resources on Eglin AFB.  These 37 measures are designed to avoid impacts to these resources.  Eglin AFB Range users also observe procedures in EAFBI 13-212, where applicable, are included in GLI training components as part of the Proposed Action. For purposes of this EIS, cultural resource analysis assumed that avoidance and mitigation measures currently in place on Eglin AFB would be implemented as part of the Proposed Action. If necessary, additional avoidance or mitigation methods are recommended. Cultural resources were analyzed by assessing each resource’s state of investigation and condition, then evaluating the resource as it intersects with the Area of Potential Effects (APE) created by the Proposed Action. The ROI for this EIS is equivalent to the APE designation utilized in the NHPA. As defined under 36 CFR 800.16(d), “the Area of Potential Effects is the geographic area or areas within which an undertaking may directly or indirectly cause changes in the character or use of historic properties, if such properties exist.” The APE is influenced by the scale and nature of the Proposed Action and may differ according to the kinds of effects caused by the action. The APE for this project is assumed not to extend beyond the footprint of the activity boundaries as defined under each alternative training area. NHPA obligations (as described herein) for a federal agency are independent from the NEPA process and must be complied with even when environmental documentation is not required. When both are required, the Air Force may coordinate NEPA compliance with their NHPA responsibilities to ensure that historic properties, as defined under 36 CFR 800.16(l)(1), are given adequate consideration. As per AFI 32-7065, Section 3.3.1, and 36 CFR 800.8(a), the Air Force has chosen to incorporate NHPA Section 106 review into the NEPA process, rather than substituting the NEPA process for a separate NHPA Section 106 review of alternatives (AFI 32-7065, Section 3.3.2, and 36 CFR 800[c]). Properties identified in the APE by the Air Force are evaluated according to the NRHP criteria, in consultation with the SHPO and other parties. Typically, if the SHPO and other parties and the Air Force agree in writing that a historic property is eligible or not eligible to the NRHP, that judgment is sufficient for purposes of Section 106 (36 CFR 800.4[c][2]). Relevant procedures and criteria can be found in 36 CFR 63, Determinations of Eligibility for Inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. Formal initiation of the Section 106 process began with notification to the Florida SHPO and ACHP on December 18, 2013, of the Proposed Action and anticipated impacts.   Also, five federally recognized tribes were notified of the Proposed Action on December 18, 2013, in accordance with the NHPA.  Subsequent follow-on phone calls to the five federally recognized tribes were made in January 2014 (see Appendix C for a full record of correspondence).  A government-to-government letter was mailed in February 2014. Information regarding these consultations and notifications are provided in Appendix C, Consultation Documentation. Table 3-37 defines how the impact attributes of context, intensity, and duration are applied to the cultural resource analysis. PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT | APRIL 2014 1 Table 3-37.  Definitions of Impact Attributes for Cultural Resources Categories TCP = traditional cultural property; SS = sacred site  2  If a cultural resource is impacted, mitigations or avoidance measures would be required  3  regardless of impact context, duration, and/or intensity.  However, the scope of mitigations or  4  avoidance would be based on context and duration of the impact.  5  3.9.1.3 Impact Levels  6  The level of impact associated with cultural resources and the impact’s potential significance  7  is determined by considering how Proposed Action effectors could interact with cultural  8  resources in terms of context, intensity and duration as described in Table 3-37.  For purposes  9  of this EIS, there are two types of effects when considering historic properties, which are  10  defined by 36 CFR Section 800.5:  11  • Adverse Effect: “When an undertaking may alter, directly or indirectly, any of the  12  characteristics of a historic property that qualify the property for inclusion in the NRHP  13  in a manner that would diminish the integrity of the property’s location, design,  14  setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association” (36 CFR 800.5(a)(1)). Based  15  on context and intensity factors identified in Table 3-37 and the NHPA regulatory  16  definitions of impact, the Air Force has identified the potential for adverse impacts to  17  cultural resources.  However, the Air Force has notified the ACHP, Florida SHPO, and  18  applicable Native American tribes about this Proposed Action. Consultation  19  documents under the NHPA Section 106 will be provided in Appendix C, Consultation  20  Documentation, and results of the consultation process will be included in the Final  21  EIS.  22  • No Adverse Effect: “When the undertaking's effects do not meet the criteria of  23  paragraph (a)(1) of this section or the undertaking is modified or conditions are  PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT | APRIL 2014  1  imposed, such as the subsequent review of plans for rehabilitation by the SHPO/THPO  2  to ensure consistency with the Secretary’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic  3  Properties (36 CFR part 68) and applicable guidelines, to avoid adverse effects” (36 CFR  4  800.5(b)).  5  Table 3-38 explains the impact level categories for cultural resources analyzed in this EIS and  6  identified in Chapters 4, 5, and 6.  7  Table 3-38.  Impact Level Categories for Cultural Resources  Adverse but Adverse effects occur when an undertaking may alter, directly or indirectly, any of the characteristics of a not historic property that qualify the property for inclusion in the NRHP in a manner that would diminish the integrity of the property’s location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association. The potential for regional or localized high-to medium-intensity or low-intensity long-term impacts to currently unidentified historic properties that may require mitigation or resource avoidance. Reduction or improvement in adverse effects only occurs through avoidance of the resource or mitigation of effects. Localized or regional actions that do not affect historic properties. Either no historic properties are present or there are historic properties present but the Proposed Action would have no effect upon these properties. TCP = traditional cultural properties; SS = sacred sites; NRHP = National Register of Historic Places  8  3.9.2 General Emitter Activity Impact Assessment  9  Based on scope of action described in Chapter 2, emitter site use would not be expected to  10  result in impacts to cultural resources, because emitters would be located on property already  11  heavily modified and disturbed with existing infrastructure in place. As a result, this resource  12  area is not carried forward for site-specific analysis in Chapter 4.  13  3.9.3 General Training Activity Impact Assessment  14  Analysis focused on potential adverse effects to cultural resources due to physical  15  disturbance from troop movements, bivouacking, and other ground-disturbing activities.  16  General Operational Constraints to alleviate potential adverse effects to cultural resources  17  from mission activities are detailed in Section 2.5. Under the Proposed Action, these  18  requirements would be implemented or, in some cases, certain areas would be avoided.  19  Cross-country ground operations, bivouacking, and other ground-disturbing activities could  20  displace or destroy cultural resources.  Dismounted movements are more likely to affect  21  archaeological sites in areas where soil is exceptionally soft or devoid of vegetation, where  22  activities occur on steep slopes such as along stream banks or interior gullies, or where  23  artifacts are located on ground surface. To avoid impacts from any cross-country training  24  operations, units must coordinate with FFS staff and the Eglin AFB 96th Civil Engineer  25  Group/Environmental Assets (96 CEG/CEIEA) Cultural Resources Office to determine  26  avoidance areas and only conduct ground-disturbing activities in areas known to be devoid  27  of historic properties.  If cultural resources are unexpectedly discovered during the course of  28  proposed activities, all activity in the immediate vicinity would cease until FFS staff or the  29  Cultural Resources Office has been notified and a determination of significance has been  30  rendered.  PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT | APRIL 2014 1 AO can affect cultural resources if such resources are either submerged and hidden or located 2 on riverbanks or along shorelines where landings occur. If direct impacts to cultural resources 3 occur during AO, these impacts would be more likely to damage resources, due to the 4 exposed surface conditions and loosely consolidated sand and soils in this type of 5 environment. 6 Based on the scope of action described in Chapter 2, some of the training activities could 7 have some interaction with cultural resources. Table 3-39 identifies potential interactions 8 between Proposed Action effectors and cultural resource receptors. Items shaded yellow 9 have the potential for adverse impacts and have been carried for site-specific analysis in 10 Chapters 5 (BRSF) and 6 (THSF). Activities shaded in green have little potential to impact 11 cultural resources or result in potential violations of federal, state, or local regulations. 12 Therefore, these activities are not carried forward for detailed analysis in Chapters 5 and 6. 13 Table 3-39.  Receptor and Effector Interactions for Cultural Resources TCP = traditional cultural property; SS = sacred site PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT | APRIL 2014  1  3.9.4 Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations  2  Based on general impact analyses presented in Section 3.9, no Resource-Specific Mitigations  3  have been identified for cultural resources in this chapter.  Implementation of General  4  Operational Constraints described in Section 2.5 would serve to minimize any identified  5  adverse impacts.  6  3.10 LAND USE  7  “Land use” typically refers to the management and use of land by people.  Components of  8  land use include general land use patterns, land ownership, land management plans, and  9  special use areas.  General land use patterns characterize the types of uses within a particular  10  area.  Specific uses of land typically include agriculture, barren land, rangeland,  11  transportation/communications/utilities, forested, urban/built up, water, and wetlands.  Land  12  use also includes areas set aside for preservation or protection of natural resources, wildlife  13  habitat, vegetation, or unique features. Management plans, policies, ordinances, and  14  regulations determine the types of uses that protect specially designated or environmentally  15  sensitive areas (NFWMD, 2007).  16  Each land use component is referred to as a “receptor.”  For purposes of this EIS, the two main  17  land use receptors considered are landowners and recreational users within and adjacent to  18  the land areas proposed for use.  19  3.10.1 Impact Assessment Methodology  20  The impact assessment for land use evaluates the potential impacts of the Proposed Action  21  on landowners and recreational users.  Impacts to these land use receptors are evaluated  22  according to type, context, intensity, and duration (as described in Section 3.1), as well as the  23  regulatory drivers identified below.  Together, these attributes define the potential  24  significance of the impacts.  25  3.10.1.1 Regulatory Drivers  26  Table 3-40 summarizes the regulations and planning documents applicable to land use under  27  the Proposed Action.  All activities would be conducted according to the guidelines  28  presented in these documents and regulations.  PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT | APRIL 2014 1 Table 3-40.  Applicable Land Use Regulations and Planning Documents Table 3-41.  Definitions of Impact Attributes for Land Use Name of Regulation/Planning Document  Description  Designated Multiple-Use of the Property, Florida Statute 589.04(3)  Permits a variety of activities on Florida state land with a focus on restoring, protecting, and managing ecosystems while at the same time integrating public use.  Air Force Instruction 32-7064; Integrated Natural Resources Management  Addresses the management of natural resources on Air Force properties to comply with federal, state, and local standards.  Blackwater River State Forest 5-Year Resource Management Plan  Provides guidelines and a framework for preserving natural resources within the state forest with a specific focus on the multiple-use concept.  Ten-Year Resource Management Plan for Tate’s Hell State Forest  Outlines management goals and guidelines for maintaining a balance between the preservation of natural resources while integrating the multiple-use concept.  Eglin AFB  Instruction (EAFBI) 13-212, Range Planning and Operations, Chapter 7 – Environmental Management (December 2010, Interim Change on 32 September 2011)  Identifies requirements for protection of natural and cultural resources and waste management. These guidelines would be adopted and adhered to throughout the course of the Proposed Action.  2  3.10.1.2 Assessment Method  3  Typically, impacts to land use involve changes in the designated land use status and the  4  manner in which the land may be utilized by people. In certain circumstances,  5  incompatibilities in land use may arise and require further planning or consultations between  6  landowners until an agreeable designation is issued.  Impacts can be assessed by identifying  7  current uses and proximity to sensitive populations and determining the degree to which  8  they would be affected by the Proposed Action and alternatives.  9  Impacts from noise associated with the Proposed Action are a potentially significant factor in  10  land use compatibility. Noise generated by the setup and operation of emitter sites, as well as  11  noise associated with the various training activities, particularly the use of HLZs and FWALS,  12  could temporarily impact recreational use as well disturb adjacent landowners. Major  13  recreational uses near the emitter sites and at BRSF and THSF that could experience potential  14  impacts include hunting, fishing, hiking, and camping. Although noise impacts are not  15  anticipated to permanently preclude these activities, recreational users may experience  16  temporary disturbances that would conflict with or temporarily preclude these activities  17  while HLZs and FWALS are in use. The mitigation measures discussed in Chapter 2 would help  18  minimize or eliminate some of the impacts felt by recreational users and adjacent  19  landowners. See Section 3.3, Noise, for more details regarding the extent and duration of  20  potential noise impacts associated with emitter sites and training activities.  Sections 5.10  21  and 6.10 (Land Use analysis for BRSF and THSF, respectively) further detail the specific types of  22  recreational areas and activities at BRSF and THSF.   23  3.10.1.3 Impact Levels  24  The level of impact associated with land use receptors and the impact’s potential significance  25  is determined by considering how Proposed Action effectors could interact with land use in  26  terms of context, intensity, and duration as described in Table 3-41.  Table 3-42 explains the  27  impact level categories for land use analyzed in this EIS and identified in Chapters 4, 5, and 6.   Attribute  Land Use Designation  Recreational Use  Landowners  Contexts Analyzed  Regional/population/recreational areas/management areas  County level, state park level, recreational area, or management unit level effects; impacts to populations and multiple landowners.  Localized  Less than management area effects; impacts to individuals and specific landowners.  Intensity (can be either adverse or beneficial)  High Mitigation measures required to minimize/avoid adverse impacts, with scope of the mitigations based on context and duration of the impact.  Substantive and noticeable changes to land use designations resulting in removal of incompatible land use designations, or introduction of new designations resulting in incompatibility and/or a violation of laws, regulations, or land use management policies.  Substantive change in recreational use resulting in relative improvement of the recreational experience or conflicts such that lack of compatibility would prohibit recreational activities from occurring. Such impacts would consist of opening of new recreational areas or creation of new restricted areas (RAs).  Substantive and noticeable changes in land use resulting in relative improvement in adjacent landowner’s property values, convenience, or potential annoyance factors, or actions that result in conflict with landowners such that property values decline and activities are incompatible with current landowner uses.   Medium Mitigations may be required to avoid adverse impacts depending on context and duration of the impact.  Moderate changes to land use designations resulting in relative improvement of current incompatible land use designations (e.g., change from industrial to commercial), or changes in current designations resulting in a temporary or resolvable conflict of land use compatibility that does not result in a violation of laws, regulations, or land use management policies.  Moderate change in recreational use resulting in relative improvement of the recreational experience or conflicts. Such impacts may result in temporary restrictions on recreational use or occasional annoyance or removal of existing temporary restrictions.  Moderate impacts to landowners would be anticipated, such as occasional inconvenience or annoyance. These impacts would have no effect on property values or current use.  Low No mitigations required.  Negligible change in land use designation. Not anticipated to result in any relative changes in current land use compatibility.  Negligible impacts to recreational users. May result in minor, infrequent annoyance but would not prohibit recreational activities.  Negligible impacts to adjacent landowners. May result in infrequent, minor annoyance but would not result in conflicts with adjacent landowners or result in changes to property values.  Neutral  Impacts to land use that would cause no apparent change in land use designations and would not result in land use compatibility conflicts.  No impacts to recreational users.  No impacts to adjacent land owners.  Duration  Long term  Effect would likely endure for the life of the action.  Medium term  Effect would likely last for a few months to a year.  Short term  Effect would likely last for a few days to weeks.  PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT | APRIL 2014 1 Table 3-42.  Impact Level Categories for Land Use Level of Impact  Land Use Designation  Recreational Use  Landowners  Adverse  Adverse impacts may result in changes in regional or local land use designations, the level of impact directly related to the impact attributes described in Table 3-41. Adverse impacts may be perceived as significant under high-intensity scenarios at any duration where permanent changes in land use designations result in conflict with existing land use management plans, statutes, or other policies. Insignificant impacts may occur under medium-to low-intensity scenarios of any duration causing a temporary or resolvable conflict of land use compatibility.  Adverse impacts may result in recreational use conflicts or preclude recreational use, the level of impact directly related to the impact attributes described in Table 3-41. Adverse impacts may be perceived as significant under high-intensity scenarios of any duration if permanent conflicts preclude recreational use. Insignificant impacts may occur under high-to medium–intensity scenarios of any duration that may cause temporary recreational use conflicts.  Adverse impacts may result in annoyance or conflicts with landowners, the level of impact directly related to the impact attributes described in Table 3-41.  Adverse impacts may be perceived as significant under high-intensity scenarios of any duration if they cause substantial long-term annoyance and/or permanent conflicts to affected landowners.  Insignificant impacts may occur under any intensity of any duration resulting in infrequent, minor annoyance but no conflicts with adjacent landowners or result in changes to property values.  Neutral/no effect  Activities do not result in a conflict of land use compatibility regardless of intensity.  Activities would not prohibit or otherwise interfere with recreational uses, regardless of intensity.  Activities would not cause a conflict with landowners, regardless of intensity.  2  3.10.2 General Emitter Activity Impact Assessment  3  The main issues affecting land use would be associated with the safety hazards from emitters  4  and the potential for emitter SHDs (as described in Section 3.4, Safety) to encroach on existing  5  land uses, thus resulting in incompatibility.  While the EMR, as expressed in SHDs associated  6  with the emitters, is unlikely to impact/change existing land use designations or recreational  7  opportunities, or conflict with adjacent land owners, site-specific analysis of land use has  8  been carried forward to Chapter 4.  9  3.10.3 General Training Activity Impact Assessment  10  Adverse impacts to recreational users may occur as a result of temporary annoyance from  11  noise during training activities (see Section 3.3, Noise).  These impacts would mainly occur in  12  the interstitial areas between identified recreational sites, because recreational sites identified  13  would be avoided for noise-generating activities such as aircraft overflights and expendable  14  use (see Section 3.3,  Noise).   While the quality of the recreational experience may be  15  somewhat diminished by noise impacts, this would not preclude recreational use or cause  16  general incompatibility, and impacts would be short  term.  Additionally, conflicts with  17  hunters would not occur because training activities would be restricted in the daytime during  18  hunting season.  PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT | APRIL 2014  1  Overall, there would be some small-scale, temporary public access restrictions to specific  2  training locations while training occurs. Some temporary road segment closures would result  3  at FWALS locations and during BD.  However, this would not negatively impact overall land  4  use because this would only occur on small segments of roadway and would be short-term in  5  nature; access would resume once training activities have ceased. These segment closures  6  would not affect access to parts of the forests because there are sufficient roadways available  7  to go around the closed segments.  Access to HLZ/DZ locations would also be temporarily  8  restricted while training activities occur; however, there would only be a few active HLZs/DZs  9  at any given time, and use would be infrequent.  10  Noise and safety impacts affecting land use for adjacent landowners would be mitigated  11  through implementation of General Operational Constraints identified in Section 2.5, and  12  Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations identified in Section 3.3 (Noise) and Section 3.4  13  (Safety). Overall, the Air Force has not identified any changes to land use designations or  14  significant land use conflicts.  15  3.10.3.1 General Training Activity Impact Assessment Summary  16  Based on the scope and nature of activities described in Chapter 2, no changes to land use  17  designations are anticipated. However, several training activities could produce noise that  18  may have a temporary, low-level impact on recreational users and landowners within the  19  state forests. Table 3-43 identifies potential interactions between Proposed Action effectors  20  and land use receptors; these activities are shaded yellow and carried forward in Chapters 5  21  and 6 for detailed site-specific analysis.  Activities shaded in green have little potential to  22  impact public health or safety or the human and natural environment or do not result in  23  potential violations of federal, state, or local regulations. Therefore, these activities are not  24  carried forward for detailed analysis in Chapters 5 and 6.  25  Table 3-43.  Receptors and Effector Interactions for Land Use Resources  Proposed Action  Land Use Resource Area Potentially Affected (Receptor)  Effector  Land Use Designations  Recreational Users  Landowners  Land Disturbance  Overall, no anticipated impact. Any required land-disturbing activities would be conducted in  accordance with applicable guidelines and regulations. This issue has not been carried forward for  site-specific analysis.  Land development  Land development activities under the Proposed Action are associated with FWALS improvements  and possibly addition of gravel surfaces at HLZs/DZs for vehicle parking. Roadways used as  FWALS would still be utilized as roadways, and addition of gravel surfaces would not change land  use designations. There would be no effects to recreational users or landowners from these actions.  This issue has not been carried forward for site-specific analysis.  Point impact  Incidental surface disturbance  These types of land disturbance would have no impact on land use, recreational users, or  landowners.  This issue has not been carried forward for detailed, site-specific analysis.  Consumption  Ground Movement  Overall, no anticipated impact. Ground movements would be conducted in accordance with  Wheeled vehicles  applicable guidelines and regulations. In addition, ground movements would be specifically timed in  Dismounted maneuver  order to reduce or eliminate impacts to recreational users and landowners. For example, during  hunting season, ground movements would occur only from 2 hours after sunset to 2 hours before  sunrise to minimize conflicts during hunting season. Additionally, ground movements would avoid  inhabited recreational sites and private property. Temporary access restrictions to small portions of  the forests (road segments, HLZs/DZs) would have no overall impact on land use.  This issue has  not been carried forward for site-specific analysis.  Table 3-43.

This issue has not been carried forward for site-specific analysis.  Utilities  No anticipated impact. Usage of utilities would not be expected to result in impacts to  land use designations, recreational users, or landowners.

Implementation of General Operational  4  Constraints described in Section 2.5 would serve to minimize any identified adverse impacts.  5  3.11 SOCIOECONOMICS/ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE  6  Within the context of this EIS, “socioeconomic resources” refers to the populations, economic  7  activity, recreation, and tourism associated with the surrounding areas proposed for use.  8  “Environmental justice” refers to the potentially affected populations that meet certain  9  characteristics based on race, income, and age.   Each socioeconomics and environmental  10  justice resource components is referred to as a “receptor.”  11  3.11.1 Impact Assessment Methodology  12  The impact assessment for socioeconomics and environmental justice evaluates the potential  13  impacts of the Proposed Action on socioeconomic and environmental justice receptors.  14  Impacts to these resources are evaluated according to type, context, intensity, and duration  15  (as described in Section 3.1), as well as the regulatory drivers identified below.   Together,  16  these factors define the potential significance of the impacts.  17  3.11.1.1  Regulatory Drivers  18  Laws  and  regulations  applicable  to the  Proposed  Action  for  socioeconomics  and  19  environmental justice are summarized in this section.  • There is no applicable regulatory setting for socioeconomics. • EO 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations, directs federal agencies to address environmental and human health conditions in minority and low-income communities. • EO 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks, directs federal agencies to identify and assess environmental health and safety risks that may disproportionately affect children. 3.11.1.2 Assessment Method The assessment method described below was applied to socioeconomic and environmental justice receptors identified within the Proposed Action ROIs as described in Sections 4.11.1, 5.11.1, and 6.11.1.  There are no specific guidelines on assessment of socioeconomic resources but in general, any federal action that would result in a change in the spatial distribution of populations, spending patterns, employment, income, or public services would be considered an impact.  Under the Proposed Action, there would be no change to populations; as a result, population impacts are not addressed in this EIS. Analysis of impacts to environmental justice focused first on identifying potentially significant adverse impacts identified for any of the resource areas described in this EIS.  If no potentially significant impacts to any populations were identified, environmental justice concerns were not considered further. For purposes of this EIS, the ROI for the environmental justice analysis is the county, which served as the region of comparison, and analysis focused on the demographics of specific affected populations for each of the alternatives evaluated.  Where potentially significant impacts were identified, the percentage of low-income and minority persons and children under 18 were calculated for the ROI. These percentages were compared with those of the region of comparison to determine if the affected population is disproportionately composed of low-income and minority persons and children (i.e., has higher percentages). Data relative to race and age were derived from the 2010 decennial census.  For the purposes of this analysis, “children” were defined as persons age 17 and younger. The 2010 census does not contain any data relative to income; therefore, low-income populations were identified using data from the 2007–2011 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates.  The ACS 5-year estimates constitute the most recent data set available from the Census Bureau that tabulates data relative to income at the census tract level of geography. Table 3-44 defines how the impact attributes of context, intensity, and duration are applied to socioeconomic and environmental justice analyses. 1 Table 3-44.

Extensive mitigations required to minimize adverse impacts; scope determined by context and duration of the impact.  Substantive and noticeable disproportionate effect to the health or economic conditions of minority, low-income, and youth populations as a result of significance threshold exceedance for identified resource areas (e.g., safety, land use).  Extensive mitigations required to minimize adverse impacts; scope determined by context and duration of the impact.  Medium  Noticeable effect to socioeconomic characteristics that the market can adjust to within the short to medium term, such as increased incidental spending of military personnel during training activities or minor reduction in income over the medium to short term.  Mitigations may be required to minimize adverse impacts; scope determined by context and duration of the impact.  Noticeable disproportionate effect to the health or economic conditions of minority, low-income, and youth populations that do not exceed resource-specific significance threshold criteria. Mitigations may be required to minimize adverse impacts; scope determined by context and duration of the impact.  Low  Minimal change in socioeconomic characteristics that the market can adjust to immediately.  No mitigations required.  Minimal effect to the health or economic conditions of minority, low-income, and youth populations that is not disproportionate and does not result in exceedance of any significance thresholds. No mitigations required.  Neutral  No discernable effect to socioeconomic resource conditions.  No discernable effect to minority, low-income, or youth populations.  Duration  Long term  Effect would likely endure for more than a year after the activity.  Medium term  Effect would likely last for a few months to a year after the activity.  Short term  Effect would likely last only for the duration of the activity.  2  3.11.1.3  Impact Levels  3  The level of impact associated with socioeconomics and environmental justice and the  4  impact’s potential significance is determined by considering how Proposed Action effectors  5  could interact with socioeconomics and environmental justice resources in terms of context,  6  intensity, and duration as described in Table 3-44. Table 3-45 explains the impact level  7  categories for socioeconomics and environmental justice resource categories analyzed in this  8  EIS and identified in Chapters 4, 5, and 6.  Table 3-45.  Impact Level Categories for Socioeconomics and Environmental Justice Level of Impact  Socioeconomics  Environmental Justice  Adverse  Adverse impacts may result in negative changes to socioeconomic characteristics such as job numbers or spending, the level of impact directly related to the impact attributes described in Table 3-44.  Adverse impacts may be perceived as significant under high-intensity scenarios of any duration that require long-term market adjustments and extensive mitigation.  Insignificant impacts may occur under medium-intensity scenarios of any duration requiring medium-to short-term market adjustments and minimal mitigation.  Adverse impacts may affect the health or economic conditions of minority, low-income, or youth populations, the level of impact directly related to the impact attributes described in Table 3-44. Adverse impacts may be perceived as significant under medium-to high-intensity scenarios of any duration resulting in substantive and noticeable disproportionate health or economic effects. Insignificant impacts may occur under low-intensity scenarios of any duration and have negative health or economic effects but they are not disproportionate and only require minimal mitigation.  Neutral/no effect  Activities do not result in adverse impacts to socioeconomic conditions and require no mitigation.  Activities do not result in adverse effects to the health or economic conditions of minority, low-income, or youth populations within the ROI.  ROI = region of influence  2  3.11.2 General Emitter Activity Impact Assessment  3  Socioeconomic and environmental justice impacts are relative to the site-specific location of  4  the proposed emitter sites. In general, there would be minimal socioeconomic impacts  5  associated with emitter activity.  These would be related to increased revenue to the FFS from  6  Air Force lease of emitter sites and incidental local spending from military personnel while  7  involved in a training action.  Potential impacts to the general public associated with safety  8  and land use resulting emitter placement and use are described in Sections 3.4 (Safety) and  9  3.10 (Land Use), respectively. These impact analyses, as well as potential environmental  10  justice-related issues resulting from safety and land use impacts have been carried forward  11  for site-specific analysis in Chapter 4.   12  3.11.3 General Training Activity Impact Assessment  13  Economic Activity  14  No significant adverse impacts to socioeconomic resources would result from Proposed  15  Action activities.  Ground and vehicular movement in the forest would occur on designated  16  roads.  Road maintenance is costly to the FFS, and additional road usage and ISD from ground  17  movement could create an additional expense.  However, the number of people and vehicles  18  and the frequency of training activities proposed to occur would not be anticipated to add  19  significant maintenance costs.  In addition, the FFS would constrain the time, frequency, and  20  types of activities to avoid conflicts with hunters, campers, boaters, and other recreational  21  users to avoid negatively impacting visitor usage.  1  A concern was expressed during the scoping comment period that housing values would be  2  negatively impacted by noise associated with military training activities in the forest. There  3  are many factors that influence the market value of a home including location, square  4  footage, amenities, year built, and surrounding environmental conditions such as noise and  safety. However, based on Sections 3.3 (Noise) and 3.4 (Safety), the training activities would  6  avoid noise sensitive locations such as residences, schools, etc., therefore no significant  7  impacts to housing values would be anticipated as a result of the proposed action.  8  Recreation and Tourism  9  While training activities under the Proposed Action would not result in significant adverse  impacts to recreation and tourism, training activities may result in adverse impacts from  11  noise, safety, and land use impacts as described in Sections 3.3 (Noise), 3.4 (Safety), and 3.10  12  (Land Use), respectively.  As described in Chapter 2, the FFS would constrain the time,  13  frequency, and types of activities to avoid conflicts with hunters, campers, and boaters.  Some  14  recreational users, such as hikers, may be annoyed by noise from aircraft operations.   Environmental Justice and Special Risks to Children  16  Environmental justice impacts and special risks to children may result from noise, safety, and  17  land use impacts as described in Sections 3.3 (Noise), 3.4 (Safety), and 3.10 (Land Use),  18  respectively.  No other significant impacts for this action have been identified that would  19  impact environmental justice or pose special risks to children.  3.11.3.1 General Training Activity Impact Assessment Summary  21  Based on the scope of action described in Chapter 2, most training activities would have at  22  least some interaction with socioeconomics and environmental justice resources. Table 3-46  23  identifies potential interaction between Proposed Action effectors and socioeconomics and  24  environmental justice resource receptors. Activities shaded in yellow have the potential to  impact the public health and safety and the human and natural environment and are carried  26  forward for detailed analysis in Chapters 5 and 6.  Activities shaded green have little potential  27  to impact public health or safety or the human and natural environment or do not result in  28  potential violations of federal, state, or local regulations. Therefore, these activities are not  29  carried forward for detailed analysis in Chapters 5 and 6.  Table 3-46.

Receptor and Effector Interactions for Socioeconomics and Environmental Justice, Cont’d 1 3.11.4 Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations 2 Based on general impact analyses presented in Section 3.11, Proposed Resource-Specific 3 Mitigations would be the same as those identified in Sections 3.3 (Noise), 3.4 (Safety), and 3.10 4 (Land Use).  1 3.12 SOLID AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS/WASTE 2 This discusses the generation and management of solid and hazardous materials and wastes 3 associated with the activities under the Proposed Action. 4 3.12.1 Impact Assessment Methodology The analyses focused on how and to what degree the Proposed Action would affect 6 hazardous materials management and solid waste generation and management.  The debris 7 from range operations was calculated based on the types of ordnance used. 8 3.12.1.1 Regulatory Drivers 9 The following primary standards and regulations apply to solid and hazardous materials/wastes as it relates to the Proposed Action: 11 • Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), USC Title 40 CFR, Parts 239 to 282, 42 12 USC 6901 et seq:  RCRA is the primary law governing the disposal of solid and 13 hazardous waste. RCRA established three distinct, yet interrelated, programs. First, the 14 solid waste program, under RCRA Subtitle D, encourages states to develop comprehensive plans to manage nonhazardous industrial solid waste and municipal 16 solid waste, sets criteria for municipal solid waste landfills and other solid waste 17 disposal facilities, and prohibits the open dumping of solid waste.  Second, the 18 hazardous waste program, under RCRA Subtitle C, establishes a system for controlling 19 hazardous waste from the time it is generated until its ultimate disposal—in effect, from “cradle to grave.” Third, the underground storage tank (UST) program, under 21 RCRA Subtitle I, regulates USTs containing hazardous substances and petroleum 22 products. 23 • Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 24 42 USC Chapter 103:  CERCLA, commonly known as Superfund, created a tax on the chemical and petroleum industries and provides broad federal authority to respond 26 directly to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that may endanger 27 public health or the environment. 28 • Florida Solid and Hazardous Waste Management Act, Florida Statutes 29 Chapter 403: 29 Requires that counties establish and operate solid waste disposal facilities and that each county implement a recycling program to achieve reduction in the levels of solid 31 waste disposed. 32 • Florida Resource Recovery and Management Regulations, Florida Administrative Code 33 (FAC) 67.2:  Establishes local resource recovery and management programs and 34 regulates the collection, transport, storage, separation, processing, recycling, and disposal of solid wastes. 1 • AFI 32-7042, Solid and Hazardous Waste Compliance: Establishes municipal solid waste 2 management and compliance.  In general, AFI 32-7042 establishes the requirements 3 for installations to have a solid waste management program that incorporates the 4 following: a solid waste management plan; procedures for handling, storage, collection, and disposal of solid waste; record keeping and reporting; and pollution 6 prevention. 7 • AFI 32-7080, Pollution Prevention Program -Addresses source reduction, resource 8 recovery, and recycling of solid waste. 9 • Eglin AFB Instruction 32-7042, Eglin AFB Hazardous Material Management Process Establishes hazardous materials management practices for all Eglin AFB organizations 11 and tenants. 12 • Eglin AFB Instruction 32-7003, Eglin AFB Hazardous Waste Management Plan -Identifies 13 hazardous waste generation areas and addresses proper packaging, labeling, storage 14 and handling, record-keeping, spill contingency and response requirements, and education. 16 3.12.1.2 Assessment Method 17 Potential impacts related to hazardous materials and hazardous wastes are analyzed for the 18 following effects. 19 • 1) Generation of waste types or quantities that cannot be accommodated by the current management system. The analysis methodology identifies activities 21 associated with the Proposed Action and, using process knowledge or other available 22 data, predicts the type and quantity of wastes that would likely be generated from 23 these activities.  These data are compared with current generation rates, waste types, 24 and capability for managing wastes to determine the resulting effects.  It is assumed that proposed activities would not result in the generation of hazardous wastes. 26 Additionally, it is assumed that metallic debris (e.g., brass cases) from training 27 operations would be recycled and, therefore, not disposed of as solid waste. 28 • 2) An increased likelihood of an uncontrolled release of hazardous materials that 29 could contaminate soil, surface water, groundwater, or air, from the release of chemicals used in training activities.  The analysis methodology first reviews the types 31 and quantities of hazardous materials that would be used (fuel, expendables, etc.) and 32 evaluates the potential for the release of these materials, and associated amounts, into 33 the environment.  Potential impacts from chemical releases to specific media (i.e., soil, 34 water, air, biological resources) are discussed in each of those respective sections. Table 3-47 defines how the impact attributes of context, intensity, and duration are applied to 36 biological resource analyses. 1 Table 3-47.  Definitions of Impact Attributes for Solid and Hazardous Materials/Waste Resource 2 Categories Attribute  Chemical Releases  Waste Generation  Contexts Analyzed  Regional/population  County level, state park level, or management unit level effects; impacts to populations.  Localized  Less than management area effects; impacts to individuals.  Intensity (can be either adverse or beneficial)  High  Substantive increase or decrease in chemical release that results in a relative decline or improvement in baseline chemical releases to soil, surface water, groundwater, or air.  Examples include increases in existing releases and/or introduction of new releases at reportable quantity levels1 where there were none previously or discontinuation of actions currently resulting in reportable quantity releases.  Substantive increase or decrease in waste generation that results in a relative change in the waste management system. Examples may include increases in existing or introduction of new solid or nonacute and/or acute hazardous waste streams where there were none previously and that cannot be managed by the current waste management system without new or additional waste management procedures, or elimination of several solid or nonacute or acutely hazardous waste streams.  Medium  Moderate increase or decrease in chemical release that results in a relative decline or improvement in baseline chemical releases to soil, surface water, groundwater, or air.  Examples include increases in existing releases and/or introduction of new releases under reportable quantity levels or a reduction in baseline chemical releases to quantities below reportable levels.  Moderate increase or decrease in waste generation that results in a relative change in the waste management system. Examples may include increases in existing or introduction of new, nonacute hazardous or solid waste streams where there were none previously and that can be accommodated by the existing management system with some procedural modification or reduction in quantities of baseline hazardous or solid waste generation.  Low  Slight increase or decrease in chemical release that results in no perceptible decline or improvement in baseline chemical releases to soil, surface water, groundwater, or air.  Examples include small increases in existing releases that are currently under reportable quantity levels, or a small reduction in baseline chemical releases, neither of which result in noticeable impacts.  Slight increase or decrease in waste generation that results in no perceptible change in the waste management system. Examples may include small increases in existing nonacute hazardous or solid waste streams that can be accommodated by the existing management system with no procedural modification or reduction in quantities of baseline hazardous or solid waste generation, neither of which results in noticeable impacts.  Neutral  No chemical release or waste impacts.  Duration  Long term  Effect would likely endure for the life of the action.  Medium term  Effect would likely last for a few months to a year.  Short term  Effect would likely last for a few days to weeks.  EPCRA = Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act 1.  Reportable releases are those chemical releases in that exceed applicable reporting threshold quantities established under EPCRA.  3  3.12.1.3  Impact Levels  4 5 6 7  This section addresses the potential for the Proposed Action to pose adverse risks from chemical release, as well as the Air Force’s capability to manage these risks and manage solid/hazardous waste generation. The level of impact associated with solid and hazardous waste and the impact’s potential significance is determined by considering how Proposed  PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT | APRIL 2014  1  Action effectors could interact with solid/hazardous waste generation and management in  2  terms of context, intensity, and duration as described in Table 3-37.   Table 3-48 explains the  3  impact level categories for solid and hazardous materials/waste analyzed in this EIS and  4  identified in Chapters 4, 5, and 6.  5  Table 3-48.  Impact Level Categories for Solid and Hazardous Materials/Waste Resources  Level of Impact  Solid & Hazardous Materials/Waste Receptors  Adverse  Adverse impacts may result from a chemical release of hazardous materials or the generation of solid/hazardous waste types or quantities, the level of impact directly related to the impact attributes described in Table 3-47.  Adverse impacts may be perceived as significant under high-to medium-intensity scenarios of any duration if proposed activities resulted in a high potential for uncontrolled chemical releases to the environment or the generation of wastes that could not be managed by the current system. Insignificant impacts may occur under medium-intensity scenarios of any duration and result in nonreportable chemical releases but chemical exposures to military personnel, the public, or the environment are adequately controlled by means of established procedures. For solid/hazardous waste, activities may result in the generation of large but manageable waste types or quantities requiring only some management adjustments.  Neutral/no effect  Activities do not result in a perceptible increase in chemical release potential, do not change baseline releases, or result in adverse chemical exposures.  Solid/hazardous waste generation amounts may be reduced or may be similar to the baseline condition.  6  3.12.2 General Emitter Activity Impact Assessment  7  Based on the scope of action described in Chapter 2, emitter site use would not be expected  8  to result in impacts to this resource.  Operation of the emitters would not result in potential  9  releases of hazardous chemicals or the generation of appreciable solid or hazardous wastes.  10  No hazardous materials or hazardous or petroleum wastes would be generated at most FFS  11  sites or at the two FWC sites, because no industrial activities would occur at these sites. The  12  only exceptions are the Molino, Youngstown, and White City sites. At these locations,  13  personnel would perform limited maintenance of vehicles and equipment, primarily  14  consisting of oil and fluid changes. Consequently, hazardous materials stored at these sites  15  include small quantities (55-gallon containers or smaller) of lubricating oil, hydraulic fluid,  16  antifreeze, solvents, and paints. All materials and wastes would be managed according to  17  established FFS requirements. These requirements include the use of secondary containment  18  and the availability of spill response equipment.  19  Emitter activity would be expected to result in neutral levels of solid waste (minimal  20  improvements required, some solid waste from personnel).  The primary hazardous material  21  associated with this activity is POLs, used for fuel and lubrication of parts.  Use of these items  22  may result in generation of small amounts of POLs and associated waste, such as  23  contaminated rags. Use of POLs, and disposal of associated wastes, would be conducted  24  according to established procedures as described under Section 3.12.1.1, which would  25  minimize the potential for associated spills.  As a result, the Air Force anticipates no adverse  26  impact to public health or safety or the human and natural environment or potential  1 violations of federal, state, or local regulations.  Therefore, this issue has not been not carried 2 forward for site-specific analysis in Chapter 4. 3 3.12.3 General Training Activity Impact Assessment 4 Based on the scope of action described in Chapter 2, examples of potential debris generated during training include: 6 • Shell casings, canisters from signal smokes, etc. 7 • Unexploded ordnance (UXO) (primarily inert items) 8 • Litter and refuse from daily mission activities, including ground troop movement 9 Most ground training on foot (dismounted maneuver) would involve movement without leaving any evidence of troop presence. Impacts from litter or refuse are not anticipated if the 11 following mitigations are adhered to: 12 • Pack out debris and refuse packed in or properly dispose of litter (FAC 62-701). 13 • Remove and properly dispose of solid debris from blanks, GBSs, and smokes in 14 accordance with Eglin AFB operating procedures. • Conduct post-mission surveys to ensure debris has been removed. 16 Based on the above, and the scope of action described in Chapter 2, the following proposed 17 activities are not discussed further under this resource area: utilities (which would have no 18 interaction with hazardous or solid materials and waste) and dismounted maneuver. 19 Land Disturbance Impacts to solid and hazardous materials/waste may occur as a result of solid waste/debris 21 deposited on the surface of terrestrial or aquatic environments during land disturbance 22 activities. As discussed in Chapter 2, any land disturbance would be minimal in nature, and it 23 is not anticipated that land-clearing activities would generate a need for disposal of soil and 24 woody waste.  This is based upon the assumption that soils generated would be used as fill during construction projects and woody wastes would be used by the wood industry or 26 chipped and reused as mulch or compost on-site or in surrounding communities.  Therefore, 27 these materials would not be expected to impact solid waste resources.  As with emitter use, 28 utilization of POLs for equipment could result in chemical releases and hazardous waste 29 generation.  However, use of POLs, and disposal of associated wastes, would be conducted according to established procedures as described under Section 3.12.1.1, which would 31 minimize the potential for spills associated with these types of operations.  As a result, the Air 32 Force anticipates no adverse impacts associated with chemical releases or generation of solid 33 or hazardous wastes from land disturbance activity. 34 Ground Movement (Wheeled Vehicles), Aircraft Operations, and Amphibious Operations Impacts from these activities are associated with petroleum leaks or spills from the operation 36 or fueling of vehicles, aircraft, or watercraft. 37 Established refueling protocols and BMPs would be followed during vehicle operation or 38 refueling activities. These protocols include making spill response kits (pads and booms) 39 available on vehicles or during FARP/HGO operations. Personnel would also be trained on how to respond to/clean up potential spills, which includes containing any spills with pads, 1  booms, etc.  Post-spill activities may also include removing any contaminated soils and  2  replacing these with clean fill.  Within four hours of the spill event, a spill response form must  3  be sent to the Eglin AFB Compliance Branch (96 CEG/CEIEC).  Implementation of established  4  vehicle operation and refueling protocols and BMPs would preclude the potential for any  5  adverse environmental impacts.  6  UoEX  7  A primary impact to solid and hazardous materials/waste would be associated with a release  8  of chemical materials to the environment. These materials encompass liquid, solid, or  9  gaseous substances released to the environment as a result of mission activities and include  10  expendables combustion by-products, fuel or oil leaks or spills, and untreated bilge release  11  from watercraft.  12  To mitigate potential chemical releases, Eglin AFB has implemented a comprehensive  13  Hazardous Material Management Process.  Hazardous materials management is guided by  14  AFI 32-7042 (U.S. Air Force, 2009).  All Eglin AFB organizations and tenants are required to  15  follow this plan. In addition, Eglin has implemented a Hazardous Waste Management Plan,  16  Eglin AFB Instruction 32-7003.  This plan identifies hazardous waste generation areas and  17  addresses proper packaging, labeling, storage and handling, record keeping, spill  18  contingency and response requirements, and education. Procedures and responsibilities for  19  responding to a petroleum spill or other incident are also described in the Eglin AFB Spill  20  Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan (U.S. Air Force, 2005b).  21  Expendables training operations would be conducted twice per quarter during a 24-hour  22  period and would involve 6 to 12 personnel. They would include movement from insertion  23  points to objective sites and dismounted travel through training areas.   24  The Eglin AFB Interstitial Area Final Programmatic Environmental Assessment (U.S. Air Force,  25  1998c) analyzed the environmental impact of increasing yearly ground troop movement in  26  interstitial spaces from 55,800 troops per year (1997) to 167,500, equal to a 200 percent  27  increase. No adverse environmental impacts associated with chemical releases or  28  solid/hazardous waste were determined from the 200 percent increase in ground troops  29  regarding debris and the use of blanks, smokes, and flares during ground troop training  30  activities in Eglin AFB training areas.  31  The Interstitial Area Range Final Environmental Assessment Revision 2 (U.S. Air Force, 2013c)  32  documented chemical releases from the UoEX of the same quantity and types as are  33  associated with the current Proposed Action. Table 3-49 summarizes the associated annual  34  release of chemical constituents from the use of these expendables.  35  Table 3-49.  Expendables-Related Residue  Annual Quantity Generated  Chemical  (pounds)  Antimony  5  Barium  8  Chromium  3  Hydrochloric acid  79  Lead  8  Source: U.S. Air Force, 2009 1  The chemical load from all expendables, as summarized in the table, would be distributed  2  over all training areas.  Therefore, the overall concentration of any chemical at any given  3  location would be minute.  Consequently, no significant adverse impacts are associated with  4  the release of chemicals from the proposed UoEX.  Releases to the environment from expendables used in proficiency and qualification training  6  require reporting to the USEPA under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to 7  Know Act (EPCRA) Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) program.  Training is subject to a TRI  8  reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds per year for most common chemicals, with lower  9  reporting thresholds for chemicals classified as persistent bioaccumulative toxic. These  chemicals include mercury, with a reporting threshold of 10 pounds, and lead, with a  11  threshold of 100 pounds. In cases when a threshold is exceeded, the installation must report  12  on a “Form R” report to the USEPA the quantity of munitions-related waste released to the  13  environment or recovered and recycled.  Eglin AFB has procedures to comply with TRI  14  reporting requirements and would track expendables use associated with the proposed  activities. Potential impacts could result if proposed training activities would result in  16  reporting thresholds being exceeded at Eglin AFB for any new chemicals. Based on the  17  quantity of chemicals that would be released as part of proposed activities, no new TRI  18  thresholds would be exceeded and no additional TRI reporting would be required by Eglin  19  AFB.  Additionally, troops would be required to recover shell casings and other expendable by 21  products (e.g., GBS canisters) from the training sites to the extent practicable. While it would  22  not be feasible to collect every casing or other expendable by-product, the amount that may  23  be missed or left behind would be minimal. The Interstitial Area Range Final Environmental  24  Assessment Revision 2 (U.S. Air Force, 2013c) addresses impacts under similar circumstances  and found that there would be no significant impacts.  Consequently, given the amount of  26  expendables would be lower at the state forests than that represented in analyses for Eglin  27  AFB, the Air Force expects that the minimal amount of expendable by-products that may be  28  missed as part of troop recovery processes at the state forests would result in minimal  29  impacts to the environment.  3.12.3.1 General Training Activity Impact Assessment Summary  31  Table 3-50 summarizes potential interactions between Proposed Action effectors and  32  resource effectors. Activities shaded in green have little potential to impact public health or  33  safety or the human and natural environment or do not result in potential violations of  34  federal, state, or local regulations.  Therefore, these activities are not carried forward for  detailed analysis in Chapters 5 and 6.  1 Table 3-50.

Implementation of General Operational Constraints described in  4  Section 2.5 would serve to minimize the potential for any adverse impacts.  3.13 INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION  6  “Infrastructure” refers to the system of public works, such as utilities and transportation that  7  provides the underlying framework for a community. Utilities typically consist of the services  8  and facilities that supply electricity, potable water, wastewater treatment, and natural gas.  9  Transportation infrastructure includes the public roadway network, public transportation  systems, airports, railroads, pedestrian/bicycle facilities and waterborne transportation  11  required for the movement of people, materials, and goods. Each of these utility and  12  transportation resource components is referred to as a “receptor.”  13  3.13.1 Impact Assessment Methodology  14  The impact assessment for infrastructure evaluates the potential impacts of the Proposed  Action on utilities and transportation resources.  Impacts to these resources are evaluated  16  according to type, context, intensity, and duration (as described in Section 3.1).  Together,  17  these attributes define the potential significance of the impacts.  18  3.13.1.1 Regulatory Drivers  19  There are no applicable regulatory drivers for infrastructure and transportation resources.  3.13.1.2 Assessment Method  21  Impacts to utilities and transportation were assessed with respect to the potential for  22  disruption, degradation, or improvement of existing utility systems and roadways, changes in  23  demand for energy or water resources, deterioration or improvement of existing levels of  24  service, and changes in existing levels of utility and transportation safety.  Impacts may arise  from physical changes to utility corridors, construction activity, change in demand for services  26  from changes in personnel, and increased utilization of existing roadways. Table 3-51 defines  27  how the impact attributes of context, intensity, and duration are applied to utility and  28  transportation resource analyses.  1 Table 3-51.  Definitions of Impact Attributes for Infrastructure Attribute  Utilities  Transportation  Contexts Analyzed  Regional/population  Large-scale power generation plants and interstate power or natural gas distribution systems, water and wastewater treatment systems that serve the region or large counties.  Interstate, U.S., or state highways.  Localized  Small individual or municipal utilities and infrastructure (e.g., city water or wastewater treatment plant, individual water wells and septic systems, local power, water, sewer, and gas lines).  County or local roads and streets, road network within BRSF or THSF.  Intensity (can be either  adverse or beneficial)  High  Substantive change in average and peak utility use associated with the Proposed Action. Major new utility construction and/or upgrades to existing utility infrastructure.  Substantive change in traffic volume and/or major new road construction/improvements that have major effects and changes on the operational characteristics, level of service, circulation patterns, and safety of the affected roadways.  Medium  Moderate change in utility use and demand. Minor new utility construction and/or upgrades to existing utility infrastructure.  Moderate change in traffic volume and/or new road construction/improvements that have a limited effect on the operational characteristics, level of service, circulation patterns, and safety of the affected roadways. New road construction/improvements  Low  Negligible change in utility use and demand that could be easily accommodated by existing systems. Existing utility connections could be upgraded or added, but construction of new utility infrastructure would not occur.  Negligible change in traffic volume and/or small road construction/improvement projects that have little effect on the operational characteristics, level of service, circulation patterns, and safety of the affected roadways.  Neutral  No apparent change in operational condition of the resource.  Duration  Long term  Effects would be permanent or endure for the operational life of the action or until improvements could be made or new infrastructure constructed to accommodate increased use and demand.  Medium  Depending on seasonal periods of use and demand, effects would likely last for a few months. New construction and improvements could last for a few months to a year.  Short term  Effects would likely last for a few days to a week only during times of activity associated with the action.  BRSF = Blackwater River State Forest; THSF = Tate’s Hell State Forest  2  3.13.1.3  Impact Levels  3  The level of impact associated with infrastructure and the impact’s potential significance is  4  determined by considering how Proposed Action effectors could interact with utilities and  5  transportation  resources in  terms of  context,  intensity,  and  duration  as described  in  6  Table 3-51.   Table 3-52 explains the impact level categories for utilities and transportation  7  resources analyzed in this EIS and identified in Chapters 4, 5, and 6.  Table 3-52.  Impact Level Categories for Infrastructure Level of Impact  Utilities  Transportation  Adverse  Adverse utility impacts may result in changes to existing utility infrastructure, use, or demand, the level of impact directly related to the impact attributes described in Table 3-51.  Adverse impacts may be perceived as significant under high-intensity scenarios of long duration where an increase in average and peak utility use and demand is beyond the capacity of existing utility infrastructure. Major system upgrades that are beyond those projected by the utility system in their capital improvements plans could be necessary to maintain existing level of service. Insignificant impacts may occur under medium-intensity scenarios of any duration and result in: • A violation of a permit condition or contract with a utility provider. • Deterioration or interruption of existing utility services. • Physical changes to utility plants and corridors from upgrades and construction of new infrastructure. Moderate increases in utility use and demand could be met by existing utility systems. However, future use/demand could be limited due to the lack of excess capacity unless upgrades or new infrastructure are added.  Adverse transportation impacts may result in traffic volume and/or new road construction/improvements, the level of impact directly related to the impact attributes described in Table 3-51. Adverse impacts may be perceived as significant under high-intensity scenarios of long duration resulting in: • Increased traffic volumes at or above a roadway’s full design capacity causing a reduction in level of service and major congestion and traffic delays. • Accident rate increases greater than the average range of accidents on similar roadways. • Major deterioration of roadway surfaces beyond normal conditions or wear rates. • The need for major roadway construction and/or upgrades beyond those projected and funded by federal, state, or local agencies. Insignificant impacts may occur under medium-to low-intensity scenarios of any duration negatively affecting traffic congestion and accident rates during peak travel times but not necessarily leading to a change in level of service. Additional traffic might also contribute to increased roadway deterioration. New roadway construction/improvements could cause temporary traffic delays and temporary road closures until activities are completed.  Neutral/no effect  Activities do not require utility upgrades or new infrastructure because utility use/demand is unchanged or remains close to baseline conditions.  Activities have no effect on circulation, traffic congestion, and accident rates and existing transportation resources are unchanged or unaffected from normal conditions.  2  3.13.2 General Emitter Activity Impact Assessment  3  Based on the scope of action described in Chapter 2, emitter site use would not be expected  4  to result in impacts to utilities or transportation resources.   All of the proposed emitter  5  locations are improved or semi-improved sites and, except for FWC-2, have on-site electrical  6  power available. Water and telephone service is available at all of the locations except FWC-1  7  and FWC-2.   Four of the locations (EAFB-1, FFS-5, FFS-6, and FFS-7) also have fiber optic  8  service available.  Power generation for the different types of emitters would be provided  9  either by generator or connection to the existing electrical system.  Water would either be  10  supplied through the available on-site sources or could be brought in as needed.   If latrines  11  are not available on-site, portable toilets could be utilized during training activities. Transport  12  of the various emitters to the emitter sites would only require occasional trips utilizing a small  13  number of transport and support vehicles and would not adversely impact any of the  1  roadways that would be used.  Based on the context, intensity, and duration of emitter site  2  use, the Air Force has not identified any adverse impacts to infrastructure associated with the  3  Proposed Action.  Therefore, this issue area is not carried forward for site-specific analysis in  4  Chapter 4.  3.13.3 General Training Activity Impact Assessment  6  Based on the scope of action described in Chapter 2, all training activities except for  7  establishment of HLZs/DZs, UoEX, LLHI/Es, AO, Natural Resource Consumption, and OHO  8  would have at least some interaction with utility or transportation resources.  9  Use of utilities would only occur at BRSF associated with use of the hardened camp sites. Use  at these locations would be intermittent, and would not be expected to result in any  11  additional burden on utility providers because these sites have been used in the past more  12  frequently with no issues.  With regards to transportation resources, small convoys (5–10  13  vehicles) may be used to transport troops to/from the training sites; this would not be  14  expected to result in any transportation issues.  There would be occasional, temporary  closures of specific roadways associated with the FWALS and during BD.  These closures  16  would be road-segment specific and only during training operations.  These closures would  17  not result in restricted access to forest areas because there are multiple roadways available on  18  each forest to allow “drive-arounds.” As part of general operating constraints, boating activity  19  associated with AO would require avoidance and interaction with recreational boaters.  Based  on the above the Air Force does not anticipate adverse impacts associated with  21  transportation or infrastructure.  Consequently, this issue area has not been carried forward  22  for detailed analysis in Chapters 5 (BRSF) and 6 (THSF).  23  3.13.3.1 General Training Activity Impact Assessment Summary  24  Table 3-53 identifies potential interactions between Proposed Action effectors and  infrastructure receptors; no potential for adverse impacts have been identified. Activities  26  shaded in green have little potential to impact public health or safety or the human and  27  natural environment or do not result in potential violations of federal, state, or local  28  regulations.  Therefore, these activities are not carried forward for detailed analysis in  29  Chapters 5 and 6.  Table 3-53.  Receptor and Effector Interactions for Infrastructure Table 3-53.

Implementation of General  4  Operational Constraints described in Section 2.5 would serve to minimize the potential for  5  any adverse impacts.  6  3.14 PROPOSED ACTION AFFECTED RESOURCE SUMMARY  7  Table 3-54 provides a summary of resources potentially adversely affected by the Proposed  8  Action, based on analyses provided in Sections 3.2–3.13. A “dot” indicates an interaction  9  between a resource and an effector. Resource areas and interactive effectors identified in  10  yellow show the potential for adverse impacts to site-specific resources and have been  11  carried forward for site-specific analyses in Chapters 4, 5, and 6 to determine the associated  12  level of impact.   13  Resource areas and interactive effectors identified in green have not been carried forward for  14  site-specific analysis in Chapters 4, 5, and/or 6 because (1) there is no potential interaction  15  between the Proposed Action and the resource/issue area, (2) general analyses provided in  16  Sections 3.2–3.13 have determined that there is no potential for violation of federal, state, or  17  local regulation and that any impacts to public health and safety and the human and natural  18  environment are either neutral or have no adverse effect despite the site-specific nature of  19  the resource, or (3) incorporation of identified General Operational Constraints (Section 2.5)  20  and/or Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations (indicated in respective resource-area  21  discussions) as part of the Proposed Action precludes adverse impacts.  Table 3-54.  Proposed Action Affected Resource Summary GBS = ground burst simulator  2  3.14.1 Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations  3  Based on the scope of activities associated with the Proposed Action, the inherent General  4  Operational Constraints identified in Section 2.5, and related impact analyses detailed in  5  Chapter  3,  there are  no  identified  Resource-Specific Mitigation impact  minimization  6  procedures necessary for the following resource areas: solid/hazardous materials and waste,  7  and infrastructure and transportation.   8  Impact analysis of the Proposed Action has identified the following Proposed Resource 9  Specific Mitigations  that  would  be  implemented,  in  addition  to  General  Operational  10  Constraints in Section 2.5, to further minimize or avoid adverse impacts – in most cases  11  impacts would be minimized such that impact level categories would be reduced from  12  “adverse” (yellow) to “neutral” or “no effect” (green).  13  Both Forests  14  Airspace Management  15  A coordination process would be established by which the Air Force would work with FFS  16  POCs prior to any mission to ensure that FFS operations and recreational aviation activities  17  would not be negatively impacted by GLI training.  Noise • Aircraft would not operate below 500 feet AGL except while engaged in approaches to, departures from, or training at designated HLZ/DZ, OHO locations, or FWALS. • HLZ/DZs would be sited at not less than 2,200 feet from known noise-sensitive locations. Known noise-sensitive locations include campgrounds and privately owned parcels with at least one residential structure. • Maneuvers near the HLZ/DZ (i.e., initial approach, departure, circling and pattern work at less than 500 feet AGL) would not be conducted at distances less than 200 feet from known noise-sensitive locations. • OHO locations would not be located within 2,200 feet of known noise-sensitive locations. • The full spectrum of HLZ/DZ aircraft training (i.e., LLHI/E, AD, and A/LVL) would only be permitted at FWALS that are remote from all known noise-sensitive locations (i.e., FWALS in TA-1, the northern half of Munson Airstrip, and all FWALS in THSF). Only LAPT would be allowed at the FWALS in TA-9. • New FWALS would not be located within 9,300 feet of known noise-sensitive locations if they would also be approved for the full spectrum of HLZ/DZ uses. Earth Resources • Clear zones for FWALS would be cleared as part of normal forestry operations; the Air Force would not clear any areas in support of roadway use for FWALS.  This limits the potential for adverse impacts associated with soil erosion, and eliminates the need for NPDES or USACE Section 404 permitting. • FWALS within poorly suited areas (see Section 3.6.3) can only be used on existing roadways that do not require land disturbance outside the existing road bed or rightof-way.  This limits the potential for adverse impacts associated with soil erosion, and minimizes the need for excessive maintenance. • Conduct site fingerprinting of each proposed FWALS location to collect the data necessary to develop and implement FWALS project plans. Site fingerprinting is a data collection, ground-truthing, and reporting process designed to gather and analyze the field data necessary to plan, design, and construct FWALS to fully support the proposed military aircraft training activities. Site data collection tools and protocols are used during field visits to gather critical roadway and affected area measurements, photopoint records, and soil samples.  Based on validated field features and conditions, determinations can then be made as to site suitability and engineering requirements. As needed, site project plans could then be developed to meet site construction and operational needs. • Utilize sites that are best suited to the intended activity and avoid areas with known constraints or limitations. • Temporally and spatially disperse FWALS and HLZ/DZ training to minimize repetitive use impacts to landing zone surface conditions and maximize life cycles. Utilize mission logistics information to plan training events that avoid, to the degree possible, FWALS used during the previous year and HLZ/DZ areas used during the previous two years.  A rest period would promote vegetative growth and allow disturbed areas to recover. • Construct and maintain an FWALS drainage system that collects and discharges stormwater runoff in a non-erosive manner. • Inspect FWALS landing zones following each training mission.  Coordinate immediate repairs of damaged areas with the L.I.T. • Avoid clear zone maintenance during wet soil conditions.  All soils are highly sensitive to mechanical compaction or rutting damage when wet. • As needed, install BMPs to minimize soil disturbances (FDACS, 2008; USACOE. 2004; USACOE, 2008).  For clear zone sites with extreme rutting damage, physically amend damaged soils with tillage equipment after the soils have dried.  Depending on extent of damage, soil structure amendments could be made with hand tools or motorized tillage equipment.  Areas may also need to be reseeded to native species to reduce bare ground and encourage the establishment of soil protecting ground cover. • Avoid HLZ/DZ areas with highly and potentially highly erodible soils and hydric soils. Soil erosion potentials increase with increasing soil erodibility and wet soil are highly sensitive to damage by compaction and rutting. • Maintain at least a 100 foot exclusion buffer around sensitive steephead slopes and closed depression subsidence areas to prevent accelerated soil erosion of slopes and wet soil rutting. • As necessary, install temporary metal landing mats for HLZ/DZ landing training activities conducted in wet areas during poor weather conditions.  Mats can reduce potentials for soil damage and provide stable platforms aircraft landings, materials and personnel loading and unloading, and temporary storage. • To the degree possible, utilize established walking trails or designated roads during cross county dismounted maneuvers. • Avoid cross county maneuvers through steephead locations.  The steep to very steep slopes of these geologic features are highly prone to accelerated rates of erosion if disturbed.  • Avoid the use of borrow pits for temporary campsites.  For some pits, additional surface disturbances could increase soil erosion rates or affect the stability of early-stage pit reclamation. • Avoid establishing temporary camps within or in proximity to steepheads and closed depression areas. These sites may be sensitive to increases in stormwater runoff of disturbances associated with camp activities. An exclusion zone of at least 100 feet is recommended. • Avoid sensitive streambank areas that are overheightened and oversteepened and/or areas exhibiting bank scour and mass failure features. • To the degree possible, avoid the repetitive use of the same egress and ingress locations within the same year for AO. • For sites where vegetation damage could result in loss of plant cover, reseed with native species to encourage the reestablishment of vegetative cover. Water Resources • Use only FFS-approved, designated vehicle water crossings in “Good” or “Fair” condition.  Report any damaged water crossings identified in the field to the L.I.T. • If off-road vehicle use is required for any reason the respective FFS Management Office would need to be consulted prior to occurrence, and no vehicles would be allowed within 100 feet of a surface water body or wetland as specified by EABFI 13-212. • To minimize localized damage potential from foraging and dismounted troop movements, the size of troop units will be kept to small manageable numbers. Troop use would be rotated within and among TAs to prevent concentration of activities in particular locations. Implementation of this mitigation would allow water resources to recover from extended use after intensive training activities. • Roads, trails, and stream/wetland crossings would be inspected before and after each training mission to identify maintenance issues that could cause problems if not repaired. Training activities would be shifted or redirected if conditions of roads and stream and wetland crossings require repair or other measures to prevent erosion from impacting surface waters and wetlands. The FFS will be notified of any identified issues.  Wheeled vehicle training would only occur on crossings rated as good or fair condition; no wheeled vehicle training would occur at crossings rated Poor until these crossing are approved by the FFS. • AO would utilize designated ingress/egress locations as determined by the GLI Liaison and the FFS.  To the extent possible AO should use established, hardened boat ramps for ingress/egress of amphibious craft. If ingress/egress must utilize natural habitat in wetlands, care should be taken to prevent destruction of wetland vegetation or other activities that might cause shoreline erosion. Ingress/egress points for both personnel and watercraft should be rotated to the extent possible to allow sites time to recover from AO. 1 2  4. EMITTER SITES AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES  3  4.1 INTRODUCTION  4  This chapter provides the affected environment and environmental impact analysis for use of  5  emitter sites as described in Section 2.3.1.  As discussed in Chapter 3, Section 3.14, Proposed  6  Action Affected Resource Summary, some resource areas would experience no interaction with  7  this activity, or general impact analyses in Sections 3.2 through 3.13 have shown that there  8  would be negligible or no impacts to a specified resource area, despite the site-specific nature  9  of the resources.  This is noted in each applicable resource area’s section.  Overall, impact  10  analyses for EMR account for any applicable General Operational Constraints identified in  11  Section 2.5.  At the end of this chapter, Section 4.14 summarizes the emitter site  12  environmental analysis and any associated Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations required  13  to minimize or avoid adverse impacts.  14  4.2 AIRSPACE MANAGEMENT AND USE  15  As discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.2.2), emitter site use would not be expected to result in  16  impacts to airspace management. As a result, this resource area is not discussed in further  17  detail in this chapter.  18  4.3 NOISE  19  As discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.2.2), emitter site use would not be expected to result in  20  adverse noise impacts associated with public health and safety or the human and natural  21  environment.  Construction noise impacts would be temporary and localized.  Operations of a  22  generator at emitter site FWC-2 would result in noise levels of approximately 49 dB at the  23  nearest residence.  These operations would be in compliance will all federal, state, and local  24  regulations.  Consequently, this resource area is not discussed further in this chapter.  25  4.4 SAFETY  26  4.4.1 Affected Environment  27  The affected environment for safety as it relates to proposed activities comprises the policies  28  and procedures currently in place at Eglin AFB, previously discussed in Sections 3.4.2  29  and 3.4.3.  30  Because of the strict review and control of activities employing the use of EMR emitters, there  31  is little, if any, EMR exposure to personnel that might cause injury to or that may result in  32  explosion or fire hazards.  1  The Blackwater Forestry Center (BFC) and the Tallahassee Forestry Center (TFC) of the FFS  2  have primary responsibility for BRSF and THSF, respectively. TFC and BFC are responsible for  3  prevention, detection, and suppression of wildfires, as well as responding to emergencies,  4  such as accidents. BFC encompasses Escambia, Santa Rosa, and Okaloosa Counties, while TFC  5  encompasses Leon, Gadsden, Liberty, Wakulla, Jefferson, and Franklin Counties.  Both BFC  6  and TFC have cooperative agreements with local fire and police departments, and also call on  7  the Florida Highway Patrol and Florida Department of Transportation to provide assistance as  8  needed. For more information on the capabilities of BFC and TFC, please refer to Sections 5.4  9  and 6.4, respectively.  10  4.4.2 Environmental Consequences  11  Because of the strict review and control of activities employing the use of EMR emitters on the  12  Eglin Reservation, there is little, if any, EMR exposure to military personnel engaged in test  13  range activities.  There is also little chance of fuel vapor situations/EEDs that might cause  14  injury to personnel if ignited or detonated by exposure to sufficient EMR field strengths.  15  Emitter site use would not be expected to result in significant adverse safety impacts to the  16  public.  Only the JTE system could emit EMR.  This system has an SHD of 400 feet from  17  habitable buildings or recreational sites and 268.7 feet from EED storage and 198.3 feet from  18  fuel storage areas. Table 4-1 lists the potential acceptable JTE emitter sites based on the SHD  19  of 400 feet, which would result in no safety impacts to the population.  All sites would be  20  acceptable for radar and telemetry units.  21  Table 4-1.  Potential Locations for JTE Systems Based on SHD  FFS = Florida Forest Service; FWC = Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission; JTE = joint threat emitter;  SHD = safety hazard distance  1. Based on evaluation of satellite imagery  2.  FDEP, 2007a  22  Additional guidance on protecting personnel from electromagnetic fields, including safety  23  training and personal protection equipment, is provided in Defense Instruction 6055.11,  24  Protection Personnel from Electromagnetic Fields (DoD, 2009).  Since radars would be placed to  25  avoid populated areas, and the sites would be fenced or have other security measures to  26  prevent unauthorized personnel from entering the safety hazard area, no significant impacts  1 to the general public would be expected.  Air Force personnel, both military and civilian, 2 working directly with the JTE equipment would adhere to the safety guidelines provided in 3 the 2008 SSHA and Defense Instruction 6055.11.  Therefore, no significant impacts to military 4 personnel would be expected under the Proposed Action. 5 Based on Table 4-1, the JTE system would not be located at the following emitter sites due to 6 the proximity of residential structures within the SHD:  FFS-1, FFS-2, FFS-3 and FFS-4.  As a 7 result, there would be no adverse impacts associated with emitter use at these locations. 8 Sites EAFB-1, FFS-5, FFS-6, and FFS-7 currently have structures within or near proposed SHDs; 9 however, these structures are not residential. These sites would need to be evaluated prior to 10 JTE use to ensure no persons are within these structures that may be at risk of EMR exposure. 11 Provided this mitigation is implemented, the potential for adverse impacts would be avoided. 12 4.4.3 Impact Summary 13 Table 3-15 identifies the context, intensity, and duration factors utilized in safety analysis; 14 based on these factors the Air Force has identified the potential for insignificant adverse 15 impacts to public health and safety at four proposed emitter sites associated with the JTE SHD 16 and proximity to inhabited buildings.  This impact can be mitigated through actions 17 described in Section 4.4.4.  Table 4-2 summarizes the impacts identified.  Impacts are 18 categorized as follows: 19 • Adverse (yellow) 20 • Neutral/no effect (green) 22 4.4.4 Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations 23 Implementation of the following mitigations would preclude any adverse impacts, reducing 24 impact significance as listed in Table 4-2 from adverse (yellow) to neutral or no effect (green). 25 • Sites EAFB-1, FFS-5, FFS-6, and FFS-7, where structures currently exist within the 26 proposed SHD but are not residential, would be verified as vacant before allowing the 27 JTE system to be utilized at these emitter locations. If not vacant, the JTE would not be 28 utilized at these locations. 29 • The proximity to populated areas would continue to be monitored to determine 30 constraints associated with the site and respective operational parameters of the 31 specific system. 1  4.5 AIR QUALITY  2  4.5.1  Affected Environment  3  Emitter sites would be located in various locations across the northwest Florida panhandle.  4  To adequately capture emissions over such a broad area and to accommodate the changing  5  emitter site locations the Mobile-Pensacola-Panama City-Southern Mississippi Interstate  6  AQCR is used as the ROI.  This AQCR includes 50 counties from Alabama, Florida, and southern  7  Mississippi.   The baseline emissions from counties within the AQCR are shown in Table 4-3.   8  Emitter locations would all be within Florida, and all counties in the Florida panhandle are in  9  attainment for all criteria pollutants.  10  Table 4-3.

Mobile emitters would require vehicle transportation to the location, which would cause some air pollutant emissions.  Emissions of air pollutants from emitter sites would be negligible compared with the AQCR (Table 4-4).   16  Table 4-4.

Impacts are categorized as follows: 6 • Adverse (yellow) 7 • Neutral/no effect (green) 8 Table 4-5.  Impact Summary for Air Quality – Emitters 12  4.6 EARTH RESOURCES  13  Based on the scope of action described in Chapter 2, and as identified in Chapter 3, emitter  14  site use would not be expected to affect any earth resources because all sites are either  15  “improved” or “semi-improved.” Most sites would require few, if any, minor improvements to  16  support the emitters.  Consequently, this resource area is not discussed further in this chapter.  17  4.7 WATER RESOURCES  18  Based on the scope of action described in Chapter 2, and as identified in Chapter 3, emitter  19  site use would not be expected to affect any water resources because all sites are either  20  “improved” or “semi-improved.” Most sites would require few, if any, minor improvements to  21  support the emitters and no water resources would be affected.    Consequently, this resource  22  area is not discussed further in this chapter.  23  4.8 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES  24  As discussed in Chapter 3, biological resources would not be affected by emitters, as these  25  instruments would be operated on improved and semi-improved areas.  As a result, this  26  resource area is not discussed further in this chapter.  1 4.9 CULTURAL RESOURCES 2 As discussed in Chapter 3, emitter site use does not have the potential to impact cultural 3 resources.  Sites have been previously developed with adequate infrastructure in place. 4 Therefore, this resource area is not discussed further in this chapter. 5  4.10 LAND USE  6  4.10.1 Affected Environment  7  The majority of the 12 emitter sites are located on FFS land (FFS-1through FFS-9); the  8  remaining sites are located  on  FWC land (FWC-1 and FWC-2) and Eglin AFB (EAFB-1).  9  See Figure 2-3 through Figure 2-5 for a regional and local view of emitter sites.  All sites are  10  currently listed as either “improved” or “semi-improved.”  11  General land use types associated with the proposed emitter sites include barren land,  12  forested, urban/built up, and wetlands (FDEP, 2007b).   Table 4-6 lists the land uses in each  13  emitter site. For the majority of the FFS sites, the dominant land use is urban/built up, while  14  both FWC sites are forested and the Eglin AFB site is located in a parcel of barren land.  15  Table 4-6.  Land Use Type Associated with Emitter Sites  Source: FDEP, 2007b  16  4.10.2 Environmental Consequences  17  Emitter site use would not be expected to result in significant adverse impacts to this  18  resource, because no significant noise (Sections 3.3 and 4.3) or safety (Sections 3.4 and 4.4)  19  impacts have been identified that would impact existing land use.   Only those emitters that  20  use a generator as a power source would increase the noise level; however, the noise would  21  be intermittent and would not result in adverse impacts (see Section 4.3, Noise).  22  Safety concerns associated with the emitter systems are further detailed in Section 4.4.2,  23  Safety, Environmental Consequences.   Only the JTE system has the potential to emit EMR and,  24  therefore, must not be placed within 400 feet of habitable buildings or recreational sites, nor  25  within 268.7 feet of EED storage or 198.3 feet from fuel (see Section 4.4.2).  Table 4-1 located  26  in Section 4.4.2 lists the potential acceptable JTE emitter sites based on the SHD of 400 feet,  27  which would result in no impacts to the population.  All sites would be acceptable for radar  28  and telemetry units.  1 4.10.3 Impact Summary 2 Table 3-41 identifies the context, intensity, and duration factors utilized in land use analysis; 3 based on these factors the Air Force has identified the potential for insignificant adverse 4 impacts to public health and safety at four proposed emitter sites associated with the JTE SHD 5 and proximity to inhabited buildings.  This impact can be mitigated through actions 6 described in Section 4.4.4. The Air Force has not identified any significant land use impacts 7 associated with emitter sites.  Table 4-7 summarizes the impacts identified.  Impacts are 8 categorized as follows: 9 • Adverse (yellow) 10 • Neutral/no effect (green) **  Adverse impacts can be mitigated as described in Section 4.4.4  12  4.10.4 Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations  13  Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations  as  described in Section 4.4.4 would offset any  14  potential land use impacts and mitigate impacts from adverse (yellow) to beneficial or no  15  effect (green) through avoidance of any land use conflicts.  16  4.11 SOCIOECONOMICS/ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE  17  4.11.1 Affected Environment  18  The main  concern  for socioeconomics and environmental justice  resource  areas is the  19  potential noise and safety hazards associated with the emitter sites that could potentially  20  impact nearby populations and noise-sensitive receptors, such as schools and childcare  21  centers.  22  The 12 emitter sites are located across nine counties in northwest Florida.   The county  23  represents the region of comparison for evaluating disproportionate effects (in Section 4.11.2)  24  on populations of concern for environmental justice and for children. Table 4-8 lists the total  25  population of each county and the portion of minority, low-income, and youth populations  26  out of the total county population in which the emitter sites are located.  The closest  27  population to the emitter sites is provided in Table 2-1 in Chapter 2.  There are no sensitive  28  noise receptors (e.g., schools, childcare centers) within 1 mile of any of the emitter sites.  1 Table 4-8.  County Data for Emitter Site Locations Source:  U.S. Census Bureau 2010, 2013  1.  American Community Survey, 5-year estimate, 2007–2011  2  4.11.2 Environmental Consequences  3  No significant noise (Sections 3.3 and 4.3), safety (Sections 3.4 and 4.4), or land use  4  (Sections 3.10 and 4.10) impacts have been identified that would affect the surrounding  5  populations. Thus, emitter site use would not be expected to result in significant adverse  6  impacts to socioeconomic or environmental justice resources.  Use of emitters powered by a  7  generator would increase the noise level; however, the noise would be intermittent and  8  would not result in adverse impacts (see Section 4.3, Noise).  9  As discussed in Section 4.10.2, the JTE system would not be located at Sites FFS-1, FFS-2,  10  FFS-3, and FFS-4, due to the proximity of residential structures within the SHD.  As a result, no  11  adverse impacts would be associated with emitter use at these locations.  12  Sites EAFB-1, FFS-5, FFS-6, and FFS-7 currently have structures within or near proposed SHDs,  13  but these structures are not residential.  However, to ensure no one is exposed to EMR, these  14  sites would need to be evaluated prior to JTE use to ensure no persons are inside the  15  structures. This mitigation would avoid the potential for adverse impacts.  16  Environmental Justice and Special Risks to Children  17  All 12 proposed emitter sites are located in counties with either a disproportionate  18  percentage of low-income populations, youth populations, or both as compared with the  19  state, or community of comparison (COC).  However, the use of emitters would not result in  20  disproportionate impacts to minority or low-income populations or pose a special risk to  21  children, as long as appropriate mitigations are implemented.  The mitigations detailed in  22  Section 4.4.4 would prevent significant noise or safety impacts to populations, inhabited  23  areas, or noise-sensitive locations (such as schools).  Furthermore, those emitters powered by  24  generators would create noise but only intermittently and at levels that would not harm  25  individuals. Safety concerns would not significantly impact environmental justice areas,  26  because emitter use would avoid impacts through SHD constraints analysis (see Safety,  27  Section 4.4).  The JTE is the only emitter that has an SHD, and JTE use would be restricted to  28  areas not encroaching on inhabited buildings, schools, and other populated areas.  (See  1 Safety, Section 4.4.2 for potential JTE locations that would not interfere with populations or 2 pose a special risk to children.) 3 4.11.3 Impact Summary 4 Table 3-44 identifies the context, intensity, and duration factors utilized for socioeconomic 5 and environmental justice impact analysis; based on these factors the Air Force has identified 6 the potential for insignificant adverse impacts to public health and safety at four proposed 7 emitter sites associated with the JTE SHD and proximity to inhabited buildings. This impact 8 can be mitigated through actions described in Section 4.4.4. The Air Force has not identified 9 any significant socioeconomic/environmental justice impacts associated with emitter sites. 10 Table 4-9 summarizes the impacts identified.  Impacts are categorized as follows: 11 • Adverse (yellow) 12 • Neutral/no effect (green) 13 Table 4-9.

As a result, this resource area is not  21  discussed further in this chapter.  22  4.13 INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION  23  As identified in Chapter 3 (Section 3.13.2), emitter site use would not be expected to result in  24  adverse impacts to utilities or transportation resources. As a result, this resource area has not  25  been carried forward for detailed analysis.  1 4.14 EMITTER SITES IMPACT SUMMARY 2 Overall, there is little interaction between emitter site use and environmental/anthropogenic 3 resources. All sites are either improved or semi-improved and negligible improvements, such 4 as installation of fencing or small areas of tree topping/clearing (approximately 0.6 acres at 5 two or three sites), would not result in adverse impacts. Issues associated with safety, land 6 use, and related socioeconomics and environmental justice resulting from emitter SHDs can 7 be resolved by restricting use of the JTE at certain locations. 8 Table 4-10 summarizes the impacts identified with emitter site use, by site, for potentially 9 affected resources based on analyses presented in Chapter 3, Sections 3.2 through 3.13, and 10 Chapter 4, Sections 4.2 through 4.13.  Impacts are categorized as follows: 11 • Adverse (yellow) – Impacts to public health and safety, the human or natural 12 environment or potential violation of federal, state, or local regulations 13 • Neutral / No Effect (green) 14 No significant adverse impacts have been identified.  Resource-Specific Mitigations (in Section 15 4.14.1) would serve to minimize or avoid any identified adverse impacts. 16 Table 4-10.

BLACKWATER RIVER STATE FOREST AFFECTED  2  ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES  3  5.1 INTRODUCTION  4  This chapter addresses the receptors identified in Chapter 3 (Affected Environment) specific  to BRSF and the impacts (Environmental Consequences) on those receptors by the various  6  effectors associated with the Proposed Action.  As discussed in Chapter 3, Section 3.14 some  7  resource areas would experience no interaction with this activity, or general impact analyses  8  in Sections 3.2 through 3.13 have shown that there would be negligible or no impacts to a  9  specified resource area, despite the site-specific nature of the resources.  Additionally, in some  cases the general analyses provided in Chapter 3 are sufficient to determine the extent of  11  impacts on site-specific resources in that the general analysis is applied to the site-specific  12  resources identified as the affected environment.  13  As noted in previous chapters, analyses rely heavily on previous NEPA documentation for  14  similar activities within similar environments; these documents are incorporated by reference  in certain sections where applicable, and are noted. Finally, the affected environment  16  discussions provide information regarding the types of resources present; however, to avoid  17  encyclopedic repetition of publicly available information the reader is directed to locations  18  outside this document for such information should the reader desire it.  As an example, the  19  fact that sensitive species are present on BRSF is addressed and types, quantities and  locations (where applicable and allowed by law) are described.  However, as discussion of  21  each individual species in terms of physical description and foraging/reproductive aspects are  22  encyclopedic and readily available from various sources, the reader is directed to a location  23  (e.g., the USFWS or Florida Natural Areas Inventory [FNAI] website) for this information.  This is  24  in keeping with 40 CFR requirements.  Training activity impact analyses consider the General Operational Constraints provided in  26  Section 2.5. These are based on the establishment of the Protection Levels identified in  27  Table 2-24 as well as the noise protection levels resulting from impact analysis in Section 3.3,  28  and presented in Table 2-25.  The following Figure 5-1 through Figure 5-10 provide graphical  29  representation of the protection levels for ground operations at BRSF as a whole, and for each  individual tactical area.  Figure 5-11 through Figure 5-20 provide similar information for noise 31  generating activities at BRSF.  Each map is a “clickable” thumbnail image that will provide full 32  screen viewing; each map is also available for full-page printing in Appendix A.  Figure 5-1.

The  4  airspace is carefully managed to provide for safe and efficient operations of both military and  5  civilian aircraft.  6  5.2.1.1  Military Training Airspace  7  BRSF underlies several military training airspace units, as shown in Figure 5-21.  Table 5-2 lists  8  the characteristics of the airspace units and the approximate number of sorties flown in the  9  airspace unit under baseline conditions.  10  Table 5-2.  Characteristics of Airspace Units Overlying BRSF  AGL = above ground level; IR = instrument route; MOA = military operations area; MSL = mean sea level; MTR= military training route; NAS = Naval Air Station; NOTAM = notice to airmen; UTBNI = up to, but not including a.  Calendar year 2010 b. Floor altitudes vary by segment. Lowest floor of MTR is listed in the table. c.  Ceiling altitudes vary by segment. Highest ceiling of MTR is listed in the table. 1 Alert Area 292 supports Navy training 2 across a wide area at altitudes 3 between ground elevation and 4 3,000 feet AGL (17,500 feet mean sea level [MSL] outside of federal airways). 6 Alert areas are designated so that 7 nonparticipating pilots will be aware 8 of an increased number of flights in 9 the area.  The alert area is not scheduled, and Navy operations in 11 the alert area do not preclude the 12 operations of any other aircraft in the 13 same area at the same time. 14 Pensacola North MOA is also managed by the Navy and used for training flights. The MOA has a floor altitude of 10,000 feet MSL. 16 Eglin A and B MOAs normally have floor altitude of 1,000 feet AGL, but this floor may be 17 lowered to 200 feet AGL if a NOTAM is published.  These MOAs overlie the central portion of 18 BRSF and are used by about 2,200 sorties per year. 19 Three military training routes traverse BRSF. The floor altitudes of the three routes vary by segment. The lowest segment of IR-021 has floor altitude of 5,000 feet MSL, the lowest 21 segment of IR-057 has a floor altitude at 200 feet AGL, and the lowest segment of IR-059 has a 22 floor altitude of 200 feet AGL.  These military training routes (MTRs) are used infrequently, on 23 the order of about once every other week. 24 R-2915A supports a wide variety of test and training activities and is managed by Eglin AFB. The RA is heavily utilized by units conducting hazardous activities such as munitions training. 26 Currently, the RA is also used for nonhazardous training events of the types that would occur 27 at BRSF and THSF under the GLI. 28 5.2.1.2 Airfields and Transiting Aircraft 29 Jacksonville ARTCC is responsible for monitoring and controlling aircraft in the region while en route.  ATC and RAPCON/TRACON facilities manage aircraft operating in their respective 31 terminal areas. 32 Table 5-3 lists airfields located at or near BRSF, along with the approximate number of airfield 33 operations currently flown per year. Blackwater/Munson Airfield is located in central BRSF 34 and supports FFS as well as general aviation operations.  The FFS conducts aircraft operations over BRSF as part of controlled burns, aerial surveys, and other operations.  The frequency of 36 these flights is variable from one season to the next depending on the number of prescribed 37 burns conducted and other factors (Colburn, 2013).  Brewton Municipal, Bob Sikes, Northwest 38 Florida Regional, and Peter Prince Airports are civilian airfields, but each also supports military 39 aircraft operations.  Harold Naval outlying landing field (NOLF) Heliport, Santa Rosa outlying landing field (OLF), Whiting Field NAS North, Whiting Field NAS South are military airfields. 41 Several smaller airfields in the area are owned by private individuals or corporations, and the 42 number of annual operations at these airfields is not reported. Figure 5-21.

FAA, 2013  d.  U.S. Air Force, 2011a  2  The Crestview Very High Frequency Omni-Directional Radio Range Tactical Air Navigation Aid  3  (VORTAC), which is located near BRSF, is a convergence point of victor routes 198, 241, 115,  4  and 329.  Victor routes extend vertically from 1,200 feet AGL up to but not including  5  18,000 feet MSL.  Aircraft transiting the area en route to northwest Florida typically travel  6  through the North-South Corridor located between R-2915A and R-2914A.  7  Class C airspace associated with NAS Whiting Field overlies BRSF at altitudes between 1,400  8  and 4,200 feet MSL at distances between 5 and 10 nautical miles (NM) from the field.  At  9  distances less than 5 NM from NAS Whiting Field, Class C airspace extends from 4,200 feet  10  MSL to the surface.  Aircraft entering Class C airspace must first establish two-way  11  communications with the ATC tower.  12  5.2.2 Environmental Consequences  13  As discussed in Section 3.2, airspace management and use would only be potentially  14  adversely affected by aircraft operations.  Other Proposed Action effectors are not addressed  15  in this section.  16  Implementation of the Proposed Action would increase military aircraft activity in the  17  airspace above BRSF.  As many as nine sorties per annual average day could be conducted  1 over BRSF, and each sortie would include up to four aircraft.  Section 2.3 describes types of GLI 2 training events, including the expected frequency of occurrence. 3 Aircraft conducting GLI training would operate in compliance with all federal aviation 4 regulations.  The training would not require segregation from nonparticipating aircraft nor would it have to occur in SUA.  No new SUA or modifications to existing SUA would be 6 required to support the proposed training, nor would any modifications to existing non-SUA 7 boundaries be needed. 8 5.2.2.1 Scheduling/Coordination 9 As described in Section 5.2.1, BRSF is overlain by several special use airspace units (see Figure 5-21).  Most GLI aircraft training would be conducted below the 1,000-foot AGL 11 floor altitudes of the Eglin MOAs and the 10,000-foot MSL floors of the Pensacola MOAs. 12 R-2915A overlies a small portion of southern BRSF and extends from the surface to unlimited 13 altitude.  In keeping with current mission planning procedures, SUA managing agencies 14 would be contacted prior to the mission to ensure airspace availability.  As most GLI missions would use altitudes not included in SUA, the number of missions requiring the use of existing 16 SUA would be expected to be low.  Current internal DoD scheduling procedures would be 17 expected to be sufficient to handle minor increases in SUA usage rates.  18 As discussed in Sections 1.3 and 1.4, a large part of the purpose and need for the GLI is to 19 alleviate overscheduling of the Eglin Range by moving nonhazardous training currently occurring there to other locations.  Implementation of the Proposed Action would reduce 21 scheduling and coordination concerns related to the Eglin Range Complex. 22 Operations in alert areas such as A-292 do not require exclusion of other aircraft operations, 23 and nonparticipating aircraft transit the alert area frequently while training is under way. 24 Knowing that an alert area supports a high volume of pilot training flights, pilots operating in the alert area practice the “see-and-avoid” method.  GLI training operations in portions of 26 A-292 located above BRSF would not affect scheduling of the airspace, because the airspace is 27 not scheduled. 28 Sorties on MTRs may also occur simultaneously with other military training in the same area. 29 Operations on IR-059/IR-057 and IR-021 that traverse BRSF would not need to be scheduled to not occur outside the times of GLI training events. Pilots involved in GLI training would be 31 made aware of scheduled MTR traffic during mission planning and pre-flight briefings. 32 GLI training missions would be coordinated with BRSF to ensure de-confliction with all BRSF 33 activities.  This coordination would be a new process and conducted prior to any GLI aircraft 34 operation. 5.2.2.2 Efficiency of Ongoing Operations 36 As discussed previously, GLI was devised in part to avoid scheduling conflicts on Eglin Range 37 by relocating nonhazardous training events currently conducted there.  Implementation of 38 the Proposed Action would have a beneficial impact, in that it would permit continued 39 growth in the tempo of testing and training operations on Eglin Range.  Increased usage of SUA over BRSF (i.e., Eglin A and B MOAs) would be expected to be minimal as the floor 41 altitude of those airspace units is higher than the altitude at which most GLI training would 42 occur. 1 GLI training events would be conducted in compliance with all federal aviation regulations, 2 operating in essentially the same manner and following the same rules as civilian aircraft. 3 Much of the training would be conducted in Class G uncontrolled airspace.  In Class G 4 airspace, ATC does not provide separation, and aircraft would practice the see-and-avoid 5 method at all times during training.  Prior to entering Class C airspace associated with NAS 6 Whiting Field, aircraft conducting GLI training would contact ATC to request permission to 7 enter.  There would be a minor increase in the number of aircraft handled by NAS Whiting 8 Field ATC. Aircraft transiting the region on victor airways typically fly at altitudes higher than 9 those proposed for GLI training. There would be little potential interaction between GLI 10 training and operations on victor routes. 11 Coordination between the Air Force and State Forest POCs would be conducted to ensure 12 that the efficiency of ongoing FFS activities would not be negatively affected.  As long as this 13 scheduling is conducted per the agreement between the Air Force and the FFS, no conflicts 14 should occur. 15 5.2.3 Airspace Impact Summary 16 Table 3-4 describes the context, intensity, and duration factors utilized in analysis for impacts 17 to airspace; based on these factors the Air Force has identified insignificant adverse impacts 18 to airspace. In summary, airspace management impacts would be regional and would 19 include some positive impacts (i.e., reduced scheduling conflicts at Eglin Range) and some 20 negative impacts (i.e., increased air traffic in controlled and uncontrolled airspace over BRSF). 21 Impacts on scheduling and coordination processes would be moderate.  Implementation of a 22 coordination process between the Air Force and FFS would avoid potential operational 23 conflicts that otherwise could be considered severe. Potential increases in scheduling 24 demand for SUA over BRSF would be expected to be minor.  Impacts to ongoing operations 25 would be expected to be minor, as the proposed GLI training would not require blocking off a 26 volume of airspace to be used exclusively by Air Force aircraft.  Other operations would be 27 able to continue to transit the area while GLI training is under way.  Impacts would last for the 28 entire life of the action, as air traffic tempo over BRSF would remain slightly elevated for as 29 long as GLI training continues. 30 Table 5-4 summarizes the impacts identified.  Impacts are categorized as follows: 31 • Adverse (yellow) 32 • Neutral/no effect (green)  33 Table 5-4.

Ground vehicles,  10  including passenger vehicles and heavy trucks, use the roads and trails on BRSF.   Privately  11  held parcels of land in BRSF are used for agriculture/silviculture and low-density residential  12  development.  USEPA has stated 44 dB and 51 dB as typical DNL noise levels at a farm area  13  and a low-density residential area, respectively (USEPA, 1974).   Based on measured noise  14  levels in similar settings, ambient noise levels (i.e., while military training is not under way) in  15  BRSF are assumed to be 45 dB DNL. SUA over BRSF is used by several types of military aircraft.  16  Table 5-5 lists noise levels generated by individual overflights of several aircraft that use the  17  training airspace over BRSF.  Under current conditions, F-35 operations above BRSF are  18  relatively infrequent.  19  Table 5-5.

Used standard acoustical conditions (59 degrees Fahrenheit and 70 percent relative humidity). 2.  The noise levels for the F-35A operating at high speeds were based on an empirical curve fit from the noise data contained in NoiseFile database for these high-speed operations (Wyle, 2010). 20 The Eglin MOAs are used by a wide variety of aircraft primarily in conjunction with the 21 adjacent Eglin Range. Eglin A and B MOAs are used for approximately 2,200 and 1,700 sorties 22 per year, respectively. Pensacola North MOA is used primarily by T-6 and T-45 aircraft based 23 at Whiting Field NAS for about 1,800 sorties per year. Even while operating at the lowest 1 altitude in the MOA (i.e., MOA floor altitude) of 10,000 feet AGL, individual overflight noise 2 levels generated by T-6 nd T-45 aircraft are relatively low.  The MTRs IR-021, IR-057, and IR-059 3 traverse BRSF but are used relatively infrequently. IR-021 is used for about 26 sorties per year, 4 while IR-059 and IR-057 are used rarely.  Since MTR operations are infrequent, they are a relatively insignificant part of the noise environment.  R-2915 is used for approximately 6,953 6 sorties annually. Under current conditions, the noise level beneath R-2915A is 61 dB DNLmr, 7 and the noise levels generated by other SUAs and MTRs overlying BRSF is below 45 dB DNLmr.  8 Civilian aircraft operations, including operations by FFS rotary-and fixed-wing aircraft, also 9 occur over BRSF. The Munson/Blackwater Airfield is used for about two aircraft operations per average day, which consist primarily of single-engine Cessna aircraft. Baseline noise levels at 11 Munson/Blackwater airstrip do not exceed 55 dB DNL. 12 Munitions noise generated on Eglin Range, which is located south of BRSF, may be audible at 13 BRSF, particularly when large high-explosives munitions are detonated.  Munitions noise 14 becomes a less significant part of the noise environment in portions of BRSF farther from Eglin Range. 16 5.3.2 Environmental Consequences 17 As discussed in Section 3.3, adverse impacts may potentially occur from UoEX and aircraft 18 operations. Other Proposed Action effectors are not addressed in this section. 19 Figure 5-11 through Figure 5-20 show the noise protection levels associated with noise-generating operations at BRSF. Aircraft and ground vehicles would follow variable routes to 21 and from training locations in the state forest. Aircraft en route typically operate at or above 22 500 feet AGL unless operating within existing SUA.  Areas outside the state forest would 23 occasionally experience aircraft and surface vehicle noise at levels listed in Table 3-9 and 24 Table 3-13 generated by vehicles en route.  However, because routing would vary from one training mission to the next, overflight/pass-by of any given location would be infrequent, 26 and noise impacts outside the state forests would be minimal. 27 5.3.2.1 Air Operations 28 At BRSF, as many as nine sorties per annual average day would be conducted as part of LAPT, 29 LLHI/E, AD, A/LVL, and OHO training.  Each training event could include up to four aircraft but only one or two under normal circumstances.  The experience of a person on the ground 31 would vary depending on the person’s location relative to the training location and the 32 mission being conducted.  In general, one or more aircraft would maneuver to the training 33 location using variable routing at not less than 500 feet AGL.  On nearing an HLZ/DZ, the 34 aircraft would descend along a pre-approved flight, avoiding known noise-sensitive locations by at least 200 feet. Maneuvers and any additional approaches to the HLZ/DZ would also 36 avoid known noise-sensitive locations by 200 feet.  Training, including maneuver, approaches, 37 and hover, would typically last 2 hours or less.  About 20 percent of total annual operations 38 would occur at least partially after 10:00 PM, with the majority of these late-night operations 39 taking place in summer months when the sun sets later.  HLZ/DZs would be sited in locations greater than 2,200 feet from known noise-sensitive locations to minimize the likelihood of 41 direct overflights of people at low altitudes. Operations noise, whether it is generated by a 42 direct overflight or training at a distance, could be disruptive of activities (e.g., conversation, 1 sleeping) and could be considered annoying.  Several HLZ/DZs would be established, and any 2 given training locations would be used for less than one training event per day on average. 3 Under a conservative set of assumptions, which are described in Section 3.3.3 and in more 4 detail in Appendix H (Section H.3), noise levels exceeding 55 dB DNL would not affect any 5 known noise-sensitive locations.  Several aircraft currently operating in the airspace above 6 BRSF, such as the A-10 and F-35, generate noise levels higher than those typically generated 7 by aircraft that would be involved in GLI training.  Military aircraft, such as the F-35, do not 8 normally fly over BRSF at levels below 1,000 feet AGL (the floor altitude of Eglin MOAs) except 9 in R-2915. Table 5-6 compares baseline aircraft and those proposed under the GLI. 10 The Munson/Blackwater and BRSF TA-1 FWALS would support A/LVL training, and noise 11 generated by that training was included with LAPT training noise for purposes of analysis. 12 Operations by rotorcraft such as the CV-22 are generally louder than light propeller-driven 13 aircraft, and the full spectrum of HLZ/DZ training would only be conducted at locations that 14 are relatively remote from known noise15 sensitive locations (e.g., TA-1 and the northern 16 half of the Munson/Blackwater Airstrip). At the 17 Munson/Blackwater airstrip, GLI training 18 aircraft would arrive from the north and depart 19 toward the north to avoid overflight of the Krul 20 Lake Recreation Area, which includes a 21 campground.  Takeoff roll would be initiated 22 from approximately midfield to minimize noise 23 impacts to the campground.  DNL noise 24 contour maps reflecting these scenarios are 25 shown in Figure 5-22 through Figure 5-24. At 26 the Munson/Blackwater Airstrip, light aircraft 27 currently make approaches and departures 28 without operational restrictions, although these operations occur almost entirely during 29 daytime hours. Figure 5-22.

Level flight, steady high-speed conditions.  Used standard acoustical conditions (59 degrees Fahrenheit and 70 percent relative humidity). 2.  C-23 Sherpa used as surrogate noise source for various small, propeller-driven aircraft types involved in GLI; C-23 is powered by two 1,198-hp engines, while CASA-212, PC-12, and M-28 are powered by pairs of 900-hp, 850-hp, and 1,100-hp engines, respectively. 3.  The noise levels for the F-35A operating at high speeds were based on an empirical curve fit from the noise data contained in NoiseFile database for these high-speed operations (Wyle, 2010).  2 3 4 5  GLI aircraft approaching and departing from FWALS in TA-9 would overfly privately owned parcels at altitudes below 500 feet AGL.  Noise levels generated during LAPT would not be expected to exceed 95 dB SEL (see Table 3-10).  Operations would be relatively infrequent, and the noise levels at privately owned parcels would not exceed 55 dB DNLmr.   6  5.3.2.2  Munitions Use  7 8 9  At BRSF, firing of blank rounds and ground burst simulators would only take place at the STOP Camp and the SRYA.  Paintball/plastic pellets and smoke grenades would be used at other locations, but use of these expendables generates minimal noise.  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  The former STOP Camp is located 1,650 feet from the nearest privately owned land and about 1,900 feet from the nearest structure visible on available aerial photos.  The SRYA is located about 1,350 feet from the nearest privately owned land parcel and about 5,000 feet from the nearest structure visible in available aerial photos. The noise generated by blank rounds may be alarming to residents living on privately owned parcels and transient users of BRSF, particularly if it occurs outside of hunting season or at night.  The extent of noise from firing blank rounds is shown in Figure 5-11 through Figure 5-20 and would exceed threshold levels at known noise-sensitive locations (i.e., residences).  Detonation of ground burst simulators would be expected to be disturbing and possibly alarming to people nearby.  To avoid  1  unnecessary concern among local residents, the Air Force would notify adjacent residents of  2  any upcoming training events that use munitions.  3  5.3.2.3 Ground Vehicle Operations  4  As discussed in Section 3.3.3, ground vehicle operations (e.g., CCVM, VSWC, BD, and OFVO)  may generate noise that is annoying to people in the state forest or private inholdings,  6  particularly when it occurs at night.  Noise levels generated by two of the loudest vehicles  7  expected to be used during GLI training are listed in Table 3-13.  Ground vehicles used in GLI  8  training would be equipped with exhaust mufflers in compliance with Florida Statutes.  9  Training would occur along roads that are used currently by heavy trucks (e.g., logging trucks)  and other traffic.  Noise impacts would be localized to the area where ground vehicles are  11  operating and would be limited to the duration of the training event.  12  5.3.2.4 Amphibious Operations  13  AO would involve up to six watercraft equipped with motors up to 200hp.  These boats would  14  generate noise that could be considered disruptive and annoying by people along the banks  of the water body being used. The boats would be of a similar size and engine power to  16  boats currently used on the same waterbodies, and would not be expected to exceed noise  17  level thresholds established in Florida Statutes. During covert training operations in confined  18  water bodies, full throttle would be expected to be used rarely, limiting the intensity of noise  19  generated.  This type of training could occur up to 10 times per year in waterbodies where  motor-powered boats are currently permitted.  Noise impacts would be expected to be  21  temporary, lasting the duration of the training exercise.  22  5.3.3 Noise Impact Summary  23  Table 3-7 describes the context, intensity, and duration factors utilized in analysis of impacts  24  to noise receptors; based on these factors the Air Force has identified some insignificant  noise-related impacts to public health and safety and the human and natural environment.  26  Noise associated with aircraft operations and munitions use would result in annoyance  27  associated with activity interference to some recreational users and residences. Given the  28  context of the BRSF existing noise environment and intensity of potential noise levels  29  resulting from the Proposed Action, noise levels would not be sufficiently intense to exceed  recommended guidelines.  As a result, adverse impacts associated with annoyance (e.g.,  31  hearing loss) for those people not participating in the training can be expected.  People  32  involved in training would wear hearing protection as required by DoD regulations.  Activities  33  such as munitions training and aircraft operations are either not regulated or are specifically  34  exempt from local noise regulations.  Ground vehicles and watercraft used during GLI training  would be expected to generate noise levels below thresholds established in Florida Statutes.  36  Implementation of operational constraints identified in Section 2.5, as well as Proposed  37  Resource-Specific Mitigations in the previous analysis, would minimize potential noise  38  annoyance and, in most cases, minimize noise to a negligible level.  1 Table 5-7 summarizes the impacts identified.

While noise impacts can be 8 minimized, they cannot be completely avoided, due to the transient nature of training 9 activities and recreational users, and the varying perception of annoyance among members 10 of the public: 11 • A/LVL training would not be conducted at the proposed FWALS in TA-9, and aircraft 12 inbound to and outbound from the FWALS would avoid overflying privately owned 13 parcels with residential structures where practicable. 14 • Approaches to and departures from the FWALS in TA-2 (Munson Airstrip) would be 15 conducted from/to the north to avoid low overflight of a campground. 1 • Aircraft departing Munson/Blackwater would initiate takeoff roll from about the center 2 point of the airstrip. 3 • The Air Force would notify residents within 4,000 feet of the SRYA or former STOP 4 Camp prior to use of munitions. 5 Figure 5-11 through Figure 5-20 show the areas in which training activities would be 6 restricted based on buffer distances described above and in Section 3.3.4.  Buffers would be 7 established for all privately owned parcels containing at least one residential structure and all 8 campgrounds. 9  5.4 SAFETY  10  5.4.1  Affected Environment  11  The affected environment for safety as it relates to proposed activities comprises the policies  12  and procedures currently in place at Eglin AFB, previously discussed in Sections 3.4.2  13  and 3.4.3.  The BFC of the FFS is primarily responsible for emergency or fire response at BRSF.  14  The BFC is also responsible for prevention, detection, and suppression of wildfires, as well as  15  responding to other emergencies at BRSF, such as accidents. The BFC encompasses Escambia,  16  Santa Rosa, and Okaloosa Counties.  17  Since January 2010, on average there have been 126 wildfires annually caused by various  18  sources such as campfires, debris burning, lightning, and children at BRSF (Table 5-8). Of  19  those, only about six were caused by equipment/vehicle use.  20  Table 5-8.  Average Wildfires by Cause at BRSF  Source: FFS, 2013a To respond to potential fires, BFC has 29 forest rangers and senior forest rangers that are certified wildland firefighters in the three-county area.  BFC also has 5 primary certified wildland firefighter supervisors and an additional 12 certified wildland firefighters to assist in suppressing and managing wildfires in the district. All certified personnel can be utilized for suppressing wildfires at BRSF. BFC firefighting equipment includes 14 John Deere 650 bulldozers (Type 2) with plows and 2 heavy bulldozers (Type 1 and 2) without plows for wildfire suppression and fire line reinforcement. All bulldozers have an accompanying transport for moving the equipment.  In addition, the district has seven Type 6 and two Type 4 wildland engines available for fire response. Specialized equipment available for wildfire use includes a mechanic truck for field repairs, portable fuel tanks, small water tenders, an excavator, and various pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs).  The FFS also maintains a UH-1 Type II firefighting helicopter located at Whiting Field near Milton. This equipment is available for use or support in fighting wildfires at BRSF. Five facilities are considered primary response locations in the district. Three of those locations are located at BRSF. These locations include the headquarters at Munson, Okaloosa Forestry Station near Blackman, and Coldwater Horse Stables located southwest of Munson. The remaining primary sites are located at Milton and Molino. Secondary sites commonly used during periods of elevated wildfire risk are located in Laurel Hill, Holt, Ensley, and Navarre. To mitigate wildfire risk, BRSF has an aggressive prescribed burning program.  Upland forest lands are burned an average of every three to four years. This prevents high accumulations of vegetation that would fuel catastrophic wildfires. The BFC cooperates with local county, state, and federal resources to suppress wildfires in the local area. Cooperative agreements exist at the state and local level to allow paid and volunteer fire departments to assist with wildfire suppression and structure protection. The following fire departments commonly assist with wildfires at BRSF: Berrydale Volunteer Fire Department (VFD), Munson VFD, Blackman VFD, Baker VFD, North Okaloosa VFD, Holt VFD, Harold VFD, East Milton VFD, Skyline VFD, and U.S. Navy Whiting Field Fire Department. Other surrounding fire departments may assist as needed. The FFS also maintains cooperative wildfire assistance agreements with Jackson Guard at Eglin AFB, U.S. Forest Service, FWC, the NWFWMD, and the Longleaf Alliance Ecosystem Support Team. Each organization has a variety of conventional or specialized equipment and/or personnel available for significant wildfire incidents at BRSF.  The FFS also has agreements with the Florida Highway Patrol and Florida Department of Transportation to provide road closures and or signage necessary for smoke events on federal and state highways. The FFS monitors weather conditions daily for wildfire planning and burning authorization purposes. The BFC records rainfall at various locations, calculates the National Fire Danger Rating System values daily, and sets fire preparedness levels.  The FFS also monitors and estimates the Keetch-Byrum Drought Index (KBDI) and FDI for the state of Florida. 1 5.4.2 Environmental Consequences 2 As discussed in Section 3.4, potential adverse impacts may occur from wildfire associated with 3 Use of Expendables. Other Proposed Action effectors are not addressed in this section. 4 Impacts to BRSF associated with safety would be the same as those described in Section 3.4.  The Proposed Action would not negatively affect the ability to provide for safe operation of 6 aircraft or other equipment, nor would it result in uncontrollable safety hazards to military 7 personnel, the public, or property. Implementation of established procedures, as discussed in 8 Sections 3.4.2 and 3.4.3, would ensure that activities associated with the Proposed Action 9 would not result in significant impacts to safety. At BRSF, campfires are only allowed at designated camp sites, which would not be used by 11 training personnel. However, campfires may potentially be utilized at the hardened camp 12 sites in designated fire pits.  No campfires would be utilized in the interstitial areas of BRSF. To 13 minimize the potential for fires caused by the Use of Expendables and general training 14 activities (such as idling vehicles), before a mission begins units would obtain the daily fire danger rating and would coordinate with FFS personnel to ensure that adequate fire 16 response is available, if needed per General Operational Constraints identified in Section 2.5.  17 Under Florida law, it is unlawful for any person to set fire to, or cause fire to be set to, any 18 wildlands or to build a campfire or bonfire or to burn trash or other debris within the 19 designated area of a severe drought emergency, unless a written permit is obtained from the division or its designated agent. 21 5.4.3 Safety Impact Summary 22 Table 3-15 describes the context, intensity, and duration factors utilized in analysis for 23 impacts to safety; based on these factors the Air Force has identified some insignificant 24 adverse public health and safety impacts to the human and natural environment.  There is the potential for wildfire associated with training activities, and wildfires could result in adverse 26 impacts.  However, requirements identified in Section 2.5 associated with wildfire prevention 27 and response would minimize the potential for this impact to occur. Therefore, based on the 28 context, intensity, and duration of identified potential safety impacts, the Air Force has not 29 identified any significant safety impacts.  Table 5-9 summarizes the impacts identified. Impacts are categorized as follows: 31 • Adverse (yellow) 32 • Neutral/no effect (green) Table 5-9.

While these would minimize the potential for wildfire probability, the potential  5  for increased wildfires cannot be completely avoided under the Proposed Action. Thus, the  6  potential for adverse safety impacts at BRSF remains.   The increased potential for wildfire  7  probability can only be avoided through implementation of the No Action Alternative.  1  5.5 AIR QUALITY  2  5.5.1  Affected Environment  3  BRSF is located in both Santa Rosa and Okaloosa Counties.   Both counties are in attainment  4  for all criteria pollutants (USEPA, 2013).   5  Baseline emissions for Okaloosa and Santa Rosa Counties are presented in Table 5-10.   These  6  emissions data were acquired from the USEPA’s 2008 NEI data for Okaloosa and Santa Rosa  7  Counties (USEPA, 2012).   The county data include emissions data from point sources, area  8  sources, and mobile sources.  9  Table 5-10.

Other  13  Proposed Action effectors are not addressed in this section.  14  All activities proposed at BRSF already occur at Eglin AFB, which is located in Okaloosa and  15  Santa Rosa Counties. Emissions for these activities are currently reported in the Eglin AFB air  16  emissions inventory and GHG inventory.   The Proposed Action would involve moving the  17  activities within the current affected county.  Emissions from each training activity were  18  compared with county emissions and impacts were determined.  19  Emissions for land disturbance and fugitive dust for each training activity are provided in  20  Section 3.5.   These emissions would cause negligible (less than 5 percent of the ROI  21  emissions) short-term impacts to regional air quality (Table 5-11 and Table 5-12).  22  Wheeled vehicle emissions associated with each training activity are provided in Section 3.5.   23  Vehicles operating in the ROI would emit negligible short-term levels of air pollutants  24  (Table 5-13).   GHG and air pollutant emissions would not exceed thresholds for significant  25  negative impacts.  Table 5-11.

In summary, 12 training activities would result in small amounts of air emissions that would not result in 13 exceedence of any local or regional air quality standards.  While NOx emissions associated 14 with aircraft operations may be considered adverse, given the potential increase over 15 baseline air quality conditions, these emissions would be transient and short term in nature. 16 Table 5-17 summarizes the impacts identified.

Discussion focuses on  8  impact assessment resource features and issues identified in Section 3.6, Earth Resources.   9  5.6.1.1 Geologic Resources  10  The following subsection discusses the physical geography and closed depressions  11  subsidence features on BRSF.  12  Physical Geography  13  The Blackwater River watershed that generally defines the BRSF landscape is characterized by  14  alluvial and fluvial terraces and the Citronelle Formation.  Stream terraces form as one or a  15  series of constructed and/or erosional flat-topped landforms in a stream valley that flank and  16  are parallel to the stream channel originally formed by the previous stream level. Subsequent  17  terraces, which may rarely or never flood, are built on the remnants of abandoned floodplain,  18  streambed, or valley floor features (Schmidt and Coe, 1978; USDA, 1994; Hollie et al., 2010).  19  The Citronelle Formation is a deltaic deposit up to 340 feet thick consisting of quartz sands  20  and gravel that are unconsolidated to poorly consolidated, very fine to very coarse, and clean  21  to clayey. It frequently contains extremely hard cemented sandstone lens known as  22  hardpans, which form as a result of cementation of sands by iron oxides that precipitate from  23  groundwater. In some instances, seepage slopes and natural ponds are created by hardpans  1  at or near the surface.   As currently recognized, this formation only occurs in the Florida  2  panhandle (Beck, 1973; Hollie et al., 2010; Maddox et al., 2002; Marsh, 1966).   3  Sensitive Karst Terrain  4  No sensitive karst terrain areas have been identified on BRSF (see Section 3.6.1.2).  5  Closed Depressions  6  There are several closed depression areas that may or may not represent sinkhole subsidence.  7  BRSF areas designated as closed depressions are likely nonkarst features relating to other  8  natural geologic features or conditions created by human activities, such as buried organic  9  materials, broken drain lines, septic tanks, or other subterranean condition.   A licensed,  10  professional geologist makes the determination if the subsidence incident is a sinkhole or  11  closed depression.  A summary of BRSF closed depression subsidence incidents are listed in  12  Table 5-18 and shown in Figure 5-25.   Approximately 54 percent of designated closed  13  depressions are within the Juniper Creek tactical area (TA-8).   14  Table 5-18.

A  18  preeminent characteristic of the forest’s upland soils that is responsible for many of its unique  19  attributes is the broad distribution and, in most cases, dominance of quartz sand.   The soil  20  series that compose the BRSF are summarized in Table 5-19   and shown in Figure 5-26.   21  Appendix E, Earth Resources, provides detail by tactical area.  Figure 5-25.

BRSF Highly Erodible and Potentially Highly Erodible Soils Table 5-22.  BRSF Erodible Soils 1.  Total area does not include pits, water, urban lands, Aquents, gullied lands, and other variants.  2  Natural Soil Erosion Sources  3  Streambanks  4  BRSF streambank  habitats are generally divided  into three categories: (1) banks  with  5  vegetation and leaf litter 2 to 10 feet high, (2) clay lens with vegetation, and (3) small sand  6  banks with trailing grasses (Peters and Jones, 1973).  A study conducted by the FDEP within  7  the BRSF documented channel segments of the Blackwater River with severe erosion (Ray,  8  1999).   In several instances, banks were observed to exhibit unstable overheightened and  9  oversteepened conditions leading to mass slope failure (see Streambank Erosion photos).  No  10  site-specific BRSF streambank erosion data were available.  Blackwater River Bendway Streambank Erosion (Photos by Donald Ray)  11  Steepheads  12  The 11 steepheads within the BRSF are listed in Table 5-23 and shown in Figure 5-25.

Borrow  6  pits are potential sources of severe soil erosion and sedimentation, due to their state of  7  perpetual surface disturbance, bare surface conditions, common location in proximity to  8  waterways, accumulations of loose soil materials, and exposure of relatively impervious soil  9  layers (see photo of Sweetwater Borrow Pit-Induced Gully Erosion and Post-Reclamation  10  Conditions).   BRSF pits  are  stabilized and restored to  native vegetation  once  mining  11  operations have ceased (Hollie et al., 2010).  12  Table 5-24.

Soils detached from roads and roadside 5 areas are readily discharged into waterways at crossings (see photos of Unpaved Road 6 Erosion and Wetland Sedimentation and Coon Camp Branch Low-Water Crossing-Induced 7 Soil Erosion and Sedimentation).  Studies by FDEP have confirmed that unpaved roads and 8 crossings are primary sources of soil erosion and sedimentation in water resources on BRSF 9 (Ray, 1996; Ray, 2005a; Ray, 2005b). BRSF Unpaved Road Erosion and Wetland Sedimentation (Photos by Donald Ray) BRSF Coon Camp Branch Low Water Crossing-Induced Soil Erosion and Sedimentation (Photos by Donald Ray) 10 Routine maintenance of primary, secondary, and some tertiary unpaved roads on BRSF is 11 primarily conducted by the Santa Rosa and Okaloosa County road maintenance departments. 12 Most improved roads are surfaced with clayey sand materials to improve surface cohesion 13 and stability.  Maintenance of these roads is conducted in compliance with the forest road 14 standards described in the Road and Bridge Plan (FDACS, Division of Forestry, Policies and 15 Procedures 500.108) and silviculture BMPs manual (FDACS, 2008) developed by FDACS, 16 Division of Forestry (FDACS, 2007). 1  Based on available data, most BRSF unpaved road water crossings are low water crossings  2  (see Table 5-25 and the photos of the Mare Branch Unpaved Tertiary Road Low Water  3  Crossing).  The BRSF is currently discriminating the locations of non-crossing road drains and  4  crossing culverts therefore a complete culvert crossings dataset is not available. Low water  5  crossings account for approximately 67 percent of unpaved road crossings. A summary of  6  BRSF unpaved road bridge and low-water crossings is presented in Table 5-25.  In most cases,  7  low water crossings are unimproved; however, based on the stream flow conditions and  8  trafficking loads and frequency reinforcing, materials such as rock or geo-web materials may  9  be required to reduce in-stream, streambank, and road approach disturbances.   Between  10  FY 07–08 and FY 11–12, 32 low water crossings were improved (FDACS, 2013).  11  Table 5-25.

These  13  roads, which are not included on the roads inventory, are used to collect and remove  14  harvested timber from the site.   In most cases, these native-soil roads are not built to road  15  class standards and are abandoned once harvesting operations cease. Generally, these roads  16  are restored via natural attenuation.  Since these roads are not designed for continued use by  17  wheeled-vehicles, they easily degrade and may be highly susceptible to soil erosion.   In  18  addition, firebreaks are also not designed to support continued use by motor vehicles.  1 5.6.2 Environmental Consequences 2 As discussed in Section 3.6, potential adverse 3 impacts to earth resources may occur from 4 land development activities, use of wheeled vehicles and dismounted movement, and 6 aircraft and AO.  Other proposed action 7 effectors are not addressed in this section. 8 5.6.2.1 Land Disturbance 9 As discussed in Section 3.6.3, HLZs/DZs, point impacts, consumption, and incidental land 11 disturbance would have no adverse impact on 12 soils.  Impacts to BRSF earth resources 13 identified in Section 5.6.1 would generally be 14 the same as those described in Section 3.6.  Fixed-Wing Aircraft Landing Sites 16 The Munson Airfield is an existing airstrip in the Sweetwater TA (TA-2) that has been 17 designated for public use with no restrictions.  The other two fixed-wing aircraft landing 18 locations would utilize existing unpaved roads in Coldwater and Yellow River TAs (TA-1 and 19 TA-9, respectively) (see Appendix A, Printable Maps, Figure 2-8 through Figure 2-10).  No field-validated data on the existing features and conditions of the proposed unpaved road 21 FWALS locations were available for comparison with military FWALS standards.  Based on data 22 collected from the FFS, the widths of forest unpaved roads shoulder to shoulder and 23 stabilized aggregate/clay base range from 34 to 22 feet and 12 to 24 feet, respectively. 24 Current primary, secondary, and tertiary unpaved roads at BRSF likely provide less than the 30 feet of usable landing surface required by military standards. 26 Based on field experience, most BRSF unpaved roads likely do not have shoulder areas and 27 are maintained at a maximum road width.  Where shoulders do exist, they are generally not 28 constructed or maintained to a standard that would support vehicle traffic.  Based on a review 29 of aerial photographs, the proposed Yellow River site would occur on an unimproved, tertiary sand road that is restricted for use as an FWALS without major reconstruction.  The proposed 31 Coldwater Creek site may be an improved secondary road but may be flanked on both sides 32 by timber (Zones A and B). Given the road subgrade and surface course, the road surface may 33 require reconstruction to support aircraft landings and bushhogging to clear adjacent 34 vegetation. Bushhogging is a vegetation maintenance mowing procedure performed after standing timber and large, mature shrubs have been removed. 36 TA-2 Munson Airfield Landings Determination:  Since the Munson Airfield is currently utilized for 37 aircraft operations, it is anticipated that LAPT training conducted at this location would be 38 adverse but insignificant, site specific, low intensity, and short term.  No modifications to the 39 existing airfield would likely be required to accommodate proposed aircraft mission activities. Impacts would likely be limited to minor disturbances of maintained areas that could be fully 41 recovered during routine FWALS maintenance.  The proposed use of light military aircraft is 42 not anticipated to exceed the surface loading and pressures associated with other aircraft 11 Table 5-27 summarizes soil suitability ratings for landing zones of proposed FWALS at BRSF 12 based on USDA ratings provided previously in Section 3.6. 1  that use the airfield.  No loss or degradation of prime farmland soils or geologic steephead or  2  closed depression features is anticipated.  3  TA-1 and TA-9 Unpaved Road FWALS Landings Determination:  For this analysis, it was assumed  4  that the proposed TA-1 and TA-9 FWALS locations have no road shoulders, are surfaced with  5  unimproved native soils, and have an average roadway driving surface width of 18 feet.   To  6  convert these roads into FWALS that meet AFSOC standards (AFSOC, 2011), the existing  7  roadways would have to be rebuilt according to requirements identified in Section 3.6,  8  resulting in about 0.6 acres of soil disturbance per FWALS.   The estimated FWALS footprint  9  area and impacted soils are presented in Table 5-26.  10  Table 5-26.

No loss or degradation of prime farmland, karst soils, geologic steephead, or closed  18  depression features is anticipated.  Since no hydric soils were identified within the estimated  19  footprint area, federal or state wetland permits are not likely required.  20  5.6.2.2  Ground Movement  21  As discussed in Section 3.6, ground movement has the potential for causing soil erosion;  22  however,  this potential is considered negligible given general operating procedures  23  identified in  Section  2.5 and  the  Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations  identified in  24  Section 3.6.4.   Based on information provided in Section 3.6, BRSF temporary low-and  25  moderate-use camp site suitability and  limitation  constraint areas  are summarized  in  26  Table 5-28 and Figure 5-29.   BRSF tactical area lands were rated as somewhat limited or very  27  limited for bivouac suitability.  Limitations would be less restrictive on sites for tents or  28  remote camps.  Areas identified as very limited would not be suitable for bivouacking.  Table 5-28.

Total area does not include pits, water, urban lands, Aquents, gullied lands, and other variants. 2 Constraint areas where mission impact3 induced earth resource effects are most likely 4 to occur include closed depressions, 5 steepheads, and hydric and erodible soils. 6 Steepheads and closed depressions represent 7 locations where steep slopes and sustained 8 wet soil conditions are sensitive to soil 9 disturbances from troop movements.  These 10 would mostly likely occur during dismounted 11 maneuvers. 12 As discussed in Section 3.6, no adverse impacts 13 to off-road areas would occur from wheeled 14 vehicles. Proposed use of unpaved roads and 15 crossings could degrade and destabilize unpaved road soil or aggregate surfaces, which 16 could increase soil erosion and sedimentation.  However, the proposed mission frequency as 17 identified in Chapter 2 would likely not exceed the carrying capacity of available unpaved 18 roads or be greater than the current level of vehicle use. Vehicles traversing low-water 19 crossings could destabilize road approach slopes and increase soil erosion.  Generally, the 20 potential sources of sediment are limited to the portions of the road in immediate contact 21 with the water course and the distance of road slopes from the gradient crest to the stream. 22 Driving through a stream also mobilizes streambed sediments. 23 However, implementation of General Operational Constraints identified in Section 2.5, along 24 with implementation of Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations in Section 3.6.4 would serve 25 to minimize impacts to earth resources. 26 5.6.2.3 Aircraft Operations 27 The proposed BRSF aircraft operations detailed below include FWALS landings, HLZ/DZ 28 landings, and FARP/HGO.  FWALS landings and HLZ/DZ landings may occur within LU-1 and 29 LU-2 areas, while FARP/HGO may only occur in LU-2 areas on asphalt or concrete. All activities 30 must adhere to noted general and Proposed Resource-Specific Constraints and mitigations 1 identified in Sections 3.6.4, respectively.  FARP/HGO and other fueling activities were 2 previously discussed in Section 3.6, and no adverse impacts were identified. Figure 5-29.  BRSF Bivouac Constraint Areas 3 FWALS Landings 4 TA-2 Munson Airfield Landings Determination:  Since the Munson Airfield is currently utilized for 5 aircraft operations, it is anticipated that LAPT training conducted at this location would result 6 in neutral, fully reversible impacts.  No modifications to the existing airfield would likely be 7 required to accommodate proposed aircraft mission activities.  Impacts would likely be 8 limited to minor disturbances of maintained areas that could be fully recovered during 9 routine FWALS maintenance.  The proposed use of light military aircraft is not anticipated to 10 exceed the surface loading and pressures associated with other aircraft that use the airfield. 11 Furthermore, no loss or degradation of prime farmland soils or geologic steephead or closed 12 depression features is anticipated. 13 TA-1 and TA-9 Unpaved Road FWALS Landings Determination:  As discussed in Section 3.6, 14 potential earth resource impacts include soil compaction, rutting, and erosion.  Areas prone 15 to physical damage from compaction are the undisturbed ground adjacent to the existing 16 roadway that could be incorporated into the landing zone.  The effects of undisturbed 17 ground compact would extend for the life of the FWALS landing zone.  Soil rutting would 18 most likely occur within the lateral clearance zones during maintenance activities under 19 saturated soil conditions.  Since area slopes are relatively minor and there are no road-stream 20 crossing within the proposed footprint, construction-induced soil erosion would be limited to 21 the immediate area and would not likely affect water resources. 22 HLZ/DZ Landings 23 Proposed HLZ/DZ-based aircraft landing activities include A/LVL and LLHI/E training at 24 existing cleared areas, primarily clearcuts, in various locations at BRSF (see Section 2.3.2.1).  All 25 forest tactical areas are candidate locations.  No landing strips, helicopter pads, or other 26 construction activities would be required to prepare selected sites.  For safety and operational 27 reasons, aircraft landings would take place on relatively level ground that is less prone to 28 unstable soil conditions and soil erosion than steeper sites. 29 Based on analyses presented in Section 3.6, BRSF HLZ suitability and limitation constraint 30 areas are summarized in Table 5-29 and Figure 5-30.  Very limited areas fall under the LU-1 31 category and would be limited in use for HLZs/DZs. Figure 5-30. BRSF Helicopter Landing Zone Constraint Areas Table 5-29.

Total area does not include pits, water, urban lands, Aquents, gullied lands, and other  variants.  2  Again, with the implementation of mitigations specific to earth resources (see Section 3.6.4),  3  potential soil erosion, compaction, and rutting impacts from proposed FWALS landings and  4  HLZ/DZ use at BRSF are anticipated to be adverse but insignificant, site specific, low intensity,  5  and short term.  No loss or degradation of prime farmland, karst soils, geologic steephead, or  6  closed depression features is anticipated.  Since no hydric soils were identified within the  7  estimated footprint area, federal or state wetland permits are not likely required.  8  5.6.2.4 Amphibious Operations  9  Boat and troop egress and ingress activities would occur along the banks and shorelines of  10  available training areas within all use areas (except prohibited areas and RAs), with noted  11  General Operational Constraints and Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations identified in  12  Sections 2.5 and 3.6.4, respectively.  As discussed in Section 3.6, AO could disturb soils and  13  trample vegetation, resulting in conditions that may result in accelerated bank erosion.  14  As discussed in Section 5.6.1.2, some reaches of larger BRSF streams are experiencing  15  scouring and mass failures from overheightened and oversteepened bank conditions.  These  16  features are most common along river bendways and are particularly sensitive to disturbance.  17  These conditions are likely most common water bodies such as the Blackwater River.  AO  18  conducted in these sensitive locations or other water areas with similar conditions could  19  further destabilize streambanks and significantly increase soil loss and streambank retreat.  20  On streambanks and shorelines with established vegetation and stable grades (not  21  overheightened or oversteepened), impacts would consist of minor disturbances that, in  22  most cases, would naturally recover.  Operations conducted at boat launches would not likely  23  increase streambank degradation or soil loss.  24  Implementation of General Operational Constraints and Proposed Resource-Specific  25  Mitigations, such as rotation of ingress/egress locations, would serve to minimize impacts to  26  earth.  1 5.6.3 Earth Resources Impact Summary 2 Table 3-27 describes the context, intensity, and duration factors utilized in analysis for 3 impacts to earth resources; based on these factors the Air Force has identified some 4 insignificant impacts to the natural environment. In summary, there are unavoidable adverse 5 impacts associated with minor soil erosion impacts resulting from use of existing roadways 6 for fixed-wing aircraft landing, HLZ/DZ use, ground movement, and AO.  No NPDES 7 permitting requirements have been identified.  The intensity of these impacts is minimized 8 through implementation of General Operational Constraints and Proposed Resource-Specific 9 Mitigations identified in Section 2.5 and 3.6.4, respectively. 10 Table 5-30 summarizes the impacts identified.

The Blackwater River  14  watershed is fed by three major tributaries: Juniper Creek, Coldwater Creek, and Sweetwater  15  Creek (FDEP, 2004).  The Blackwater River flows south into Blackwater Bay and the Gulf of  16  Mexico.  The Blackwater River watershed is one of the last natural shifting white-sand bottom  17  river systems in the world. FDEP classifies the Blackwater River within BRSF as an OFW  18  because of its high ecological integrity and recreation potential. Despite its OFW status,  19  several streams within the Blackwater River watershed do not meet their designated use and  20  are listed as impaired by FDEP. Table 5-31 lists impaired waters within the Blackwater River  21  watershed and the impairment classification for each listed stream. Figure 5-31 provides an  22  overview of surface water resources at BRSF. Figure 5-32 through Figure 5-40 provide more  23  detailed views of surface water resources in each TA at BRSF.  1 Table 5-31.

There are 4 27,222 acres of wetlands at BRSF, including 5 nearly 26,414 acres of palustrine or 6 freshwater wetlands, 495 acres of lacustrine 7 wetlands, and 313 acres of riverine wetlands 8 (Table 5-32). Palustrine or freshwater 9 wetlands include forested wetlands, scrub10 shrub wetlands, emergent wetlands, and 11 ponds. Lacustrine wetlands include 12 deepwater habitat (depths greater than 13 6.6 feet) associated with lakes. Riverine 14 wetlands occur entirely within stream 15 channels of nontidal, low-gradient, perennial 16 streams (Cowardin et al., 1979).  Figure 5-31 provides an overview of wetlands at BRSF. Figure 17 5-32 through Figure 5-40 provide more detailed views of the distribution of wetlands in each 18 TA at BRSF. 19 Table 5-32.  Wetlands Summary for BRSF (acres) Figure 5-40.

In all, 29,348 acres of floodplains have been mapped at BRSF (Table 5-33).  24  Figure 5-31 provides an overview of floodplains at BRSF.  Figure 5-32 through Figure 5-40  25  provide more detailed views of floodplains in each TA at BRSF.  26  Table 5-33.

Other Proposed Action effectors  4  are not addressed in this subsection.  Impacts to BRSF water resources identified in  5  Section 5.7.1 would generally be the same as those described in Section 3.7.  6  Impact assessment considers implementation of the General Operational Constraints  7  inherent to the Proposed Action as identified in Section 2.5.  These constraints, such as  8  establishment of buffers around sensitive water resource locations and habitats, would  9  minimize potentially adverse impacts and, in some cases, preclude adverse impacts  10  altogether. Avoidance areas for water resources are identified in Figure 5-1 through Figure  11  5-10.  12  5.7.2.1 Water Resource Protection Levels  13  Water resource protection levels were defined based on current environmental management  14  requirements at Eglin AFB (EAFBI 13-212; U.S. Air Force, 2012). Water resources fall within the  15  LU-1 protection level as described in Section 5.1, shown in Figure 5-1 through Figure 5-10 as  16  yellow. The LU-1 protection level would affect all surface water bodies (streams, ponds, and  17  lakes), wetlands, and floodplains and require a 100-foot buffer zone around these resources.  18  No land disturbance would be permitted outside of previously disturbed roadbeds and road  19  shoulders. Dismounted maneuvers and AO would be allowed, but concentrated troop  20  movements would not be allowed on steep slopes, streambanks/shorelines, and wetlands.  21  Pyrotechnic use outside of hardened campsites located at the SRYA and STOP would be  22  limited only to smoke grenades.  23  Wheeled vehicle use would be restricted to existing, approved roads and trails in each tactical  24  area. Table 5-34 summarizes the types and conditions of stream and wetland crossings at  25  each TA at BRSF. Wheeled vehicle use of stream and wetland crossings would be restricted to  26  crossings with a good or fair rating, and in coordination with the FFS. Vehicle access would be  27  prohibited at stream and wetland crossings rated in poor condition. Currently at BRSF,  28  115 stream crossings and 41 wetland crossings are rated good or fair ratings, and 45 stream  29  crossings and 35 wetland crossings are rated poor.  Stream and wetland crossings at BRSF,  30  and their relative conditions, are shown in Figure 5-1 through Figure 5-10. Good/fair  31  crossings are shown in light blue, while poor condition crossings are identified by dark blue.  32  Table 5-34.

These restrictions in each TA range  3  from 2,516 acres to 8,891 acres (19.19 percent to 32.60 percent of each TA).  Figure 5-1  4  through Figure 5-10 provide more detailed views of water resource avoidance areas in each  5  TA at BRSF.  LU-1 areas are identified in each figure as solid yellow.  6  Table 5-35.

Vehicle use would be restricted to existing roads and trails and approved, existing  14  crossing locations in streams and wetlands.  15  Wheeled vehicle activities could indirectly affect water resources at BRSF. Routine use of the  16  existing dirt road network at BRSF that extends throughout the TAs is a regular contributor to  17  roadway erosion, and a recognized problem affecting some streams and wetlands (FDOF,  18  2000). Leaks of fuel and other vehicle fluids would also be a potential indirect source of  19  contamination to water resources as described under land improvement effects. Some  20  indirect effects to water resources from roadway erosion are likely and assumed to occur.  21  While the potential for these occurrences are inherent to vehicle use (whether for the military,  22  the FFS, or civilians) and unavoidable, implementation of standard vehicle maintenance and  23  spill prevention SOPs would minimize the potential to a negligible level.  24  Dismounted Movements  25  Dismounted troop movement is a potential impact to surface water and wetland resources in  26  all TAs at BRSF.  Potential effects would be direct but on a minor scale.  Rotation of any stream  27  or water body ingress/egress areas would serve to minimize the potential for any medium-to  28  long-term impacts associated with shoreline erosion, and units would be advised to avoid any  29  noticeably eroded shorelines. Over the short term, sediments in the fast-flowing streams  30  typical of those found at BRSF would settle rapidly and water clarity would return, causing the  31  streams to return to their former state once units had moved on.  32  5.7.2.3 Amphibious Operations  33  As discussed in Section 3.7, AO may potentially result in disturbance of streambeds and  34  shorelines from the loading and unloading of watercraft and movement of watercraft on the  35  surface waters, as well as ingress/egress of troops over the land/water interface as detailed in  1 the Riverine/Estuarine Programmatic Environmental Assessment (U.S. Air Force, 2004).  AO 2 would adhere to the General Operational Constraints and mitigations identified in Section 2.5 3 associated with EAFBI 13-212, Section 7.2.9.  Impacts to water resources would be minimized 4 to levels less than significant by limiting activity to designated landing zones and by rotating 5 landing zones when these areas show signs of erosion.  There is potential for release of fuel 6 from watercraft to surface waters, however, this potential is inherent to watercraft use 7 (whether military or civilian).  Such potential for adverse impacts would be minimized to a 8 negligible level by implementation of SOPs for watercraft maintenance and spill prevention 9 procedures as identified in Section 3.12.  Motorized boats would be prohibited in Bear Lake. 10 5.7.3 Water Resources Impact Summary 11 Table 3-31 describes the context, intensity, and duration factors utilized in analysis for 12 impacts to water resources; based on these factors the Air Force has identified insignificant 13 impacts to the natural environment. However, potential impacts to water quality would not 14 adversely affect public health or safety.  In summary, unavoidable, direct adverse impacts to 15 wetlands from ISDs are associated with ground movement and AO. The intensity of any of 16 the identified impacts would be minimized through General Operational Constraints and 17 Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations identified in Section 2.5 and 3.7.4, respectively. No 18 USACE Section 404 permitting requirements have been identified. 19 Table 5-36 summarizes the impacts identified.  Impacts are categorized as follows: 20 • Adverse (yellow) 21 • Neutral/no effect (green) 22 Table 5-36.

However, while wheeled vehicles would be required to utilize  existing and approved roadways and water and wetland crossings, unavoidable adverse but not  significant impacts to surface waters and wetlands may occur from use of wheeled vehicles at  water/wetland crossings. Minor impacts may be associated with indirect impacts from vehicles (oil  drips, etc.). Mitigations to prevent environmental damage as described in Section 5.7.2.3 include use  of only stream crossings rated “good” or “fair” for training exercises and avoiding use of crossings  rated “poor.” Leaks of vehicle fluids would be mitigated through proper vehicle maintenance and spill  kits for field use. Implementation of these mitigations and constraints would reduce impact potentials  from “yellow” to “green” by decreasing the potential for vehicle interaction with degraded resources and  the potential for any spills to occur.  Table 5-36.  Surface Water, Wetland, and Floodplain Impacts Summary – BRSF, Cont’d 1  5.7.4  Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations  2  The  USFWS, as part  of the  ESA Section  7  consultation  process  (USFWS, 2014), has  3  recommended the following conservation measure: avoidance of “Good” and “Poor” rated  4  vehicle water crossings for training use in order to protect the better crossing sites and  5  minimize further degradation of the sites in poor condition.  6  No additional Resource-Specific Mitigations for water resources have been identified.  All  7  General Operational Constraints (Section 2.5) and Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations  8  (Section 3.7.4)  identified  previously would sufficiently minimize any identified adverse  9  impacts (yellow), mitigating them to beneficial or no effect (green).  10  5.8 BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES  11  5.8.1  Affected Environment  12  Figure 5-31 provides an overview of biological resources at BRSF.  Figure 5-32 through  13  Figure 5-40 provide more detailed views of biological resources in each TA at BRSF.  14  5.8.1.1  Vegetation  15  In combination with the Conecuh National Forest, BRSF is home of the largest contiguous  16  longleaf pine/wiregrass ecosystem in the world and contains some of the richest plant and  1  animal diversity. In 2006, FNAI completed an inventory and ecological community mapping  2  project on 190,639 acres of BRSF.  Types of vegetation found consist of mostly upland pine  3  (approximately 70 percent of the land surveyed).  The next largest ecological communities  4  found are alluvial forest (approximately 14 percent) and sandhill (approximately 10 percent).  5  Other types of vegetation include seepage slope, baygall, upland hardwood forest, mesic  6  flatwoods, blackwater stream, floodplain swamp, dome swamp, depression marsh, and  7  seepage slope (FDACS, 2013). Table 5-37 lists representative vegetation species within each  8  ecological community. More detailed descriptions of vegetation can be found in the Guide to  9  the Natural Communities of Florida (FNAI, 2010).  10  Table 5-37.  Ecological Communities Within BRSF  Vegetation  Type  Description  Upland pine  Exists on high, rolling clay hills and consists of widely spaced trees with few shrubs and a dense cover of herbs often intergrading with sandhill.  The dominant canopy tree is longleaf pine with scattered southern red oak and blackjack oak. Other species include shrubs such as dwarf huckleberry (Gaylussacia dumosa), gallberry, winged sumac, and Darrow’s blueberry. Herbs are dense and dominated by wiregrass. Frequent low-intensity ground fires during the growing season reduce hardwood competition and facilitate pine and wiregrass reproduction.  Alluvial forest  Forms borders along the high sandy banks with a gradual transition to baygall as elevation increases. Alluvial forest mainly consists of Atlantic white cedar with slash pine and/or loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). Other plant species include red maple, sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), tuliptree (Liriodendron tulipifera), black titi (Cliftonia monophylla), dahoon (Ilex cassine), American holly (Ilex opaca), swamp laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia), water oak (Quercus nigra), sourwood, and swamp bay. Short shrub species include coastal sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia), blue huckleberry (Gaylussacia frondosa var. tomentosa), St. Andrew’s cross (Hypericum hypericoides), mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia), coastal doghobble (Leucothoe axillaris), and possumhaw. Hurricane Lake, Karick Lake, and Bear Lake are all converted seepage streams and alluvial forest.  Sandhill  Most abundant community in the southernmost region within TA-8 and TA-9.  Dominated by widely spaced longleaf pine, turkey oak (Quercus laevis), and wiregrass.  Other plant species include bluejack oak, sparkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum), common persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), and gopher apple (Licania michauxii). Sandhill requires growing season fires every 1 to 3 years to maintain open structure.  Seepage slope  Occurs adjacent to alluvial forest/baygall communities. Dominated by grass and sedge communities occurring on slopes with constant seepage from a perched water table where the ground is usually saturated but rarely inundated.  These communities have very few trees and only occasional shrubs.  Seepage slopes are historically open and dominated by a dense groundcover of wiregrass and toothache grass (Ctenium aromaticum).  Community also supports pockets of carnivorous bog plants, especially pitcher plants (Sarracenia spp.) and sundews (Drosera spp.).  Baygall  Occurs at the edges of floodplains and along seepage streams and drainages from surrounding upland pine and sandhill communities.  They are generally shrubby or forested seepage areas dominated by sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), swamp bay (Persea palustris), black titi (Cliftonia monophylla), and titi (Cyrilla racemiflora). Seepage from surrounding uplands maintains a saturated substrate with peat moss (Sphagnum spp.), often forming mats. Baygalls are most commonly interlaced with alluvial forests and may also occur in broad grassy wet flatwoods communities at the bases of seepage slopes. Dominant baygall species are typically fire-intolerant.  Upland hardwood forest  Well-developed, closed-canopy forests of upland hardwoods on rolling hills occurring sporadically on rich hillsides. In the northeast corner of the forest, hardwood forests may have been more common prior to forest disturbance. The canopy is a mixture of deciduous species, mostly oaks (Quercus sp.) and occasionally American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and southern magnolia. Subcanopy and shrub layers are also well developed with a diversity of temperate species that grade gradually into upland pine on upper slopes and alluvial forest/baygalls on lower slopes.  Mature hardwood forests create fire-resistant conditions through shading, reduction of herbaceous groundcover, and buildup of oak leaf litter, so fires from adjacent communities should be allowed to naturally extinguish at the edges of upland hardwood forest.  Table 5-37.  Ecological Communities Within BRSF, Cont’d Vegetation  Type  Description  Mesic flatwoods  Open-canopied pine forests, predominately longleaf pine, with little to no mid-story and a fairly dense low shrub and herb layer.  Occurs on relatively flat terrain with moderate to poor drainage, adjacent to alluvial forest with a very gradual transition to upland pine or sandhill and distinguished by an abundance of running oak (Quercus elliottii), dwarf live oak (Quercus minima), hairy laurel (Kalmia hirsuta), and false rosemary (Conradina canescens) in the short shrub and herb layers. Some mesic flatwoods sites in TA-9 have been converted to slash pine plantations.  Blackwater stream  Consists of Coldwater Creek, Blackwater River, Juniper Creek, Sweetwater Creek, Panther Creek, and Penny Creek. These are perennial or intermittent seasonal watercourses with sandy bottoms originating deep in sandy lowlands. Characteristic of tea-colored waters laden with tannins and are generally acidic. Emergent and floating aquatic vegetation growth is often reduced because of typically steep banks and considerable seasonal fluctuations in water level. Plant communities along these streams are usually either alluvial forest dominated by Atlantic white cedar or floodplain swamp dominated by pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens).  Floodplain swamp  Floodplain swamps are located along streams mostly in the southern portion of BRSF.  They occur on the lowest parts of the floodplain and have a well-developed canopy of buttressed trees dominated by either pond cypress in the south or mostly swamp tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora) in the north.  Other canopy plant species include red maple, Atlantic white cedar, sweetbay, and slash pine. Some shrubs such as coastal sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia), titi (Cyrilla racemiflora), wax myrtle, and fetterbush and hydrophytic herbs such as goldenclub (Orontium aquaticum) and common arrowhead (Sagittaria latifolia) may be sporadic.  Dome swamp  Occurs within upland pine and sandhills forming small, forested depressions consisting of a canopy of swamp tupelo and some pond cypress in the southern regions.  Other tall shrubs and small trees include myrtle dahoon, swamp bay (Persea palustris), sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), fetterbush, and large gallberry.  Also may contain a clear herbaceous ring around these dome swamps forming an ecotone with the surrounding upland community.  These ecotones are similar to wet prairies. Swamps that have been surrounded by development from agricultural and sivicultural activities generally lack the wet prairie ecotone edge, potentially smothered by sediment from forest roads.  Depression marsh  Occurs in upland pine and sandhill communities creating a small, open circular basin dominated by herbaceous vegetation.  An acidic peat layer of sphagnum moss (Sphagnum sp.) may also develop.  Some marshes may have formed from seepage streams that have been dammed.  Seepage stream  Occurs in troughs of high rolling hills and bordered by closed canopy baygall/alluvial forests. These streams typically form the headwaters of many alluvial and blackwater streams and generally have sandy bottoms. Plants are not frequently found in these shallow ground waters that have percolated through deep, sandy, upland soils.  Sources: FDACS, 2013; FNAI, 2010  BRSF = Blackwater River State Forest; TA = tactical area  1  5.8.1.2  Wildlife  2  Florida's Wildlife Management Area (WMA) system is managed by the FWC to sustain the  3  widest possible range of native wildlife in their natural habitats. BRSF consists of four WMAs:  4  Blackwater WMA, the Yellow River WMA, the Blackwater Carr Unit, and the Blackwater Hutton  5  Unit (FFS, 2013b).  6  The FFS and FWC cooperatively maintain 60 acres of permanent wildlife openings and  7  214 acres of planted food plots on BRSF. These areas range from 0.1 to 15.4 acres and are  8  established and maintained in accordance with the FFS State Forest Handbook (FDACS, 2013).  9  The Great Florida Birding Trail passes through BRSF, and many birds can be found such as  10  mourning dove, myrtle warbler,  red-tailed  hawk,  red-headed  woodpecker (Melanerpes  1 erythrocephalus), and the Carolina wren (FWC, 2013a).  Hunting is allowed in designated areas 2 throughout BRSF. Game animals include deer, wild hog, turkey, gray squirrel, quail, raccoon, 3 bobcat, waterfowl, crow, and dove, among others (FDACS, 2013). 4 5.8.1.3 Protected Species Three federally listed endangered species are found within BRSF, the red-cockaded 6 woodpecker (Picoides borealis) (RCW), the reticulated flatwoods salamander (Ambystoma 7 bishopi) and the Choctaw bean mussel (Villosa choctawensis). The longleaf pine ecosystem of 8 BRSF provides the perfect habitat for the RCW. With the implementation of the Recovery Plan 9 for the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) (USFWS, 2003), the population of RCWs is recovering, with over 90 active clusters which includes 89 potential breeding pairs 11 documented on BRSF (Gault, 2013). Nesting season occurs between April and July. One 12 population of reticulated flatwoods salamander has been previously documented breeding 13 on a single pond in the Yellow River Ravines TA (TA-9). However, this species has not been 14 recently found in BRSF (FDACS, 2013). The Choctaw bean and critical habitat for this species are found in TA-9 within the Yellow River. 16 There are several federally listed threatened species. One federally listed threatened species 17 on BRSF is the eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon couperi). Habitat for this species seems to be 18 good within BRSF, however, the eastern indigo snake has not been found on BRSF for many 19 years (FDACS, 2013). Three mussels, the narrow pigtoe (Fusconia escambia), southern sandshell (Hamiota australis) and fuzzy pigtoe (Pleurobema strodeanum), and their critical 21 habitat are found in TA-9 in the Yellow River. 22 One state-listed threatened species on BRSF is the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus). 23 The gopher tortoise is associated mainly with sandhill habitat. They dig deep burrows for 24 shelter and forage on low-growing plants. Nesting occurs during May and June, and hatching occurs from August through September (FWC, 2001). 26 The Gulf sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrhinchus destoi), another federally listed threatened species, 27 can be found in several rivers throughout Florida and spends the major part of the year in 28 freshwater, migrating to saltwater in the fall. Movement from the Gulf of Mexico and upriver 29 movement generally occur between February and April when spawning season occurs, while downriver movement occurs between September and November. 31 The bald eagle has been federally delisted due to its recovery; however, it is afforded 32 protection under the BEPA.  In August 2012, FWC removed the Florida black bear from the 33 state-threatened species list; however, the species is protected under the Florida Black Bear 34 Conservation Rule [Florida Administrative Code (FAC) 68A-4.009].  Potential impacts from the Proposed Action to federally listed species require the Air Force to consult with the USFWS 36 regarding impacts to federally protected species.  The Air Force has conducted Endangered 37 Species Act Section 7 consultation with the USFWS for this Proposed Action, and the USFWS 38 has concurred with the Air Force determination that it may affect but is not likely to adversely 39 affect endangered species (USFWS, 2014).  Table 5-38 includes all federally listed and state-listed species known to occur or with the potential to occur within BRSF. Some bird and 41 wildlife species have the potential to occur throughout several TAs within BRSF, depending 42 on habitat associations and feeding habits. Plant species with a recorded occurrence within a 43 particular TA are noted as confirmed in Table 5-38. 1 Table 5-38.

Longleaf pine communities provide habitats for many plants and 4 animals, including many classified as endangered, threatened, or species of special concern 1  (SSC). This ecosystem once covered over 90 million acres in the southeastern U.S., and now  2  less than 3 million acres remain (FDACS, 2013). Longleaf pine–wiregrass flatwoods and slash  3  pine flatwoods terrestrial habitat is crucial for the recovery of the RCW and the reticulated  4  flatwoods salamander. Conservation of wetlands and ponds is also crucial for the reticulated  5  flatwoods salamander to breed.  See Section 5.7.1, Water Resources – Affected Environment, for  6  information on wetlands, floodplains, and other bodies of water throughout BRSF that are  7  important habitat areas for the conservation of protected species.  8  Red-cockaded woodpeckers require open pine woodlands and savannahs with large old  9  pines for nesting and roosting habitat. Red-cockaded woodpeckers excavate cavities in live  10  pines; these cavities constitute a critical resource. Longleaf pine is a preferred tree species for  11  cavity excavation, because it produces a long-lasting resin that creates an effective barrier  12  against climbing snakes (USFWS, 2003). Table 5-39 lists documented RCW tree cavities of an  13  active, inactive, or unknown status and are differentiated in Figure 5-31 through Figure 5-40  14  (which depict water and biological resources at BRSF).  15  Other sensitive habitats include gopher tortoise burrows. Both the tortoise and its burrow are  16  protected under state law. Gopher tortoises share these burrows with more than 360 other  17  species, such as the federally threatened eastern indigo snake. The gopher tortoise is  18  associated with sandhill habitat and well-drained uplands with associated wetlands  19  (FWC, 2001).  Gopher burrows on BRSF are mainly found in the northwestern area of BRSF,  20  TA-1, and the southwestern region of TA-9.  21  Critical habitat for the Gulf sturgeon habitat is found outside the southern area of BRSF  22  adjacent to TA-8 and TA-9 in the Blackwater River and the Yellow River, respectively.  23  Additionally, critical habitat for the reticulated flatwoods salamander is found outside of BRSF,  24  southwest and adjacent to TA-8 and within and adjacent to the southern region of TA-9.  As  25  stated previously, reticulated flatwoods salamander was previously documented on a single  26  breeding pond in BRSF (TA-9), however, this species has not been recently found breeding in  27  this area. Critical habitat for the four species of mussel listed in Table 5-38 is found in the  28  Yellow River along the boundary of TA-9.  29  Pitcher plant bogs, typically located within seepage slopes, are found scattered throughout  30  BRSF.  They occur in isolated depressions of somewhat poorly drained soils.  Steps are taken  31  to preserve and protect these areas because they contain a high diversity of rare plant species  32  (FDACS, 2013).  33  Table 5-39 lists documented sensitive habitats that occur within BRSF.   34  Table 5-39.

Invasive species have the  3  potential to compete with and displace native species. FFS staff conducts surveys and record  4  data into a GIS database, which is updated as new plants are discovered. Some invasive  5  species identified within BRSF include cogon grass (Imperata cylindrical), Chinese tallow  6  (Sapium sebiferum), Japanese climbing fern (Lygodium japonicum), Chinese privet (Ligustrum  7  sinense), Chinese wisteria (Wisteria sinensis), mimosa (Albizia julibrissin), and Japanese  8  honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica).  The invasive species most found on BRSF are cogon grass  9  and Japanese climbing fern, which have spread significantly since Hurricane Ivan (FDACS,  10  2013).  11  Table 5-40 lists the number of documented invasive plant species surveyed. Each  12  documented occurrence or location corresponds to an invasive species point shown on  13  Figure 5-31 through Figure 5-40, which can represent an isolated occurrence or populations  14  of multiple individuals. Invasive species can spread rapidly; however, the FFS continuously  15  monitors and mitigates to control or eradicate invasive species throughout BRSF.  16  In addition to invasive plants, feral hogs (Sus scrofa) are present in some areas of BRSF.  (FWC  17  has issued a feral hog control trapping permit to FFS and encourages removal of this invasive  18  species through trapping and hunting [FDACS, 2013]).  19  Table 5-40.  BRSF TAs with Invasive Species  Source: FNAI, 2011  1.  One occurrence could refer to a single plant, a combination of scattered plants, or clumps surveyed.  20  5.8.2 Environmental Consequences  21  As discussed in Section 3.8, potential adverse impacts to biological resources may occur from  22  dismounted maneuvers, UoEX, and aircraft and AO.  Other proposed action effectors are not  23  addressed in this section.  The general analysis presented in Section 3.8 covers potential  24  impacts to affected environment resources identified in Section 5.8.1.  25  Impact assessment considers implementation of the General Operational Constraints  26  inherent to the Proposed Action as identified in Section 2.5.  These constraints, such as  27  establishment of buffers around sensitive species locations and habitat, serve to minimize  28  potentially adverse impacts and, in some cases, avoid adverse impacts altogether.  Avoidance  29  areas for biological resources are identified in Figure 5-1 through Figure 5-10 and Figure 5-11  30  through Figure 5-20. General Operational Constraints identified in Section 2.5 require that all  31  identified sensitive species locations and habitat would be protected, and aspects of EAFBI  32  13-212 and Eglin AFB sensitive species consultations would be implemented as part of the  33  Proposed Action.  34  Additionally, impact analyses rely heavily on analysis and results as presented in the Interstitial  35  Area Range Final Environmental Assessment Revision 2, Eglin AFB Interstitial Area Biological  36  Opinion, Eglin AFB Red-Cockaded Woodpecker Programmatic Biological Opinion, and the Eglin  Tactical Area  Invasive Species  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  Documented occurrence (number of locations1)  23  7  13  14  7  1  12  1  1  1  AFB Riverine/Estuarine Biological Assessment. These documents analyze potential impacts to  2  resources on the Eglin Range from activities associated with the Proposed Action. The  3  resources addressed are similar to those that occur on BRSF (BRSF is adjacent to the Eglin  4  Range).  Impacts to BRSF biological resources identified in Section 5.8.1 would be the same as  5  those described in Section 3.8.  6  5.8.2.1  Vegetation  7  The Proposed Action would cause adverse impacts to vegetation at BRSF.  Table 5-41 lists  8  impacts to vegetation in each TA.  Impacts are categorized as follows: adverse (yellow) and  9  neutral/no effect (green). Most impacts to vegetation  would  result from  temporary  10  disturbances, such as trampling associated with ground movements, landing of aircraft, or  11  minor ground disturbance, and would be recoverable through natural processes.  12  Table 5-41.  Vegetation Impacts by TA at BRSF  AFB = Air Force Base; BRSF = Blackwater River State Forest; GBS = ground burst simulator; TA = tactical area  13  Potential wildfires resulting from expendables would impact BRSF ecological communities.  14  As noted in Section 5.8.1.1, upland pine is the largest ecological community in BRSF and  15  mainly consists of a longleaf pine/wiregrass ecosystem. Generally, controlled fire can be  16  beneficial to ecological communities and species by maintaining the grassy understory and  17  preventing mid-story encroachment. However, wildfires can damage the habitats of species  18  that rely on these communities. According to the Final Environmental Assessment for the Eglin  19  AFB Integrated Natural Resource Management Plan Activities, Eglin averages 110 wildfires  BLACKWATER RIVER STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014  1  annually, with an average size of 60 acres. The majority of these wildfires are due to mission  2  activities, primarily ordnance and pyrotechnics use (U.S. Air Force, 2013a).  By comparison,  3  BRSF averages 24 wildfires annually, with an average size of 30 acres (FDACS, 2013). Blanks  4  and GBSs are noise-generating expendables that would only be used at two hardened camp  5  sites at BRSF (SRYA Camp and STOP Camp). The potential for wildfires would mainly be due  6  to the use of smoke grenades, which could be used throughout areas at BRSF within the LU-1  7  protection level under fire restrictions identified in Section 2.5. These constraints would  8  reduce the chance of wildfires caused by military activities at BRSF. Additionally, the FFS  9  utilizes a fire management program that includes wildfire prevention, detection and  10  suppression, and prescribed burning that would also help to minimize wildfire potential.  11  5.8.2.2 Wildlife  12  The Proposed Action would potentially cause adverse impacts to wildlife. Table 5-42 lists  13  impacts to wildlife in each TA. Impacts are categorized as follows: adverse (yellow) and  14  neutral/no effect (green). Impacts would be related to temporary disturbances associated  15  with harassment and/or displacement associated with general training activity, minor land  16  disturbances, noise from expendable use, and wildfire potential. Permanent disturbances  17  associated with consumption of wildlife would also adversely impact individual species.  18  However, consumption would be intermittent and recoverable through natural processes  19  and would result in a negligible long-term impact.  20  Table 5-42.  Wildlife Impacts by TA at BRSF  5-56 BLACKWATER RIVER STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014 1  5.8.2.3  Protected Species  2  As discussed in Section 3.8, protected species could be directly impacted by vehicle collisions,  3  land disturbance, and expendables (from wildfire). Further, the effector mechanisms of noise  4  and human activity related to military training are not unlike that of recreational hunting,  5  logging, and other human activities that have been conducted at BRSF for many years. Thus,  6  some species may have acclimated to noise and other disturbances. Vehicles would operate  7  at or under 35 mph on BRSF dirt roads, which should reduce the chance for collision with  8  bears, indigo snakes, or other animals that have been struck by vehicles in the past.  9  Noise-generating expendables (blanks/GBS) would only be used at the two hardened camp  10  sites at BRSF, and these sites are not located near currently documented active RCW cavity  11  trees and most other protected species.  See Figure 5-37 and Figure 5-38.  12  Figure 5-1 through Figure 5-20 show buffer areas where sensitive species occur.   In these  13  buffer areas, training activities would either be restricted  or  limited at point locations.  14  Sections 2.5 and 3.8.4 identify General Operational Constraints and Proposed Resource 15  Specific Mitigations associated with sensitive species.  16  Table 5-43 lists impacts to protected species in each TA. Impacts are categorized as follows:  17  adverse (yellow) and neutral/no effect (green).  Most impacts would be related to temporary  18  disturbances, which would be minimized by avoidance measures.  19  Table 5-43.

Short-term, localized impacts; while unavoidable, potential for occurrence can  be mitigated by distributing educational materials to familiarize personnel with protected species so  that troops can avoid transient species where possible. Additionally, established buffer areas  around protected species habitats would be utilized.  Use of Expendables  Blanks/GBS  Use of Expendables would avoid known protected species locations (Figure 5-1 through Figure  Smoke grenades  5-20). Utilization of blanks and GBSs would be restricted to hardened camp sites, thus minimizing  Other/equipment  potential noise impacts. Potential adverse impacts associated with increased wildfire potential from  utilization of expendables is unavoidable. These impacts are regional in context and long term in  duration. Wildfire potential would be mitigated through implementation of safety requirements and  adherence to BRSF and Eglin AFB wildfire management practices.  Aircraft Operations  Potential adverse impacts associated with noise disturbance. Impacts would be short term,  localized, and mitigated through avoidance of known species locations and associated habitat (see  Figure 5-1 through Figure 5-20), resulting in unavoidable, intermittent impacts to transient species.  However, these impacts would not be considered significant given the context, intensity, and  duration.  Table 5-43.

Additionally, Figure 5-1 through Figure 5-20 show  4  sensitive species constraint areas that include documented RCW cavity trees, pitcher plant  5  bogs, and reticulated flatwoods salamander habitat.   Training activities would either be  6  restricted at point locations or limited in those designated buffer  areas.  Impacts to  7  vegetation, discussed in Section 5.8.2.1, also apply to sensitive habitats at BRSF; however, all  8  known sensitive habitats would be protected to the extent possible during training activities.  9  Sections  2.5 and  3.8.4  identify  General  Operational  Constraints  and  Resource-Specific  10  Mitigations associated with sensitive habitats.  11  Table 5-44 lists impacts to sensitive habitats in each TA. Impacts are categorized as follows:  12  adverse (yellow) and neutral/no effect (green).  13  Table 5-44. Sensitive Habitat Impacts by TA at BRSF  Table 5-44.

Invasive Species Impacts by TA at BRSF, Cont’d AFB = Air Force Base; BRSF = Blackwater River State Forest; GBS = ground burst simulator; TA = tactical area  1  Areas potentially slated for ground-disturbing activities would be surveyed for gopher  2  tortoises, and burrows would be avoided where possible. Burrows that cannot be avoided  3  would be relocated in accordance with FWC guidelines. Additionally, there is a potential for  4  wildfire from expended items to spread into other areas including those with sensitive  5  habitats.  Potential for wildfires to impact active RCW cavity trees would be lower in TA-4,  6  TA-7, and TA-9, as no active RCW cavity trees have been documented in these TAs. The FFS  7  works to prevent impacts to and manage fire-dependent habitats that support protected  8  species through prescribed burning. Impacts from wildfires would be minimized to the extent  9  possible through a program of prevention, response, and coordination with the FFS. Fire  10  suppression activities, such as the use of heavy machinery for fire response, could result in  11  changes to the landscape, localized alterations to hydrology, sedimentation, and direct  12  damage to vegetation.  13  5.8.2.5 Invasive Species  14  As discussed in Section 3.8, the Proposed Action would potentially cause adverse impacts  15  associated with the spread of invasive species resulting from use of expendables and the  16  associated potential for wildfire.

According to records of 21 the Florida Division of Historical Resources 22 (DHR), many of the training areas have been 23 surveyed to some extent for cultural resources 24 (Figure 5-41).  Many of these surveys are either not up to current standards or were focused 26 academic studies and are not comprehensive 27 in nature (DHR, 2013). Appendix F, Cultural 28 Resources, lists surveys conducted on BRSF. 29 Within BRSF, there are 196 archaeological sites ranging in age from twentieth century historic 31 contexts to the Paleo-Indian period (10,000 years before Christ [B.C.]). Of these 196 sites, 111 32 (56.63 percent) are prehistoric, 29 (14.80 percent) are historic, and 2 (1.02 percent) are 33 multicomponent historic and prehistoric.  Due to insufficient information, the cultural or 34 temporal affiliation of 54 sites (27.55 percent) cannot be determined.  Most of the 196 sites have not been evaluated by either the principal investigator or the SHPO as to NRHP 36 eligibility (DHR, 2013).  Appendix F, Cultural Resources, lists sites considered potentially 37 eligible along with those that remain unevaluated. Figure 5-41.  Cultural Resource Survey in BRSF 1 To date, two historic cemeteries have been identified on BRSF; both are located in Training 2 Area 1. The Concord/Simmons Cemetery (8SR00891) was first established in 1888; it is no 3 longer in use but is maintained by the state of Florida.  This cemetery has not been evaluated 4 for NRHP eligibility.  The Sellersville Cemetery (8SR01216) is privately maintained and it is not known whether it currently is in use. This cemetery has not been evaluated for NRHP 6 eligibility (DHR, 2013). Additional information on these cemeteries can be found in 7 Appendix F, Cultural Resources. 8 One NRHP-eligible historic structure is located within the boundaries of BRSF. The Munson 9 Lodge (8SR01029), a vernacular-style structure constructed in 1927, is located within TA-6 (DHR, 2013). 11 To date, no historic districts, TCPs, or SSs have been identified on BRSF (DHR, 2013). 12 5.9.2 Environmental Consequences 13 As discussed in Section 3.9, potential adverse impacts to cultural resources may occur from 14 land disturbance activities, dismounted movements, and AO due to ground disturbance. Other Proposed Action effectors are not addressed in this section.  Impacts to BRSF cultural 16 resources identified in Section 5.9.1 would be the same as those described in Section 3.9, that 17 is, potential disturbance or inadvertent discovery of previously unidentified cultural resources 18 in both surveyed and unsurveyed areas.  Ground-disturbing activities would be limited in 19 unsurveyed areas, and known cultural resource locations would be avoided as part of general operations constraints (see Section 2.5).  The Air Force has notified the ACHP, SHPO, and 21 applicable Native American tribes about this Proposed Action. The Air Force is completing a 22 Programmatic Agreement  to meet its requirements under Section 106 of the NHPA. The final 23 Programmatic Agreement and results of the consultation process will be included in 24 Appendix C of the Final EIS. 5.9.3 Cultural Resources Impact Summary 26 Table 3-37 describes the context, intensity, and duration factors utilized in analysis for 27 impacts to cultural resources. Based on the 36 CFR Section 800.5 definitions of “adverse 28 effect” and “no effect,” the Air Force has determined there is the potential for adverse effects 29 to cultural resources.  Implementation of the General Operational Constraints identified in Section 2.5 would minimize the potential for negative effects. In addition, units would have 31 access to a database and maps that would provide spatial and textual information on 32 restrictions associated with specific training areas.  These tools would allow units quick access 33 to information on avoidance areas, thus minimizing the potential for impacts to cultural 34 resources. Table 5-47 summarizes the impacts.

More detail regarding land use types and management practices at BRSF can 3 be found in the Five Year Management Plan for Blackwater River State Forest. 4 Recreational Opportunities 5 Several recreational areas are present at BRSF (Table 5-49). The major recreation areas include 6 Bear Lake Recreation Area, Bone Creek Recreational Area, Camp Paquette, Coldwater 7 Recreation Area, Hurricane Lake Recreation Area, Karick Lake Recreation Area, and the Krul 8 Recreation Area. These recreation areas provide opportunities for camping swimming, 9 picnicking, hiking, canoeing, fishing, horseback riding, and mountain biking as well as other 10 activities permitted in Florida state forests. BRSF also contains three separate WMAs including 11 the Blackwater WMA, the Blackwater Carr Unit, and the Blackwater Hutton Unit. These WMAs 12 provide opportunities for hunting, horseback riding, wildlife viewing, cycling, canoeing, 13 and fishing.

Other proposed action effectors are not 5 addressed in this section.  Impacts to BRSF land uses identified in Section 5.10.1 would be the 6 same as those described in Section 3.10. 7 5.10.3 Land Use Impact Summary 8 Table 3-41 describes the context, intensity, and duration factors utilized in analysis for 9 impacts to land use; based on these factors the Air Force has identified insignificant land use 10 impacts to public health and safety and the human environment. Temporary annoyance to 11 transient recreational users from noise during training activities (see Noise Sections 3.3 and 12 5.3) is unavoidable.  Impacts to other recreational users and adjacent landowners would be 13 minimized through implementation of operational constraints identified in Section 2.5, and 14 avoidance of noise-sensitive areas (see Figure 5-11 through Figure 5-20).  15 Minor, short-term small-scale closures of areas (HLZs/DZs, road segments) during training 16 activities would not preclude use of the forest and access would be allowed once training 17 activities have ceased. The STOP Camp and SRYA site are currently not open to the public, 18 and this would not change if the Air Force utilizes these locations.  No conflicts with hunters 19 have been identified since day-time training activities would be restricted during hunting 20 season.  While the impacts are adverse, the quality of the recreational experience may be 21 somewhat diminished by these impacts, this would not preclude recreational use or cause 22 general incompatibility, and impacts would be short term.  23 Table 5-51 summarizes the impacts identified.

These activities  18  include  swimming, canoeing, hiking, fishing, hunting,  nature  study, off-road bicycling,  19  horseback riding, picnicking, and camping.   In addition, BRSF also manages a number of  BLACKWATER RIVER STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014 1 developed recreation areas with conveniences such as dining halls, boat ramps, horse stables, 2 flush toilets, running water, picnic tables, and grills. 3 The Forestry Center maintains approximately 600 miles of main forest roads, along with a 4 nearly equal amount of administrative roads and trails as well as 90 bridges throughout the 5 forest.  This road system provides for public access, supports management activities, and 6 provides residents with access to their property (FFS, 2000).  More information on recreational 7 activities can be found in Section 5.10, Land Use. 8 Environmental Justice 9 Table 5-52 lists the percentages of minority, 10 low-income, and youth populations compared 11 with the community of comparison (COC) 12 populations.  The COC values represent the 13 percentages of minority and low-income 14 populations within a geographic extent 15 representing the ROI.  Locations where the 16 countywide percentages, or area of concern 17 (AOC) percentages, are greater than the 18 statewide percentages, or COC percentages, 19 are identified as having potential EJ concerns.  20 As indicated in Table 5-52 and Figure 5-43, the 21 individual counties and the two-county ROI 22 have a lower percentage of minority and low-income populations than the state and the 23 nation.  Okaloosa County and Santa Rosa County have a higher percentage of youth 24 populations than the state but lower than the nation.  Noise-sensitive locations, such as 25 schools and childcare centers, are not located on BRSF; however, there are many recreational 26 sites located throughout the forest that could be considered noise-sensitive locations. 27 Table 5-52.

American Community Survey, 5-year estimate, 2007–2011  28  5.11.2 Environmental Consequences  29  As discussed in Section 3.11, potential adverse impacts to socioeconomic resources may  30  occur from safety issues associated with wildfire and land use incompatibility associated with  31  noise resulting from UoEX and aircraft operations.   Other proposed action effectors are not  32  addressed in this section.   Impacts to BRSF socioeconomic and environmental justice  33  resources identified in Section 5.11.1 would be the same as those described in Section 3.11.  1 Recreation and Tourism 2 As described in Section 2.5, scheduling for training activities would constrain the time, 3 frequency, and types of activities to avoid conflicts with hunters, campers, boaters, and other 4 recreational users.  Some transient recreational users, such as hikers, may be annoyed by 5 noise from aircraft operations. 6 Environmental Justice and Special Risks to Children 7 As described previously, there would be no significant impact to populations from noise and 8 safety hazards associated with the Proposed Action.  Additionally, no other significant 9 impacts for this action have been identified that would impact environmental justice or pose 10 special risks to children. 11 5.11.3 Socioeconomics/Environmental Justice Impact Summary 12 Socioeconomic and environmental justice impacts are tied to those related to noise (Sections 13 3.3 and 5.3), safety (Sections 3.4 and 5.4) and land use (Sections 3.10 and 5.10).  Table 3-44 14 describes the context, intensity, and duration factors utilized in analysis for socioeconomic 15 and environmental justice impacts; based on these factors the Air Force has identified 16 insignificant impacts to these resource areas and public health and safety and the human 17 environment in general.  18 Table 5-53 summarizes the impacts identified.  Impacts are categorized as follows: 19 • Adverse (yellow) 20 • Neutral/no effect (green) 21 Table 5-53.

The only exceptions are the  8  Molino, Youngstown, and White City sites. At these locations, personnel would perform  9  limited maintenance of vehicles and equipment, primarily consisting of oil and fluid changes.  10  Consequently, hazardous materials stored at these sites include small quantities (55-gallon  11  containers or smaller) of lubricating oil, hydraulic fluid, antifreeze, solvents, and paints.  12  Wastes generated would include waste and solvents.  All materials and wastes would be  13  managed according to established FFS requirements. These requirements include the use of  14  secondary containment and the availability of spill response equipment.  15  Additionally, the affected environment would comprise FFS requirements regarding the use  16  and management of hazardous materials and wastes.  17  5.12.2 Environmental Consequences  18  As discussed in Section 3.12.3, no adverse impacts to public health and safety and the human  19  and natural environment associated with solid and hazardous material or waste would occur  20  from training activities. All activities would comply with applicable federal, state, and local  21  regulations.  As a result, this resource area is not discussed further in this chapter.  22  5.13 INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION  23  5.13.1 Affected Environment  24  Based on the limited interaction between training activities and utilities and transportation  25  resources, discussion of the affected environment for infrastructure at BRSF is general in  26  nature.  BLACKWATER RIVER STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014  1  5.13.1.1 Utilities  2  Due to the size of BRSF and the existence of a significant acreage of private inholdings,  3  numerous utility corridors (i.e., power lines, gas pipelines) are found within the Forest (BRSF,  4  2013).  Additionally, most of the developed recreation area campsites have electricity, water,  and flush toilets. The STOP Camp and SRYA sites also have available electricity, water, and  6  natural gas. Wastewater at these sites is handled via septic tank.  7  5.13.1.2 Transportation  8  The local and regional road network between Eglin AFB/Hurlburt Field and the BRSF is well  9  developed.  The key transportation routes include State Road (SR) 85, U.S. Highway (US) 90,  and SR 4.  From Eglin AFB, SR 85 is a four-lane route north to Crestview where it intersects  11  US 90. From Crestview west, US 90 is a four-lane divided route that transitions to two lanes  12  just east of the Yellow River.  SR 4 intersects with US 90 just west of the Yellow River and is a  13  two-lane road that cuts through the middle of BRSF.  PJ Adams Parkway/Antioch Road is  14  available as a by-pass around downtown Crestview, running from SR 85 to US 90. Numerous  developed and undeveloped roads are located within BRSF.  16  5.13.2 Environmental Consequences  17  As discussed in Section 3.13.2, no adverse impacts to public health and safety or the human  18  and natural environment associated with utilities usage or use of transportation resources  19  would occur from training activities. All activities would comply with applicable federal, state,  and local regulations.  As a result, this resource area is not discussed further in this chapter.  21 5.14 BLACKWATER RIVER STATE FOREST IMPACT SUMMARY 22 Table 5-54 provides a summary of impact determinations associated with training activities, 23 for potentially affected resources based on analyses presented in Chapter 3, Sections 3.2 24 through 3.13, and Chapter 5, Sections 5.2 through 5.13.

TATE’S HELL STATE FOREST AFFECTED 2 ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES 3  6.1 INTRODUCTION  4  This chapter addresses the receptors identified in Chapter 3 (the Affected Environment)  specific to THSF and the impacts (the Environmental Consequences) on those receptors by  6  the various effectors associated with the Proposed Action.  As discussed in Chapter 3,  7  Section 3.14, some resource areas would experience no interaction with this activity, or  8  general impact analyses in Sections 3.2–3.13 have shown that there would be negligible or no  9  impacts to a specified resource area, despite the site-specific nature of the resources.  Additionally, in some cases the general analyses provided in Chapter 3 are sufficient to  11  determine the extent of impacts on site-specific resources in that the general analysis is  12  applied to the site-specific resources identified as the affected environment.  13  As noted in previous chapters, analyses rely heavily on previous NEPA documentation for  14  similar activities within similar environments; these documents are incorporated by reference  in certain sections where applicable, and are noted. Finally, the affected environment  16  discussions provide information regarding the types of resources present; however, to avoid  17  encyclopedic repetition of publicly available information the reader is directed to locations  18  outside this document for such information should the reader desire it.  As an example, the  19  fact that sensitive species are present on THSF is addressed and types, quantities and  locations (where applicable and allowed by law) are described.  However, as discussion of  21  each individual species in terms of physical description and foraging/reproductive aspects are  22  encyclopedic and readily available from various sources, the reader is directed to a location  23  (e.g., the USFWS or FNAI website) for this information.  This is in keeping with 40 CFR  24  requirements.  Training activity impact analyses consider the General Operational Constraints provided in  26  Section 2.5. These are based on the establishment of the Protection Levels identified in  27  Table 2-24 as well as the noise protection levels resulting from impact analysis in Section 3.3  28  and presented in Table 2-25.  The following Figure 6-1 through Figure 6-11 provide graphical  29  representation of the protection levels for ground operations at THSF as a whole, and for each  individual tactical area.  Figure 6-12 through Figure 6-22 provide similar information for noise 31  generating activities at THSF.  Each map is a “clickable” thumbnail image that will provide full 32  screen viewing; each map is also available for full-page printing in Appendix A.  Figure 6-1.

As is the case with BRSF,  7  Jacksonville ARTCC manages air traffic while en route and RAPCON/TRACON facilities take  8  over management responsibility for aircraft in their respective terminal areas.  1 6.2.1.1 Military Training Airspace 2 THSF underlies Tyndall E and G 3 MOAs (see Figure 6-23).  Tyndall E 4 MOA has a floor altitude of 300 5 feet AGL while Tyndall G MOA 6 has a floor altitude of 1,000 feet 7 AGL.  Both MOAs have a ceiling 8 altitude up to but not including 9 18,000 feet MSL. MOA usage is 10 intermittent between sunrise and 11 sunset Monday through Friday. 12 The Tyndall MOAs are expected 13 to be used for approximately 14 5,000 sorties per year in calendar 15 year 2014 (U.S. Air Force, 2011a). Both MOAs are managed by the 325 OSS/OSOS at Tyndall 16 AFB, Florida. 17 6.2.1.2 Airfields and Transiting Aircraft 18 Airfields located in or near THSF are listed in Table 6-2 with the approximate number of 19 airfield operations flown per year currently.  The locations of the airfields are shown in 20 Figure 6-23.  Apalachicola, the busiest of the airports near THSF, supports 24,347 airfield 21 operations per year.  The other airports support fewer operations.  Class E Airspace associated 22 with Carrabelle Thompson Airport extends to 5 NM from the airport and to altitudes of 23 1,500 feet AGL. This airspace overlies a portion of THSF. 24 Table 6-2. Airfields Near THSF Figure 6-23.  Special Use Airspace Units and Airfields Approximate  Annual  Airfield  Airfield Name  Operations  Apalachicola Municipal Airport  24,375  Carrabelle-Thompson Airport  524  Saint George Island Airport  500  Wakulla County Airport  5,710  25  The FFS conducts aircraft operations over THSF as part of controlled burns, aerial surveys, and  26  other operations.   The frequency of these flights is variable from one season to the next  27  depending on the number of prescribed burns conducted and other factors. (Colburn, 2013).  28  There are six helispots designated at THSF.  29  6.2.2  Environmental Consequences  30  As discussed in Section 3.2,  airspace management and use would only be potentially  31  adversely affected by aircraft operations.  Other proposed action effectors are not addressed  32  in this section.  1  Several of the GLI training event types would include or consist entirely of aircraft operations.  2  As many as nine sorties per annual average day could be conducted over THSF, and each  3  sortie would include up to four aircraft. Section 2.3 describes types of GLI training events,  4  including the expected frequency of occurrence.  GLI training would operate in compliance  with all federal aviation regulations and would not require segregation from nonparticipating  6  aircraft.  No new SUA or modifications to existing SUA would be required.  Existing non-SUA  7  airspace boundaries would not need to be altered to support proposed GLI training.  8  6.2.2.1 Scheduling/Coordination  9  THSF is overlain by Tyndall E and G MOAs.  The floor altitude of Tyndall G MOA is 300 feet AGL,  and GLI training would occur frequently above this altitude.  Tyndall G MOA has a floor  11  altitude of 1,000 feet AGL, and fewer GLI aircraft operations would be expected to require use  12  of this airspace volume.  Coordination with the 325 Operational Support Squadron, the  13  agency managing the Tyndall MOAs, would be conducted prior to use of the MOAs when the  14  MOAs are active.  The MOAs are not active after sunset, which is when approximately 50  percent of GLI training would take place.  16  As discussed in Sections 1.3 and 1.4, scheduling concerns at the Eglin Range would be  17  reduced as a result of the Proposed Action.  This is because the Proposed Action would  18  relocate nonhazardous training operations from the Eglin Range, thereby allowing continued  19  growth in the testing and training missions conducted there.  A new process would be implemented by which the Air Force would coordinate GLI training  21  missions with THSF to ensure de-confliction with forest activities. This coordination would be  22  a new process.  23  6.2.2.2 Efficiency of Ongoing Operations  24  Tyndall MOAs are used much less frequently than other MOAs in the region (U.S. Air Force,  2011a).  As mentioned previously, about 50 percent of GLI training is expected to take place  26  after dark.  The Tyndall MOAs are activated only intermittently between sunrise and sunset.  27  An incremental increase in the usage rate of Tyndall E and G would not be expected to result  28  in scheduling conflicts that would reduce the efficiency of ongoing operations.  29  GLI training would be conducted primarily in Class G uncontrolled airspace.  All participating  and nonparticipating aircraft would operate using see-and-avoid procedures.  Any GLI aircraft  31  operations entering Carrabelle Thompson Airport Class E airspace would not be expected to  32  overwhelm the capacity of the airport, which currently conducts about 524 airfield operations  33  annually (less than two per day).  34  Air Force staff would coordinate with THSF POCs to ensure that the efficiency of ongoing FFS  would not be negatively affected by GLI training.  So long as the coordination is carried out in  36  accordance with the proposed agreement between the Air Force and FFS, no conflicts  37  between the operations of the two organizations should occur.  38  6.2.3 Airspace Impact Summary  39  Table 3-4 describes the context, intensity, and duration factors utilized in analysis for impacts  to airspace; based on these factors the Air Force has identified insignificant adverse impacts  1 to public safety and the human environment. Overall, impacts to airspace management 2 would be moderate.  Impacts would be regional, affecting Eglin Range as well as the airspace 3 above THSF, and long term, with the increase in air traffic tempo lasting as long as GLI 4 training continues.  Impacts would include both positive impacts (i.e., reduced scheduling 5 conflicts at Eglin Range) and negative impacts (i.e., increased air traffic in controlled and 6 uncontrolled airspace over THSF).  Although the number of sorties using Tyndall MOAs would 7 be expected to increase, about 50 percent of GLI training operations would occur after sunset 8 when the Tyndall MOAs are not active.  Implementation of a coordination process between 9 the Air Force and FFS would avoid potential operational conflicts that otherwise could have 10 been considered severe impacts.  Impacts to other ongoing operations would be expected to 11 be minor as other operations could continue to transit the area normally while GLI training is 12 under way. 13 Table 6-3 summarizes the impacts identified.  Impacts are categorized as follows: 14 • Adverse (yellow) 15 • Neutral/no effect (green) 16 Table 6-3.

The Tyndall MOAs located above THSF are used for  26  approximately 5,000 sorties per year.  These sorties are primarily conducted by F-22 and T-38  27  aircraft based at Tyndall AFB. Although the floor altitude of Tyndall E and G MOAs are 300  28  feet AGL and 1,000 feet AGL, respectively, F-22 and T-38 aircraft operate at higher altitudes.  29  Table 6-4 lists individual overflight noise levels for F-22 and T-38C aircraft.

SEL Under the Flight Track for Aircraft Commonly Operating Above THSF  TATE’S HELL STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014  1  6.3.2 Environmental Consequences  2  As discussed in Section 3.3, adverse impacts may potentially occur from UoEX and aircraft  3  operations. Other proposed action effectors are not addressed in this section.  4  Aircraft and ground vehicles would follow variable routes to and from training locations in the  state forest.  Aircraft en route typically operate at or above 500 feet AGL unless operating  6  within existing special use airspace.  Areas outside the state forest would occasionally  7  experience aircraft and surface vehicle noise at levels listed in Table 3-9 and Table 3-13  8  generated by vehicles en route.  However, because routing would vary from one training  9  mission to the next, overflight/pass-by of any given location would be infrequent, and noise  impacts outside the state forests would be minimal.  11  6.3.2.1 Aircraft Operations  12  At THSF, as many as nine sorties per annual average day would be conducted as part of LAPT,  13  LLHI/E, AD, A/LVL, and OHO training.  Each training event could include up to four aircraft but  14  would include only one or two aircraft under normal circumstances. The experience of a  person on the ground would be as described in Section 5.3.2.1 for BRSF.  As would be the case  16  at BRSF, about 20 percent of total annual operations would occur at least partially after 10:00  17  PM with the majority of these late-night operations taking place in summer months when the  18  sun sets later.  Operations noise, whether it is generated by a direct overflight or training at a  19  distance, could be disruptive of activities (e.g., conversation, sleeping) and could be  considered annoying.  Several HLZ/DZs would be established, and any given training  21  locations would be used for less than one training event per day on average.  HLZ/DZs would  22  be located at greater than 2,200 feet from known noise-sensitive locations.  Under a  23  conservative set of assumptions, which are described in Section 3.3.3 and in more detail in  24  Appendix H (Section H.3), noise levels exceeding 55 dB DNL would not affect any known  noise-sensitive locations.  Several aircraft currently operating in the airspace above THSF, such  26  as the F-22 and T-38, generate noise levels higher than those typically generated by aircraft  27  that would be involved in GLI training. The aircraft utilized as part of GLI would be of similar  28  type and generate similar noise levels to those listed in Table 6-5.  29  Aircraft maneuvering at THSF would vary flight paths from one mission to the next.  Assuming  less than one hour is spent maneuvering per training event, and using the CH-47D Chinook as  31  a representative noise source for all GLI aircraft, distributed flying operations would generate  32  less than 45 dB DNLmr.  33  Three dirt FWALS would be established at THSF under the Proposed Action; these would be  34  used for practice approaches by light propeller-driven aircraft.  As shown in Figure 2-11  through Figure 2-13, the locations of the proposed FWALS at THSF are geographically remote.  36  Noise levels would not be expected to exceed 55 dB DNL at distances greater than 9,267 feet  37  from the FWALS and would not exceed 65 dB DNL at distances greater than 1,186 feet from  38  the FWALS.  These distances were calculated for a scenario where all proposed LAPT  39  operations occur at a single FWALS and yield a very conservative estimation of impacts.  No known noise-sensitive locations or privately owned parcels of land are located within  41  9,267 feet of the proposed THSF FWALS.  Noise generated by operations at the FWALS may be  42  annoying to transient users that happen to be near the FWALS (e.g., hunters) during  TATE’S HELL STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014 1 operations.  However, overflights of light aircraft would be infrequent, and the noise 2 generated would be similar to that generated by other propeller-driven aircraft noise heard in 3 the area currently. When conditions at the FWALS become less than ideal for training (e.g., 4 when growth of surrounding trees make landing and takeoff unsafe), the FWALS would be replaced.  Replacement FWALS would be selected in geographically remote areas similar to 6 those selected for the initial three proposed THSF FWALS.  New FWALS would not be sited 7 within 9,300 feet of campgrounds or privately owned parcels.  At this distance, noise impacts 8 associated with operations at new FWALS would be expected to be minimal. 9 At THSF there would be about one training event per day on average at HLZs/DZs conducting LLHI/E, AD, and A/LVL once GLI training is at full capacity.  Based on analyses presented in 11 Section 3.3.3, noise levels exceeding 55 dB DNL would not be expected to occur at greater 12 than 200 feet from approach/departure paths and 2,200 feet from the HLZ/DZ.  To avoid 13 excessive annoyance, HLZs/DZs, including run-in paths, should be sited no closer than these 14 distances to known noise-sensitive locations (e.g., campgrounds, privately owned parcels with residences). 16 OHO would take place at surveyed locations in open water at THSF up to once per month. 17 Per Section 3.3.3, individual OHO operations could be annoying to people located nearby.  To 18 mitigate excessive annoyance, OHO hover locations should not be sited within 2,200 feet of 19 known noise-sensitive locations, the same distance applied to HLZs/DZs. 6.3.2.2 Munitions Use 21 At THSF, firing of blank rounds and detonation of ground burst simulators would be 22 permitted anywhere, subject to restrictions described later in this section.  Paintball/plastic 23 pellets and smoke grenades would be used at other locations, but these expendables 24 generate minimal noise.  An estimated 576,000 blank 5.56-mm rounds (8,000 per event), 196,200 blank 7.62-mm rounds (10,000 per event), would be fired annually.  Blank rounds do 26 not fire a bullet and are quieter than live rounds.  Ground burst simulators (GBSs) are 27 designed to sound similar to artillery rounds detonating.  Two to five GBSs would be used per 28 event, for a total of up to 5,172 annually. 29 As described in Army Regulation 200-1, noise-sensitive land uses are discouraged where small arms noise exceeds 87 dB PK 15(met) and strongly discouraged where small arms noise 31 exceeds 104 dB PK 15(met).  Army Regulation 200-1 discourages noise-sensitive land use 32 where large arms noise exceeds 62 dB CDNL and strongly discourages noise-sensitive land 33 uses where large-arms noise exceeds 70 dB CDNL. Table 3-12 lists distances from the training 34 location at which gunfire noise levels drop below these threshold levels.  Noise levels are presented for a location 90 degrees to the right of the direction of firing. For the purposes of 36 analysis, it was assumed that all GBS use would be evenly distributed among two locations at 37 THSF.  In fact, GBS use would be more widely distributed, so that GBS noise would be 38 experienced infrequently at any given location.  Calculated distances to threshold noise levels 39 are conservative estimates of actual noise levels. To minimize adverse levels of noise and annoyance levels, use of noise-generating expendables would be restricted within 4,000 feet 41 of noise-sensitive receptors. 1 6.3.2.3 Ground Vehicle Operations 2 As discussed in Section3.3.3, ground vehicle operations (e.g., CCVM, VSWC, BD, and OFVO) 3 may generate noise that is annoying to people in the state forest or private inholdings, 4 particularly when it occurs at night.  Noise levels generated by two of the loudest vehicles expected to be used during GLI training are listed in Table 3-13.  Ground vehicles used in GLI 6 training would be equipped with exhaust mufflers in compliance with Florida Statutes. 7 Training would occur along roads that are used currently by heavy trucks (e.g., logging trucks) 8 and other traffic.  Noise impacts would be localized to the area where ground vehicles are 9 operating and would be limited to the duration of the training event. 6.3.2.4 Amphibious Operations 11 AO would involve up to six watercraft equipped with motors up to 200 hp.  These boats 12 would generate noise that could be considered disruptive and annoying by people along the 13 banks of the water body being used.  The boats would be of a similar size and engine power 14 to boats currently used on the same water bodies and would not be expected to exceed noise level thresholds established in Florida Statutes. During covert training operations in confined 16 water bodies, full throttle would be expected to be used rarely, limiting the intensity of noise 17 generated. This type of training could occur up to 10 times per year in water bodies where 18 motor-powered boats are currently permitted.  Noise impacts would be expected to be 19 temporary, lasting the duration of the training exercise. 6.3.3 Noise Impact Summary 21 Table 3-7 describes the context, intensity, and duration factors utilized in analysis of impacts 22 to noise receptors; based on these factors the Air Force has identified insignificant adverse 23 noise-related impacts to public health and safety and the human and natural environment. 24 Noise associated with aircraft operations and munitions use would result in annoyance to some recreational users and residences.  However, implementation of operational constraints 26 identified in Section 2.5, as well as Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations identified in the 27 previous analysis, would minimize potential noise annoyance to less than significant and, in 28 most cases, minimize noise to a negligible level.  Noise levels would not be sufficiently intense 29 to result in impacts other than annoyance or disturbance of recreational activities for those people not participating in the training.  People involved in training would wear hearing 31 protection if necessary, as required by DoD regulations.  Activities such as munitions training 32 and aircraft operations are either not regulated or are specifically exempted from local noise 33 regulations.  Ground vehicles and watercraft used during GLI training would be expected to 34 generate noise levels below thresholds established in Florida Statutes. Table 6-6 summarizes the impacts identified.  Impacts are categorized as follows: 36 • Adverse (yellow) 37 • Neutral/no effect (green) TATE’S HELL STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014 1 Table 6-6.

In addition to the mitigations identified in Section 3.3.4, noise-generating expendables would not be used within 4,000 feet of noise-sensitive locations at THSF. This measure would further minimize noise impacts.  8 9 10 11  Figure 6-12 through Figure 6-22 show the areas in which training activities would be restricted based on buffer distances described above and in Section 3.3.4.  Buffers would be established for all privately owned parcels containing at least one residential structure and all campgrounds.  12  6.4 SAFETY  13  6.4.1  Affected Environment  14 15  The affected environment for safety as it relates to proposed activities comprises the policies and procedures currently in place at Eglin AFB, previously discussed in Sections 3.4.2 and  TATE’S HELL STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014  1  3.4.3.   The TFC of the FFS is primarily responsible for prevention, detection, and suppression  2  of wildfires wherever they may occur and to respond to other emergencies.  3  The TFC,  which  encompasses  Leon, Gadsden, Liberty, Wakulla,  Jefferson  and  Franklin  4  Counties, has reported approximately 87 annual average wildfires since January 2010 caused  5  by various sources, such as campfires, debris burning, lightning, and children (Table 6-7).  Of  6  those, only about five on average were caused by equipment/vehicle use (FFS, 2013c).  7  Table 6-7.  Average Wildfires by Cause for THSF  Source: FFS, 2013c  8  To respond to potential fires, TFC has eight forest rangers and four senior forest rangers that  9  are certified wildland firefighters in the THSF area. THSF also has two primary certified  10  wildland firefighter supervisors and an operations administrator. All certified personnel can  11  be utilized for suppressing wildfires on THSF.  12  THSF firefighting equipment includes four John Deere 650 bulldozers (Type 2) with plows and  13  four heavy bulldozers (Types 1 and 2) without plows for wildfire suppression and fire line  14  reinforcement. All bulldozers have an accompanying transport for moving the equipment. In  15  addition, the district has five Type 6 engines available for fire response. Specialized  16  equipment available for wildfire use includes a mechanic truck for field repairs, portable fuel  17  tanks, small water tenders, a backhoe, and various pickups and SUVs.  18  Three facilities are considered primary response locations in the THSF area. The THSF  19  headquarters is located in Carrabelle. The other two sites are tower/office sites. One is located  20  at St. James on the east side of the forest, and the other is East Bay Tower site, located on the  21  west side of the forest.  22  To mitigate wildfire risk, THSF has an aggressive prescribed burning program. Upland forest  23  lands are burned an average of every three to four years. This prevents high accumulations of  24  vegetative fuels that contribute to catastrophic wildfires. THSF prescribe burns roughly 35 to  25  45 thousand acres a year.  26  THSF cooperates with local county, state and Federal resources to suppress wildfires in the  27  local area. Cooperative agreements exist at the state and local level to allow paid and VFDs to  TATE’S HELL STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014 1 assist with wildfire suppression and structure protection. The following fire departments 2 commonly assist with wildfires on THSF: Alligator Point Fire Department, Apalachicola Fire 3 Department, Carrabelle Fire Department, Dog Island Fire Department, East Point Fire 4 Department, Lanark Village Fire Department, and the St. George Island Fire Department. Other surrounding fire departments may assist as needed. 6 FFS also maintains cooperative wildfire assistance agreements with US Forest Service and 7 FWC. Each organization has a variety of conventional or specialized equipment and/or 8 personnel available for significant wildfire incidents on THSF. 9 FFS also has agreements with the Florida Highway Patrol and Florida Department of Transportation to provide road closures and or signage necessary for smoke events on 11 Federal and State highways. 12 FFS monitors weather conditions daily for wildfire planning and burning authorization 13 purposes. It records rainfall at various locations, calculates the National Fire Danger Rating 14 System values daily, and sets fire preparedness levels.  FFS also monitors and estimates the KBDI and FDI for the State of Florida. 16 6.4.2 Environmental Consequences 17 As discussed in Section 3.4, potential adverse impacts may occur from wildfire associated with 18 UoEX.  Other proposed action effectors are not addressed in this section. 19 Impacts to THSF associated with safety would be the same as those described in Section 3.4.  The Proposed Action would not negatively affect the ability to provide for safe operation of 21 aircraft or other equipment, nor would it result in uncontrollable safety hazards to military 22 personnel, the public, or property. Implementation of established procedures, as discussed in 23 Sections 3.4.2 and 3.4.3, would ensure that activities associated with the Proposed Action 24 would not result in significant impacts to safety. At THSF, campfires are only allowed at designated camp sites, which would not be used by 26 training personnel; however, campfires could be used at the hardened camp sites in 27 designated fire pits.  No campfires would be used in the interstitial areas of THSF. To minimize 28 the potential for fires caused by the UoEX and general training activities (such as idling 29 vehicles), before beginning missions, units would obtain the daily fire danger rating and coordinate with FFS personnel to ensure that adequate fire response is available, if needed 31 per General Operational Constraints identified in Section 2.5.  Under Florida law, it is unlawful 32 for any person to set fire to, or cause fire to be set to, any wildlands or to build a campfire or 33 bonfire or to burn trash or other debris within the designated area of a severe drought 34 emergency unless a written permit is obtained from the division or its designated agent. 6.4.3 Safety Impact Summary 36 Table 3-15 describes the context, intensity, and duration factors utilized in analysis for 37 impacts to safety; based on these factors the Air Force has identified insignificant safety38 related impacts to public health and safety and the human and natural environment. The 39 potential for wildfire occurrence associated with training activities could result in adverse impacts.  However, requirements identified in Section 2.5 associated with wildfire prevention 41 and response would minimize the potential for this impact to occur. 1 Table 6-8 summarizes the impacts identified.

However, GBS use would be restricted to hardened camp sites, thus reducing wildfire potential due to low fuel load associated with improved grounds, and the increase in potential wildfires caused by idling vehicles and other equipment would be negligible.  While the risk of wildfire is unavoidable under the Proposed Action, General Operational Constraints, as well as fire management procedures implemented by both Eglin AFB personnel, and the FFS would serve to minimize this potential (see Section 6.4.2). impacts associated with this activity (see impacts associated with this activity (see impacts associated with this activity (see  THSF = Tate’s Hell State Forest; GBS = ground burst simulator; TA = tactical area  5  6.4.4  Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations  6  All constraints and mitigations, mainly associated with wildfire prevention, are identified in  7  Section 3.4.3.   While these constraints and mitigations would minimize the potential for  8  wildfires, the potential for increased wildfire occurrence cannot be completely avoided under  9  the Proposed Action, and the potential for adverse safety impacts to THSF remains.  The  6-18 TATE’S HELL STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014 1  increased potential for wildfire can only be avoided through implementation of the No Action  2  Alternative.  3  6.5 AIR QUALITY  4  6.5.1  Affected Environment  5  THSF is located in Franklin and Liberty Counties in Florida, which are in attainment for all  6  criteria pollutants (USEPA, 2013).   7  Baseline emissions for Franklin and Liberty Counties utilized in this document are presented  8  in Table 6-9.  These emissions data were acquired from the USEPA’s 2008 NEI data for Franklin  9  County (USEPA, 2013).   The county data include emissions data from point sources, area  10  sources, and mobile sources  11  Table 6-9.

Other Proposed Action effectors are not addressed in this section.  16  Emissions from training activities were compared with those of Franklin and Liberty counties  17  to determine the impacts.  While it is likely that air emissions would be distributed between  18  the two counties, it is unknown exactly how this distribution would occur, because it would  19  depend on the location of specific training events.  As a result, air emissions analyses  20  compared the estimated Proposed Action emissions with each county’s baseline emissions, as  21  well as those of the entire ROI (which would include both Franklin and Liberty Counties).  22  Emissions for land disturbance and fugitive dust for each training activity are provided in  23  Section 3.5. These emissions would cause negligible (less than 5 percent of emissions in each  24  county and the ROI) short-term impacts to regional air quality (Table 6-10 and Table 6-11).   Table 6-10.

Table 6-14 summarizes emissions  6  from aircraft operations for the different types of activities.   Aircraft operations would cause  7  short-to medium-term impacts to air emissions in Franklin County.  In particular, NOx and SO2  8  would cause an 8.97 and 3.94 percent increase in air pollutant emissions in Franklin County,  9  and 9.51 and 2.94 percent increase, respectively, in Liberty County (Table 6-14). However, this  10  analysis assumed all activities would occur within a single county.   It is more likely that air  11  emissions would be comparable to those of the entire ROI, because air operations would be  12  distributed between the two counties.  Consequently, aircraft emissions would likely result in  13  an approximate 4.62 percent increase in NOx and a 1.68 percent increase in SO2 air emissions  14  over the two-county area.  Aircraft emissions evaluated based on context, intensity, and  15  duration (see Table 3-18) would not be greater than 10 percent and would not affect either  16  county’s attainment status.  17  Table 6-14.

In summary, training activities would result in small amounts of air 6 emissions when compared with the baseline.  However, these emissions are still within 7 emission standard guidelines and would not adversely impact public health or safety or the 8 human and natural environment. 9 Table 6-16 summarizes the impacts identified.

Discussion focuses  4  on impact assessment resource features and issues identified in Section 3.6, Earth Resources.   5  6.6.1.1 Geologic Resources  6  The following subsections discuss the land-surface form, sensitive karst terrain, and closed  7  depression geologic features of THSF.  8  Land-Surface Form  9  The THSF land-surface form is a component of the Terraced Coastal Lowland, Apalachicola  10  delta complex and primarily consists of low marine terraces created by ocean currents and  11  wave actions when sea levels were higher (USDA, 1994).  The forest lies between the  12  Ochlocknee and Apalachicola Rivers on the deep sedimentary materials of the Apalachicola  13  Embayment.  Much of the Pleistocene epoch sediments are composed of extensive clay layers  14  and graded quartz sand not found elsewhere in northwest Florida (Kindell, 1997).  Land  15  elevations generally range from sea level along the coast to 42 feet above mean sea level on  16  the relict quartz sand dune ridges of the Talbot marine terraces.  Slopes are moderate near  17  the coast and level to nearly level in most other areas of the forest.  18  The low, swampy conditions that characterize much of THSF are a product of the delta  19  formed by the Apalachicola River as it enters Apalachicola Bay and the slowly permeable clay  20  layers that underlie much of the forest (USDA, 1994).  The THSF contains shallow-gradient  21  terraces, low ridges, flats, depressions, swamps, and marshes that often exhibit fluctuating  22  near-surface water tables and/or frequent to occasional flooding (Photo: Tate’s Hell State  23  Forest Typical Land-Surface Form). As a consequence of low elevations and minor relief,  24  runoff is slow and drainage is generally characterized by numerous sluggish tributary drains  25  that are often bounded by wet plains, swamps, and marshes (Mooney and Patrick, 1916).  26  There are no identified commercially mined mineral resources within THSF (USDA, 1994).  1 Sensitive Karst Terrain 2 The areas of sensitive karst terrain occurring on 3 THSF are listed in Table 6-17 and shown in 4 Figure 6-24.

Many THSF landforms exhibit wet soils conditions and 5 are defined as hydric soils (see Section 5.6.1.2).  Approximately 55 percent of the THSF soil 6 series is classified as hydric and about 98 percent of the forest land area is designated as 7 hydric; for all TAs, the percent hydric soils was 90 percent and greater.  The highest 8 concentration of nonhydric areas is the Psamments soil suborder along the marine terrace 9 coastline in High Bluff (TA-10) (Table 6-20 and Figure 6-26).

Total area does not include borrow pits, water, urban lands, Aquents, gullied lands, and  other variants.  6  Soil Erosion  7  Because of the relatively flat terrain (see Section 6.6.1.1), THSF is considered to have a  8  generally low susceptibility to  soil erosion.   Other  than  natural coastal  erosion  and  9  accelerated erosion of some unpaved roads and crossings, THSF has no known major soil  10  erosion problems (FDACS, 2007).  11  Erodible Soils  12  There are no known highly erodible or potentially highly erodible soils at THSF.  13  Natural Soil Erosion Sources  14  Steepheads  15  There are no known steepheads at THSF.  16  Streambanks  17  No evidence of overheightened and oversteeped THSF streambanks was identified.  It is  18  estimated that these conditions are less likely to occur within the forest because of the  19  relatively flat terrain and subsequently lower stream gradients.  TATE’S HELL STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014 1 Gulf Coastline Erosion 2 Beach erosion (shoreline retreat) and sediment 3 accretion (shoreline advance) are ongoing 4 natural processes along the approximately 5 4,820 feet of the High Bluff tactical area (TA-10) 6 that borders the Gulf of Mexico coastline (Figure 7 6-24). 8 Accelerated Soil Erosion Sources 9 Borrow Pits 10 There are no known active borrow pits located at 11 THSF. 12 Unpaved Roads and Crossings 13 The THSF unpaved road network primarily consists of maintained primary, secondary, and 14 tertiary roads; about 55 percent of unpaved roads are classified as dirt tertiary (Figure 6-27) 15 and Table 6-22).  THSF dirt roads are primarily surfaces with imported clayey materials. Rock 16 roads are of crushed limestone or gravel (Photo: THSF Crushed Limestone Tertiary Road), and 17 sand roads are surfaced with native soils (Photo: THSF Sand Tertiary Road). 18 Table 6-22.

Potential crossings include bridges, culverts, and low water crossings.  A 3 discussion of the environmental effects of unpaved roads and crossings is provided in Section 4 5.6.1.2, Soil Erosion.  THSF has developed a road plan (FDACS, Division of Forestry, 2007) 5 outlining road removal, road bridge and low water crossing upgrades and maintenance 6 activities, and updates to the forest road network database to promote a comprehensive road 7 network maintenance program.  Planned unpaved road and crossing activities to restore 8 hydrology will include installation of culverts, low water crossings, and roadside ditch plugs 9 and/or reshaping of road surfaces.

Road shoulders are maintained by tandem 15 roller drum chopping, followed by harrowing and 16 finish grading. The long-term goal is to maintain 17 road shoulder on primary and secondary unpaved 18 roads using tractor mowers (FDACS, 2007).  Unpaved 19 roads maintenance is conducted in compliance with 20 the forest road standards described in the Road and 21 Bridge Plan (FDACS Division of Forestry [DOF] Policies 22 and Procedures 500.108) and silviculture BMPs 23 manual (FDACS, 2008) developed by FDACS, 24 Department of Forestry for each state forest (FDACS, 25 2007). 26 6.6.2 Environmental Consequences 27 As discussed in Section 3.6.3, potential adverse 28 impacts to earth resources may occur from land 29 development activities, use of wheeled vehicles and 30 dismounted movement, and aircraft and AO.  Other 31 proposed action effectors are not addressed in this THSF Crushed Limestone Tertiary Road 32 section. (Photo by Greg Kesler) TATE’S HELL STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014 1 6.6.2.1 Land Disturbance 2 As discussed in Section 3.6.3, use of HLZs/DZs, point impacts, consumption, and incidental 3 land disturbance would have no adverse impact on soils.  Impacts to THSF earth resources 4 identified in Section 6.6.1 would generally be the same as those described in Section 3.6. 5 Fixed-Wing Aircraft Landing Sites 6 The three proposed FWALS would utilize existing unpaved roads in Juniper Creek (TA-2), 7 Picketts Bay (TA-6), and Deep Creek (TA-8) (see Section 2.3.2.2 and Figure 2-11 through 8 Figure 2-13).  The FWALS requirements and analysis impact scenarios for THSF would be the 9 same as those presented for BRSF FWALS landings in Section 3.6.3. 10 Of particular importance to this analysis is the dominance of nearly level terrain, hydric soils, 11 and wetland ecosystems (see Sections 6.6.1.1 and 6.6.1.2), and the potential for sensitive karst 12 terrain (Section 6.6.1.1).  As shown in Table 6-24, the majority of soils at all proposed FWALS 13 locations are hydric. 14 Table 6-24.  THSF Proposed FWALS Soils 15 THSF level to near-level slopes generally minimize the potential for soils to erode and 16 transport sediments.  However, the extent and distribution of wetlands throughout the forest 17 increases the potentials for on-site erosion and sedimentation to intersect and be transported 18 by waterways and impact off-site aquatic ecosystem habitats and water quality. Utilization of 19 erosion control BMPs during roadway improvements for fixed-wing aircraft landings, as 20 outlined in Sections 3.7 and 3.8, would serve to minimize potential sedimentation issues. 21 Hydric soils are characterized by extended periods of surface and/or near-surface saturation 22 by flooding and/or water table fluctuations. These wet conditions are when soils are most 23 prone to physical damage from mechanical compaction and rutting.  Soil physical damage 24 would most likely occur during FWALS improvements and clear zone maintenance activities. 25 Extensive soil damage is not prone to remediation by natural means and normally requires 26 mechanical intervention.  The potential inclusion of roadside hydric soils areas for the TA-2, 27 TA-6, and TA-8 FWALS landing zones would result in dredge and fill operations that may 28 require federal and state permits (see Section 3.7).  However, as noted under LU-1 conditions, 29 fixed-wing aircraft landings in these areas may only occur on roadways that do not require 30 extensive improvements.  Additionally, zone maintenance would not be conducted by the Air 31 Force, but would occur as part of normal forest management processes. 32 There is also the potential for proposed FWALS within TA-2 and TA-6 to affect subsurface karst 33 features.  The possible excavation of existing unpaved road materials to establish the required TATE’S HELL STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014  1  landing zone subgrade and surface course could damage or disrupt underlying karst features.  2  Impacts to karst geology could compromise the loading capacity and stability of affected  3  landing zones.  4  With the implementation of Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations (see Section 3.6.4),  5  potential earth resource impacts associated with THSF FWALS construction and landings at  6  the proposed TA-2, TA-6, and TA-8 are anticipated to be adverse but insignificant, site 7  specific, of low intensity, and short-term duration. No loss or degradation of prime farmland  8  or closed depression features is anticipated.  9  Table 6-25 summarizes soil suitability ratings for landing zones of proposed FWALS at THSF.  10  Table 6-25.

Based on information provided in Section 3.6, THSF temporary low-and  16  moderate-use camp site suitability and  limitation  constraint areas  are summarized  in  17  Table 6-26 and Figure 6-28.   THSF tactical area lands were rated as somewhat limited or very  18  limited for bivouac suitability.  Limitations would be less restrictive on sites for tents or  19  remote camps.   Areas identified as very limited would not be suitable for bivouacking.  20  Bivouac constraint areas are summarized in Table 6-26 and depicted in Figure 6-28.  21  Table 6-26.

Steepheads and closed depressions represent locations where 6 steep slopes and sustained wet soil conditions 7 are sensitive to soil disturbances from troop 8 movements.  These would mostly likely occur 9 during dismounted maneuvers. As discussed in Section 3.6, no adverse impacts 11 to off-road areas would occur from wheeled 12 vehicles. Proposed use of unpaved roads and 13 crossings could degrade and destabilize 14 unpaved road soil or aggregate surfaces, which could increase soil erosion and sedimentation.  However, the proposed mission frequency as 16 identified in Chapter 2 would likely not exceed the carrying capacity of available unpaved 17 roads or be greater than the current level of vehicle use. Vehicles traversing low-water 18 crossings could destabilize road approach slopes and increase soil erosion.  Generally, the 19 potential sources of sediment are limited to the portions of the road in immediate contact with the water course and the distance of road slopes from the gradient crest to the stream. 21 Driving through a stream also mobilizes streambed sediments. 22 However, implementation of General Operational Constraints identified in Section 2.5, along 23 with implementation of Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations in Section 3.6.4, would serve 24 to minimize impacts to earth resources. 6.6.2.3 Aircraft Operations 26 The proposed THSF aircraft operations detailed below include FWALS landings, HLZ/DZ 27 landings, and FARP/HGO.  FWALS landings and HLZ/DZ landings may occur within LU-1 and 28 LU-2 areas, while FARP/HGO may only occur in LU-2 areas on asphalt or concrete. All activities 29 must adhere to noted general and Proposed Resource-Specific Constraints and mitigations identified in Sections 2.5 and 3.6.4, respectively. FARP/HGO and other fueling activities were 31 previously discussed in Section 3.6, and no adverse impacts were identified. 32 Prominent earth resources at THSF that exhibit characteristics potentially sensitive to HLZ/DZ 33 landings include sensitive karst areas, closed depressions, and hydric soils. Hydric soils 34 compose 98 percent of THSF, and sensitive karst areas make up 55 percent.  Because of the low, relatively flat terrain and extent of hydric soils and sensitive karst areas, most areas of 36 THSF could be affected by landing/takeoff activities.  Rutting damage to wet soils would likely 37 be greatest in Ultisol and Inceptisol soils, which tend to have higher amounts of silt and/or 38 clay in the topsoil, as well as Histosols, which have high amounts of organic matter.  The 39 depth of soil damage during landings could exceed 10 inches. Figure 6-28.  THSF Bivouac Constraint Areas 1 In karst areas, near-surface limestone solution pipes or caverns could be breached or 2 otherwise damaged by landing wheels.  Since surface indicators of susceptible solution pipes 3 or caverns are usually absent, it is assumed these formations could be present within all 4 affected TAs where karst occurs. Closed depressions are often early indicators of karst 5 sinkhole formation.  As with wet hydric soils, the contact point footprints would affect a small 6 area and the infrequent occurrences and distribution of aircraft landing events at various 7 THSF locations would minimize repetitive 8 impacts. 9 Based on analyses presented in Section 3.6, THSF 10 HLZ suitability and limitation constraint areas are 11 summarized in Table 6-27 and Figure 6-29.  Very 12 limited areas fall under the LU-1 category and 13 would be limited in use for HLZs/DZs. 14 Again, with the implementation of mitigations 15 specific to earth resources (see Section 3.6.4), 16 potential soil erosion, compaction, and rutting 17 impacts from proposed FWALS landings and 18 HLZ/DZ use at THSF are anticipated to be adverse 19 but insignificant, site-specific, low intensity, and 20 short term because HLZs and FWALS would be rotated over time. No loss or degradation of 21 prime farmland, karst soils, geologic steephead, or closed depression features is anticipated. 22 Since no disturbance of wetlands is proposed within the estimated footprint area, federal or 23 state wetland permits are not required. 24 Table 6-27.

As discussed in Section 3.6, AO could disturb soils and 3 trample vegetation, resulting in conditions that may result in accelerated bank erosion. 4 AO could destabilize streambanks and significantly increase soil loss and streambank retreat. 5 On streambanks and shorelines with established vegetation and stable grades (not 6 overheightened or oversteepened), impacts would consist of minor disturbances that, in 7 most cases, would naturally recover.  Operations conducted at boat launches would not likely 8 increase streambank degradation or soil loss. 9 Implementation of General Operational Constraints and Proposed Resource-Specific 10 Mitigations, such as rotation of ingress/egress locations, would serve to minimize impacts to 11 earth. 12 6.6.3 Earth Resources Impact Summary 13 Table 3-27 describes the context, intensity, and duration factors utilized for impacts to earth 14 resources; based on these factors the Air Force has not identified insignificant adverse 15 impacts to the natural environment.  In summary, there are unavoidable adverse impacts 16 associated with minor soil erosion resulting from roadway improvements for fixed-wing 17 aircraft landings, HLZ/DZ use, ground movement, and AO. No NPDES permitting 18 requirements have been identified.  The intensity of these impacts is minimized through 19 implementation of General Operational Constraints and Proposed Resource-Specific 20 Mitigations identified in Sections 2.5 and 3.6.4, respectively. 21 Table 6-28 provides a summary of the impacts identified.  Impacts are categorized as follows: 22 • Adverse (yellow) 23 • Neutral/no effect (green) 24 Table 6-28.  Earth Resource Impacts Summary by TA – THSF Table 6-28.

All General Operational Constraints (Section 2.5) and  4  Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations (Section 3.6.4) identified previously would sufficiently  5  minimize any identified adverse impacts (yellow), mitigating them to beneficial or no effect  6  (green).  7  6.7 WATER RESOURCES  8  6.7.1  Affected Environment  9  Water resources at THSF include the watersheds of Ochlockonee River, New River and  10  Whiskey George Creek, the Floridan aquifer, and extensive areas of wetlands and floodplains  11  throughout the area.  12  6.7.1.1  Surface Waters  13  THSF includes portions of three major watersheds:   the Ochlockonee River, New River, and  14  Whiskey George Creek (part of the Apalachicola River basin) (FDEP, 2001; FDEP, 2002).   The  15  eastern portion of THSF is part of the Ochlockonee River watershed; Crooked Creek is a major  16  tributary of this watershed.   The New River basin is the largest watershed in THSF.  The  17  tributaries that feed the New River include Juniper Creek (northeast of the New River), Gator  18  Creek, Gully Branch, Trout Creek, Nero Branch, and an unnamed creek. The New River merges  TATE’S HELL STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014 1 with the Crooked River to form the Carrabelle River and discharges into St. George Sound. 2 Southwest of the Carrabelle River, runoff from some coastal areas of THSF discharges directly 3 into St. George Sound.   Whiskey George Creek is located west of New River, east of the 4 Apalachicola River.  Tributaries to Whiskey George Creek include Juniper Creek and Doyle 5 Creek.  Whiskey George Creek drains into the West Bayou of East Bay, which is part of 6 Apalachicola Bay. FDEP classifies portions of the Ochlockonee River as an OWF. Several 7 streams in THSF are listed as impaired by FDEP.  Table 6-29 lists impaired waters in the THSF 8 and the impairment classification for each. 9 Since 1994, NWFWMD and FFS began acquiring the THSF property with the goal of restoring 10 historical ecological communities and surface water drainage patterns to improve the quality 11 of surface water discharged to the Apalachicola Bay system and surrounding waters 12 (NWFWMD–FFS, 2010a; NWFWMD–FFS, 2010b). NWFWMD and FFS share responsibility for 13 restoring and protecting THSF’s hydrology and ecosystems. The overall goals of hydrologic 14 restoration at THSF are to: 15 • Improve the water quality of surface water flows and runoff discharged to East Bay, 16 Apalachicola Bay, and surrounding waters. 17 • Restore historical surface water drainage patterns. 18 • Enhance wetland hydrology and function. 19 • Restore a mix of native ecological communities. 20 Table 6-29.

There are 181,476 acres of  23  wetlands at THSF, including nearly 179,949 acres of palustrine or freshwater wetlands, 1,300  24  acres of estuarine wetlands, 44 acres of lacustrine wetlands, and 183 acres of riverine  25  wetlands (Table 6-30). Palustrine or freshwater wetlands include forested wetlands, scrub 26  shrub wetlands, emergent wetlands, and ponds.

These constraints, such as establishment of buffers around sensitive 2 water resource locations and habitats, would minimize potentially adverse impacts and, in 3 some cases, avoid adverse impacts altogether.  Avoidance areas for water resources are 4 identified in Figure 6-1 through Figure 6-11. 5 6.7.2.1 Water Resource Protection Levels 6 Water resource protection levels were defined based on current environmental management 7 requirements at Eglin AFB (EAFBI 13-212; U.S. Air Force, 2012). Water resources fall within the 8 LU-1 protection level as described in Section 5.1 and shown in Figure 6-1 through Figure 6-11 9 as solid yellow. The LU-1 protection level would affect all surface water bodies (streams, 10 ponds, and lakes), wetlands, and floodplains and a 100-foot buffer zone around these 11 resources.  No land disturbance would be permitted outside of previously disturbed roadbeds 12 and road shoulders. Dismounted maneuvers and AO would be allowed, but concentrated 13 troop movements would not be allowed on steep slopes, streambanks/shorelines, and 14 wetlands. Pyrotechnic use in wetlands at THSF would be limited only to star clusters. 15 Wheeled vehicle use would be restricted to existing, approved roads and trails in each TA. 16 Wheeled vehicle use of stream and wetland crossings would be restricted to FFS-identified 17 crossings at THSF.  Data on stream and wetland crossing conditions for THSF are unavailable 18 from the FFS.  For purposes of analysis, each crossing was assumed to be in fair condition; 19 however, prior to use the Air Force would coordinate with the FFS to evaluate each crossing 20 and determine its relative condition to determine whether the crossing is “good,” fair,” or 21 “poor.” Vehicle access would be prohibited at stream and wetland crossings rated in poor 22 condition. Table 6-32 summarizes the stream and wetland crossings at each TA at THSF, while 23 Figure 6-1 through Figure 6-11 show their locations. Each crossing is shown in light blue. 24 Table 6-32.

These  restrictions  in  each  TA  range  from  12,975  acres  to  31,207  acres  28  (95.95 percent to 99.92 percent of each TA).  Figure 6-1 through Figure 6-11 provide more  29  detailed views of water resource avoidance areas in each TA at THSF.

Vehicle use would be restricted to existing roads and trails and approved, existing crossing locations in streams and wetlands. Wheeled vehicle activities could indirectly affect water resources at THSF. Routine use of the existing dirt road network at THSF that extends throughout the TAs is a regular contributor to roadway erosion, and a recognized problem affecting some streams and wetlands (FDOF, 2000). Leaks of fuel and other vehicle fluids would also be a potential indirect source of contamination to water resources as described under land improvement effects. Some indirect effects to water resources from roadway erosion are likely and assumed to occur. While the potential for these occurrences are inherent to vehicle use (whether for the military, the FFS, or civilians) and unavoidable, implementation of standard vehicle maintenance and spill prevention SOPs would minimize the potential for occurrence to a negligible level. Dismounted Movements Dismounted troop movement could impact surface water and wetland resources in all TAs at THSF.  Potential effects would be direct but minor.  Rotation of any stream or water body ingress/egress areas would minimize the potential for any medium-to long-term impacts associated with shoreline erosion, and units would be advised to avoid any noticeably eroded shorelines. Over the short term, sediments in the fast-flowing streams typical of those found at THSF would settle rapidly and water clarity would return, causing the streams to return to their former state once units move out of the area. 6.7.2.3 Amphibious Operations AO could impact surface waters and wetland resources in TA-10 (High Bluff) at THSF.  As discussed in Section 3.7, AO could result in disturbance of streambeds and shorelines from the loading and unloading of watercraft and movement of watercraft on the surface waters, as well as ingress/egress of troops over the land/water interface as discussed in detail in the Riverine/Estuarine Programmatic Environmental Assessment (U.S. Air Force, 2004).  AO would adhere to the General Operational Constraints and mitigations identified in Section 2.6 associated with EAFBI 13-212, Section 7.2.9.  Impacts to water resources would be minimized to levels less than significant by limiting activity to designated landing zones and rotating landing zones when these areas show signs of erosion.  Fuel could be released from watercraft to surface waters, however, this is inherent to watercraft use (whether military or civilian).  Such potential for adverse impacts are minimized to a negligible level by implementation of SOPs for watercraft maintenance and spill prevention procedures, as identified in Section 3.12. 6.7.3 Water Resources Impact Summary Table 3-32 describes the context, intensity, and duration factors utilized in analysis for impacts to water resources; based on these factors the Air Force has identified insignificant adverse impacts to water resources.  In summary, there are unavoidable, direct, adverse impacts to wetlands from ISDs associated with ground movement and AO.  However, these impacts would be minimized through implementation of General Operational Constraints TATE’S HELL STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014 1 and Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations identified in Section 2.5 and 3.7.4, respectively. 2 Water quality impacts would not be expected to impact public health or safety. No USACE 3 Section 404 permitting requirements have been identified. 4 Table 6-34 summarizes the impacts identified.

However, while wheeled vehicles would be required to utilize  existing and approved roadways and water and wetland crossings, unavoidable adverse impacts to  surface waters and wetlands may occur from wheeled vehicles at water/wetland crossings. Minor  impacts may be associated with indirect impacts from oil drips, etc., from vehicles. Mitigations to  prevent environmental damage, as described in Section 3.7.4, include use of only stream crossings  rated “good” or “fair” for training exercises and avoiding use of crossings rated “poor.” Leaks of  vehicle fluids would be mitigated through proper vehicle maintenance and spill kits for field use.  Implementation of these mitigations and constraints would minimize the potential for impacts from  “yellow” to “green” by decreasing the potential for vehicle interaction with degraded resources and  the potential for any spills to occur.  Dismounted  Floodplains would not be affected. There is a potential for localized disturbance to shoreline and  movement  wetland vegetation (e.g., trampling) from personnel.  This would be minor and recoverable over the  short term. Implementation of general and activity-specific operational constraints and mitigations as  described in Section 2.6 (such as frequently rotating tactical area use and minimizing unit size) would  result in reduction of adverse impacts from “yellow” to “green” by minimizing the potential for  excessive trampling and allowing natural recovery processes.  Use of Expendables  Blanks/GBS  The Air Force has not identified any adverse water resource impacts associated with these activities  Smoke grenades  (see Section 3.7).  Other/equipment  Aircraft Operations  The Air Force has not identified any adverse water resource impacts associated with these activities  (see Section 3.7).  Amphibious  Floodplains would not be affected.

Activities in estuarine areas could affect wetlands, as could water-land  transition actions. These impacts would be adverse, but they would be localized and recoverable  over the short term under natural processes. Implementation of general and activity-specific  operational constraints and mitigations as described in Section 2.6 (such as using only designated  ingress/egress points and rotating water/land transition areas) would result in reduction of adverse  impacts from “yellow” to “green” by minimizing the potential for erosion, allowing natural recovery  processes.  Utilities  The Air Force has not identified any adverse water resource impacts associated with these activities  (see Section 3.7).  TATE’S HELL STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014  1  6.7.4  Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations  2  The  USFWS, as part  of the  ESA Section  7  consultation  process  (USFWS, 2014), has  3  recommended the following conservation measure: avoidance of “Good” and “Poor” rated  4  vehicle water crossings for training use in order to protect the better crossing sites and  5  minimize further degradation of the sites in poor condition.  6  No additional Resource-Specific Mitigations for water resources have been identified.

Figure 6-31 through  13  Figure 6-40 provide more detailed views of biological resources in each TA at THSF.  14  6.8.1.1  Vegetation  15  Descriptions of vegetation within THSF are based on ecological community categories used  16  by the Florida Natural Area Inventory and the FFS.  Table 6-35 lists representative vegetation  17  species within each ecological community.  18  Table 6-35.  Ecological Communities Within THSF  Community  Description  Sand pine scrub  Occurs on well-drained soils on relict coastal dune ridges. Sand pine (Pinus clausa choctawhatchee) dominates the canopy. Other species include shrubs such as myrtle oak (Quercus myrtifolia), sand live oak (Quercus geminata), saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), and Florida rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides), and lichens are common groundcover.  Most sand pine scrub areas in THSF are undisturbed.  Mesic flatwoods  Occurs on moderately drained sandy soils. Most natural areas of mesic flatwoods in THSF were converted to stands of slash pine plantation, but restoration efforts to reestablish the historical longleaf pine are under way. Other plant species included a low dense groundcover of wiregrass (Aristida stricta), Florida dropseed (Sporobolus floridanus) bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum), saw palmetto, and other low shrubs and grasses.   Wet/mesic flatwoods  Occur on poorly drained soils.  Most natural areas of wet/mesic flatwoods have been converted to planted pine. Fire suppression has allowed titi shrubs to establish a dense mid-story, which under natural conditions would not exist. Wet/mesic flatwoods naturally have a widely spaced canopy of slash, pond, or longleaf pine and a grassy or shrubby understory consisting of titi (Cliftonia monophylla and Cyrilla racemiflora), sweet gallberry (Ilex coriacea), bitter gallberry (Ilex gabra), and St. John’s wort (Hypericum spp.). Groundcover species include wiregrass, beakrushes (Rhynchospora spp.), panic grasses (Panicum spp.), nutrushes (Sceleria spp.), and sundews (Drosera spp.).  Wet savannas  Occur on poorly drained soils.  Serve as transition areas between wet flatwoods and deciduous or mixed forested wetlands.  Grassy open areas with few trees. Seasonally saturated and often contain rare plants such as pitcher plants (Sarracenia spp.), dew-threads (Drosera tracyi), and grass-pink orchids (Calopogon spp.).  In THSF, most of these areas were converted to slash pine plantation. The Florida Division of Forestry has begun restoring wet savannahs through a program of thinning planted pines, applying prescribed burns, and re-creating historical drainage patterns.  Wet savanna – cypress flats  Occurs on poorly drained soils.  Savanna-type habitats with widely separated pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) and slash pine with a shrub/small cypress mid-story.  Fire suppression fosters growth and  Table 6-35.  Ecological Communities Within THSF, Cont’d Community  Description  invasion and domination of titi and other shrubs.  Forest road and ditch removal and reestablishment of historical drainage patterns are measures employed to restore this habitat type.  Basin swamps/shrub and mixed forested wetlands  A mix of wetland types that occur on poorly drained soils and in depressional features of low topography. May be inundated at times throughout the year. Mixed pond cypress—titi forests, shrub wetlands, Atlantic White Cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) swamps, black gum (Nyssa biflora)—bay forests, slash pine/cypress/bay swamps, and other mixtures of canopy trees and shrubs are common. Fire suppression has led to natural vegetation becoming dense and overgrown.  Shrub wetlands  Occur on poorly drained soils. Dominated by black titi (Cliftonia monophylla), white titi (Cyrilla racemiflora), and gallberry. Overgrowth results without fire suppression. Large areas of remnant shrub wetlands are found east of State Road 67 in THSF.  Deciduous  Occur on poorly drained soil, with standing water present for much of the year. Includes cypress sloughs,  forested  dwarf cypress swamps, riverine bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) swamps, and smaller forested wetlands  wetlands  having canopies of pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens), red maple (Acer rubrum), tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera), or black gum.  Dwarf cypress trees are unique due to their stunted height of only 15 feet; however, they can live more than 300 years.  Marshes  Water present usually year-round, fluctuating with tidal or rainfall cycles. Associated with lower reaches of New, Carabelle, and Crooked Rivers and Whiskey George and Cash Creeks; also present as isolated marshes within THSF.  May be fresh or brackish. Typical vegetation of riverine marshes includes sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), black needle rush (Juncus roemerianus), and salt cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora). Typical vegetation in isolated freshwater marshes includes grasses, rushes, sedges, herbaceous plants, and floating aquatics.  Source: FNAI, 2010; FDACS, 2007  THSF = Tate’s Hell State Forest  1  6.8.1.2 Wildlife  2  THSF is a WMA. Its game species are regulated and managed by the FWC. In addition to  3  protected wildlife species discussed in Section 6.8.1.3, THSF support numerous other wildlife  4  species, including mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. Mammals include raccoons  5  (Procyon lotor), coyotes (Canis latrans), river otters (Lutra canadensis), and white-tailed deer  6  (Odocoileus virginianus).  Birds include eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris),  7  several species of sparrows, raptors, wading birds, and ducks (FWC, 2013b). In the fall and  8  winter, almost 90 different migratory bird species may visit THSF (NWFWMD-FFS, 2010a;  9  NWFWMD-FFS, 2010b).  Migratory birds are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16  10  USC 703–712) and EO 913186. A migratory bird is defined by the USFWS as any species or  11  family of birds that lives, reproduces, or migrates within or across international borders at  12  some point during the annual life cycle. Federal agencies are to integrate bird conservation  13  principles, measures, and practices into agency activities and avoid or minimize adverse  14  impacts on migratory bird resources. Also, federal agencies must notify the USFWS in advance  15  of conducting an action that is intended to take migratory birds. The American alligator  16  (Alligator mississippiensis) and Florida cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus conanti) are  17  notable reptiles.  Amphibians include frogs, toads, and salamanders.  There are several apiary  18  (bee-keeping) operations throughout THSF. Table 6-36 lists known apiary operations  19  associated with the tactical areas.  Table 6-36.

Additionally, the bald eagle is afforded  5  protection under the BEPA, and bottlenose dolphins, which occur in waters adjacent to TA-10,  6  have federal protection under the MMPA.   Potential impacts from the Proposed Action to  7  federally listed species would require the Air Force to consult with the USFWS, who would  8  then decide whether to issue a biological opinion with terms and conditions for minimizing  9  impacts to federally protected species.  As there is a low potential for amphibious operations  10  to adversely interact with bottlenose dolphins, a consultation with the National Marine  11  Fisheries Service (NMFS) would not be required. All federally listed and state-listed species  12  known to occur or with the potential to occur within THSF are provided in Table 6-37. Some  13  bird and wildlife species have the potential to occur throughout several TAs within THSF,  14  depending  on  habitat associations and feeding habits. Plant species with  a  recorded  15  occurrence within a particular TA are noted as confirmed in Table 6-37.   16  Table 6-37.

Other proposed action effectors are not 11 addressed in this section.  The general analysis presented in Section 3.8 covers potential 12 impacts to affected environment resources identified in Section 6.8.1. 13 Impact assessment considers implementation of the General Operational Constraints 14 inherent to the Proposed Action as identified in Section 2.5.  These constraints, such as 15 establishment of buffers around sensitive species locations and habitat, serve to minimize 16 potentially adverse impacts and, in some cases, avoid adverse impacts altogether.  Avoidance 17 areas for biological resources are identified in Figure 6-1 through Figure 6-11 and Figure 6-12 18 through Figure 6-22.

However,  4  wildfires can damage the habitats of species that rely on these communities. According to  5  the Final Environmental Assessment for the Eglin AFB Integrated Natural Resource Management  6  Plan Activities, Eglin averages 110 wildfires annually, with an average size of 60 acres; the  7  majority of these wildfires are due to mission activities, primarily ordnance and pyrotechnics  8  use (U.S. Air Force, 2013a).  By comparison, THSF averages four wildfires annually, with an  9  average size of 40 acres (FDACS, 2007). The FFS utilizes a fire management program that  10  includes wildfire prevention, detection and suppression, and prescribed burning. Adherence  11  to FFS and Eglin fire management procedures as outlined in Section 2.5 would serve to  12  minimize wildfire occurrence.  As a result the Air Force does not consider this potential to be  13  significant.  14  6.8.2.2 Wildlife  15  The Proposed Action would potentially cause adverse impacts to wildlife, including migratory  16  birds. Because military readiness activities are exempt from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act,  17  except in cases where significant adverse impacts to a population are likely, the Proposed  18  Action is exempt from incidental takes to migratory birds. A consultation with the USFWS  19  associated with migratory birds is not required. Table 6-41 lists impacts to wildlife in each TA.  20  Impacts are categorized as follows: adverse (yellow) and neutral/no effect (green). Impacts  21  would be related to temporary disturbances associated with harassment and/or displacement  22  associated with general training activity, minor land disturbances, and wildfire potential.  23  Permanent disturbances associated with consumption of wildlife would also adversely impact  24  individual species.  However, consumption would be intermittent and recoverable through  25  natural processes and would result in a negligible long-term impact.  26  Table 6-41.

Further, the effector mechanisms of noise and human activity related to  5  military training are not unlike that of recreational hunting, logging, and other human  6  activities that have been conducted at THSF for many years. Thus, some species may have  7  acclimated to noise and other disturbances. Vehicles would operate at or under 35 mph on  8  THSF dirt roads, which should reduce the chance for collision with bears, indigo snakes, or  9  other animals that have been struck by vehicles in the past.  10  AO in TA 10 would move through Gulf sturgeon critical habitat, but the activities would not  11  alter or disturb this species or its habitat.  Usage of the water areas for AO and landings would  12  be similar to current recreational and commercial use, which have no effect on Gulf sturgeon.  13  Noise-generating expendables (blanks/GBS) would be used throughout THSF with exception  14  of noise constraint areas identified in Figure 6-12 through Figure 6-22.   15  Figure 6-1 through Figure 6-11 show buffer areas where sensitive species occur.  In these  16  buffer areas, training activities would either be restricted or limited at point locations.  17  Sections 2.5 and 3.8.4 identify General Operational Constraints and Proposed Resource 18  Specific Mitigations associated with sensitive species.  19  Table 6-42 lists impacts to protected species in each TA.

Protected Species Impacts by TA at THSF 2  6.8.2.4  Sensitive Habitats  3  Sensitive habitats with the potential to be impacted by the Proposed Action are shown  4  in Figure  6-30  and discussed in  Section  6.8.1.4.   Impacts to vegetation,  discussed  in  5  Section 6.8.2.1, may be applied to sensitive habitats in THSF; however, all known sensitive  6  habitats would be protected to the extent possible during training activities. Areas slated for  7  ground-disturbing activities would be surveyed for gopher tortoises and burrows would be  8  avoided where possible; burrows that cannot be avoided would be relocated in accordance  9  with FWC guidelines.  Additionally, expended items could start wildfires that spread into  10  other areas including those with sensitive habitats.  Given that some protected and rare plant  11  species within THSF have been noted to be declining, there is potential for localized long- 1  term impacts.  The FFS works to prevent impacts to and manage fire-dependent habitats that  2  support protected species through a program of prescribed burning. Impacts from wildfires  3  would be minimized to the extent possible through a program of prevention, response, and  4  coordination with the FFS. Fire suppression activities, such as the use of heavy machinery for  5  fire response, could result in changes to the landscape, localized alterations to hydrology,  6  sedimentation, and direct damage to vegetation.  Parts of the land-water interface of TA-10  7  border critical habitat for the wintering population of the piping plover.  Piping plover are  8  especially susceptible to human disturbance.

There are unavoidable adverse impacts to 9 biological resources from incidental disturbances associated with dismounted maneuvers 10 and aircraft and AO.  Direct unavoidable impacts have also been identified from increased 11 wildfire potential resulting from training activities.  The intensity of any of the identified 12 impacts would be minimized through implementation of General Operational Constraints 13 and Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations identified in Sections 2.5 and 3.8.4, respectively. 14 The Air Force completed consultation with USFWS in accordance with Section 7 of the ESA on 15 April 8, 2014, and has received concurrence on a finding of “Not Likely to Adversely Affect” 16 sensitive species or habitat (USFWS, 2014).

Archaeological surveys 6 have been conducted in many of the Training 7 Areas (Figure 6-41).  Many of these surveys, 8 are either not up to current scientific 9 standards or were more focused academic studies and are not comprehensive in nature 11 (DHR, 2013). Appendix F, Cultural Resources, 12 lists surveys conducted on THSF. 13 Within THSF, there are 35 archaeological sites 14 ranging in age from twentieth century historic contexts to the Early Archaic period (7,500 B.C.).  Of these 35 sites, 13 (37.14 percent) 16 are prehistoric, 17 (48.58 percent) are historic, and 3 (8.57 percent) are multicomponent 17 historic and prehistoric.  Due to insufficient information, the cultural or temporal affiliation of 18 two sites (5.71 percent) cannot be determined.  Most of the 35 sites have not been evaluated 19 by either the principal investigator or the SHPO as to NRHP eligibility (DHR, 2013). Appendix F, Cultural Resources, lists sites considered potentially eligible along with those that remain 21 unevaluated. 22 One historic district, Camp Gordon Johnson (8FR00900), formerly occupied the eastern half of 23 THSF. Starting in 1942, the U.S. Army bought or leased approximately 159,000 acres to 24 establish an amphibious training base for World War II recruits. At its height, Camp Gordon Johnston was Florida's second largest military installation, both in size and troops.  The camp 26 spanned over 20 miles along the Gulf Coast between Carabelle and Alligator Point and 27 included St. George and Dog Islands. Originally called Camp Carabelle, the site was officially 28 renamed Camp Gordon Johnston in January 1943.  By 1944, the camp was also being used to 29 house German and Italian prisoners of war (Hathaway et al., 2000). Soon after World War II ended in 1945, the camp was closed. Structural remains and 31 foundations (both above and below ground) were identified in only 3 of 22 surveyed areas. 32 Military-related artifacts, including a dog tag, glass sherds, and a variety of metal fragments, 33 were recorded for a portion of the survey area. Other structural remains included radio tower 34 footers and concrete and brick building foundations.  This historic site was identified during background research and further examined during fieldwork (Hathaway et al., 2000). 36 Evaluative testing is recommended to determine NRHP eligibility. 37 One historic cemetery has been identified in TA-3.  The Thompson Cemetery (8FR00873) was 38 a family cemetery established in 1813.  It is currently no longer in use but is maintained by the 39 state of Florida (DHR, 2013). To date, no historic structures, TCPs, or SSs have been identified to date within THSF (DHR, 2013). Figure 6-41.  Cultural Resource Survey in THSF TATE’S HELL STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014 1 6.9.2 Environmental Consequences 2 As discussed in Section 3.9, potential adverse impacts to cultural resources may occur from 3 land disturbance activities, dismounted movement, and AO due to ground disturbance. 4 Other Proposed Action effectors are not addressed in this section.  Impacts to THSF cultural 5 resources identified in Section 6.9.1 would be the same as those described in Section 3.9 and 6 consist of potential disturbance or inadvertent discovery of previously unidentified cultural 7 resources in both surveyed and unsurveyed areas. Ground disturbing activities would be 8 limited in unsurveyed areas, and known cultural resource locations would be avoided as part 9 of general operations constraints (see Section 2.5).  The Air Force has notified the ACHP, 10 Florida SHPO, and applicable Native American tribes about this Proposed Action. The Air 11 Force is completing a Programmatic Agreement to meet its requirements under Section 106 12 of the NHPA.  The final Programmatic Agreement and results of the consultation process will 13 be included in Appendix C of the Final EIS. 14 6.9.3 Cultural Resources Impact Summary 15 Table 3-37 describes the context, intensity, and duration factors utilized in analysis for 16 impacts to cultural resources. Based on the 36 CFR Section 800.5 definitions of “adverse 17 effect” and “no effect,” the Air Force has determined there is the potential for adverse effects 18 to cultural resources.  Implementation of the General Operational Constraints identified in 19 Section 2.5 would minimize the potential for negative effects.  In addition, units would have 20 access to a database and maps that would provide spatial and textual information on 21 restrictions associated with specific training areas.  These tools would allow units quick access 22 to information on avoidance areas, thus minimizing the potential for impacts to cultural 23 resources. 24 Table 6-46 summarizes the impacts identified. Impacts are categorized as follows: 25 • Adverse (yellow) 26 • No effect (green) 27 Table 6-46.  Cultural Resource Impacts Summary by TA at THSF Table 6-46.

All  3  General  Operational  Constraints  (Section  2.5)  identified  previously would  sufficiently  4  minimize any identified adverse impacts (yellow), mitigating them to beneficial or no effect  5  (green).  6  6.10 LAND USE  7  6.10.1 Affected Environment  8  Existing and planned land uses at THSF include  9  rangeland,  forested,  urban/built  up,  and  10  wetlands (FDEP, 2007b). Figure 6-42 shows the  11  various land  use types,  recreational areas,  12  private parcels, and special use areas at THSF.  13  Table  6-47  lists the number,  acreage,  and  14  percent of land use types, recreation areas, and  15  privately held parcels present in each TA at  16  THSF  (TA-1  through  TA-10).  More  detail  17  regarding land use types and management  18  practices at THSF can be found in the Ten Year  19  Management Plan for Tate’s Hell State Forest.  Figure 6-42.

Table 6-48 lists the recreational areas in each TA). See Figure 6-42 for specific  6  locations of recreational areas at THSF (FDACS, 2004b).  7  Table 6-48.

Temporary 7 annoyance to transient recreational users from noise during training activities (see Noise 8 Sections 3.3 and 6.3) is unavoidable.  Impacts to other recreational users and adjacent 9 landowners would be minimized through implementation of operational constraints 10 identified in Section 2.5, and avoidance of noise-sensitive areas (see Figure 6-12 through 11 Figure 6-22). Minor, short-term, small-scale closures of areas (HLZs/DZs, road segments) 12 during training activities would not preclude use of the forest, and access would be allowed 13 once training activities have ceased.  No conflicts with hunters have been identified, since 14 day-time training activities would be restricted during hunting season. While the impacts are 15 adverse, the quality of the recreational experience may be somewhat diminished by these 16 impacts, but this would not preclude recreational use or cause general incompatibility, and 17 impacts would be short term. 18 Table 6-50 summarizes the impacts identified.  Impacts are categorized as follows: 19 • Adverse (yellow) • Neutral/no effect (green) 20 Table 6-50.  Land Use Impacts Summary by TA at THSF Proposed Action  Tactical Area  Effector  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  Land Disturbance  Land development  The Air Force has not identified any adverse impacts to land use associated with these activities (see  Point impact  Section 3.10).  Incidental surface disturbance  Consumption  Ground Movement  Wheeled vehicles  The Air Force has not identified any adverse impacts to land use associated with these activities (see  Dismounted movement  Section 3.10).  Use of Expendables  Blanks/GBS  Noise-generating expendables would be restricted near noise-sensitive locations (see Figure 6-12  Smoke grenades  through Figure 6-22).  Measures would be taken to minimize noise impacts, but occasional low-level  Other/equipment  temporary noise impacts to recreational users and adjacent landowners could occur.  Aircraft Operations  Although measures such as restrictions regarding the timing and location of aircraft operations (see  Figure 6-12 through Figure 6-22) would minimize noise impacts to recreational users and adjacent  landowners, occasional lowlevel temporary noise impacts could occur.  Amphibious  The Air Force has not identified any adverse impacts to land use associated with these activities (see  Operations  Section 3.10).  2  6.10.4 Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations  3  No additional Resource-Specific Mitigations for land use have been identified.   All General  4  Operational Constraints (Section 2.5) identified previously, as well as Proposed Resource 5  Specific Mitigations identified for noise (Section 3.3.4) would sufficiently minimize any  6  identified adverse impacts.  7  6.11 SOCIOECONOMICS/ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE  8  6.11.1 Affected Environment  9  The main concerns regarding socioeconomic and environmental justice resources include  10  noise, safety, and disturbance associated with the military land and air training that could  11  potentially impact recreation and tourism and environmental justice–related populations.  12  Socioeconomic resources associated with THSF are concentrated in Liberty County and  13  Franklin County, Florida, which constitutes the ROI for the analysis.  14  There are several privately owned parcels and state-owned parcels dispersed throughout  15  THSF.   The majority of the private properties are located on the southern end of the forest  16  between Eastpoint and Carrabelle and are being developed for residential and vacation  17  homes (FDACS, 2007). There are two adjacent parcels located on the eastern side of the forest  18  for the purpose of mining operations.   There are no residents permanently stationed on  19  federal property, but on-site housing at THSF could be considered and established if  20  approved by the Director.  TATE’S HELL STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014 1 Recreation and Tourism 2 There are many outdoor recreational opportunities within THSF that depend on the natural 3 environment (FDACS, 2007).  The number of recreational opportunities available has 4 increased dramatically over the past several years. THSF is located in Tate’s Hell WMA and has 5 35 miles of rivers, streams, and creeks available for activities including canoeing, boating, 6 fishing, camping, and hunting. 7 As of 2007, there were 268 miles of primary and secondary roads and 850 miles of nonpaved 8 roads. This extensive network of paved roads has increased public access to the area, which is 9 now a popular location for residents to hunt and fish (FDACS, 2007).  There are over 35 points 10 where recreational users can access THSF, which is open year-round to fishing in the rivers 11 and ditches and during the established seasons for hunting (FDACS, 2007).  More information 12 regarding recreational use is provided in Land Use Sections 3.10 and 6.10. 13 Environmental Justice 14 Table 6-51 lists the percentage of minority, 15 low-income, and youth populations compared 16 with the COC populations.  The COC values 17 represent the percentages of minority and 18 low-income populations within a geographic 19 extent representing the ROI.  Locations where 20 the countywide percentages, or AOC 21 percentages, are greater than the statewide 22 percentages, or COC percentages, are identified 23 as having potential EJ concerns.  As indicated in 24 Table 6-51 and Figure 6-43, the individual 25 counties and the two-county ROI have a lower 26 percent of minority and youth populations than 27 the state and the nation but a higher percent of 28 low-income populations than the state and the nation. Noise-sensitive locations, such as 29 schools and childcare centers, are not located on THSF; however, there are many recreational 30 sites located throughout the forest that could be considered noise-sensitive locations. 31 Schools and childcare centers are also shown in Figure 6-43. 32 Table 6-51.

American Community Survey, 5 year estimate, 2007–2011 1 6.11.2 Environmental Consequences 2 As discussed in Section 3.11, potential adverse impacts to socioeconomic resources may 3 occur from safety issues associated with wildfire and land use incompatibility associated with 4 noise resulting from UoEX and aircraft operations. Other proposed action effectors are not 5 addressed in this section.  Impacts to THSF socioeconomic and environmental justice 6 resources identified in Section 6.11.1 would be the same as those described in Section 3.11. 7 Recreation and Tourism 8 As described in Section 2.5, scheduling for training activities would constrain the time, 9 frequency, and types of activities to avoid conflicts with hunters, campers, boaters, and other 10 recreational users.  Some transient recreational users, such as hikers, may be annoyed by 11 noise from aircraft operations. 12 Environmental Justice and Special Risks to Children 13 As described previously, no other impacts for this action have been identified that would 14 impact environmental justice or pose special risks to children. 15 6.11.3 Socioeconomics/Environmental Justice Impact Summary 16 Socioeconomic and environmental justice impacts are tied to those related to noise (Sections 17 3.3 and 6.3), safety (Sections 3.4 and 6.4) and land use (Sections 3.10 and 6.10).  Table 3-44 18 describes the context, intensity, and duration factors utilized in analysis for impacts to 19 socioeconomics and environmental justice; based on these factors the Air Force has identified 20 insignificant socioeconomic or environmental justice impacts to public health and safety and 21 the human environment.  22 Table 6-52 provides a summary of the impacts identified.  Impacts are categorized as follows: 23 • Adverse (yellow) 24 • Neutral/no effect (green) 25 Table 6-52.

Such mitigations include avoidance of noise-sensitive areas and adherence  to wildfire management requirements.  Aircraft Operations  Potential adverse impacts to the public associated with noise from aircraft operations (see Sections  3.3/6.3 [Noise]. Impacts would be mitigated through operational constraints described in Section 2.5  and Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations described in Section 6.3 [Noise]), such as use of  avoidance areas and other flight constraints.  Amphibious  The Air Force has not identified any adverse impacts to socioeconomics or environmental justice with  Operations  these activities (see Section 3.11).  1  6.11.4 Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations  2  No additional Resource-Specific Mitigations for socioeconomics and environmental justice  3  have been identified as a result of analyses in this chapter.  All General Operational  4  Constraints (Section 2.5) identified previously, as well as Proposed Resource-Specific  5  Mitigations identified for noise (Section 3.3.4), would sufficiently minimize any identified  6  adverse impacts.  7  6.12 SOLID AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS/WASTE  8  6.12.1 Affected Environment  9  No hazardous materials or hazardous or petroleum wastes would be generated at most THSF  10  sites, because no industrial activities would occur at these sites.  At administrative locations,  11  personnel would perform limited maintenance of vehicles and equipment, primarily  12  consisting of oil and fluid changes. Consequently, hazardous materials stored at these sites  13  include small quantities (55-gallon containers or smaller) of lubricating oil, hydraulic fluid,  14  antifreeze, solvents, and paints. Wastes generated would include waste and solvents.  All  15  materials and wastes would be managed according to established FFS requirements. These  16  requirements include the use of secondary containment and the availability of spill response  17  equipment.  18  Additionally, the affected environment would comprise FFS requirements regarding the use  19  and management of hazardous materials and wastes.  20  6.12.2 Environmental Consequences  21  As discussed in Section 3.12, Solid and Hazardous Materials/Waste, no adverse impacts to  22  public health and safety or the human and natural environment associated with solid and  23  hazardous material or waste would occur from training activities, and all activities would  24  comply with federal, state, and local regulations.  As a result, this resource area is not  25  discussed further in this chapter.  1  6.13 INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION  2  6.13.1 Affected Environment  3  Based on the limited interaction between training activities and utilities and transportation  4  resources, discussion of the affected environment for infrastructure at THSF is general in  nature.  6  Utilities  7  Utilities within THSF are extremely limited.  Utilities are present at the THSF Headquarters; the  8  Womack Creek Group Recreation Area has a bathhouse. Also, NWFWMD operates four deep  9  water table monitoring wells: two in the Juniper Creek Tract (TA-2) and two in the Womack  Creek Tract (TA-3) (THSF, 2007).  11  Transportation  12  The local and regional road network between Eglin AFB/Hurlburt Field and THSF is well  13  developed. Public access to THSF is via paved roads, including County Road 67, SR 65, and  14  US 98.  THSF can also be accessed from the north through the Apalachicola National Forest.  THSF has over 850 miles of nonpaved roads, of which 268 miles are classified as primary and  16  secondary roads.  All of the recreation areas can be accessed via these primary and secondary  17  roads (THSF, 2007).  18  6.13.2 Environmental Consequences  19  As discussed in Section 3.13.2, no adverse impacts to public health and safety and the human  and natural environment associated with use of utilities or transportation resources would  21  occur from training activities. All activities would comply with federal, state, and local  22  regulations.  As a result, this resource area is not discussed further in this chapter.  23 6.14 TATE’S HELL STATE FOREST IMPACT SUMMARY 24 Table 6-53 provides a summary of impact determinations associated with training activities, for potentially affected resources based on analyses presented in Chapter 3, Sections 3.2 26 through 3.13, and Chapter 6, Sections 6.2 through 6.13.  A “dot” in a cell indicates an 27 interaction between the training activity and the respective resource. Impacts are categorized 28 as follows: 29 • Adverse (yellow) – Potential impact to public health and safety, the human and natural environment, and/or potential violation of federal, state, or local regulations 31 • Neutral/no effect (green) 32 Adverse, insignificant impacts have been identified and are described in detail in the 33 respective resource area chapters. 34 The analyses in these sections were conducted based on effectors associated with training activities (as identified in Table 3-1 and their impacts on receptors identified in Table 3-2. The 36 impact summary provided in Table 6-53 ties these two tables together and identifies the 6-66 TATE’S HELL STATE FOREST AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT/ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES | APRIL 2014 1  degree of impact to affected resources associated with specific training activities as described  2  in Section 2.3.2.  This allows the reader to understand the potential impacts associated with  3  specific training activities.  4  Proposed Resource-Specific Mitigations applicable to both BRSF and THSF resulting from  5  general analysis were previously identified in Section 3.14.1.  Additional Proposed Resource 6  Specific Mitigations identified through analysis in this chapter are provided in Section 6.14.1  7  that would serve to further minimize or avoid any identified adverse impacts.  8  Table 6-53.

Figure 6-12 through Figure 6-22 show the areas in which training activities would  10  be restricted based on buffer distances described above and in Section 3.3.4.   Buffers are  11  established from all privately-owned parcels containing at least one residential structure and  12  all campgrounds.  This page is intentionally blank. 1  7. CUMULATIVE IMPACTS  2  According to CEQ regulations, cumulative effects analysis in an EIS should consider the  3  potential environmental impacts resulting from “the incremental impacts of the action when  4  added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what  5  agency or person undertakes such other actions” (40 CFR 1508.7).  6  7.1 CUMULATIVE IMPACT ANALYSES PRINCIPLES  7  Cumulative effects may occur when there is a relationship between a proposed action or  8  alternative and other actions expected to occur in a similar location or during a similar time  9  period.  This relationship may or may not be obvious.  The effects may then be incremental  10  (increasing) in nature and result in cumulative impacts.  Actions overlapping with or in  11  proximity to the proposed action or alternatives can reasonably be expected to have more  12  potential for cumulative effects on “shared resources” than actions that may be  13  geographically separated.  Similarly, actions that coincide temporally will tend to offer a  14  higher potential for cumulative effects.  15  In this EIS, the Air Force has made an effort to identify actions on or near the action areas  16  associated with the Proposed Action that are under consideration and in the planning stage  17  at this time.  These actions are included in the cumulative analysis sections to the extent that  18  details regarding such actions exist and the actions have a potential to interact with the  19  Proposed Action and associated resources.  Although the level of detail available for those  20  future actions varies, this approach provides the decision maker with the most current  21  information to evaluate the consequences of the alternatives.  The EIS addresses cumulative  22  impacts in order to assess the incremental contribution of the alternatives to impacts on  23  affected resources from all factors.  24  Given the global and cumulative nature of climate change associated with GHGs, cumulative  25  impacts associated with GHGs are addressed below.  Draft CEQ guidance on climate change  26  and NEPA require analysis of “[t]he relationship of climate change effects to a proposed action  27  or alternatives, including the relationship to proposal design, environmental impacts,  28  mitigation and adaptation measures.”   29  GHGs are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. The accumulation of GHGs in the  30  atmosphere regulates the earth’s temperature. GHG emissions are generated by both natural  31  processes and human activities. GHGs include water vapor, CO2, CH4, N2O, ozone, and several  32  hydrocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Each GHG has an estimated global warming  33  potential (GWP), which is a function of its atmospheric lifetime and its ability to absorb and  34  radiate infrared energy emitted from the Earth’s surface. The GWP of a particular gas provides  35  a relative basis for calculating its CO2e, or the amount of CO2 that would be equal to CO2,  36  which has a GWP of 1 and is, therefore, the standard by which all other GHGs are measured.  37  The U.S. Global Change Research Program report Global Climate Change Impacts in the United  38  States states the following:  39  Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed  40  over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases.  These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities.  Warming over this century is projected to be considerably greater than over the last century. The global average temperature since 1900 has risen by about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit (ºF). By 2100, it is projected to rise another 2 degrees to 11.5ºF.  The U.S. average temperature has risen by a comparable amount and is very likely to rise more than the global average over this century, with some variation from place to place. Several factors will determine future temperature increases. Increases at the lower end of this range are more likely if global heat-trapping gas emissions are cut substantially. If emissions continue to rise at or near current rates, temperature increases are more likely to be near the upper end of the range. Volcanic eruptions or other natural variations could temporarily counteract some of the human-induced warming, slowing the rise in global temperature, but these effects would only last a few years.  Reducing emissions of CO2 would lessen warming over this century and beyond. Sizable early cuts in emissions would significantly reduce the pace and the overall amount of climate change. Earlier cuts in emissions would have a greater effect in reducing climate change than comparable reductions made later. In addition, reducing emissions of some shorter-lived heat-trapping gases, such as CH4, and some types of particles, such as soot, would begin to reduce warming within weeks to decades.  Climate-related changes have already been observed globally and in the United States. These include increases in air and water temperatures, reduced frost days, increased frequency and intensity of heavy downpours, a rise in sea level, and reduced snow cover, glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice. A longer ice-free period on lakes and rivers, lengthening of the growing season, and increased water vapor in the atmosphere have also been observed. Over the past 30 years, temperatures have risen faster in winter than in any other season, with average winter temperatures in the midwest and northern Great Plains increasing more than 7ºF. Some of the changes have been faster than previous assessments had suggested. These climate-related changes are expected to continue while new ones develop. Likely future changes for the United States and surrounding coastal waters include more intense hurricanes with related increases in wind, rain, and storm surges (but not necessarily an increase in the number of these storms that make landfall), as well as drier conditions in the southwest and Caribbean.  These changes will affect human health, water supply, agriculture, coastal areas, and many other aspects of society and the natural environment (Karl et al., 2009).  While regional and state impacts are more difficult to predict than large regional or global impacts, a report by the Florida Governor’s Action Team on Energy and Climate Change (2012) says that regional models indicate the following possible impacts in the state of Florida: • Sea level rise could lead to flooding of low-lying areas, erosion of beaches, loss of coastal wetlands, intrusion of saltwater into water supplies, and increased vulnerability of coastal areas to storms and hurricanes. • As climate changes, this could cause some plants and animals to go extinct, some to decline or increase in population, and others migrate to areas with more favorable conditions. For example, along the coast, fish that need colder temperatures to survive could migrate north, while more tropical varieties could move up the coast into Florida. 1 • Diseases and pests with current tropical ranges could invade Florida, as have West Nile 2 virus and Africanized honey bees in Florida’s panhandle. 3 • Crops and trees that need cooler climates may not grow as well in Florida, while more 4 tropical varieties might do better. • More severe storms and droughts could affect crop production, pests, and growth 6 rates. 7 While the Proposed Action would result in GHG emissions, based on the analysis presented in 8 Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6, the Air Force has identified only minor GHG emission increases over 9 the baseline condition.  Emissions would be associated with extra travel time/distance resulting from transport to and from each state forest as opposed to remaining on Eglin AFB. 11 In all other respects, GHG emissions would be similar to the baseline condition from a 12 regional and global context.  Therefore, the Air Force expects the Proposed Action to have 13 negligible cumulative impacts to GHG production and climate change when taken into 14 context with other factors affecting climate change. At this time, analysis of whether global warming or climate change will have an effect on the 16 Proposed Action is purely speculative due to the uncertainties and vagaries of the available 17 science and timelines for potential climate change impacts.  Were the impacts associated with 18 climate change to occur as outlined previously there would certainly be an effect on the 19 Proposed Action, as well as impacts to human-related activities as a whole.  Any proposal design, mitigation and/or adaptation measures to minimize the effects of climate change on 21 the Proposed Action would be developed as climate change effects are more fully realized, 22 and would likely be part of an overall strategy by the Air Force to adapt to climate change 23 impacts. 24  7.2 CUMULATIVE IMPACT ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY  No unmitigatible adverse impacts have been identified for use of emitters sites, thus the Air  26  Force has not identified any correlating potential for cumulative impacts from emitter site  27  use.  28  Cumulative analysis therefore focuses on the potential for cumulative impacts associated  29  with the Proposed Action and each state forest region, as well as northwest Florida as a  whole.   Analysis is conducted by first identifying past, present, and reasonably foreseeable  31  actions as related to the ROI for the particular resource.   Cumulative impacts are then  32  identified if the combination of proposed activities and past, present, and reasonably  33  foreseeable actions interact with the resource to the degree that incremental or additive  34  effects occur.  In the absence of any adverse impacts identified for solid/hazardous waste and  infrastructure/transportation, no cumulative impacts have been identified and these issue  36  areas are not discussed further.  1 7.3 BLACKWATER RIVER STATE FOREST CUMULATIVE IMPACT ASSESSMENT 2 7.3.1 BRSF Regional Past/Present/Reasonably Foreseeable Future Actions 3 Actions potentially interacting with resources impacted by the Proposed Action are limited to 4 activities associated with BRSF, since the affected resources related to the Proposed Action are those within BRSF and along its borders.  The main action for consideration under 6 cumulative impacts for BRSF is FFS implementation of the BRSF Forest Management Plan; this 7 plan details specific forest management goals, objectives, and projects that would be 8 implemented over the specified planning period. 9 Multi-use strategies to utilize and conserve state forest resources include: • Support state forest management objectives and sustain efficient sources of revenue 11 through the implementation of sustainable forest management practices. 12 • Provide resource-based outdoor recreational opportunities for multiple interests. 13 • Restore and manage healthy forests and native ecosystems and ensure the viability of 14 listed plants and animals. • Protect archaeological, historical, cultural, and paleontological resources. 16 • Restore, maintain, and protect hydrologic functions of water resources and health of 17 aquatic communities. 18 • Cooperate with the military to facilitate mission-essential training in a manner that 19 does not adversely impact natural resources, forest management, or public access (FDACS, 2013). 21 Overall, the FFS implementation of the management plan would serve to conserve and 22 enhance the natural environment of BRSF, and improve recreational opportunities at BRSF; 23 this would not be expected to result in adverse impacts to BRSF resources. 24 Additionally, the Proposed Action would be required to comply with applicable FFS forest management plan requirements, thus ensuring no management conflicts between the 26 Proposed Action and the FFS management program. 27 The FFS is actively involved with ongoing and proposed projects to control erosion and 28 sedimentation in surface waters and wetlands at BRSF. These projects include efforts to 29 restore highly eroded areas (with various state and federal agencies), monitoring groundwater quality and quantity (with NWFWMD), and ongoing road and trail evaluations. 31 Ongoing and future projects include closing unneeded roads, surfacing other roads, installing 32 rock at low-water stream crossings, restricting vehicle access to the more sensitive primitive 33 recreation sites, restricting access to some primitive recreation sites that are closed 34 permanently or seasonally, and reengineering and revegetating problem areas to abate erosion at road-stream crossings and borrow pits. 36 To assess potential regional cumulative impacts, the comprehensive plans for Okaloosa 37 (Okaloosa County, 2009) and Santa Rosa (Santa Rosa County, 2008) Counties were reviewed. 38 The road departments for each county provide ongoing operational maintenance for BRSF 39 roads within their jurisdiction.  It is anticipated that impacts from commercial logging CUMULATIVE IMPACTS | APRIL 2014  1  activities outside the forest, but within the affected county areas, would be similar to those for  2  BRSF. Both counties maintain active boat launching facilities along major streams.  3  The other action with potential cumulative impacts at BRSF is the beddown of the F-35 at  4  Eglin AFB currently being evaluated in another NEPA document (U.S. Air Force, 2013b).  7.3.2 Cumulative Impacts by Resource Area  6  Airspace  7  The beddown of 59 F-35s at Eglin AFB currently under way will increase the number of sorties  8  flown in the Eglin MOAs and R-2915 (U.S. Air Force, 2008).  At BRSF, a majority of GLI training  9  operations would be conducted at altitudes below the floor altitudes of the Eglin MOAs.  Proposed GLI training would have minimal cumulative effects in combination with increased  11  F-35 flight activity since they occur in different airspace.  12  Airspace in the region is currently somewhat congested, and demand for airspace is expected  13  to increase. The Strategic Plan developed as part of the GRASI includes several recommended  14  strategies that would improve ATC procedures, enhance military capacity, and enhance  collaboration among airspace users in the region.  These strategies include, but are not  16  limited, to reorganization of the Pensacola North MOA and increased coordination between  17  airspace managing agencies. If these strategies are adopted, they would reduce the potential  18  effects that continued growth in demand for available airspace would have on regional traffic  19  flow and the efficiency of operations.  Proposed GLI training would not typically require use of  SUA or extensive ATC management.  GLI training would allow nonhazardous training  21  currently conducted in R-2915 to be conducted elsewhere, partially alleviating scheduling  22  concerns in a critical airspace unit. Cumulative impacts at a regional level would be minimal  23  and include beneficial impacts.  24  Noise  Operational scenarios including F-35 utilization of training airspace continue to evolve.  26  However, as of May 2013, it was anticipated that noise levels beneath R-2915A and Eglin A  27  MOA would not exceed 62 dB DNLmr once F-35 units are at full strength.  F-35 aircraft are not  28  expected to use Eglin B MOA frequently, and noise levels beneath the MOA would remain  29  below 45 dB DNLmr (Air Force 2013).  F-35 individual overflight noise levels are substantially  higher than noise levels generated by aircraft during GLI training (see Table 5-5).  In most  31  portions of BRSF beneath Eglin A MOA and R-2915A, noise generated by GLI training would  32  not add appreciably to overall time-averaged noise levels generated by the F-35 and other  33  aircraft. Additional annoyance could result from experiencing F-35 training noise as well as  34  proposed GLI training noise, particularly in the immediate vicinity of designated GLI training  locations.  36  Safety  37  From a regional perspective, training activities that currently occur on adjacent Eglin AFB  38  would occasionally occur at BRSF and would not necessarily result in an incremental impact  39  to safety within the region.  While there would not be an overall increase in the number of  potential aircraft mishaps (because the overall number of aircraft operations would not  41  change), BRSF-related areas could see an increase in location-specific occurrences during  42  training activities, due to the shift of operations to the area, while  there would be less  probability of mishaps at Eglin AFB.  Similarly, with wildfires the overall potential for wildfires would shift from Eglin AFB to BRSF during training activities, but the overall number of wildfires occurring in the BRSF region is not likely to increase or decrease in any substantive manner. The probability of occurrence based on drought conditions, wildfire fuel load, and the number of potential fire-starting activities would generally remain the same. Implementation of wildfire prevention requirements as identified in Section 3.4 would minimize potential wildfire occurrences. While there are potential safety concerns inherent to training activities, these would be mitigated through implementation of SOPs and other constraints identified in Section 3.4, thus minimizing the potential for cumulative impacts within the BRSF region. Air Quality Any training activities would be consistent with the restoration and maintenance plans for the state forests. Each plan outlines the resource protection measures designed to reduce impacts for future use. Because the Air Force is already conducting activities in the ROI, the increase in emissions due to training activities would be a small percentage of the overall emissions in the region and mainly associated with the extra travel distance from Eglin AFB to BRSF. As a result, negligible cumulative impacts to air quality are expected. Earth Resources Analysis focuses on activities where there is a discernible potential for the Proposed Action to affect the nature of earth resource impacts and effects at the regional (Okaloosa and Santa Rosa Counties) scale. Contributing mounted troop movements and other training related vehicle-based support activities could increase the utilization of some roads and crossings maintained by Okaloosa and Santa Rosa Counties.  It is anticipated that potential incremental soil erosion and sedimentation cumulative effects of military vehicles would not diminish the life cycle of county road and crossing improvements and would be insignificant.  Proposed Action training constraints and mitigations to avoid and amend mission-related roadscape damage would benefit affected sites. Contributing aircraft HLZ/DZ landings and dismounted troop movements could damage post-harvest clearcut earth resources but would not impact county commercial logging operations and incrementally increase stream sedimentation rates. Constraints and mitigations to avoid and amend mission-related damage would benefit affected sites and minimize soil erosion and sedimentation.  It is anticipated that potential earth resource impacts would be insignificant.  Mission activities would not occur at county-maintained boat launches or other recreational sites outside BRSF.  As applicable, the military would coordinate directly with the FFS to ensure consideration of county planning objectives related to transportation and conservation. Water Resources The cumulative impacts on water resources should take into account all surface-altering actions that have occurred or are likely to occur within or adjacent to the ROI. The most frequent effect of surface disturbance in this region is accelerated erosion and sediment deposition which may affect water resources by contributing sediment, introducing contaminants, or increased flooding. The primary cumulative impacts on surface water and wetlands would result from any increase in the acreage of earthmoving activities and accelerated erosion from roads and trails that have the potential to increase sediment delivery and surface water runoff downstream or introduction of chemical contaminants into surface waterbodies and wetlands. All proposed training activities at BRSF would be consistent with the forest management plans and policies for the forest and hydrologic restoration plans for BRSF. Proposed Air Force training activities would comply with all federal, state, or local regulations. In addition, Air Force environmental management regulations and policy contained in EAFBI 13-212, Range Planning and Operations, and the Interstitial Area Range Final Environmental Assessment Revision 2 (U.S. Air Force, 2013c) identify specific measures to prevent potential adverse effects to water resources from proposed training activities. These measures include, but are not limited to, restricting vehicle access to existing roads, trails, and approved stream/wetland crossings; establishing protective buffers around streams and wetlands; use of BMPs to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation in streams and wetlands; and use of spill prevention measures to prevent contamination in surface waters, aquifers, or wetlands from fuel spills. Impacts to water resources from the proposed training activities would be minimized as long as troops adhere to all environmental management requirements and proposed mitigative measures. Therefore, the Air Force does not expect any of the proposed training activities to incrementally contribute to other impacts to water resources at BRSF. Biological Resources As discussed in Section 5.8.2, there would be some adverse but not significant impacts on biological resources under the Proposed Action.  However, no additional cumulative impacts have been identified that would adversely impact biological resources.  BRSF is a multi-use state forest that utilizes and conserves state forest resources that will best serve the people of the state of Florida while maintaining the purpose for which BRSF was acquired. Additional potential for wildfires and ongoing recreational activities would have adverse cumulative impacts on the forest. However, cumulative contributions would be insignificant due to forest management practices. The FFS goal is to restore and manage healthy forests and native ecosystems to ensure the long-term viability of biological resources, including all wildlife and protected species and habitat communities. Additionally, the FFS would continually cooperate with the U.S. military to facilitate mission-essential training in a manner that does not adversely impact natural resources, forest management, or public access. The Ten-Year Resource Management Plan for BRSF (FDACS, 2013), in coordination with Santa Rosa and Okaloosa County Comprehensive Plans, only contribute beneficial cumulative impacts on biological resources. Cultural Resources Damage to the nature, integrity, and spatial context of cultural resources can have a cumulative impact if the initial act is compounded by other similar losses or impacts. The alteration or demolition of historic structures or the disturbance or removal of cultural artifacts may incrementally impact the cultural and historic setting of BRSF. Recreational activities and forestry management practices at BRSF have long occurred in the training areas under consideration for the Proposed Action.  The inclusion of additional training activities such as those that currently occur on Eglin AFB, if unrestrained, could 1  cumulatively impact various resources. These activities, which involve cross-country ground  2  movement and other potentially ground-disturbing activities, are guided by previously  3  mentioned operating instructions, such as EAFBI 13-212, as well as numerous other agreed 4  upon stipulations resulting from other actions.  These operating instructions, as discussed in  Section 3.9.4, would be implemented at BRSF as well.  Thus, given the required coordination  6  with BRSF staff and 96 CEG/CEIEA Cultural Resources Office, required mitigations and BMPs, as  7  well as any measures recommended by the SHPO, mission activities are not expected to  8  contribute to cumulative impacts to archaeological resources.  9  Land Use  When combined with past, present, or reasonably foreseeable actions, no cumulative impacts  11  to land use receptors are anticipated, since the impacts at BRSF would not carry any  12  significant long-term adverse impacts.  While other actions in the region, such as the  13  proposed F-35 beddown may impact land use, the Proposed Action would not result in any  14  incompatibilities with existing land use guidance or documents (see Table 3-40). In addition,  impacts to recreational users and landowners would be minimized or eliminated by following  16  impact avoidance measures as discussed in the land use baseline and impacts section as well  17  as those described in the mitigation sections of this EIS (Sections 3.10, 4.10, 5.10, and 6.10).  18  Socioeconomics/Environmental Justice  19  As identified in Chapter 5, the Proposed Action would not result in significant adverse  socioeconomic or environmental justice impacts.  Similarly, no impacts have been identified  21  that would pose special risks to children.  Additional annoyance could result from  22  experiencing F-35 training noise as well as proposed GLI training noise, particularly in the  23  immediate vicinity of designated GLI training locations. However, no disproportionately  24  adverse impacts to minority or low-income populations have been identified for the  Proposed Action, and none would be expected from a cumulative perspective when  26  considering other actions. There would likely be minor beneficial impacts to the economy as a  27  result of hiring local contractors to perform needed road/site improvements; however, such  28  impacts would be temporary. Overall, tourism and outdoor recreational activities such as  29  picnicking, camping, boating, fishing, and hunting would not be adversely affected by the  use of BRSF for training activities because implementation of the Proposed Action would not  31  prevent these activities from occurring in the same capacity as the baseline condition.  While  32  the Proposed Action involves the use of publicly accessible state forest land, measures would  33  be taken to avoid conflicts with the public and minimize any potential impacts from restricted  34  access.  7.4 TATE’S HELL STATE FOREST CUMULATIVE IMPACT ASSESSMENT  36  7.4.1 THSF Regional Past/Present/Reasonably Foreseeable Future Actions  37  Similar to BRSF, actions potentially interacting with resources impacted by the Proposed  38  Action are limited to activities associated with THSF, since the affected resources related to  39  the Proposed Action are those within THSF and along its borders.  The main action for  consideration under cumulative impacts for THSF is FFS implementation of the THSF Forest  1 Management Plan; this plan details specific forest management goals, objectives, and 2 projects that would be implemented over the specified planning period. 3 THSF multi-use forest resource management objectives are to: 4 • Restore, maintain, and protect all native ecosystems. • Ensure the long-term viability of populations and species considered endangered, 6 threatened, or of special concern. 7 • Integrate human use through a total resource concept, not emphasizing any particular 8 use over the others or over restoration, maintenance, and protection of native 9 ecosystems. • Protect known archaeological and historical resources. 11 Practice sustainable forest management utilizing sound silvicultural techniques 12 (FDACS, 2007). 13 Overall, the FFS implementation of the management plan would serve to conserve and 14 enhance the natural environment of THSF, and improve recreational opportunities at THSF; this would not be expected to result in adverse impacts to THSF resources.  Additionally, the 16 Proposed Action would be required to comply with applicable FFS forest management plan 17 requirements, thus ensuring no management conflicts between the Proposed Action and the 18 FFS management program. 19 The FFS is actively involved with ongoing and proposed projects to control erosion and sedimentation in surface waters and wetlands. These projects include efforts to restore highly 21 eroded areas, monitoring recreational areas and uses to identify impacts on water resources, 22 and use of BMPs to protect water resources on the forest (FDACS, 2007). The main future 23 plans include road and trail evaluations to identify and rehabilitate problem areas 24 contributing to erosion and sedimentation in surface waters and wetlands and working with NWFWMD to implement the hydrologic restoration plan for streams and wetlands at THSF 26 (NWFWMD, 2010a; NWFWMD, 2010b). 27 No county comprehensive or management plans were identified for Liberty or Franklin 28 County.  However, it is expected that commercial logging activities outside the forest, but 29 within the affected county areas, would be similar to those for THSF. The road departments for each county also provide ongoing operational maintenance of paved and unpaved roads 31 in the vicinity of THSF. 32 The beddown of an operational squadron of F-22 aircraft and detachment of T-38 aircraft at 33 Tyndall AFB will increase the demand on airspace in the region. 34 7.4.2 Cumulative Impacts by Resource Area Airspace Management 36 The beddown of an operational squadron of F-22 aircraft and detachment of T-38 aircraft at 37 Tyndall AFB will increase the number of sorties flown in the Tyndall MOAs (U.S. Air Force, 38 2011b).  Existing internal DoD coordination and scheduling processes would be sufficient to 39 de-conflict multiple DoD users of the training airspace. Cumulative impacts on airspace management would be minimal. Airspace in the region is currently somewhat congested, and demand for airspace is expected to increase. The Strategic Plan developed as part of the GRASI includes several recommended strategies that would improve ATC procedures, enhance military capacity, and enhance collaboration among airspace users in the region.  If these strategies are adopted, they would to reduce the potential effects of continued growth in demand for available airspace on regional traffic flow and efficiency of operations. Proposed GLI training would not typically require use of SUA or extensive ATC management.  GLI training would allow nonhazardous training currently conducted in R-2915 to be conducted elsewhere, partially alleviating scheduling concerns in a critical airspace unit. Cumulative impacts at a regional level would be minimal and include beneficial impacts. Noise Individual overflight noise levels generated by F-22 and T-38 aircraft are higher than noise levels generated by GLI training aircraft while operating at the same altitudes.  However, F-22 and T-38 aircraft would typically operate at much higher altitudes than those used during GLI training. As described in the Environmental Analysis for F-22 Operational Squadron and T-38 Detachment at Tyndall AFB, both F-22 and T-38 aircraft would spend 95 percent of training time at altitudes above 10,000 feet MSL.  The time-averaged noise level beneath Tyndall F MOA would remain below 45 dB DNLmr, and the noise level beneath Tyndall G MOA would increase by 1 dB or less after beddown of these aircraft is complete (U.S. Air Force, 2011b).  Additional annoyance could result from F-22 training noise, as well as noise from proposed GLI training, particularly in the immediate vicinity of designated training locations. Safety Airspace over the THSF region is regularly used by military aircraft and subject to aircraft mishaps.  The THSF region could see an increase in mishaps during training activities due to the shift of operations to the area, while there would be less probability of mishaps at Eglin AFB.  However, the probability of an aircraft mishap is low and has not been identified as a significant safety issue.  Similarly, the overall potential for wildfires would shift from Eglin AFB to the THSF region during training activities, but the overall number of wildfires occurring within the region is not likely to increase or decrease in any substantive manner.  The probability of wildfires based on drought conditions, wildfire fuel load, and the number of potential fire-starting activities would remain the same.  Implementation of wildfire prevention requirements as identified in Section 3.4 would minimize potential wildfire occurrences. While there are potential safety concerns inherent to training activities, these would be mitigated through implementation of SOPs and other constraints identified in Section 3.4, thus minimizing the potential for cumulative impacts within the THSF region. Air Quality Any training activities would be consistent with the restoration and maintenance plans for the state forests. Each plan outlines the resource protection measures designed to reduce impacts for future use. Combined emissions from other aircraft operations in the area would be minimal given that most aircraft, with the exception of those identified as part of the Proposed Action, operate at altitudes that do not adversely affect air quality. Analysis has shown that training activities would have a negligible impact to air quality; therefore, negligible cumulative impacts to air quality are expected. Earth Resources Contributing vehicular use of public roads under the Proposed Action to access THSF could increase the utilization of some county-maintained roads. However, the potential incremental cumulative effects from soil erosion and sedimentation caused by military vehicles would not diminish the life cycle of county road and crossing improvements and would be insignificant. Water Resources The most frequent effect of surface disturbance in this region is accelerated erosion and sediment deposition, which could affect water resources by contributing sediment, introducing contaminants, or increasing flooding. The primary cumulative impacts on surface water and wetlands would result from any increase in the acreage of earth-moving activities and accelerated erosion from roads and trails, which could increase sediment delivery and surface water runoff downstream or introduce chemical contaminants into surface water bodies and wetlands. All proposed training activities at THSF would be consistent with the forest management plans and policies for the forest and hydrologic restoration plans for THSF. Proposed Air Force training activities would comply with all federal, state, or local regulations. In addition, Air Force environmental management regulations and policy contained in EAFBI 13-212, Range Planning and Operations, and the Interstitial Area Range Final Environmental Assessment Revision 2 (U.S. Air Force, 2013c) identify specific measures to prevent potential adverse effects to water resources from proposed training activities. These measures include, but are not limited to, restricting vehicle access to existing roads, trails, and approved stream/wetland crossings; establishing protective buffers around streams and wetlands; use of BMPs to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation in streams and wetlands; and use of spill prevention measures to prevent contamination in surface waters, aquifers, or wetlands from fuel spills. Impacts to water resources as a result of the proposed training activities would be minimized as long as troops adhere to all environmental management requirements and proposed mitigative measures. Therefore, the Air Force does not expect any of the proposed training activities to incrementally contribute to other impacts to water resources at THSF. Biological Resources There is a potential for cumulative impacts resulting from the Proposed Action in combination with recreation, silviculture, NWFWMD hyrodrologic recovery efforts, and FFS ecological management of THSF natural resources. Short-to medium-term adverse cumulative impacts are initially anticipated, with long-term beneficial impacts once effectiveness of NWFWMD and FFS restoration programs is realized.  The FFS would continually cooperate with the U.S. military to facilitate mission-essential training in a manner that does not adversely impact natural resources, forest management, or public access at THSF. Cultural Resources Damage to the nature, integrity, and spatial context of cultural resources can have a cumulative impact if the initial act is compounded by other similar losses or impacts. The alteration or demolition of historic structures or the disturbance or removal of cultural artifacts may incrementally impact the cultural and historic setting of THSF. Recreational activities and forestry management practices at THSF have long occurred in the training areas under consideration for the Proposed Action.  The inclusion of additional training activities at THSF such as those that currently occur on Eglin AFB, if unrestrained, could cumulatively impact various resources.  These activities, which involve cross-country ground movement and other potentially ground-disturbing activities, are guided by previously mentioned operating instructions, such as EAFBI 13-212, as well as numerous other agreed-upon stipulations resulting from other actions. These operating instructions, as discussed in Section 3.9.4, would be implemented at THSF as well. Thus, given the required coordination with THSF staff and 96 CEG/CEIEA Cultural Resources Office, required mitigation and BMPs, as well as any measures recommended by the SHPO, mission activities are not expected to contribute to cumulative impacts to archaeological resources. Land Use When combined with past, present, or reasonably foreseeable actions, no cumulative impacts to land use receptors is anticipated, since the impacts at THSF would not carry any significant long-term adverse impacts.  Land use impacts are not anticipated to have cumulative impacts at THSF. The Proposed Action would not result in incompatibilities with existing activities, land use regulations, or planning documents (see Table 3-40).  As discussed in Sections 3.10, 4.10, 5.10, and 6.10, the timing and location of training activities and emitter site operations, as well as the mitigation measures presented in these sections, would prevent or minimize any potential impacts to land use receptors.  No regional cumulative impacts are anticipated to land use receptors considering other activities occurring in the northwest Florida region. Socioeconomics/Environmental Justice As identified in Chapter 6, the Proposed Action would not result in significant adverse socioeconomic or environmental justice impacts.  No adverse impacts to local populations have been identified from the Proposed Action.  Similarly, no impacts have been identified that would pose special risks to children.  Additional annoyance could result from F-22 training noise as well as proposed GLI training noise, particularly in the immediate vicinity of designated GLI training locations.  However, no disproportionately adverse impacts to minority or low-income populations have been identified for the Proposed Action, and none would be expected from a cumulative perspective when considering other actions.  There would likely be minor beneficial impacts to the economy as a result of hiring local contractors to perform needed road/site improvements; however, such impacts would be temporary. Tourism and outdoor recreational activities such as picnicking, camping, boating, fishing, and hunting would not be affected by the use of THSF for training activities. While the Proposed Action involves the use of publicly accessible state forest land, measures would be taken to avoid conflicts with the public and minimize any potential impacts from restricted access. 1 8. NO ACTION ALTERNATIVE IMPACT ANALYSIS 2 Implementation of the No Action Alternative means that none of the Proposed Action 3 components as described in Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 would occur at the respective locations 4 (emitter sites, BRSF, and THSF).  All activities would remain on Eglin AFB and no new emitter 5 sites would be established. 6 There would be no impacts to the proposed emitter sites, BRSF, or THSF beyond those 7 resulting from normal activities at these locations, such as recreational use and typical forest 8 management activities conducted by the FFS as identified in the respective state forest 9 management plans. Evaluation of the impacts of these activities on the affected environment 10 is beyond the scope of this EIS. 11 Impacts to the Eglin Range and associated airspace would be as described in the Eglin AFB 12 Final Interstitial Range Environmental Assessment Revision 2 (U.S. Air Force, 2013c), the Eglin AFB 13 Riverine/Estuarine Final Programmatic Environmental Assessment (U.S. Air Force, 2004), and the 14 Eglin AFB Final Overland Air Operations Programmatic Environmental Assessment (U.S. Air Force, 15 2006). 16 Implementation of the No Action Alternative would not meet the purpose and need for the 17 Proposed Action, and would result in continued scheduling issues between nonhazardous 18 ground training operations and hazardous testing and training operations. This page is intentionally blank. 9. OTHER NEPA CONSIDERATIONS 2  9.1 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SHORT-TERM USE AND LONG-TERM PRODUCTIVITY  3  Short-Term Uses  4  The Proposed Action would have minor short-term effects related to use of resources during  land improvements in support of FWALS and HLZs, consumptive use, traveling, use of  6  produced materials, fuels, etc.  As a mitigating component of short-term uses of the  7  environment, the Proposed Action would create economic benefits during training activities  8  in the form of some jobs and the direct and indirect demand for goods and services (see  9  Sections 3.11, 4.11, and 5.11 – Socioeconomics).  Long-Term Productivity  11  Based on analysis of the Proposed Action provided in Chapters 3 through 7, the Air Force has  12  not identified any long-term adverse impacts to productivity as a result of unmitigated short 13  term impacts.  The scope of activities associated with the Proposed Action would result in  14  minor long-term productivity benefits as the GLI would be a program wherein training  activities occur intermittently over time; thus, short-term increases in direct and indirect  16  demand for goods and services while training activities occur would be intermittent over the  17  long term as the GLI program is established and implemented.  Long-term benefits to the FFS  18  associated with lease fees would be realized through leasing agreements; however, this is not  19  an easily quantifiable impact since it is unknown how this income would be distributed within  the state government.  If these funds were directed back to the specific state forest, then  21  there would be a direct benefit to each forest.  22  Short-Term Uses Versus Long-Term Productivity  23  The assessment of effects on long-term productivity is related to whether the project is  24  consistent with long-term regional and local planning objectives. Under the Proposed Action,  there would be minor increases in employment, income, and net fiscal benefits and revenues  26  to the FFS and surrounding communities during training activities.  Training activities at the  27  state forests would be scheduled to avoid conflict with hunters and other recreational users,  28  thus avoiding impacts to long-term productivity associated with recreational use of the  29  forests.  Local short-term impacts to resources would be consistent with the regional, state,  and local long-term planning objectives.  31  9.2 IRREVERSIBLE AND IRRETRIEVABLE COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES  32  NEPA requires that environmental analysis identify any irreversible and irretrievable  33  commitments of resources involved in the implementation of the Proposed Action or  34  alternatives.  Irreversible and irretrievable resource commitments are related to the use of  nonrenewable resources and the effects that the use of these resources could have on future  36  generations.  Irreversible effects primarily result from the use or destruction of a specific  37  resource (e.g., energy and minerals) that cannot be replaced within a reasonable time frame.  38  Irretrievable resource commitments involve the loss in value of an affected resource that  1  cannot be restored as a result of the action (e.g., extinction of a threatened or endangered  2  species or the disturbance of a cultural site).  3  Implementing the Proposed Action would require a commitment of natural, physical, human,  4  and fiscal resources. In all of these categories, irreversible and irretrievable commitments of  5  resources would occur in the form of utilization of energy resources such as fossil fuels (for  6  transportation, associated with utility use, etc.).   However, these physical resources should  7  generally be in sufficient supply that their commitment would not have an adverse effect on  8  the resources’ local, regional, or national continued or future availability.  Land disturbance as  9  described in the Proposed Action would not result in irretrievable resource commitments, as  10  any land disturbance would by minor in nature and would be recoverable over the short-to 11  medium term.  12  While none of the proposed activities involve direct habitat alteration, some biological  13  resources would be directly lost as a result of consumptive use during training activities;  14  however, no sensitive species would be impacted, and the amount of general wildlife species  15  taken would be insignificant when compared to the amount of hunting taking place at each  16  proposed location.  Incidental contact (such as a vehicle strike) may also result in incidental  17  mortality to some species; while this cannot be completely avoided, the potential can be  18  minimized  by implementation  of  the General Operational Constraints  and  Proposed  19  Resource-Specific Mitigations identified in this EIS.  20  9.3 ENERGY REQUIREMENTS AND CONSERVATION POTENTIAL OF ALTERNATIVES AND  21  MITIGATION MEASURES  22  Energy requirements associated with the Proposed Action are limited to use of fossil fuels in  23  support of transportation and utility use.  Conservation potential for this resource is limited to  24  general energy conservation techniques, such as making  sure no  lights remain  on  at  25  hardened camp sites, transportation pooling, etc.  26  9.4 NATURAL OR DEPLETABLE RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND CONSERVATION  27  POTENTIAL  28  While use of natural resources as a component of the training environment would occur at  29  each forest (e.g., consumption training), use of natural resources for the Proposed Action is  30  expected to be “non-intrusive,” in the sense that the goal of the Air Force in implementing the  31  Proposed Action is to avoid to the greatest extent possible adverse impacts to natural and  32  anthropogenic resources and to be compatible with FFS forest management plans. To this  33  end, the Air Force has developed General Operational Constraints and Proposed Resource 34  Specific Mitigations to avoid or minimize impacts on the environment. Consequently, the Air  35  Force will support conservation measures of the FFS through implementation of these  36  requirements.   Other  than  use  of  fossil  fuels  as discussed  previously,  there are no  37  requirements for depletable resources associated with the Proposed Action.  1  10.

GLOSSARY  2  Accretion is the gradual increase or extension of land by natural forces acting over a long  3  period of time, as on a beach by the washing up of sand from the sea floor or a floodplain by  4  the accumulation of sediment deposited by a stream.  Airspace – Class C, D, E refers to controlled airspace designations as defined by the Federal  6  Aviation Administration in order JO 7400.2J, Part 4 Chapter 14, Section 1  7  (http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/ publications/atpubs/AIR/air1401.html).  8  Alluvial pertains to the materials or processes associated with stream sediment transportation  9  and deposition whereas fluvial pertains to waterways produced by stream or river action.  Deltaic refers to land formation processes associated with alluvium, nearly flat and fan 11  shaped, depositions at or near the mouth of a river or stream where it enters a body of  12  relatively quiet water such as a lake or sea.  13  Karst is a kind of topography formed in limestone, gypsum, or other soluble rocks by  14  dissolution.  Land-surface form is the description of a given terrain area based on empirical analysis of the  16  land surface rather than interpretation of genetic factors.  Surface form may be expressed  17  quantitatively in terms of vertical and planimetric slope-class distribution, local and absolute  18  relief, and patterns of terrain features such as drainage lines or terraces.  19  RNAV, or Area Navigation, can be defined as a method of navigation that permits aircraft  operation on any desired course within the coverage of station-referenced navigation signals  21  or within the limits of a self-contained system capability, or a combination of these.  22  Solution pipe refers to a subsurface, vertical, cylindrical or cone-shaped hole, formed by  23  dissolution in soluble limestone bedrock.  These features often are without surface expression  24  filled with soil materials and serve as a bypass rout for internal water flow.  Stratigraphy is the branch of geology that deals with the definition and interpretation of  26  layered earth materials; the conditions of their formation; their character, arrangement,  27  sequence, age, and distribution; and their correlation by the use of fossils and other means.  28  Tolerable erosion rate refers to an erosion rate that is lower than the rate of soil development.  29  Soils are assigned a tolerance value primarily based on the thickness of the soil above  bedrock or unaltered parent material.  This page is intentionally blank. APPENDIX A PRINTABLE MAPS This page is intentionally blank. APPENDIX A – PRINTABLE MAPS | APRIL 2014 DRAFT GRASI LANDSCAPE INITIATIVE EIS APPENDIX A – PRINTABLE MAPS | APRIL 2014 DRAFT GRASI LANDSCAPE INITIATIVE EIS APPENDIX A – PRINTABLE MAPS | APRIL 2014 DRAFT GRASI LANDSCAPE INITIATIVE EIS APPENDIX A – PRINTABLE MAPS | APRIL 2014 DRAFT GRASI LANDSCAPE INITIATIVE EIS APPENDIX A – PRINTABLE MAPS | APRIL 2014 Figure 2-3.

National Environmental Policy Act requirements for public involvement are set forth in the Air Force Environmental Impact Analysis Process, Council on Environmental Quality regulations, at 32 Code of Federal Regulations Part 989.  These regulations describe what the Air Force must do as a part of the public hearing and public comment process to involve the public.  The entire public involvement process ensures that the EIS has adequately addressed significant issues important to the people who will be impacted by the Air Force’s decisions. In addition to information on the public hearings for the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the proposed Gulf Regional Airspace Strategic Initiative (GRASI) Landscape Initiative (GLI), this appendix contains a summary and overview of the public scoping process , to include public scoping, agency correspondence, and public comments received during the public scoping process.

INTRODUCTION This Public Scoping Summary Report (PSSR) has been developed for the U.S. Air Force (Air Force), and more specifically, on behalf of the Headquarters Air Force (HAF/A7); HAF Office of Airspace, Ranges and Basing (HAF/A30); and the Eglin Air Force Base (AFB) 96th Test Wing (96 TW). It summarizes the scoping process and public scoping input received for the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) of the proposed Gulf Regional Airspace Strategic Initiative (GRASI) Landscape Initiative (GLI) at Eglin AFB, Florida. The purpose of the Proposed Action under the GLI EIS is to afford military operational and training flexibility by providing optional training space for nonhazardous training should hazardous activity preclude use of the Eglin Range.  This would be accomplished through two types of partnerships.  The Air Force would partner with the State of Florida to utilize Blackwater River State Forest (BRSF) and Tate’s Hell State Forest (THSF) for nonhazardous testing and training activities as needed. In addition, the Air Force would partner with the Florida Forest Service (FFS) and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) for use of associated lands for placement of temporary and mobile training radar emitters. Further details regarding the Proposed Action and its purpose and need can be found in the GLI EIS Description of Proposed Action and Alternatives (DOPAA) (Chapters 1 and 2 of the EIS). The EIS will address the Proposed Action and alternatives as well as a No Action Alternative, which provides a benchmark, enabling decision makers to compare the magnitude of environmental effects of the action alternatives. A Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare the GLI EIS was published in the Federal Register on 12 August 2013.  Scoping for the EIS took place from 12 August 2013 to 12 September 2013. This PSSR describes the public scoping notification process and the scoping meetings, and summarizes avenues provided for public comment and public comments received throughout the scoping period. While the scoping report identifies potentially significant issues and concerns, the document does not describe Air Force decisions, nor does it set policies.  Section 3 of this report summarizes the scoping issues the Air Force received through 13 September 2013, with 167 individuals and organizations submitting 1,306 comments. 2. SCOPING OBJECTIVES AND APPROACH Scoping is a vital part of EIS planning under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, and is one of the first steps in such planning.  Scoping is conducted pursuant to NEPA; Executive Orders (EOs) 11514 and 11991; Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Parts 1500–1508); the Environmental Quality Improvement Act of 1970, as amended (42 United States Code [USC] 4371 et seq.); and the Air Force EIS process (32 CFR 989). The intent of scoping is to provide ample opportunity for the public, government agencies, and other stakeholders to learn about and comment on the proposed actions and alternatives introduced in the GLI EIS DOPAA. Stakeholder comments are sought during scoping to help ensure the EIS will address significant issues and concerns important to those who may be impacted by the GLI EIS decisions.  The key elements of scoping include the following: • It is an “early and open process for determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying the significant issues related to a proposed action” (40 CFR 1501.7). • It provides agencies with a method to determine the scope of analysis in an EIS, meaning the nature of the actions, the alternatives, and the impacts to be analyzed. • It helps agencies “identify and eliminate from detailed study the issues which are not significant or which have been covered by prior environmental review” (40 CFR 1501.7). • It involves federal, state, and local agencies, affected Tribal entities, the proponent of an action, and other interested persons (40 CFR 1501.7). As described in further detail below, the scoping period was supported by public outreach materials and resources, including a project website, key messages, questions and answers, and an Air Force Public Affairs (PA) point of contact (POC). The Air Force held three scoping meetings in towns near the areas potentially impacted by the GLI.  The meetings fulfill part of the Air Force scoping requirements under NEPA.  Witten comments were solicited during those meetings as well as through the Federal Register notice, direct letters, newspaper advertisements, and the project website. 2.1 PUBLIC NOTIFICATION PROCESS Groups, agencies, or organizations directly, indirectly, or perceived to be affected by the Air Force’s implementation of the Proposed Action or alternatives evaluated in the environmental analysis were provided notification of the Air Force’s intent to prepare an EIS and the upcoming scoping meetings in several ways, as outlined below. 2.1.1 Federal Register Notice of Intent The initiation of the scoping process began with the Air Force’s publication of the NOI in the Federal Register on 12 August 2013.  This notice announced the Air Force’s intent to prepare the GLI EIS. The publication of the NOI officially marked the beginning of the scoping period, during which time the Air Force accepted public comments on the scope, or range of issues, to be considered during the preparation of the draft EIS.  The NOI is included in Addendum A, Scoping Notification Materials. 2.1.2 Interagency and Intergovernmental Coordination for Environmental Planning In August, the Air Force distributed Interagency and Intergovernmental Coordination for Environmental Planning (IICEP) letters to potentially interested federal, state, and local agencies and government representatives. The Air Force also initiated Endangered Species Act (ESA) consultation via these letters.  Included as an attachment to the IICEP letter was a map of the proposed emitter sites and Blackwater River and Tate’s Hell state forests, and a flyer advertising the scoping meetings.  The IICEP letter, attachments and distribution list are provided in Addendum A. 2.1.3 Scoping Advertisements, Press Releases, and Public Service Announcements Approximately two and three weeks prior to the scoping meetings, the Air Force distributed newspaper advertisements in areas potentially impacted by the GLI to announce its intent to prepare an EIS and the associated scoping meetings.  Newspaper publication dates are shown in Table 2-1. A copy of the newspaper display advertisement is contained in Addendum A. Table 2-1.  Newspaper Advertisement Dates Newspaper Publication  Release/Publication Dates  Northwest Florida Daily News  Friday, 9 August 2013 and Saturday, 17 August 2013  Pensacola News Journal  Friday, 9 August 2013 and Friday, 16 August 2013  Apalachicola Times  Thursday, 15 August 2013 (online) and Thursday, 22 August 2013  Panama City News Herald  Friday, 9 August 2013 and Friday, 16 August 2013  Tallahassee Democrat  Friday, 9 August 2013 and Friday, 16 August 2013  2.2 WEBSITE The Air Force established a project website, http:///www.grasieis.leidoseemg.com, to notify the general public of the scoping meetings and Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) via the Internet. The website also accepted public scoping comments. The scoping brochure, developed for the scoping meetings, was posted to the project website prior to the meetings and the scoping presentation was posted shortly after the meetings. A project announcements tab announced the scoping meeting dates and locations and the close of the scoping period, and it informed the public that the draft EIS was anticipated to be available for public and agency review early in 2014.  The website also linked to the GRASI website as well as other relevant Air Force websites. 2.3 POINT OF CONTACT Public comments were directed to the GLI EIS POC: Mr. Mike Spaits, Eglin AFB Public Affairs Office, 96th Test Wing/Public Affairs [96 TW/PA], 101 West D Avenue, Room 238, Eglin AFB, Florida 32542-5499; phone (850) 882-2836.  The Air Force distributed the POC information to the interested/affected public using the notification methods described above and during the scoping meetings. 2.4 SCOPING MEETINGS The Air Force held three scoping meetings, near BRSF and THSF.  The dates and locations for those meetings are included in Table 2-2, along with the number of meeting attendees and verbal and written comments received. All scoping meetings were held from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM.  Copies of the general meeting layout, the scoping fact sheet, logistical signs, poster displays, the Air Force presentation, and the meeting sign-in sheets are provided in Addendum B. Table 2-2. Scoping Meeting Dates, Locations, Attendance, Comment Submittals, and Recognitions The meetings began with a 30-minute open house. Meeting attendees were asked to sign in and asked if they would like to sign up to provide verbal comments.  Resource specialists staffed poster stations and were available to the public to provide information, answer questions, facilitate identification of issues and encourage public involvement. Seven poster display stations covering the EIS process, the Proposed Action and alternatives, and resource areas anticipated to incur impacts were available for review: • Display 1: NEPA Process and How to Comment • Display 2: GRASI Background • Display 3: GLI Description and Purpose and Need • Display 4: GLI Proposed Training Activities • Display 5: GLI Proposed Training Locations • Display 6: GLI Proposed Emitter Locations • Display 7: Resource Areas for Environmental Analysis A four-page fact sheet with more-detailed information than the posters was provided to interested attendees. Comment forms were available for participants to provide written comments. The Air Force gave a brief presentation following the 30-minute open house. The presentation duration was approximately 20 minutes for the Milton scoping meeting and approximately 30 minutes for the Blountstown and Apalachicola scoping meetings due to the addition of introductory remarks.  Verbatim copies of the presentation are contained in Addendum C, Scoping Comments and Transcripts, within the meeting transcripts. Mr. Mike Spaits welcomed participants and provided introductory remarks, an explanation of scoping and an overview of NEPA.  Mr. Tom Tolbert then provided information on the Proposed Action and alternatives, why they are needed and how they were established by the Air Force.  Mr. Spaits identified the environmental resource areas to be evaluated in the draft EIS as well as the anticipated schedule, and wrapped up the presentation by explaining the methods for commenting verbally and in writing and opening up the floor to verbal comments. After the Milton scoping meeting showed that the public was misinterpreting the level of use proposed for the state forests, the Air Force added opening remarks for the remaining meetings.  At the Blountstown and Apalachicola meetings, Col. Shawn Moore provided opening remarks clarifying that the Air Force was not conducting a land grab and introduced Mr. Michael Penland, the Air Staff proponent from the Pentagon.  Mr. Penland explained some of the history behind the GLI, in particular that the Air Force initiated communication with the FFS regarding if there were areas available and compatible with the proposed training.  He emphasized that the intent was to cause no impacts and that the Air Force made it clear to the FFS that if there were any areas that could not be used because of hunting or other activities, the Air Force would not consider those areas. Mr. Spaits and Mr. Tolbert then proceeded with their portions of the presentation, as conducted in Milton. Following the Air Force presentation, there was a 5-to 10-minute break allowing individuals to sign up to speak. The public then had an opportunity to provide public testimony transcribed by a court reporter.  Given the limited numbers of persons signed up to speak at the scoping meetings, no time limits were set regarding the amount any given speaker could provide comment.  Members of the public were also encouraged to provide written scoping comments on sheets provided at the meeting, by mail after the meeting, through the project website at www.grasieis.leidoseemg.com, or by providing verbal comments directly to the court reporter in private. Copies of the meeting transcripts, including verbatim verbal comments from the public, are contained in Addendum C along with copies of the written comments submitted at the meetings and on the website. After the scoping meetings closed, the scoping support staff debriefed and a record was made of the number of meeting attendees; any federal, state, or local representatives in attendance; media interactions; and issues raised and discussed.  Section 2.5 summarizes media coverage during and after the scoping meetings.  Section 3 provides a summary of scoping comments captured throughout the entire scoping period. 2.5 MEDIA COVERAGE This section summarizes the media coverage of the GLI EIS during and after the scoping meetings. Copies of news articles, including WMBB news coverage and coverage by the Tallahassee Democrat and the Panama City News Herald, can be found in Addendum D, Scoping Media Coverage. 27 August 2013 Scoping Meeting in Milton, Florida at the Milton Community Center: There were no media representatives identified at the meeting and no interviews were conducted. 28 August 2013 Scoping Meeting in Blountstown, Florida at the Blountstown Civic Center: There were no media representatives identified at the meeting and no interviews were conducted. 29 August 2013 Scoping Meeting in Apalachicola, Florida at the Apalachicola Community Center: Representatives of the Apalachicola Times and WOYS100.5 were present, along with the stations interviewing, as noted below. • Fox49 interviewed Mr. Michael Penland prior to the scoping meeting; he clarified that the Air Force was looking for compatible, already developed state park areas to serve as a "relief valve" for nonhazardous Air Force training. • WMBB of Panama City interviewed Mr. Mike Spaits (96 TW/PA) who explained the Proposed Action and clarified that it was not a land grab.  3. SYNOPSIS OF PUBLIC COMMENTS The following section represents a summary by resource area or EIS topic of the public comments provided during the public scoping period at the scoping meetings or in writing to the EIS POC.  Development of the comment summaries began with a review of each comment for content by the EIS contractor.  Key issues were identified and the comments categorized by EIS topic, such as purpose and need, Proposed Action and alternatives, and suggested new alternative, or resource area, such as socioeconomics, noise, transportation, biological resources, etc. Many of the comments concerned more than one topic and/or resource area.  These comments were categorized in all relevant actions/topics to ensure their full consideration during EIS preparation.  In addition, some commenters provided written as well as verbal comments.  Accordingly, the number of comments received is greater than the number of individuals and organizations commenting.  For the GLI EIS, 167 individuals and organizations submitted 1,306 comments and requests for information.  They are summarized in Table 3-1. Table 3-1.

Comments have been organized by resource area and are summarized in Table 3-2 along with tallies of direct references to THSF or BRSF. Table 3-2. Summary of Comments by Resource Area Consolidated Summary  THSF  BRSF  AIRSPACE MANAGEMENT AND USE  Opposition to any restrictions on airspace or access to state forest grounds by the public or general aviation. Specific concerns:  • Concern about impacts to the recreational airfield at Blackwater Airfield (8FD3), identified as Munson Airfield, as it provides a rare capability for general aviation pilots to enjoy state parks; specifically the Recreational Aviation Foundation (RAF), which did a lot of groundwork with the Florida Forest Service (FFS) to reopen the airstrip for general aviation use.  • The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) requests that training activities be coordinated with the general aviation community in a timely fashion and not significantly interfere with the usage of 8FD3; utilize the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA’s) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) system; and coordinate with the BRSF Supervisor to ensure that general aviation pilots and aircraft are not inadvertently involved in a training event. • Requests that the Air Force take over the scheduling of the Blackwater Airfield and enable the public  17  23  Table 3-2.

Every HUC Unit within the Blackwater River System is on the 303(d) list for water quality impairments; please let me remind you that Outstanding FL Waters are to be more protected than waters without special attributes. The Indian River, along Florida’s East Coast was also identified as an Outstanding FL Water and has suffered from years of neglect, relaxing water quality standards, and eutrophication until now we are seeing and noting record level deaths of manatees and dolphins, as well as dwindling crab and fish populations.” impacts as this is less than 20 miles upstream.” 4. CONCLUSION The Draft GLI EIS scoping process received extensive public engagement. Agencies, government representatives, NGOs, and citizens presented 167 comment submittals to the Air Force. The actions and topics of greatest concern included impacts upon the unique state forest ecosystems; concerns about the reversal of decades of conservation work; concerns about nighttime noise and training activities impacting ecological functions; restrictions on recreation or public ground or air access to state forests; the incompatibility of the Air Force use and the original purpose of the forests; impacts to recreational pursuits, and impacts on subsistence hunting and fishing, conducted to feed local families. Several commenters requested clear and advance notice of military use.  Concerns were also expressed about potential increases in airspace conflicts or proposed expansions of restricted areas, as well as concerns about future escalation of military activities. Dozens of Franklin County entities expressed concerns about socioeconomic impacts on tourism from reducing or restricting tourism due to military presence, injury to the pristine credibility of the area, and negative impacts from increased air traffic congestion and noise. Several commenters requested more details about the proposed action, including specifics regarding the locations, length, timing, scale and duration of proposed activities; the number of personnel; the types and amount of equipment involved; and any proposed restricted access.  Commenters inquired as to why they were not informed by the military or the FFS regarding the potential of military use of state forests earlier.  Numerous commenters requested that the Air Force abandon looking to the state forests as a possible training location and to find different sites for training such as other bases or private lands. Several commenters had concerns about erosion impacts from the vehicle stream and wetland crossings and from the ORVs. Other major concerns related to the possibility of emitters potentially disrupting civilian, residential, emergency management, and private pilot communication devices or causing unknown health consequences for all species.  Concerns were also expressed about the military's ability to adequately clean up and dispose of waste based upon past history and concerns about noise impacts upon the serenity found in the state forests. ADDENDUM A SCOPING NOTIFICATION MATERIALS NOTICE OF INTENT IICEP LETTER – FINAL DISTRIBUTION LIST NEWSPAPER DISPLAY ADVERTISEMENT THIS PAGE IS INTENTIONALLY BLANK NOTICE OF INTENT IICEP LETTER – FINAL APPENDIX B, PUBLIC AND AGENCY INVOLVEMENT | APRIL 2014 DISTRIBUTION LIST Entity2  Name  Name2  Company  Address1  Address2  City  State  ZIP  Federal  FAA  Ray Towles  FAA Headquarters, Deputy Assistant Administrator for Regions and Center Operations  U.S. Department of Transportation  Federal Aviation Administration  800 Independence Avenue, SW  Washington  DC  20591  Regional  NOAA Fisheries Service  Southeast Regional Office  263 13th Avenue South  Saint Petersburg  FL  33701  Local  Northwest Florida Water Management District  Tallahassee Field Office  Carr Building, Suite 225  3800 Commonwealth Blvd., MS LS225  Tallahassee  FL  32399  Regional  Maj.

There are other places they can train such as East of tates hell area or over towards Tindall Please take into consideration all the protected species and natural wildlife we have ... ( The last Forgotten Coast ) Thank you  Anita Grove  Apalachicola Bay Chamber of Commerce  August 29th, the US Air Force held a scoping meeting in Apalachicola about the Gulf Regional Airspace Strategic Initiative (GRASI) Landscape Initiative (GLI). The purpose of this initiative is to expand military training activities from Eglin and Tyndall Air Force Bases in to Tate's Hell State Forest and Apalachicola National Forest. We wholeheartedly support our military, however, the proposed training would be more intense than we have experienced in the past. Any increase in air traffic would negatively impact our tourism industry. Currently, we host tourists from around the world seeking to view the unique flora and fauna in Tate’s Hell Forest. Tourism is a vital aspect of our economy and it is predicated on our pristine, quiet, wild natural areas. Apalachicola Bay and the surrounding lands have been preserved for decades to ensure the long term health of Apalachicola Bay and to conserve many rare and endangered habitats and species found within the fragile Tate's Hell environment. We have preserved these lands in lieu of receiving the economic benefits of development. This decade we are finally realizing the economic benefits of our preservation efforts. The Apalachicola Bay Chamber of Commerce and its 400+ members oppose any increase in air traffic over the area and any training that would negatively impact the solitude and wildlife in the area. Please advise us on how to engage in further discussions on this issue. I can be reach at [private contact information redacted] Sincerely, Anita Grove Executive Director  Autumn  Please consider your training location elsewhere. The panhandle of Florida (as  McDonald  well as the Gulf Coast as a whole) is a major Migratory Route for migrating birds each Spring & Fall. It is a resting/fueling ground for birds both before and after they make their journey across the Gulf of Mexico. Also, some threatened species make their home here year-round (i.e., Red-cockaded Woodpecker) The Gopher Tortoise is already threatened in this area and any further encroachment would surely drive this species away. Please consider your No Action Alternative. Leave Blackwater & Tate's Hell State Forest for the wildlife and people who want to enjoy it.  Barbara Albrecht  BFA, PWA, Audubon, NPA, UWF  Gulf Regional Airspace Strategic Initiative – Public Input The Mission Statement for the Blackwater River State Forest is to “protect Florida and its people from the dangers of wildfire and manage the forest resources through a stewardship ethic to assure they are available for future generations”. This was the mission for years, then in early 2013, the following was quietly added to the mission, "Cooperate with the United States military to facilitate mission essential training in a manner that does not adversely impact natural resources, forest management, or public access." The citizens of NW FL recognize that budget cuts have forced the Forest Service to become creative in funding their missions (timber management, recreation, and wildlife habitat) and managing the forest for multiple user groups. Countless user groups have volunteered hundreds of thousands of hours to assist and manage the forest for their organizations, because these lands were purchased for the public by the state and placed into preservation. Now, we are being told, informed without the opportunity to  Name  Organization  Comment  have a respectful dialogue, that military operations will close selected areas to the public. Unlike Eglin AFB, Hurlburt, or Tyndall AFB – the BWRSF lands are open areas with many in-holdings. That is private land owners. Eglin AFB has been planning mission expansions for their base operations for the past 10 years. Eglin should have been buying more land; adjacent land for these maneuvers, instead of giving land away for sewage spray fields, allowing subdivisions to encroach on their boundary, and permitting highways through their range. As a Nature Conservancy staff member for the Gulf Coastal Plain Ecosystem Partnership (GCPEP) for many years, we worked hard to openly discuss various missions with the Partnership who had enrolled their contiguous lands (totaling 1,050,000 Million acres) as wildlife corridors and habitat for the multitude of species that are year round residents, migrants, or transient in this last remaining sliver of habitat. Understanding each agencies charge, while working together to manage the landscape brought trust and success to this area through healthier uplands and aquatic systems. (http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/florid a/placesweprotect/blackwater-river-state-forest.xml) My biggest concerns with the GRASI project and I hope the EIS can address these concerns in a holistic manner, are the highly erodible sandy soils we have in this area and the proposed activities in and around the creek and river system. The Blackwater River system and watershed have been in peril for years (due to the logging industry in the 1800-1900’s, which denuded the forest and caused heavy sedimentation in the riverine system, cattle which were allowed to roam and defecate in the creeks through the 1980s, ATVs and other trucks that mud bog and ‘play’ in the system still to this day). This system, once dominated by deep water, pools, riffles, and upwards of 45-55% woody material (trees) in the system which served to stabilize banks and provide a habitat for an important fishery; today the system is choked by sand (shallow water is warmer and thus holds less oxygen, which is a hazard for aquatic specis) in active recreational areas (canoeing trails), whereas the highly important and sensitive gravel bars which are found throughout the upper reaches in areas not frequented by the public because access is difficult and in cases dangerous. The Forest Service governed by the State of FL and the Trustees, under political pressure and political favors have already reversed a previous ban to now allow deadhead logging in a riverine system recognized as an ‘Outstanding FL Water’ (which should protect it from any disturbance or impairment, water quality or habitat wise) and which also holds a second title ‘Special Waters of the State’. The PUBLIC is disturbed by these rule changes, the lack of enforcement, and manner in which these continued assaults are impacting and jeopardizing the system. What makes this scenario worse is that scientists, ecologists, and biologists are not involved in the decision making process, instead businessmen and elected officials dabbling in politics are making decisions. It is similar to having your neighborhood plumber provide medical advice for your child; it makes no sense. The Blackwater Watershed is divided into small segments, named HUC units, for the purposes of dividing the system into smaller components is to be able to better identify and delineate issues, like contaminants and water quality impairments. Every HUC Unit within the Blackwater River System is on the 303(d) list for water quality impairments; please let me remind you that Outstanding FL Waters are to be more protected than waters without special attributes. The Indian River, along Florida’s East Coast was also identified as an Outstanding FL Water and has suffered from years of neglect, relaxing water quality standards, and eutrophication until now we are seeing and noting record level deaths of manatees and dolphins, as well as dwindling crab and  Name  Organization  Comment  fish populations. I participated in the Ten Year Review for the forest; this issue to use the land for military maneuvers was not brought up. I participated in the Blackwater River State Forest Liaison Meetings, and guess what? This was not brought up. Why Not? If these issues are not to be discussed with the public, then why bother with these meetings? The health of the river, the native species that use and depend on the system and all the ecosystem services that this system provides (large feeder for the East Bay System) depend on how the uplands and the transition zone are managed. There are numerous threatened and endangered aquatic species which have been studied and identified in this system. They include the following: • Four fish species (Blackmouth Shiner, Blacktip Shiner, Florida Chub, and the Gulf Sturgeon); • Five Amphibian Species (Pine Barrens Tree Frog, Dusky Gopher Frog, FL Bog Frog, Tiger Salamander and the Flat Woods Slamander); • Four species of reptiles (Eastern Indigo Snake, Gopher Tortoise, Alligator Snapping Turtle, and FL Pine Snake); • Eight aquatic insects (Blue Sand-river Mayfly, Dolania Mayfly, Diminutive Clubtail, Townes Clubtail, Peters’ Little Sister Sedge, Zigzag Blackwater River Caddisfly, Say’s Spiketail Dragonfly and Leuctra Stonefly); and • Ten Plants (Peidmont Jointgrass, Panhandle Lily, Hummingbird Flower, Chapman’s Butterwort, Small-flowered Meadowbeauty, White-topped Pitcher Plant, Wherry’s Sweet Pitcher Plant, Chaffseed, Chapman’s Yellow-eyed Grass and Mountain Laurel) In addition, the diversity of aquatic insects identified in the Blackwater System include: • 33 species of Dragonflies and Damselflies; • 42 species of Mayflies; • 21 species of Stoneflies; • 24 species of Caddisflies; • 3 species of Dobsonflies and Fishflies; • 12 species of True Water Bugs; • 20 species of Beetles; and • 52 genera of Midges. Lastly, before we identify components of the GRASI Scoping Process which we would like to see addressed, the amount of money spent on 319 grants to address sedimentation issues, culverts, inadequate bridges built into the riparian zone, abandoned sand and gravel pits, and bank stabilization efforts may be undone by these proposed activities. The 319 grants received for the Blackwater are the tens of millions of dollars, and as stated earlier the Forest has worked hard and become very creative to stretch each dollar to accomplish their mission. http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/success319/Section319III_FL.cfm#2 Please make no mistake, the Florida Forest Service, like the FL Dept of Environmental Protection and the FL Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission are all governed by the Governor of the State of FL – who is a business man focused on developing business without regard for the cost of our environmental resources. Individuals working for these agencies essentially have their hands tied; or chance losing their job if they question or oppose the Governors Mission. That is what makes this covert military maneuver so disheartening. The GRASI Scoping Process feedback I hope you will address is as follows: • The tiny map on the un-numbered GRASI handout, page 4, entitled BRSF Tactical Areas – identifies hundreds of vehicle stream/wetland crossings. The VSWC is a large and heavy piece of equipment. How can you mitigate or restore the hydrologic impact that the use of these vehicles will cause in these low lying sensitive areas? • How many stream/wetland crossings exactly are there? Can I see a legible map of these areas, please? • What is the timeframe (years or months) that these activities will commence? • The map appears to have a majority of activity in the Hutton Unit? This area is very stressed due to anthropogenic activities and illegal dumping over the years. Our on-going monitoring of this area has shown a small amount of improvement since steps have been taken to alleviate stressors. The AFB activities may reverse this trend. • Several stream and wetland crossings are slated in the vicinity where restoration has occurred.  Name  Organization  Comment  On-going monitoring had identified improvements in these areas, along the northern reaches of the forest. We are very concerned that your activities will impact these small steps in a negative manner. • The last page of the GRASI handout includes a table which identifies resource areas potentially affected by proposed action components. I am going to focus the next series of questions on this table: o Cross-country Vehicle Movement – Water Quality, sedimentation, woody material will all potentially be impacted. Water Quality via oil, brakes, etc. entering the system. Sedimentation as these big heavy equipment moves through the system. As log jams and snags are encountered, what will these maneuvers entail? Removal, bad for the system. Drive over, bad for the habitat (the holes that they make), what will be done? o Vehicle Stream and Wetland Crossings – impact hydrologic system. Heavy vehicles will create drainage ditches which alter the hydrology of the system and will potentially reroute water potentially causing future sedimentation in the system. We recognize that these disturbances coupled with our 65” of annual rainfall unwittingly create these issues. o Emplacement of Obstacles – will any of these obstacles be placed in a stream/creek/wetland system? Will they be removed? o What is the timeframe for these missions? Yearly, monthly, what type of duration? Please include me in the distribution list for any and all activities within the following watersheds: Perdido, Escambia/Conecuh, Blackwater, Yellow/Shoal, Choactawhatchee, and St. Andrew. Who am I? I am Barbara Albrecht, Watershed Coordinator for the University of West Florida, Center for Environmental Diagnostics and Remediation; President of the Bream Fishermen Association (the oldest citizen based water quality monitoring group in the state of FL and perhaps the US); Executive Director of the Panhandle Watershed Alliance; and, I also represent the Native Plant Society – Longleaf Chapter, and am the Conservation Chair for the Francis M.

I will be e-mailing US Senator Nelson to tell him not to endanger the environment for training troops.  Bennett Hoffman  I was going to make changes to this letter... but it expresses exactly WHAT I WANT TO SAY! I am writing to express my concerns and opposition to the use of Tate's Hell State Forest for military training exercises by Eglin Air Force Base as proposed under the Gulf Regional Airspace Strategic Initiative (GRASI) Landscape Initiative (GLI). The original purpose for converting the Tate's Hell tract from county property to state-owned forest was CONSERVATION: (1) for hydrological protection and restoration of Apalachicola Bay, (2) to conserve many rare and endangered habitats and species of flora and fauna found within the fragile Tate's Hell State Forest environment, and (3) to preserve traditional and recreational uses of the land by the citizens whose tax monies were used for establishing this State Forest. The creation of Tate's Hell State Forest through the use of public funds was supported by Franklin County government and residents to protect and conserve the land for public and environmental benefits, and NOT for any usurping of those benefits by the military. There are serious consequences associated with the GRASI proposal and the following concerns must be considered. All plants, wetlands, water, insects, birds and wildlife will be severely impacted by the fuel exhaust of the low-flying (tree level) helicopters. That water flows into the already dying Apalachicola Bay. The  Name  Organization  Comment  noise alone from these planes, helicopters and training exercises will devastate all birds and wildlife, as well as create untold problems for citizens living anywhere near that vicinity. The life cycles of nocturnally foraging animals will be disrupted by holding military training exercises primarily at night. The airspace used by private pilots to land at our local airports will be compromised by giving priority for the use of that same airspace to military aircraft. Any military radar emitters installed within Franklin County have the potential to disrupt civilian and private pilot communication devices and may even have health consequences for citizens who live nearby. Many of the residents of Franklin County depend on the bounty Tate's Hell State Forest provides through hunting and fishing to feed their families in this economically disadvantaged community. The unique ecology found within Tate's Hell State Forest such as the Dwarf Cypress Swamp and over 90 species of rare and endangered wildlife (such as the Red-Cockaded Woodpecker) are at risk of being damaged or destroyed by military training exercises and/or accidents that may occur during such military usage. Tate's Hell State Forest has one of the largest Black Bear populations in Florida, as well as a very large population of nesting American Bald Eagles. Tate's Hell is also part of the Great Florida Birding Trail and is visited by birdwatchers, photographers, nature lovers, hunters, fishermen, local residents and tourists from far away. Lastly, during the Scoping Meetings, the public was not even allowed to ask questions; any questions asked were ignored. For all of these reasons, I am resolutely opposed to the use of Tate's Hell State Forest for military training exercises. Sincerely, Bennett Hoffman  Beth Wright  Definition of Emitter -A device used to exude any signal, beacon, light, odor, liquid, fragrance, ionizing particles or any other type of signal. So, pretty much this is going to be another HAARP location going up in the middle of one of the most protected wildlife areas along the Gulf Coast? You want to build a military compound in the middle of one of the Most Protected Wildlife Areas Along the Gulf Coast? And you're trying to tell people who live in this area, who own land and homes in this area (because it's one of the most Protected Wildlife Areas Along the Gulf Coast), you want to tell us that what you propose will have no effect on this Protected Wildlife Area and the peaceful coexistence the people in this area have nurtured and sacrificed for in order KEEP this a Protected Wildlife Area. You know that you will do harm, you always do. The areas around any military installation become overcrowded and the infrastructure is always damaged and altered in the extreme. You will kill and destroy everything that is wonderful about Franklin County and the surrounding areas, and you know it. You. Know. It. So, please don't. It is a sad fact that the rain forests in South America are being mowed down for profit. Our United States Wildlife Areas are PROTECTED for very good reasons. They are protected from people who would harm or destroy them for profit. Who profits from this destruction in Tate's Hell? This presidential term will end in 2016. The damage done will linger far beyond that time. Don't let this project be another that will bring great harm and then be abandoned when the next election comes around. The damage will already be done. This is The United States of America, we are American Citizens and we do not want this.

Sincerely, Bill Chambers  Brandon Rincon  This letter is a notice of concern for the Eglin Air Force Base takeover of Black Water State forest. Black water plays a key role in ensuring the protection and recovery of imperiled species and the ecosystems upon which they depend (Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. . §1531 et seq. (1973), It provides public access with multiple recreational opportunities, it provides a safety net and a green way for species to make natural migrations, and it is a permanent fixture on the Florida land scape that symbolizes America’s best idea, our state and national parks. Due to the inadequate mission scheduling and oversight of Eglin’s test ranges, our public lands are at risk of being encroached upon with military range expansion proposals. Projects like these will jeopardize public access due to mission closures, and will be in direct violation of the endangered species act. I am also concerned that long-term use of these properties will include additional environmental and public use impacts not limited to those included in the Current Environmental Impact Statement that is being developed. It is still possible to provide national security to our nation without the destruction of state lands. It is an ethical imperative not to allow Eglin Air  Name  Organization  Comment  Force Base takeover Black Water state forest.  Brenda  Concerned  After reading your documents concerning GRASI, I have to admit I am very  Callaway  Citizen  concerned for the continued health of these natural areas. Too much wonderful work has been done to protect and facilitate the recovery of endangered species and habitat to now throw caution to the wind and allow troop activities in these protected areas. You say you will not be training in the areas where protected species live. Yes you will, you will be in their forest! You will be forging, with vehicles no less, Florida's only remaining pristine river! I am also concerned for the emotional health of the people who leave their stress-filled lives behind to seek solace in the forest. How will these maneuvers affect public access? How will they affect the public's enjoyment in the areas left available to us? We often hike these woods and I frankly do not want to be greeted by concertina wire, or maneuver noises on my strolls. I realize we need the military primed and ready to protect our freedoms, but this is not the place for such activities. Surely somewhere on your nearly half a million acres there is some place more appropriate. Others will speak much more eloquently than I can, but please, leave our natural areas alone. We have too few places where we can get away from the realities of life, Blackwater and Tate's Hell are two places where souls can be restored. Thank you.  BrendaLee Lennick  Concerned Citizen  I am writing to express my concerns and opposition to the use of Tate's Hell State Forest for military training exercises by Eglin Air Force Base as proposed under the Gulf Regional Airspace Strategic Initiative (GRASI) Landscape Initiative (GLI).

For all of these reasons, I am resolutely opposed to the use of Tate's Hell State Forest for military training exercises. Sincerely, BrendaLee Lennick  Brian  Florida Native  Tate's Hell State Forest (Liberty & Franklin Counties, and bordering the  Goebel  Plant Society  Gulf/Apalachicola Bay) and Blackwater River State Forest (Santa Rosa & Okaloosa Counties) proposed to be used for "robust" military air and land training!?! I believe the Air Force has more than enough training grounds already in existence! Destroying State Forest Land under the guise of Defensive training is a complete slap in the face to the environment and the citizens of Florida! I am totally against giving up any protected lands, State Parks or environmentally sensitive land period!  Bridget  I am opposed to the military's use of BRSF. It will have very negative affects on  DeArman  its longleaf pine ecosystem and the many endangered plant, bird and animal species that are found there including the Florida black bear, Red-cockaded woodpecker and the gopher tortoise. It will also negatively affect waterways flowing through the forest such as the Blackwater River, Juniper Creek, Coldwater Creek and Sweetwater Creek.  Carole Tebay  I write as a person who craves the freedom and beauty of wild places such as the Blackwater River State Forest. Beyond my personal needs, the very things that make Florida a wonderful place to live and visit are under great strain from shortsighted development and human activity. Without an aggressive effort, Florida will cease to be the very thing that makes it such a special place. We have an obligation to future generations to be responsible stewards. I know the needs of our military and the Forest Service are important, with that in mind, I am chagrined to voice my concerns on the GRASI Landscape Initiative. But, since the public was not given a chance to address questions to the panel about the Initiative during the recent presentation in Milton, FL I am left to speculate. I am concerned about the impact on the public's use of the Blackwater River State Forest during ground maneuvers and amphibious operations. And, I am concerned about the noise created by a “near optimum use of airspace.” We were given no idea how often GRASI activities would take place or if noise from aircraft would become the new normal. The Forest is a busy place. Many hunting activities have time and date restrictions. But, many forms of recreation, such as wilderness camping, horseback riding, hiking, hog hunting and paddling may take place without notice to the Forest Service. I question the ability of those involved with the Initiative to be aware of the public's use of the Forest and plan accordingly without placing restrictions on the use of the Forest. This is a public forest, I don't believe practicing for war there is compatible. A memory I cherish is arriving in the Forest before sunrise in an area where the red cockaded woodpeckers nest. As we stood in the dark I heard the blue jays awaken, then the cardinals. Just as the sun began to rise we heard the woodpeckers calling to each other and were able to see them emerge from their nests, repair their enemy repelling pine sap traps, and then, one-by-one, fly off in different directions to forage. Will I have the freedom to do this under GRASI, what will the noise level be, or will my visits be restricted? My companions on that morning came all the way from England for that  Name  Organization  Comment  experience, what affect will GRASI have on eco-tourism. Another morning I walked through a park-like savanna of longleaf and gasped at the beauty I beheld as I came upon one of the Forest's pitcher plant bogs. But, there is a stream running through that breathtaking bog. Is it one of the countless dots on your map showing amphibious operations? Early mornings I have put my kayak into the water to enjoy the burbling creek sounds as I glided along. Will the quiet be broken by an amphibious operation or the “near optimum use of airspace?” Will I even have the freedom to make these impulsive forays into the Forest? How will GRASI operations affect the burn program schedules in the Forest? The weather, seasons, hunting schedules, and breeding periods must now be considered. Burning is crucial to maintaining the health of the forest and safety of the residents, will military operations now take presidence over forest management? I hope that you will carefully consider my questions and I wish that I could hear your answers. Respectfully,  Carolyn D.  I am very much opposed to the use of the Tate's Hell areas of Franklin and  Rosier  Liberty counties as a training area for the AF. This is one of the last great natural areas of Florida and is widely renowned for recreation and wildlife. We have a 70 year old family camp deep in the woods there and do not want to see, hear jets in the skies above us. We treasure our way of life here in the less populated regions of Florida. The preserve is there for a reason, please keep your training in the areas you already have available. Thank you, Carolyn D. Rosier  Carolyn  Please reconsider turning Tate's Hell into a training site. This land is a fragile  Davis Bellah  ecosystem which does well to support a few bear, whitetails, razorbacks, squirrels, birds, alligators, several species of snakes, and a few people. The people are mostly poor and use subsistence hunting and fishing to help feed their families. My extended family has owned property in the vicinity for 70 years. We gather there in mass several times each year with several of the kinfolk who live nearer using the property often. We have lots of children (with more coming every year) who could be endangered by unexploded munitions, etc. Please reconsider and do not degrade our forests and river through inappropriate use!  Charles Elliott  As a retired veteran I am more than supportive of this proposed operation. I personally was involved with activities on all branches of the military bases throughout the country and there is no more detailed, dedicated, professional group of managers overwatching the natural environment. Come use the forest, you will make a positive impact by opening up areas for the wildlife to use and the men and women using the are will also contribute to our economy.  Charles Lee, Director of Advocacy  Audubon Florida  Audubon Florida, the state’s oldest and largest conservation organization, founded in 1900, provides the following comments on the U.S. Air Force proposal to utilize Blackwater River State Forest and Tate’s Hell State Forest for military training exercises as described in the scoping documents. Audubon Florida and its local chapters have invested considerable time, effort and funds in collaboration with the managers of both of these state forests to advance important ecological management efforts designed to improve habitat for important species, including but not limited to listed species such as the Redcockaded Woodpecker. Audubon is knowledgeable about, and very appreciative of United States Air Force efforts toward land and wildlife conservation, which have been evident on such tracts as Avon Park Bombing Range, Tyndall Air Force Base and Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. We know that under proper circumstances, and with adequate planning and careful management, some types of military exercise uses may be compatible with  Name  Organization  Comment  land and wildlife conservation. With that in mind, we have examined the uses at Blackwater River State Forest, and Tate’s Hell State Forest proposed in the GRASI initiative. Our review has convinced us that elements of the current proposals of the U.S. Air Force for military exercises in these two state forest units are far reaching, expansive, and overly intrusive in the natural environment of both state forests. We have the following comments specifically addressing the scoping of the EIS: (1) Alternatives should be developed in the EIS process to exclude significant sensitive portions of both Blackwater and Tate’s Hell State Forests from the impact of most of the proposed activities, including operations involving vehicles, aircraft, and training munitions, noise-generating expendables and pyrotechnic devices. The exclusion areas should be based upon detailed, ground-truthed mapping of habitats for rare and listed species, and high quality natural communities. In general, operations and constructed facilities need to be excluded from such areas, with adequate buffer zones. (2) Monitoring and control of these operations, even if limited as indicated in the suggested alternatives below, should involve credentialed third-party observers with the power to intervene with commanders in the field to curtail or alter operations on a real-time basis to protect fragile resources. (3) Alternatives should also incorporate the following limitations on military training exercises: (a) The operation of wheeled or tracked military vehicles in wetlands of any kind should be prohibited. Vehicle operations of all kinds should be limited to existing roads, and then be outside of designated exclusion areas as indicated in (1) above. (b) The construction of airstrips or improvement of existing airstrips for fixed-wing aircraft use should not be permitted within either state forest. Aircraft operations should be limited to rotary aircraft. (c) Rotary aircraft operations, Temporary Combat Support Areas, Bivouacking, Assembly Areas, Hardened Camp Sites, and Emplacement of Obstacles should be limited to existing cleared areas and previously disturbed sites. (d) Installation of Emitter Sites should be limited to existing cleared, disturbed areas, where line-of-site for emitter operation is available without clearing, topping, or trimming old growth pine forest habitat vital to Redcockaded Woodpecker nesting and reproduction. (e) Amphibious operations should be limited to small boat maneuvers (not heavy landing craft). (f) Military training exercises should be limited in time and duration to avoid conflict with the traditional public access to these state forests and to avoid interference with the quality of experiences in these areas by members of the general public. In conclusion, Audubon Florida considers Blackwater River State Forest and Tate’s Hell State Forest to be among Florida’s premier ecological assets. We believe that conducting military training exercises in these areas would require extraordinary care; detailed natural resource oriented planning and scrupulous monitoring. It is important to note that significant portions of the lands affected by this proposal were acquired under environmental land acquisition programs such as Preservation 2000, or Florida Forever, using funds appropriated and/or produced by bond sales which have specific land conservation covenants attached. While compatible uses may be considered, we believe that the purpose and function of these tracts must remain primarily dedicated to the conservation purposes for which they were acquired. Charles Lee, Director of Advocacy Audubon Florida [private contact information redacted]  Cheryl Ann Griffin  Thanks for allowing us to comment and be added to the meeting minutes-with short notice, was unable to attend. We wish to thanks all our Military personnel for their service and dedication. We fly our flag, wear a yellow ribbon, daily. Our community is very patriotic … Apalachicola has the Vietnam Three Soldiers  Name  Organization  Comment  Monument, Carrabelle has Veterans’ Park and WW II Camp Gordon Johnston Museum with many activities supporting our troops. We are not against military – just against using our very fragile and precious Tate’s Hell State Forest or the Blackwater State Forest for “war games”. Both of these are the two largest state forests in Florida-with Blackwater being the oldest. We need to protect them. There has been lots of “why not to” and you have heard most – I’m probably repeating what you’ve already heard … but want to be another voice of NO!! As you are aware, our area is in dire straits with our Bay – and the famous seafood industries. We are trying to “Save our river, Save our bay” … we are one of the last pristine estuaries left in the USA and it needs protecting – not only for now but for the future generations of our area and economics. Tates Hell is a very delicate, intricate system, with complex ecological issues already… that are beginning to be addressed. Being a hydro biological area it is very important filtering system for the Apalachicola River Basin, and the nursery for most creatures of the Gulf of Mexico. Being an avid birder and environmentalist, this area needs our protection. We live in a major migratory flyway for not only our avian friends but also butterflies, dragonflies, and have many indigenous plants, trees, snakes, gopher tortoise, and others that need our protection. Let alone if in fact the ivory-billed woodpecker could still exist. (Blackwater area) Franklin County supports more than 60 documented Bald Eagle nests, amongst other nesting critters, avian or ground huggers, such as black bears, possible FL puma, etc. I know you will not “intentionally” endanger any of the above – but, just your presence… will have an effect – let alone any hide’n seek games, or God forbid, an accident. We already have restricted air space above us for military use. This whole idea/request seems to have political overtones – definitely don’t trust that!!! You are purchasing additional land around Eglin AFB – use that area? Try cross utilization with other branches of our military to use their land (which belongs to all of us also). Isn’t Eglin the largest US military site already – and you have scheduling issues? Need to work it out without destroying more protected land. There is a reason we have established state and federal land to be protected. I know you have thought about that?? We enjoy being the “forgotten coast” and want it to be left that way, for us and future generations. Most of Florida is being destroyed and don’t want to be added to the “list” I/We say NO !!! Thank you for your service, time, and considerations.

The original purpose for converting the Tate's Hell tract from county property to state-owned forest was CONSERVATION: (1) for hydrological protection and restoration of Apalachicola Bay, (2) to conserve many rare and endangered habitats and species of flora and fauna found within the fragile Tate's Hell State Forest environment, and (3) to preserve traditional and recreational uses of the land by the citizens whose tax monies were used for establishing this State Forest. The creation of Tate's Hell State Forest through the use of public funds was supported by Franklin County government and residents to protect and conserve the land for public and environmental benefits, and NOT for any usurping of those benefits by the military. There are serious consequences associated with the GRASI proposal and the following concerns must be considered. All plants, wetlands, water, insects, birds and wildlife will be severely impacted by the fuel exhaust of the low-flying (tree level) helicopters. That water flows into the already dying Apalachicola Bay. The noise alone from these planes, helicopters and training exercises will devastate all birds and wildlife, as well as create untold problems for citizens living anywhere near that vicinity. The life cycles of nocturnally foraging animals will be disrupted by holding military training exercises primarily at night. The airspace used by private pilots to land at our local airports will be compromised by giving priority for the use of that same airspace to military aircraft. Any military radar emitters installed within Franklin County have the potential to disrupt civilian and private pilot communication devices and may even have health consequences for citizens who live nearby. Many of the residents of Franklin County depend on the bounty Tate's Hell State Forest provides through hunting and fishing to feed their families in this economically  Name  Organization  Comment  disadvantaged community. The unique ecology found within Tate's Hell State Forest such as the Dwarf Cypress Swamp and over 90 species of rare and endangered wildlife (such as the Red-Cockaded Woodpecker) are at risk of being damaged or destroyed by military training exercises and/or accidents that may occur during such military usage. Tate's Hell State Forest has one of the largest Black Bear populations in Florida, as well as a very large population of nesting American Bald Eagles. Tate's Hell is also part of the Great Florida Birding Trail and is visited by birdwatchers, photographers, nature lovers, hunters, fishermen, local residents and tourists from far away. Lastly, during the Scoping Meetings, the public was not even allowed to ask questions; any questions asked were ignored. For all of these reasons, I am resolutely opposed to the use of Tate's Hell State Forest for military training exercises. Sincerely, Dale Cook  Daniel  This is concerning the Blackwater State Park in Santa Rosa county. I am a citizen  Stangeland  of the local community and frequent this park quite often. I go there for several reasons: wildlife, scenery, creeks and,most of all, peace and quiet. I completely opposed the idea of our military taking this away from me. This land was purchased by the state with my hard earned tax dollars to be used by the people of the state.  Darline  Private Citizen  No, no, no, stay out of Blackwater River State Forest. This is a place to take my  Larson  grandchildren and I hope they can take their children, grandchildren one day. And for that to happen the military needs to stay away. The more activity in that forest the more potential for damage. I do not want to see any military vehicles in BRSF. They have poor fuel efficiency and there will be fuel trucks out there and spillages will happen. I am military, born, raised, served and still work civil service but this is wrong, wrong, wrong.  Dean K. Jue  Private Citizen  I am concerned about this proposal because of its generality, the lack of any areas or habitats being declared off-limits to training exercises, and the lack of any forum for public input into the training exercises if this proposal is approved. Consequently, I am strongly opposed to this proposal in its current form despite my understanding for the need for such training exercises somewhere. Blackwater River State Forest (BRSF) has many species of rare plants and animals, some of which are federally-listed and some of which are found nowhere else in Florida except the BRSF. Many of them are associated with pitcher plant bogs and wetlands. These bogs and wetlands are very easily impacted and human footprints through such areas can be evident for months from just a single day's visit. The impact of a single training event with amphibious vehicles through such areas would impact the wetland or bogs for years!! Tates Hell State Forest (THSF) has fewer documented records of federally-listed or rare species but they do occur there as well. Like the BRSF, it too has wetlands and bogs that are equally sensitive as those in BRSF. Both state forests are used by hunters, fishermen, campers, hikers, and nature enthusiasts for their recreational activities. They often have very specific locations within those state forests to which they travel. These users must all be kept informed with the latest information about the dates of any proposed training activities within the two state forests so that they can find alternative recreational sites if necessary. As a minimum level of modifications to the Draft EIS to make it approach acceptability to me, I propose the following modifications to the proposal: 1) working in conjunction with designated representatives of all the various recreational groups of the two state forests, state agency archaeologists and historians, state agency biologists, and the  Name  Organization  Comment  state natural heritage program (the Florida Natural Areas Inventory), identify the geographic areas of the two state forests that will always be excluded from these training exercises because of their environmental sensitivity, historical value, or importance to recreational users of the forest. 2) unless there is a declaration of a national emergency, put a limit on the number of times such training exercises will occur on these state forests. A reasonable number may be once per month. 3) unless there is a declaration of a national emergency, require Eglin Air Force Base to notify all Florida Panhandle media such as newspapers and radio stations as well as through a regularly-maintained Eglin Air Force Base website of the location of such activities two weeks prior to their anticipated use. As part of this notification process, a mechanism must be developed for public feedback on the proposed usage and those public concerns must be publicly-addressed by Eglin on their website prior to the training event and the possible consequences of such public input may results in modifications to the training event up to canceling the training at the original proposed site. 4) There must be some responsibility explicitly stated about the consequences of violations of the agreed-upon usage should it occur (e.g., inadvertent destruction of a sensitive wetland). Restoration, fines, and up to removal of an area from any future training activities should be some of the possible consequences. 5) There needs to be an explicit statement about the duration of this proposal (e.g., 5 years with an option to renew and amend). It should not be in perpetuity.  Deborah Roberts  None  I am writing to express my concerns and opposition to the use of Tate's Hell State Forest for military training exercises by Eglin Air Force Base as proposed under the Gulf Regional Airspace Strategic Initiative (GRASI) Landscape Initiative (GLI).

Taylor [private contact information redacted]  Name  Organization  Comment  Delores R.  My property adjoins Tate's Hell State Forrest and I am asking you please do not  Hardin  do your military training exercises here. It has taken the state a long time and a lot of money to restore the area in order to restore and protect our watershed and the habitat for bears, wolves, etc. Our county was used and abused by the military for World War II training and there is still junk all over that they left behind. Also, our water quality is of utmost importance for the oysters and scallops in our bay. It is already suffering due to lack of fresh water in the Apalachicola River. I beg you please don't do this.  Denise  Personal  I am opposed to the plans for the Air Force to use Tate's Hell. Our area has been  Butler  negatively affected by our water issues and that is impact enough on our fragile environment and on our economy which depends on our natural-ness. This is a terrible idea and the residents and taxpayers of Franklin County were not notified until it appears this is a "done deal".  Don  I strongly oppose use of public lands such as BRSF and Tate's Hell for military  Stillwaugh  training operations. These natural areas are fragile enough without the diverse impacts of various military exercises. Please reconsider these proposals immediately!  Doug Carter  Individual -St George Island  This note is directed at both emitter sites and training activities in Tates Hell Forest. 11 September 2013 Comments on Eglin AFB Proposed Grasi Initiative After reading and listening to the presentation on the GRASI Initiative I must admit I am more than confused about the scope of the proposal the AFB is making and therefore have to oppose much of it until such time as more information can be proposed. My opposition is based on the impact this will have in a number of areas including but not limited to the following: 1) No alternatives have been proposed so that the public can weigh in and help the military find alternatives. This is both partially driven by the vagueness of the proposal itself especially with respect to the activities that will take place but also due to the targeted nature of this proposal. That is this proposal is specifically targeted at the use of publicly protected areas because of their remote nature and the desirability with regards to the purposes that have been stated. The later issue is of concern as these areas were specifically paid for by the taxpayer to protect lands and ecosystems and this intent is clear when reading the Florida Forest Service Web site from which I have extracted some information below. The last sentence (in parantheses) that clearly states what the primary purpose of the Forest Service is and how this fits into that. “The natural resources found on Tate's Hell State Forest are very diverse due to the unique and various natural community types. At one time Tate's Hell State Forest supported at least 12 major community types which included: wet flatwoods, wet prairie, seepage slope, baygall, floodplain forest, floodplain swamp, basin swamp, upland hardwood forest, sandhill, pine ridges, dense titi thickets and scrub. Currently, the forest contains approximately 107,300 acres of hydric communities such as wet prairie (contains a vast diversity of plant species), wet flatwoods, strand swamp, bottomland forest, baygall, and floodplain swamp. Past management practices have disrupted the function of the natural ecosystems on Tate's Hell State Forest. The restoration of these ecosystems is a primary objective of the Florida Forest Service.” It is not clear how the GRASI initiative as it relates to Tate’s Hell forest can be pushed forward without impacting the primary objective of the Forest Service. 2). The purpose of the proposal has not been clearly defined especially with respect to the need to do ground operations in these protected areas. It appears that what started out as a local initiative to share airspace and build an airspace plan that could serve all has grown into a land grab by the operational groups at Eglin. Pushing  Name  Organization  Comment  this plan forward under the umbrella of the need to aid training for our troops that will be deployed overseas does not help eliminate this concern. 3) The social and economic effects are not clearly stated in any fashion. Vague references to potential jobs have been made but there is no clear definition of how or even why these proposed “limited actions” would generate any jobs other than perhaps service in a convenience store. And given that no details on the scope duration or even planned events have been given (other than a listing) one can only infer that all the social and economic effects will be negative. That is lower quality of life for persons living in this region as helicopter come in and out or fixed wing aircraft approach a “KTM or MTE” or negative economic impact because this once pristine area is now being fouled by the constant noise of an army on the move. This is not acceptable to anyone and just because the population base is not large enough to make as large of a complaint does not mean it is acceptable here. 4) Environmental Consequences: The impact that these proposed actions could have on the local area are so widespread that I am shocked that anyone would seriously even consider this initiative, especially as it relates to any action on the ground. Vectoring to various emitters if limited to high altitude and limited in terms of time of day and to fixed wing aircraft does likely not have a large environmental impact (although I am not sure what is being used to run this equipment and how likely it can easily be placed in remote sites without a negative impact) but any forces at or near the ground in these remote pristine areas is nothing but bad news. To consider this seriously when the water that flows from Tates Hell forest is going into what is considered one of the most pristine estuaries on the east coast is at best irresponsible. It is beyond ludicrous to think that this proposal is coming at a time when the State of Florida is asking the Supreme Court of the United States to protect the Apalachicola Bay by limiting the fresh water use some 200-300 miles upstream. Yet at the same time we are supposed to believe that landing men and helicopters in and around this same bay will have no negative impact when this is less than 20 miles upstream. Please consider your logic here. Assurances from the military that all will be well are promises that cannot be kept as there are things that we cannot control. It will only take one mistake on refueling, one mistake on bringing in non-native species, one mistake of a crash to have an impact that could change the dynamics dramatically on this bay. Finally please also consider the scope of what is being protected here. Tates Hell Forest was put in the public trust to protect these ecosystems and is home to several endangered species (now making a comeback). The ecosystem here is not too different from the Okefenokee Swamp in South Georgia which has now been declared a National Landmark and those who put it in the public trust and protected it from use years ago are now considered to have great foresight. But what if instead this swamp had been used differently. Tates Hell today is about half the size of the Okefenokee but will I believe one day soon viewed in the same way. An area for careful public recreation but an area we need to work to preserve not to use for commercial or military activities on any large scale. (Again this is the primary objective of the State’s Forest Service). 5) Potential Human Health Consequences. This is probably frankly the least concerning other than from a stress standpoint. The stress will come from overflights, and concern about the bay and the livelihood that all depend on in this area. None of this is directly measureable but it will be there nonetheless. In short unless enormous detail is provided this proposal should be rejected out of hand as it violates a sacred covenant between the State of Florida and its People. Protecting the ecosystems of Tates Hell Forest ultimately protects the ecosystems of the Apalachicola Bay. The State has invested a lot to protect both and this should  Name  Organization  Comment  be honored. Not just because it is the right thing to do and a promise was made to the citizens of Florida when land was purchased but also because this is what preservation is all about. As the military considers closing down bases and retiring old areas perhaps this is where it should focus in terms of training rather than extending its reach into “one of pristine estuaries on the east coast”. Just as the military is trying to protect and defend the people of the United States so are people of this area trying to protect the natural ecosystem so that future generations will be able to enjoy it as well. Respectfully submitted, Doug Carter, [private contact information redacted]  Dylan  Retired Marine  As a former service member I cannot see how using a state park for exercises is  Brown  key to mission success.

Just please leave Tate's Hell the way it is, quiet and beautiful, a National Treasure. Thanks for your time.... Gary and Donna Shannon  Gathana Parmenas  I wish to voice my opposition to the use of Tate's Hell State Forest for Air Force training. The proposal shows three airstrips, more than in Blackwater, despite the notation that THSF is the less important training area. THSF map shows one airstrip which is not near any roads, despite assurances that no clearing will be  Name  Organization  Comment  done. Additionally, the note that 3/4 of an acre is the minimum cleared area for other uses does not put a maximum limit, nor discuss the ongoing maintenance which would be needed to keep trees out of the areas. All activities involving helicopters, radar, clearing, etc., have the potential to be highly disruptive to the plant and animal life, including 90 plus endangered species. Please include humans among these species, since the population of Franklin County is under severe economic pressure and many depend on the THSF for food to survive. Recent economic development studies all show the THSF as a vital component for future tourist development. Nature tours, including tours for wildflowers, butterflies and rare native plant species, will all be impaired by the environmental impacts of the training. Likewise, hunting and fishing must remain unimpaired, and hopefully improved, for the future of our county. As a resident of Franklin County, I enjoy taking visitors camping in the forest during non-hunting season. I object to the idea that the training exercises will be at night and scheduled to avoid hunting season. I cannot imagine visitors (or myself) wanting to return after hearing helicopters overhead, or encountering middle of the night exercises. When THSF was created, it was promised to be restored to natural conditions and great effort has gone into beginning that process, including removing roads and restoring the hydrologic flow, so vital for the health of the Apalachicola River and the Gulf of Mexico as a whole. The promise of a nature preserve to the north of Carrabelle played a large part in my decision to move there in the 1990s. What is now being proposed is a betrayal of that promise. The Air Force has many options nationally for areas to use as training grounds. The residents of Franklin County do not have other options. Please abandon your plans to use Tate's Hell State Forest for expanded Air Force training exercises.  George  Here we go again -no sooner do Florida's citizens get land promised for  Sibley  conservation and water protection then some fool comes up with a plan to use it for something else. Natural Florida is going down the tubes everywhere, but natural areas are essential for many basic processes we all need to live. Conservation and habitat for our dwindling wildlife are important in themselves. They should not be just what we do with land for which we haven't come up with some other use. Local residents and Franklin County's Board of Commissioners have already reminded us and you that Tate's Hell State Forest was created with public money to protect and conserve the land for public benefits, yet public participation was not allowed at your Scoping Meeting. A project like this should not go forward behind closed doors. This is public land, and the public has a right to decide what it should be used for. Actually, we already did.  Greg Pixley  I disagree with any/all activities that will further restrict or limit Blackwater 's land and airspace use from general aviation. The recreational airfield at Munson provides a rare capability for general aviation pilots to enjoy state parks. State parks should not be used to expand federal training options.  Helen Bell  Blackwater River State Forest is a natural treasure. It does not need disruption from military training activities.

I attended the Milton public meeting and feel that I heard one thing there. My later reading of the brochure that we received led me to feel that we hadn't gotten the "whole" story and increased the concerns I have for whether Blackwater is an appropriate location for the military exercises proposed. My primary concerns are three-fold: 1) damage or destruction of the natural resources such as environmentally sensitive areas with native plants, trees, wetlands, pitcher plant bogs, creeks, streams, and rivers as well as habitats and corridors for wildlife, especially protected species in the Forest; 2) noise pollution from aircraft, military vehicles, and use of "noise-generating expendables;" and 3) safe access by the public to the Forest for recreational purposes. In regard to #1, I am quite concerned that use of motorized vehicles, especially with "vehicle stream and wetland crossing" coupled with "cross-country dismounted movements" has the potential to cause significant damage, erosion or destruction of environmentally sensitive areas. How will troops know that they are in a pitcher plant area or a wetland with protected species? Why are vehicles being used to cross any wetlands? I thought we were told that vehicles would have to stay on roads. As for #2, noise pollution, my understanding at the meeting was that it would be minimal, simply coming in, dropping personnel and then coming back to retrieve them. The brochure implies that it is MUCH more significant than that. Supposedly, most of these exercises are at night -such activity may be intrusive on people camping in recreation areas, even if the actual exercise is not taking place right at that location. The noise of gunfire even if only blanks are used, can be upsetting for those of us who are using the Forest for hiking, canoeing, fishing. We are cognizant of designated hunting seasons, but random gunfire is unnerving. I am frequently hiking or working on trails in the Forest and can attest to this fact. As for #3, the brochure notes that there will be road closings during exercises, but that is just one aspect. My concern is whether there will be closures that will deny access by the citizens of our state to their public forest which states as one of its missions "to provide for resource-based outdoor recreation opportunities." There is no mention of military mission. We have already experienced closure of trails in one section of the Forest last January when there was a "wounded warrior" project. Although we appreciate our men and women of the armed forces and recognize that this event was providing an opportunity for those grievously wounded while serving their country, to have a positive outdoor experience in the Forest, some of us wondered at the time, if there would be more military-related events that would close off access to the recreational resources that are supposed to be available to all of our citizens. The military exercises being proposed raise that specter again. I am also concerned about the safety of the public who are enjoying the outdoors and encounter someone on a military mission. It could be equally dangerous for the military personnel because some of our citizens carry guns that aren't loaded with blanks. I sincerely hope that if this project moves forward that there are no unfortunate "collateral damage" type accidents. I appreciate the opportunity to  Name  Organization  Comment  provide my issues for consideration in the Environmental Impact Statement study that will be conducted and I will eagerly peruse the draft EIS document when it becomes available. Thank you. -Helen Wigersma  James A.  I write to strongly oppose the proposed GRASI project as an ecological disaster  Brady  waiting to happen. The activities that are described in your brochure are sure to disturb the ecological balance of BWRSF, with which I am familiar. Disturbance of wildlife and its habitat will result from air operations and amphibious maneuvers, as well as the preparation and maintenance of emitters, landing areas, drop zones, etc. If GRASI is implemented, BWRSF will no longer be an environmentally sound public state forest, open to multi-use by a wide variety of citizens, but rather will become a military enclave degraded by day to day operations. BWRSF currently serves as a glowing example of recovered longleaf pine forest, a small remnant of the great longleaf pine forest that once covered millions of acres in the SE United States, and part of a national effort to restore the ecological balance that it provided. It is also a corridor for tens of species of migratory birds, some considered threatened or at risk by federal standards, which cross the Gulf of Mexico twice a year on their way to and from breeding grounds. Furthermore, the state forest provides wintering habitat for tens of other species of birds that do not migrate past the coastal plain. The year-round intrusion of military operations into the forest will significantly degrade the habitat upon which these birds rely, and will add to the pressure those species are already under. It is inconceivable that amphibious operations in the forest will not have an equally or worse negative impact on the waterways that cross the forest than the land operations. The soils of the forest are soft and easily eroded, and the instability of creek and river banks during high water flow is notorious; this natural tendency will be exacerbated by heavy vehicular use to the detriment of the many fish and invertebrate species that will be negatively affected by increased sedimentation along the waterway. As a former Ecology Officer on two Naval Air Stations, I find it curious that the BRAC process, which certainly requires an Environmental Impact Statement, apparently does not take into account the long-term impact on a receiving installation when consolidation is dictated by closure of another installation. I recall the DOD directive that stated that "we hold these lands in trust for now and future generations." It seems ironical that this proposal will help keep EAFB's pristine longleaf pine forest and its inhabitants from further degradation by passing that effect on to state lands nearby. The proposed use of BWRSF for GRASI operations is shortsighted and offers no redeeming value that supercedes the ecological services and public use opportunities the forest now offers as a state forest. While unfamiliar personally with Tate's Hell State Forest, I know that my acquaintances who are familiar with that tract are equally opposed to GRASI operations in that forest, for reasons similar to those noted above. I add my voice to theirs.  James R. Hill, III  The proposal to open up Blackwater River State Forest and Tate's Hell Swamp to Air Force maneuvers is totally unacceptable. Already jet flight maneuvers over the Apalachicola River is so disturbing to those of us who seek solitude in these remote wilderness and wild areas because of the extremely loud and annoying sound pollution coming from above. Give us a break! BRSF and THSF are wildlife gems to be cherished and protected not used as worthless wastelands to be further degraded with erosion, intrusion, plus vehicular and foot traffic. The taxpaying public has a right to expect that our state and federal government would protect these "protected" lands in perpetuity for future generations, and not use political heavy-handedness to take them away under the guise of  Name  Organization  Comment  national security and air force training. Eglin Air Force Base is plenty large enough for the government to find space there for their maneuvers. Please stay out of our state and national forests.  Jane B.  Use of Tate's Hell for training is irresponsible.

These public lands are a source of recreation, as well. Consider training on abandoned airfields.  Janet R. Lloyd  Self  I am very concerned about the proposed military activities in Blackwater River State Forest. This forest is a public area used by many different groups and individuals. The forest is used by hunters, horseback riders, people using kayaks/canoes/ inner tubes, hikers, birdwatchers, campers and folks just wanting to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city life. People use the forest night and day 24/7 -365 days a year. I cannot imagine how coordination of undisclosed (so far) numbers of military activities will fit with these activities. I see no way to know exactly when people are likely to be in any one particular area of the forest. Restrictions for use of areas of the forest would have to be put in place and this sounds like it would restrict public use of the forest. Some forest activities such as hunting are carefully controlled by date, but a family on the spur of the moment deciding to go camping would have no idea they might travel right into the middle of some night activities or they would have to find another place to camp if the drops or landings of the designated planes were in the area. I have been to the forest many times for many different reasons. I have been there to hike, participate in bird counts for the Forest Service, look for rare and endangered plants, look for butterfiles, look for migrating and resident birds and other wildlife. For a number of years I have done a nightjar survey (chuckwillswidows and nighthawks-types of birds that are active at night) on one of three nights right around the full moon in May. The count does not start until the moon clears the tall pines so we usually don't start until 10 pm. During these counts anywhere from 10-15 vehicles usually pass us. One year we almost had to give up the count because low flying planes were passing over head over and over on their way to drop bombs somewhere. They did stop just before we abandoned our count. The results of the count are compiled internationally to track the population of these birds. I have never been worried about conducting this survey, but if I thought folks with guns would be doing night activities, it would make me think twice about doing the count. Breeding bird surveys and Christmas Bird Counts (all have been done for years and years) occur during the other seasons of the year. Data are compiled internationally also and supply important data about bird populations and changes. The fall season is also important in the BRSF as migrants pass through on their way to Central and South America. It is an Important Bird Area. The ecosystems of different types in BRSF furnish places to live and food for many types of birds, insects and other invertebrates, fish, plants, reptiles and mammals. Fragmenting the forest is the worst things that could happen for endangered/threatened species here and there are many. The forests depend on fires that renew the forest. The timing is important and cannot be controlled by when military activities need to take place. Carrying out training activities in the waterways would be an ecological disaster. Accessing the waterways in easy spots might actually be areas of heavy erosion that are under constant care to avoid their destruction. The thought of heavy traffic through the stream crossings and on the fragile dirt roads is not pleasant. The roads wash during heavy rains and are under constant repair. Regular pick ups and four wheel drive vehicles often make ruts and I can only imagine that heavy traffic would  Name  Organization  Comment  make the roads more rutted than are now. This deterioration of the roadways would restrict public access since many of us do not drive trucks or four wheel drive vehicles. I have many, many concerns about these activities in BRSF and the effects on the forest life -including humans. We don't want to hear loud aircraft or bombs or shots while we are trying to have a quiet escape for a few hours or a weekend. The wildlife could not help being affected by the same noise levels and they cannot go home -they are home. Eglin Air Force Base is the largest base in the USA. It seems to me that better use of the huge area might be the best course instead of disrupting/disturbing more areas. I have many questions about how these activities would be coordinated, how often they would occur, etc, and hope more of this sort of info will be made available. It is interesting to me that the announcement of the meeting in Milton appeared in the Pensacola newspaper right before the meeting was to be held. There has not been another word about the proposal in the paper for the public to know about until today, the last day of public comment at this point. Why is this so? Anything that affects the public use of any area of the forest would affect many folks and wildlife/plants and I don't think has a place in BRSF. I do not favor any type of military use in BRSF at this point. Respectfully, Janet R. Lloyd [private contact information redacted]  Jennifer  I am a resident and property owner in Franklin County, Florida and I oppose any  Bowers  military use of Tate’s Hell as outlined in the GRASI Landscape Initiative by the Eglin Air Force Base. I moved to Carrabelle because of its rural and natural environment. Surrounded by the Apalachicola National Forest and Tate’s Hell State Forest, there are plenty of opportunities to enjoy hiking, canoeing, and camping in the back woods. As a Franklin county resident I often use these public recreational areas and treat them with the utmost respect of a conservationist. As a property owner I fear the military use of Tate’s Hell will diminish my property value. Who wants to move in next to an extension of a military training base? I dread the thought of the added noises military training planes and helicopters will add to my peaceful and relaxing days. As an environmentalist I want to see public lands protected and preserved. I fear for the animals that live in the forest, due to increased human training exercises and landing of planes. I wonder how many of the 90 endangered plant species will be killed while building these air strips and training areas and additional human activity. I hate the thought of taking my canoe down the river and have planes or helicopters disturb the tranquility that I seek, let alone seeing military personnel during one of my walks. The Tate’s Hell State Forest should be preserved for public land, not for military use. I am only one person, but please consider my plea and opposition to this action before making a decision to destroy this natural resource. Jennifer Bowers  Jim  I am against using either Tate's Hell or Blackwater Forests for military training or  Cummins  exercises. The military has a very poor track record of environmental awareness and/or care. Convenience cannot be a justifiable reason to put many endangered species of animal in the forest at risk. In addition the activities will be intense enough to cause some species to leave the forest, mainly black bears, and encroach on the surrounding populated area. We have bear problems now without more provocation. Tate's Hell Forest is a delicate environment, that will not survive the tramping of feet, nor the ATVs or other military vehicles. Accidents are inadvertent and will happen; an oil or fuel spill, or fire, or damage to stream banks will endanger the Apalachicola River and Bay. This is unacceptable. Do not use the forest for these activities.  Name  Organization  Comment  John  Private Citizen  It is your jop to protect and serve. In an indirect but important way, protecting  Desrosiers  the ecosystem of Tates Hell furthers that mission.

How does the military expect to maintain security of the troops during hunting seasons? How is the public to be informed of any possibility of restrictions to the use of BRSF? This area is designated for the public use not the military. So why can't you do your training within the confines of the Eglin AFB range? The Air Force and Army desire to intrude on public lands does not set well and are not really justified. Just because you want training outside of land owned/controlled by Eglin AFB will not be readily accepted by the local home owners and public at large. More information is needed to understand the true scope of the training objectives. STOP, Short Term Offender Program...what does this really mean? What are the objectives of this training program? A copy of the training syllabus is hereby requested.  Johnny Blue  Attention Mike Spaits I personally believe that any military use of this land would have a negative environmental impact to the land. I respectfully request that you count this as a vote against this project. Thank you. Johnny Blue  Joy Lynn Lewis  Personal  It is illusion that Tate' s Hell is unused property. Take your bombs to the dead spaces on this earth we have already destroyed with our bombs. Bombs away.  Kalisa Myers  Miracle Mile Plastic Response Team  I am currently living in California, but am writing because you are about to severely impact my childhood playgrounds-land that is supposed to be available to my children-not for military testing purposes, but for tree-climbing, bug-biting, exploring purposes. Children do not develop right if they are inside all the time. They come out weak and allergic to everything. They need natural playgrounds. Finally, why not develop this area into a major eco-tourist spot? Already the birding trail is popular. Let other states ruin their natural splendor, but keep yours-now that's investment- not just for the short-term.  Kathi Chalk  Private Citizen  I am opposed to allowing Eglin AFB to lease and use BRSF and Hell's Tate Swamp for maneuvers. I am appalled that Eglin and Governor Scott would make an aggrement as important to the citizens of Florida with such little notification and time for public comments. This pristine, wild and natural area belongs to the people of Florida, and should kept in the condition it is in, which so many people, groups, and organizations have achieved through research and hard work. I wonder why in the world Gov Scott would approve a proposal in this manner. It smacks of selling our souls for a bit of commerce to me!  Kathy Evilsizer  Retired  I am writing to express my concerns and opposition to the use of Tate's Hell State Forest for military training exercises by Eglin Air Force Base as proposed under the Gulf Regional Airspace Strategic Initiative (GRASI) Landscape Initiative (GLI). The original purpose for converting the Tate's Hell tract from county property to state-owned forest was CONSERVATION: (1) for hydrological protection and restoration of Apalachicola Bay, (2) to conserve many rare and endangered habitats and species of flora and fauna found within the fragile  Name  Organization  Comment  Tate's Hell State Forest environment, and (3) to preserve traditional and recreational uses of the land by the citizens whose tax monies were used for establishing this State Forest. The creation of Tate's Hell State Forest through the use of public funds was supported by Franklin County government and residents to protect and conserve the land for public and environmental benefits, and NOT for any usurping of those benefits by the military. There are serious consequences associated with the GRASI proposal and the following concerns must be considered. All plants, wetlands, water, insects, birds and wildlife will be severely impacted by the fuel exhaust of the low-flying (tree level) helicopters. That water flows into the already dying Apalachicola Bay. The noise alone from these planes, helicopters and training exercises will devastate all birds and wildlife, as well as create untold problems for citizens living anywhere near that vicinity. The life cycles of nocturnally foraging animals will be disrupted by holding military training exercises primarily at night. The airspace used by private pilots to land at our local airports will be compromised by giving priority for the use of that same airspace to military aircraft. Any military radar emitters installed within Franklin County have the potential to disrupt civilian and private pilot communication devices and may even have health consequences for citizens who live nearby. Many of the residents of Franklin County depend on the bounty Tate's Hell State Forest provides through hunting and fishing to feed their families in this economically disadvantaged community. The unique ecology found within Tate's Hell State Forest such as the Dwarf Cypress Swamp and over 90 species of rare and endangered wildlife (such as the Red-Cockaded Woodpecker) are at risk of being damaged or destroyed by military training exercises and/or accidents that may occur during such military usage. Tate's Hell State Forest has one of the largest Black Bear populations in Florida, as well as a very large population of nesting American Bald Eagles. Tate's Hell is also part of the Great Florida Birding Trail and is visited by birdwatchers, photographers, nature lovers, hunters, fishermen, local residents and tourists from far away. Lastly, during the Scoping Meetings, the public was not even allowed to ask questions; any questions asked were ignored. For all of these reasons, I am resolutely opposed to the use of Tate's Hell State Forest for military training exercises. HELP SAVE TATE'S HELL STATE FOREST!  Kelly Jones  Dear Mr. Spaits, I am writing in opposition to the proposed annexing of BRSF and THSF for DOD use. First, BRSF is one of the most valuable state properties in terms of unique ecological value, both in housing many rare and endemic flora and fauna that make up a rich part of Florida's natural heritage, as well as serving to connect the forests of EAFB with those of Conecuh NF in adjacent Alabama. All combined, these three properties form the largest contiguous tract of remaining longleaf pine forest. Many years and dollars have gone into the restoration of this gem of a forest, and doing anything to jeopardize the balanced stewardship that currently exists would be a tragedy. Second, BRSF is an excellent multi-use resource for the citizens of Florida, as well as the many visitors we have every year, who play an integral role in Florida's economy. Open access to properties like BRSF make up a long-standing part in the Florida panhandle's culture, and preserving this will serve not only those who are using it now, but hopefully countless generations to come. If congress was wrong to approve the BRAC proposed moves to EAFB, as well as the addition of the F-35 program, Florida should not have to pay for congress' miscalculations by giving up integrity of, and access to some of it's best remaining treasures. With these points in mind, I offer TWO VIABLE ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSED PLAN: 1)  Name  Organization  Comment  EAFB should become more adept at scheduling missions within EAFB's current property boundaries (some ranges and air space currently remain relatively unused for large parts of the day on many days), or 2) EAFB should begin looking at paying more for their new testing and training needs by purchasing some St. Joe Paper Company land that is also nearby, but is much less valuable ecologically or for public use. Either way, I believe strongly that our national security will be just as intact, and we won't have to lose things that we may otherwise never get back. Thank you for considering these comments. humbly, Kelly Jones  Kenny Presnell  Dear Sirs: RE: Opposition to the inclusion of Tate’s Hell State Forest in the US Air Force’s Gulf Regional Airspace Strategic Initiative (GRASI) Landscape Initiative I am writing to express my concerns and opposition to the use of Tate’s Hell State Forest for military training exercises. I was born and raised in the panhandle area of Florida. This is my home. I cherish its forests, wetlands, rivers, and wildlife. I feel that they should be protected for future generations to enjoy and cherish as well. I would like to bring to your attention a few of my concerns regarding this matter. Deer population concerns: The State of Florida has identified that the current deer population of younger bucks is over harvested. Therefore, for the 2014-2015 deer seasons in northwest Florida, they have proposed an antler restriction to be implemented using Interstate 10 as a dividing line. This means that the supposedly over harvested younger-aged class of bucks in the Tate’s Hell State Forest and the Apalachicola National Forest are to be further impacted due to the increased military incursion into their habitat that will disrupt their lives both day and night. Instead of allowing the hunters more land to hunt on, reducing the impact on the deer herd in a given area, this military training initiative is going to further concentrate the deer herd into smaller areas both reducing the available food source and creating an environment for disease. Florida is one of the few states to thus far not have a documented case of chronic wasting disease and has restricted the importation of deer from out of state. One of the contributing factors to this disease it has been said is crowding many deer together. This disease not only spreads from close contact with infected deer but contaminates any area that a deer has eliminated his bodily waste in where it will precipitate both in nearby vegetation and water until another unaffected deer just happens to drink or feed. To make matters worse we have an increasing problem with bears and coyotes preying on deer. If an animal feeds on an infected deer, that animal now becomes a carrier and anywhere that animal eliminates his bodily wastes, the nearby vegetation and water also becomes infected. Therefore, to further concentrate the deer numbers into a smaller area just does not make sense. Bear population concerns: Florida’s Bear Management Plan utilizes the Tate’s Hell State Forest to be set aside for the bears. If we lose even one acre to a military footprint in this area, where would the new bear habitat come from? If due to the military presence the bears are displaced from these training areas that would mean that nearby towns, such as Carrabelle and Eastpoint, will see an additional population increase to their bear problem not to mention the nearby residents that live on three sides around Tate’s Hell State Forest that already are burdened by the local bear population. Limiting or prohibiting public access: I know of seven State-designated camping areas along New River in Tate’s Hell State Forest north of Gully Branch Road that are utilized by hunters every hunting season. The reason I mention these seven campsite areas in particular is that these seven campsites fall within one to three miles of one of the proposed airstrips. A lot of these campers hunt adjacent to these areas  Name  Organization  Comment  which would place them right in the middle of any military training. There is a concern whether the animals would remain in these areas due to the increased burden, both night and day, of a military presence by both vehicles and air traffic. So if this airstrip placed any burden on the wildlife, it would have a direct impact on these camper hunters. With the already limited access to public hunting lands due to many other state wildlife concerns, these people would no longer be able to feed their families the wonderful bounty they are able to harvest on our Florida public lands. The hunters would have to go somewhere else to hunt and compete for space with the other hunters that are using other areas of public land that may already be overburdened. Imagine this scenario: You worked all week. You have planned and prepared. You stayed up late Wednesday and Thursday nights moving in your camper and setting up a pristine campsite in anticipation of a beautiful family weekend adventure. After you get off work on Friday and get everybody gathered up and drive to your campsite at the turnoff of the paved road there is a roadblock and you’re informed that this area is closed to public access for the next two weeks. So you have to turn around and go home disappointed while your camper and other possessions just sit there at the campsite. Hopefully, your possessions are safe; but you never know. As previously mentioned, this area has been designated by the State as a part of the bear management area. This is only one scenario; but I’m sure you can come up with more on your own. Damage to the ecosystem: Traffic from the supplies, equipment, and military personnel entering and leaving the wildlife areas and the on-going training would greatly damage the ecosystem. Since I am familiar with this area, I know that they will need to build new roads to access the training areas. And since this area is very wet to start with, the construction of an airstrip will require both removal and new fill of dirt to be brought into the area to support the weight of an airstrip. This area supports plant life which is protected, such as pitcher plants and orchards, some of which are found nowhere else. Everything that lives in the wildlife area is dependent on each other for a healthy and balanced ecosystem. When one element is damaged or destroyed it affects everything else down the line. For example, if all the vegetation is destroyed, then the animals that feed on it die. Then that causes the animals that would have fed on those animals to die and then it goes on and on. Decline of health and well being of population: There are many people who gain great benefits, both spiritually and mentally, by their connection to the outdoors and wilderness areas. By limiting of the public’s use of the State Forests it would contribute to the decline in the overall health of the general population. Power line hazard: The southern border of the Apalachicola National Forest is only one mile north of the proposed most northern airstrip in the Tate’s Hell State Forest. Running along this southern border of the Apalachicola National Forest is a power line which will be in close proximity to the airstrip and could create an aviation hazard or possibly cause an accident with low-flying aircraft such as the proposed helicopters. As a side note, some of the numbered roads in the Apalachicola National Forest would not be there had it not been for military aircraft that had crashed in the Apalachicola National Forest in the past. At the time of the accidents, this created a great disruption to the serenity of the forest as well as ecological damage. However, we did receive a benefit of new roads being built to the crash sites which increased our access to the interiors of some of the large blocks of land. Increased road maintenance costs due to traffic: The increase in heavy vehicle traffic, i.e. heavy trucks as well as the number of vehicles, on the paved and unpaved roads that will be utilized by the military vehicles will impact the condition of the road surfaces that the counties and State are  Name  Organization  Comment  already challenged trying to maintain with their limited budgets. Noise: The surrounding area, as well as Tate’s Hell State Forest, already fall within a training zone that the military fighter planes use for dog fighting. I have had many an outing disrupted by low-flying military aircraft some of which were so close to the ground that on one occasion when a fighter made a tight turn over our heads we were able to see him wave at us on the ground. Any increase in this air traffic, day or night, would greatly diminish the enjoyment of time spent in the outdoors on our public land. Night training would also disturb people in the area who are trying to sleep. This is not just hunters during hunting season, but people that camp and fish throughout the year as well as those living in nearby towns. They will not only have to deal with the air traffic but also the vehicle traffic driving through their towns, neighborhoods, or the camping areas while they’re trying to sleep. For all these reasons, as well as many more that I have not mentioned, I am adamantly opposed to the use of Tate’s Hell State Forest for military training exercises. Sincerely, Kenny Presnell [private contact information redacted]  Kent  Too many endangered species and too sensitive environmental area to go  Kinsinger  forward with this plan. The plan calls for air strips to be built. How do you build air strips with out impacting an area? Drainage flow will go from natural to man induced and that impact will alter things for the better? Roads have to be built and that will not impact the area? Noise from helicopters and jets will be controlled how? Will jets / helicopters dump fuel in the area if they experience an emergency? Is there final plan drawings available for the public to view? Will electric power be installed at the sites and where? Will fuel tanks be installed at the site? How will wildlife and fauna be impacted? Regardless of your impact study our way of life will change. Will there be a impact study on people that live here to see if the quality of our lives change? Tate's Hell is a natural treasure that I use to hunt, fish and kayak. I moved here for the way of life. To see it change is unacceptable. I am a veteran and a patriot so my concerns are not about the military just this plan you have. Tourism, will there be a study on that also? Kent Kinsinger [private contact information redacted].  Knox  Outings Chair  With reference to the propose use of Black Water State Forest and Tate's Hell  Bagwell  Big Bend Sierra Group  Forest for robust training exercises: Having personally paddled/camped the complete Ochlockonee river, spending a total of several weeks, yearly, in both tracks of proposed training lands....these lands were bought and decreed to be environmentally sensitive and protected due to their unique makeup of both uplands and wetlands environment and home to many "at risk" species, along with providing sensitive water filtration and recharge to a wide range of estuaries....all of which would be highly jeopardized with proposed use by the Air Force. I get a yearly pass from the Jackson Guard to paddle on the AFB...and know they can be very good stewards of the environment. The several military operations in the Panhandle area comprise some significant land areas...I suspect there is ample, non restricted, lands to conduct this type of robust training, without the Air Force putting a heavy carbon footprint on very environmentally sensitive, public lands. I request to be put on the notification list concerning this proposal and that the Air Force seriously consider alternative sites for these types of operations.

Tate's Hell is well known for its biodiversity and habitat for many endangered or threatened animals and plants. This place is unique and the value of the habitat can not be mitigated. This region brings many visitors from out of state who come to the Gulf Coast in the panhandle to relax, swim, fish, hike and enjoy the last remnants of Old Florida. This area is held dear to people who love rural settings for recreation. Please help to preserve these last patches of untarnished Florida. Keep Tate's Hell and this region of Florida for your children so that they too may know what else Florida can be to us. Thank you.  Lois D.  None  This area of Florida is called the Forgotten Coast because it is off the beaten  Griffin  track and retains some vestiges of primal Florida nature. I want it to stay that way. There is precious little conservation being done and little public access to natural areas -meadows, swamps, beaches, bays -in N. Florida. I fervently plead that you not place these facilities in these areas. The impact from vehicles alone, much less the troops, would start a chain of destruction in the flora and fauna, and ultimately, the Gulf. The military should purchase land from private owners elsewhere. For example, St. Joe owns thousands of acres in N. Florida. I would rather my taxpayer dollars go toward said purchases rather than my access to natural beauty and resources be limited by their destruction. No matter what an EIS concludes, ANY impact is too great, in my opinion.  Lynn Wilder  Self  The public, the US EPA and FLDEP and FLDOH need to see how the DOD can justify how their "non hazardous" activies in and above Tate's Hell State Forrest will NOT adversely impact this complex and delicate ecosystem and public health. Please elaborate how the US EPA regulations for "no loss of wetlands" will be met. Please include the scope of operations (time of year, frequency and area of activity). Otherwise, how can the public provide input on "the NEPA process is intended to help federal officials make decisions based on an understanding of environmental consequences" (slide 5 of the USAF  Name  Organization  Comment  presentation)? The GRASI power point and handout are extremely vague in the scope of what is intended and leaves open the possibility of expansion. I fully understand and support the need for military training, but asking for public comment on something that is so vague is unreasonable. I strongly oppose the USAF developing training locations (especially airforce landing strips and roadways for heavy vehicles) in Tate's Hell State Forrest. The bay is already stressed from drought and river water supply issues from upstream cities, and endangered species are present in Tate's Hell and the surrounding area. Will the USAF adjust their activities according to important wildlife preservation issues (e.g., Bald Eagle mating and raising their kids season)? Have there been studies about the effect of emitter sites on wildlife? If so, please provide this information to the community as soon as possile. Finally, tourists come to Apalachicola year-round to relax and enjoy wildlife and peace and quiet. No carnivals, no water slides, and no fast food restaurants on the beach. Having day/night aircraft traffic will detract (if not eliminate) the reason that people come to visit. Tourism is a large part of the life blood of Apalachicola and the surrounding area. There must be other less pristine locations for training efforts that are within the emitter site criteria (which Tate's Hell is not). The emitter site criteria --2.5 to 3 hr driving distance from Egling AFV isn't met. The 1.5-1 hr flight time criteria, available roads (minimal to no improvements), and available aircraft landing areas do not currently exist. You are violating your own criteria. If you plan to install the latter, this will have a large environmental impact.

I strongly oppose the USAF developing training locations (especially airforce landing strips and roadways for heavy vehicles) in Tate's Hell State Forrest. The bay is already stressed from drought and river water supply issues from upstream cities, and endangered species are present in Tate's Hell and the surrounding area. Will the USAF adjust their activities according to important wildlife preservation issues (e.g., Bald Eagle mating and raising their kids season)? Have there been studies about the effect of emitter sites on wildlife? If so, please provide this information to the community as soon as possile. Finally, tourists come to Apalachicola year-round to relax and enjoy wildlife and peace and quiet. No carnivals, no water slides, and no fast food restaurants on the beach. Having day/night aircraft traffic will detract (if not eliminate) the reason that people come to visit. Tourism is a large part of the life blood of Apalachicola and the surrounding area. There must be other less pristine locations for training efforts that are within the emitter site criteria (which Tate's Hell is not). The emitter site criteria --2.5 to 3 hr driving distance from Egling AFV isn't met. The 1.5-1 hr flight time criteria, available roads (minimal to no improvements), and available  Name Organization  Comment  aircraft landing areas do not currently exist. You are violating your own criteria. If you plan to install the latter, this will have a large environmental impact. I recommend the GRASI decision for using Tate's Hell State Forrest for emitter sites and/or military training ---NO  Madeleine  Self  Thank you for permission to comment on the nw landing sites in Tate's Hell and  H. Carr  other areas in the Bradwell Bay area. You must be tired of hearing that such suggestions are absolutely contrary to the sustainable land use these areas provide. Can you explain to me how you will protect the already stressed bears, the absolutely beautiful and rare carnivorous plants, the history and our human sanity that has to get away from noise pollution to keep it all together. NOISE. Isn't that what the Air Force is known for? There are so many other very disturbed lands north of your proposed areas. Please, please consider those. We like to walk, hike, bird watch and through-hike on the Florida Trail. We don't want helicopters hovering around. All in all, this is a dreadful plan. Madeleine H. Carr, Ph.D.  Marcia  A state forest needs to protect its natural resources. Activities such as war  Boothe  games which include survival skills which involve eating plants and animals that are supposed to be protected is unacceptable. there is no way that soldiers will be sble to distinguish listed species from other common species. Also watershed in BRSF is too vulnerable to be used for military maneuvers. Adapt your scheduling like the rest of us who spend a great deal of our lives waiting for things too.  Margo  Citizen  There are too many endangered species for the military to be running around  Posten  doing exercises. Some of these species are found no where else in the world. There are plenty of other places to conduct such activities. Stay out of our public lands and find somewhere else for this training!  Marilyn  My husband and I attended the hastily called meeting regarding the Eglin U.S.  Hogan, Guy  Air Force proposal to establish training activities in Tate's Hell State Forest.  Hogan  Tate's Hell is our back yard, and it is one of the reasons we retired to Franklin County. It is a precious resource that drains into the Apalachicola River (a State Aquatic Preserve) and Bay with tributaries to East Bay (our home). In addition, the property was purchased by the state with Conservation and Recreation Lands (CARL) Program funds. It is home to unique and endangered species such as the red-cockaded woodpecker, gopher tortoise and several plant species. We support our military, but question the advisability of establishing a presence remote to it's base of operation that has been purchased for conservation and recreation in a unique environmentally sensitive area. GRASI is not welcome here.  Marilyn Oberhausen  Development in the Florida Panhandle has meant that the "woods" of our childhood are more critical than ever. Black Water River State Forest (and Tate's Hell State Forest) are large tracts of land--owned by the people of Florida for the purposes of habitat preservation and recreation--that provide for the natural habitat of many animal and plant species, including some endangered or threatened. Intrusions into the forest by noise creating helicopters and significant troop maneuvers disturb the habitat for these species, often with devastating results. Such use should not be a part of the forest environment. People use the forests as well, for hiking, canoeing, fishing and hunting, bird watching, and camping. Troop maneuvers both on land and water erode the land, degrade water quality and damage the forest for people to use, too. Where will people go to experience a true night sky in a natural setting, since  Name  Organization  Comment  the development of beach fronts and other coastal areas means that light pollution is always present in these places? What about the family who wants to camp, canoe, or otherwise experience nature away from the noise and lights of the town or city? If these large tracts of land are not retained in their current state of relative solitude for present and future generations to enjoy, then we will have lost another precious asset of our state. I live on the east side of Pensacola, on the western shore of Bayou Texar, and on many a night we can already hear and feel the percussions from the practice bombing runs at Eglin. Please at least keep such noise and activities on the current Eglin base instead of spreading it out further and further. If the Air Force needs more land, then let them buy out adjacent property owners. They should have been doing that all along. Please do not penalize the animals and plants of Black Water State Forest, the land and waters of the forest, or the people who want and need the forest for its ability to connect them with the natural world. We pay a high price if we lose that to an ill-advised proposal by the Air Force for more training area. I am also familiar with Tate's Hell State Forest, as both of my parents were born and raised in Apalachicola. My father grew up at a time when duck hunting and fishing were common activities on Apalachicola Bay. People visit Apalachicola now for the experience of the small town, the pristine beaches of St. George Island, and the remoteness and quiet of Tate's Hell and the Apalachicola National Forest. My comments above about BRSF hold true for Tate's Hell, too. Do not let the Air Force disturb--destroy?--the habitat of Tate's Hell, either. People go to the forests for reasons that are totally inconsistent with the Air Force's proposal for troop maneuvers and aircraft operations. I note that the proposal even calls for "Air Strips" and "aircraft operations." Does this mean that as roads are built and landing areas are cleared for helicopters, that a "landing strip" will also be constructed for winged aircraft? How is that consistent with the purposes and values of the forests? The U.S. Navy has disregarded the concerns of the people and has conducted sonar operations and underwater explosions in the Pacific Ocean, to the great harm of many sea mammals like whales and dolphins. A recent practice bombing run by the U.S. Navy resulted in serious damage to a portion of the Great Barrier Reef near Australia. I ask that you take that kind of military track record into consideration and do not allow the U.S. Air Force to do similar kinds of harm to these healthy state forests in northwest Florida. The plants, the animals, the people who enjoy them--indeed, the whole of the forests--are asking you to think of them.  Mark Nobles  Carrabelle Airport  Based on the Air Force current inability to work with general aviation, I am opposed to any future decline of available airspace for general aviation. In past personal experience with denied request, I have found myself in harms way simply because the airspace was scheduled for training, not used, and since the schedule was not corrected the airspace remained active. Any additional airspace restriction would have an adverse effect on the air commerce in and out of Franklin county. In simple analogy, "We don't want a Bully in our SAND BOX" especially when your report card does not say "Plays well with others". Please do not hesitate to call if you want to know what I really think. [private contact information redacted]  Martha E.  Property  As a property owner in Franklin County, FL whose property adjoins THSF I am  Scott  Owner in  mortified to think that you would consider it suitable to be used for training  Franklin  activities. My property once was part of Harbison City, which was basically  County  decimated by the army for training in WWII. It is still is being searched for unexploded munitions after 70 years. Tate's Hell was purchased by the State  and approved by the citizens of Franklin County as a wildlife refuge and is home  Name  Organization  Comment  to many endangered species. It is a very fragile ecosystem that acts as a buffer for storm surge from the coast. It is connected to the Apalachicola Bay which is in dire condition already due to tampering. Franklin County is a poor rural area that depends on its waters and forests for supporting and feeding families that live here. This lack of judgement and concern for the area and its citizens is just appalling.  Mary Elsheimer  Please leave Tate's Hell alone.This biodiverse virgin forest should not be used as a training site.  Mary  While I support the Air Force and all it does for us, I hope it will tread lighly on  Pittman  the Blackwater State Forest area. The river and creeks are so beautiful and pristine.. a great treasure to be protected. Please if this goes through, which I'm sure it will, think of the future users of this forest, including your children and grandchildren. We only have one earth. Thank you.  Mary Rogers  None  Comment concerning Tate's Hell State Forest. I live in Liberty County (Sumatra) which is very near Tate's Hell State Forest.... listened to the meeting held in Apalachicola on You Tube and did not like the negative comments. Not everyone feels this way. Our military deserve the best training available and should be able to utilize any place that would be suitable for that purpose. There have been training activities in this community with helicopters flying over my property in the past at night and we were not disturbed, neither were our animals, horse, goats, etc. When we see jets flying over it is just reassurance that our military are on duty. Everyone seems to be promoting their own agenda, but bottom line is that our military are protecting us so that we maintain our freedom to even have the opportunity to speak out about or question government actions. Thank You for this opportunity. William Rogers / Mary Rogers [private contact information redacted]  MaryAnn Friedman  This comment is meant to address the impact of proposed training exercises and Emitter Sites on Blackwater River State Forest. For 15 years I have been studying lepidoptera on Eglin Air Force Base Reservation and Blackwater River State Forest. I have made numerous discoveries of rare and imperiled butterflies in both of these lands in Okaloosa County, Walton County and Santa Rosa County. As a Citizen Scientist working privately and sharing research data with the State of FLorida Dept of Forestry and with Jackson Guard I have seen first hand the rich diversity and unusual concentration of wildlife contained in these tracts. In recent studies undertaken by FNAI and citizen volunteers under a FFWC Wildlife Grant, these two areas have been deemed to hold the highest concentration of S1 and S2 species of butterflies in the state. Already over the years there has been an obvious degradation occuring in the Forest and the Reservation due to habitat loss and the growth of the Air Force Missions. It has been only with the supreme effort of the good people of Jackson Guard and the Division of Forestry that these very unique areas have survived the insults of manmade events and those brought on by nature itself up until now. The reservation has been degraded by traffic pressure, repeated missions and clearing of land for training. I fear that the very fragile ecology, hydrology and geology of BWRSF will not be able to withstand the onslaught of training missions and that the unique and rare plant and animal populations which currently are holding on by a thread will be lost forever. This would be a tragedy. The State Forest is not a military base. It has been set aside as a refuge for animals and people to admire and enjoy. It is an oasis of great beauty which needs to be preserved for the future. Please do not use the forest for air force  Name  Organization  Comment  training.  Melissa  Concerned  I am writing to express my concerns and opposition to the use of Tate's Hell  Starbuck  Citizen  State Forest for military training exercises by Eglin Air Force Base as proposed under the Gulf Regional Airspace Strategic Initiative (GRASI) Landscape Initiative (GLI). The original purpose for converting the Tate's Hell tract from county property to state-owned forest was CONSERVATION: (1) for hydrological protection and restoration of Apalachicola Bay, (2) to conserve many rare and endangered habitats and species of flora and fauna found within the fragile Tate's Hell State Forest environment, and (3) to preserve traditional and recreational uses of the land by the citizens whose tax monies were used for establishing this State Forest. The creation of Tate's Hell State Forest through the use of public funds was supported by Franklin County government and residents to protect and conserve the land for public and environmental benefits, and NOT for any usurping of those benefits by the military. There are serious consequences associated with the GRASI proposal and the following concerns must be considered. All plants, wetlands, water, insects, birds and wildlife will be severely impacted by the fuel exhaust of the low-flying (tree level) helicopters. That water flows into the already dying Apalachicola Bay. The noise alone from these planes, helicopters and training exercises will devastate all birds and wildlife, as well as create untold problems for citizens living anywhere near that vicinity. The life cycles of nocturnally foraging animals will be disrupted by holding military training exercises primarily at night. The airspace used by private pilots to land at our local airports will be compromised by giving priority for the use of that same airspace to military aircraft. Any military radar emitters installed within Franklin County have the potential to disrupt civilian and private pilot communication devices and may even have health consequences for citizens who live nearby. Many of the residents of Franklin County depend on the bounty Tate's Hell State Forest provides through hunting and fishing to feed their families in this economically disadvantaged community. The unique ecology found within Tate's Hell State Forest such as the Dwarf Cypress Swamp and over 90 species of rare and endangered wildlife (such as the Red-Cockaded Woodpecker) are at risk of being damaged or destroyed by military training exercises and/or accidents that may occur during such military usage. Tate's Hell State Forest has one of the largest Black Bear populations in Florida, as well as a very large population of nesting American Bald Eagles. Tate's Hell is also part of the Great Florida Birding Trail and is visited by birdwatchers, photographers, nature lovers, hunters, fishermen, local residents and tourists from far away. Lastly, during the Scoping Meetings, the public was not even allowed to ask questions; any questions asked were ignored. For all of these reasons, I am resolutely opposed to the use of Tate's Hell State Forest for military training exercises. Sincerely, Melissa Starbuck  Michael Bailey  None (Resident of Apalachicola)  Please do not proceed with the plans to civilize Tate's Hell Forest. It's one of the few places wildlife can exist unmolested.  Norman  I understand the need for our forces to train but I also would hope that it is  Friedman  recognized that there are areas of Blackwater that require absolute protection  MD  and should be off limits to any operations including any and all pitcher plant bogs and seeps.  Name  Organization  Comment  Peggy Baker  Francis M. Weston Audubon Society  I am writing of behalf of the Francis M. Weston Audubon Society to express our concerns that the GRASI Landscape Initiative will have a great impact on the birds that utilize the Blackwater River State Forest at any time of the year. The BRSF’s Ten-Year Resource Management Plan states as one of their forestry management strategies they will: “Cooperate with the United States military to facilitate mission essential training in a manner that will not adversely impact natural resources, forest management or public access.” It is our belief that this Initiative will negatively impact all of the birds that use the forest. During the years of 2009-2012, volunteers from FMWAS conducted a seasonal bird survey of BRSF. We found 181 species of birds that were in the forest sometime during the year. There are 52 species that live year round in the forest. Another 34 species migrate into the forest during the spring and summer to nest. This means that a total of 86 species nest and raise their young within BRSF. Most birds return to the same nesting area year after year, sometimes to the same tree. But we know that birds will abandon a nesting territory if disturbed by loud noises, or physical intrusions by humans or predators. They may even abandon chicks in the nest if the intrusions continue for a period of time. During one of our survey trips into the forest, we observed a military helicopter fly less than 50 feet above a Bald Eagle’s nest. The tree swayed with the downdraft. The noise was frightening. We thought the young chick would jump out of the nest. It takes years for Eagles to construct their huge nests but they will not return to a nest that has repeated interferences. The Bald Eagle is recovering from near extinction and is protected by federal law. We fear this species will be affected by GRASI activities. The Red-cockaded Woodpecker is also an endangered bird species found in this reconstructed wiregrass ecosystem. BRSF has a recovering population thanks to the FFS. This woodpecker takes several years to drill its nest into a live tree, but it will abandon its colony if disturbed. Our survey team observed helicopters delivering supplies for the recent seismic oil testing flying right above the trees of a Red-cockaded Woodpecker colony. The trees and limbs whipped and shook causing these birds to fly around excitedly. With repeated exposure to these types of physical disturbances that might come with the GRASI activities, we would expect these birds to abandon their nesting colonies. Another bird on the threatened species list that depends on this wiregrass ecosystem as a year round home is the Bachman Sparrow. This sparrow lives and nests in the short grasses beneath the pines that is maintained by a regular burn schedule. The Red-cockaded also likes this frequently burned habitat under the trees where it lives. Troops walking through this grassy habitat would disrupt the nesting area of the Bachman. GRASI activities may also interrupt the already busy burning schedule that maintains this habitat. The Florida subspecies of the American Kestrel has recently returned to nest in the clearcut areas of the BRSF. It is hopeful that this bird would be able to use the BRSF to increase its declined numbers. Since the GRASI Landscape Initiative activities will use clearcut areas, it is possible that it would interfere with the recovery of this bird. One of the unique features of the BRSF is that it connects with Eglin and the Conecuh National Forest to provide a greenway for migratory birds for safe passage from the gulf to southern Alabama. After a 500-mile trip across the gulf, these birds need areas to feed and rest before they continue their trip northward to their breeding grounds. It is also a last chance to feed before their return trip in the fall. Our bird survey team observed 31 species that were only there in the spring and fall depending on the forest as a migratory path. Studies have shown that the numbers of migratory birds are declining rapidly. It has been found that the major causes of this decline is the development of their breeding habits. But it  Name  Organization  Comment  also has been shown that wintering habitats are disappearing. BRSF has 107 species that spend the cold season in this warmer climate. Our survey shows that there are large number of birds using the forest as their winter habitat. Under the Migratory Bird Program, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service established a list of Birds of Conservation Concern, 2008. Twenty-three(23) of these bird species have been surveyed in Blackwater River State Forest. This forest is very important to all of these migratory bird species. Our survey found that large numbers of migratory birds are present in this habitat during the year. Military activities within the forest could deprive these birds of a safe place to stay and feed during the time away from their breeding grounds. Francis M. Weston Audubon Society requests that this EIS investigates the impact on endangered birds, all resident birds, all migratory birds and the burning schedules that maintain this wiregrass ecosystem.

The need to use public land for military training must be justified, especially given the amount of DOD land available in the panhandle. Simply stating that hazardous training takes precedent is not adequate; data must be provided to allow appropriate analysis. If necessary: -the Air Force should be provided access to other DOD land, i.e. Navy land, for training -recreational use (hunting, hiking, camping) of Eglin Air Force Base lands should be discontinued to provide additional training areas before other public lands (state forests) are considered 2. Public use of state forest lands must not be impeded or restricted for the sake of military use. Any closure of public lands, however temporary, is unacceptable. 3. How does the proposed action adhere to the stated purposes of the State Forest System? This must be addressed in light of the legislation establishing the state forests. Military personnel participating in ground training activities cannot be considered normal forest users as stated at the scoping meeting. 4. The proposed military ground operations are clearly incompatible with traditional forest use. The number and type of proposed training activities far exceed what would be considered a reasonable proposal that could be incorporated into the forest use plan. Given the proposed use sites, there appears to be little possibility that conflict with the public can be avoided. Public use must take precedent. If conflict is unavoidable, military use is unacceptable. 5. The impact analysis of training operations, especially night operations, must include the following: -Effect on forest users including campers, backcountry campers, hunters, hikers, canoeists, horseback riders, bicyclists, birdwatchers, and all traditional users. -Questions to be addressed: How can aircraft use of Blackwater Field during nighttime hours not impact campers using the adjacent Krul Lake Campground? How can proposed ground maneuvers not impact other forest users such as hikers, backpack and canoe campers, horseback riders, bicyclists, etc. 6. Effect on the forest ecosystem as a whole needs to be assessed, not just the impacts on certain threatened and endangered species. Night operations will likely disrupt ecological functions on a large scale as a result of increased  Name  Organization  Comment  noise, lights, and vehicle, aircraft, and personnel movement. Since many forest species are nocturnal for feeding, movement, reproduction, offspring rearing, etc., the impacts of night operations must be analyzed in depth. 7. No site improvements/construction should be undertaken. Specifically, no trees should be removed/felled, no sites compacted/hardened, and no foreign material (gravel, asphalt) brought in and used. 8. Stream and wetland crossings of personnel and/or vehicles should be avoided. Significant downstream sedimentation and streambank erosion could result. Even if established forest roads and trails are to be utilized, the crossing sites must be improved to avoid direct contact with the water resource and riparian zone. 9. Any future expansion/increase in the number or extent of MOA’s or restricted airspace is to be avoided. Implemented activities should have no effect on airspace use, especially by general aviation. 10. Much of the proposed aircraft activity will occur within the altitudes generally used by civilian aircraft on local flights. Potential aircraft conflicts with the increased military usage must be addressed. Again, no impact on general aviation will be acceptable. 11. Any projected or future expansion of the airspace or landscape initiative must be evaluated as part of the present analysis. Future actions need to be assessed along with the current proposal as a single, complete project.  Riley  Self  Any emitter sites to be established within the state forests should be restricted  Hoggard  to developed sites i.e. the forest HQ or the former DJJ sites. If utilities are required, no other forest sites are adequate and should not be considered. In fact, it is recommended that no state forest sites be utilized. A myriad of other suitable sites are available beyond public lands. Use of forest service watch tower sites throughout the counties is an innovative approach that needs to be expanded to avoid the need to use the state forests. Airports, Navy OLF, shopping center parking lots, and even church parking lots could easily meet the emitter site requirements and should be considered. Additional site searches should be conducted. Other sites to consider include schools, car lots, farms, and ranches. Given the plan to set-up and move the emitter site daily, conflict with the regular use of these sites could easily be avoided. The fact that individual agreements would likely be necessary is not a legitimate reason to discount these options.  Robin Rickel  Florida  I have concerns about the impacts of military training activities, particularly off- Vroegop  Geotourism Associates  road vehicle use, on the vegetative and biological communities in state-owned conservation lands. These large State Forests tracks are set aside for their value as buffers to disturbance of sensitive ecosystems and waterbodies, and they contain numerous documented occurences of State and Federally-listed Threatened and Endangered Species. I refer to USACERL Technical Report 98/79 May 1998 entitled, "Management of of Maritime Communities for Threated and Endangered Species", by Sopia Gehihausen and Mary G. Harper. It describes the detrimental effect of foot and vehicular traffic on soil compaction and hydrology on sandy maritime dune ridges, swales, and wetlands, such as those found in Tate’s Hell State Forest. Training activities with ORV usage in areas such as these must be extremely limited. I am also concerned about the effect of nighttime training activites, as well as daytime activities on bird and animal breeding and migration cycles. Non-disturbance during these time is critical for productivity of many species, for example, the Threatened Southern Bald Eagle, which is also afforded special Federal protection as our national emblem. Birds and other animals are particualrly sensitive to light and noise disturbance in the nighttime, in general.  Name  Organization  Comment  Ruth  Self  Please do not use Tate's Hell State Forest for training. I am especially disturbed  McArthur  by the idea of landing planes there. This is a pristine piece of wilderness and home to an amazing variety of birds, mammals and plant life that would be disturbed by machinery and personnel in the area. Gov. Scott has said that this venture will improve our nation's security, which of course is important. However, there is certainly disused, already disturbed land that can be acquired and used for military purposes. When Winston Churchill heard that Parliament was proposing a cut to funding for the arts in order to boost military spending, he replied, "Then what's the point?" This applies here -do not destroy the best features of our country in order to protect our country.  Sam  I am against the activities proposed in Blackwater River State Forest, as well as  Shannon  Tate's Hell State Forest. The term "non-hazardous" training is used to describe the safety and security of the trainees. However, it does not ensure the safety of biology of the two State parks mentioned above. While the impact of the training on the environment may be kept to a minimum, that doesn't change the fact that it is still impacting wildlife as well as our water shed. Increased use of trails and other areas of the parks would increase erosion. This could be potentially harmful to aquatic organisms, especially if harmful chemicals are used in the training's. I would like a public report of the proposed training's to be made, as to better determine the damage to the environment. If that can not be done, I would consider using a different area to train, such as the underused Naval Air Station Whiting Field Golf Course, located Less than 6 miles from Blackwater River State Forest. Or the woods surrounding Hurlburt Field, Less than 10 miles from Tate's Hell State Forest.  Sara  None  Please do not enter Tate's hell, this is the last of real Florida and is to be protected forever.  Serge Latour  Lalutra LLC  Tate's Hell is a pristine environment. One critically damaged by past activities and essential to the health and culture of our bay. The Army Corp of Engineers has already sacrificed it to their own " governed" wills. As they just now admitted " They indicated that they are not governed by the overall benefits of the cause -just what is regulated by law. This battle has gone on since the 70's and it won't end here. This state is now suing Georgia over this issue. This is the same watershed. This river basin is essential to the existence of the bay and the generations old culture it supports. Now you want to join in this destruction. Tate's Hell was purchased by the people of this nation to restore what was destroyed by greed and personal gain. Please explain to me why you want to destroy this. There are thousands of yet defined species with untold benefits to mankind still living here in this swamp yet to be discovered and appreciated for their benefit to mankind. You all know as well as I do that there are no " Non-Hazardous" uses of this land. Just the sound of the jets and choppers over head hinders the life cycle of River Frogs and untold other species. We are still dealing with un-exploded munitions from WWII training . This is a FUDS site. Give this place a break. Its why it was purchased by the people for the people and will be protected BY THE PEOPLE. Your not fighting a war in the swamp anyway. If you think " who cares about a swamp?.. wait and see. Wrong place to practice for the wrong war. You not fighting in the swamp-your fighting for oil and water. Well, here we have water. Go fight for oil in the desert. I spent a lot of my soul in the mid east on both side's of the water war's. To bring this now into my swamp is a real war. Stop and think. Please.

Motto: Caring for the Land and Serving People The phrase, "CARING FOR THE LAND AND SERVING PEOPLE," captures the Forest Service mission. As set forth in law, the mission is to achieve quality land management under the sustainable multiple-use management concept to meet the diverse needs of people. It does include military operations or exercises. Period. With all due respect, stay out of the forest. It's a Sanctuary not a landscape for war games. Thank you, Sharon A. Warren  Sheila Blue  Dear Sir, this is just a short plea for our land. This is involving the Forest of Tate's Hell that our Gov. bought as a way to protect it. I do not believe that the Military use of it would be protecting it; even though I believe the Military is a responsible group generally, but when it comes to virgin forest with the trees and animals that depend on us to protect their habitat; I feel that the robust military air and land training in this forest would be detrimental. Please reconsider this plan and find a more suitable place for the military and let this virgin Forest of ours stay as is for many generation to come. We have so little Forest left and we need it to protect not only the animals but the humans as well. Please consider my plea and let my voice count as a vote against the Military use of Tate's Hell Forest. Thank you. Respectfully Sheila Blue  Sheila Hauser  Carrabelle Area Chamber of Commerce  Franklin County, Florida and especially the Carrabelle area relies heavily on tourism as one of our main industries and economic engines. The tourism industry supports small businesses that rely heavily on the visitors to Franklin County. Visitors that come to Franklin County are looking for nature-based activities from kayaking, hiking, fishing, camping, bird-watching, flora and fauna and just to get back to nature in a natural environment. As the Past-President of the Carrabelle Area Chamber of Commerce and current Marketing/Public Relations Consultant, I know from a first hand experience what the visitors are looking for. One of our main marketing messages is our natural wonders and nature-based activities, if we were to change this it would have a negative impact on our tourists and definitely hurt the economy in Carrabelle and Franklin County. With the current situation in our Bay with the oysters, we are now more dependent on the tourism industry for jobs. I was also on the Franklin County Tourist Development Council for 4 years and understand the market and the effects of changes. Tate's Hell State Forest is a huge attraction to visitors to Carrabelle and a big part of our economy. The tourism industry touches every small business in Franklin County including the following: Restaurants, retail, vacation rentals, hotels, RV/Camping Parks, B & B's, grocery stores, charter fishing captains, guides, outdoor and adventures shops, bait stores, marinas, hardware stores, and many more. We have a busy season from May to August, but the off-season from September to April is extremely slow  Name  Organization  Comment  and the small businesses have a difficult time staying open and making a profit. Franklin County is a beautiful place and we love our pristine and natural wonders. We feel that Tate's Hell State Forest is a true "Gem" and "Natural Wonder" for Franklin County and we need to preserve it, just that way and not make any changes. Thank you, Sheila Hauser Southern Breeze Media Marketing Consultant for Carrabelle Chamber of Commerce www.carrabelle.org  Susan  I am writing to express my concerns and opposition to the use of Tate's Hell  Alvarado  State Forest for military training exercises by Eglin Air Force Base as proposed under the Gulf Regional Airspace Strategic Initiative (GRASI) Landscape Initiative (GLI). The original purpose for converting the Tate's Hell tract from county property to state-owned forest was CONSERVATION: (1) for hydrological protection and restoration of Apalachicola Bay, (2) to conserve many rare and endangered habitats and species of flora and fauna found within the fragile Tate's Hell State Forest environment, and (3) to preserve traditional and recreational uses of the land by the citizens whose tax monies were used for establishing this State Forest. The creation of Tate's Hell State Forest through the use of public funds was supported by Franklin County government and residents to protect and conserve the land for public and environmental benefits, and NOT for any usurping of those benefits by the military. There are serious consequences associated with the GRASI proposal and the following concerns must be considered. All plants, wetlands, water, insects, birds and wildlife will be severely impacted by the fuel exhaust of the low-flying (tree level) helicopters. That water flows into the already dying Apalachicola Bay. The noise alone from these planes, helicopters and training exercises will devastate all birds and wildlife, as well as create untold problems for citizens living anywhere near that vicinity. The life cycles of nocturnally foraging animals will be disrupted by holding military training exercises primarily at night. The airspace used by private pilots to land at our local airports will be compromised by giving priority for the use of that same airspace to military aircraft. Any military radar emitters installed within Franklin County have the potential to disrupt civilian and private pilot communication devices and may even have health consequences for citizens who live nearby. Many of the residents of Franklin County depend on the bounty Tate's Hell State Forest provides through hunting and fishing to feed their families in this economically disadvantaged community. The unique ecology found within Tate's Hell State Forest such as the Dwarf Cypress Swamp and over 90 species of rare and endangered wildlife (such as the Red-Cockaded Woodpecker) are at risk of being damaged or destroyed by military training exercises and/or accidents that may occur during such military usage. Tate's Hell State Forest has one of the largest Black Bear populations in Florida, as well as a very large population of nesting American Bald Eagles. Tate's Hell is also part of the Great Florida Birding Trail and is visited by birdwatchers, photographers, nature lovers, hunters, fishermen, local residents and tourists from far away. Lastly, during the Scoping Meetings, the public was not even allowed to ask questions; any questions asked were ignored. For all of these reasons, I am resolutely opposed to the use of Tate's Hell State Forest for military training exercises. Sincerely, Susan  Susan Macken  I attended the recent scoping session held in Apalachicola to become familiar with the proposed utilization of Tate's Hell State Forest through the GRASI initiative. After hearing the presentation and public comments and completing  Name  Organization  Comment  additional research, I am adamantly opposed to THSF being utilized in this manner. There are over 90 types of endangered species in this wonderfully rich ecosystem. Continued protection of this area is critical! Having USAF training maneuvers occur in this area is totally incompatible with protection of this area. As our County Commission has pointed out, THSF represents over half of the land in Franklin County. This land was removed from the tax rolls and set aside to PRESERVE, PROTECT, and CONSERVE natural resources for the benefit of the public. Our local "public" indeed turned out for the scoping session. Those in attendance came from all corners of our county and represented a cross-section of those of us who call Franklin County home. The message you heard that evening was a resounding no! Reportedly, the proposed GRASI initiative has been in the works for several years. Why then, are we just hearing about it? Why were we provided with such a short window of opportunity to provide written comment? Why were we -the public -the last to hear of these plans? Your presentation was long on generalities and lacking in details. Many of your descriptors are unmeasurable and give us no clear picture of the of the potential future of THSF should you proceed with this initiative. I heard statements such as "to the extent practical" and "infrequent use". Exactly what do these terms mean? Franklin County's future prosperity rests, in large part, on tourism. The visitors to the Forgotten Coast come to explore this largely unspoiled area of Florida. They come to fish, kayak, boat, and swim in its waters. They come to hike the miles of wilderness trails. They come to observe our wildlife, migrating butterflies, and countless species of birds. Utilization of THSF is incongruent with this future. I respectfully ask that the use of THSF through the GRASI initiative be reconsidered. Franklin County simply does not want you.  Tammy Nelson  I am writing to express my concerns and opposition to the use of Tate's Hell State Forest for military training exercises by Eglin Air Force Base as proposed under the Gulf Regional Airspace Strategic Initiative (GRASI) Landscape Initiative (GLI).

Kerns  Todd  Bream Fishermen Association  Blackwater State Forest is one of the most species-rich forests in the country. The longleaf pine trees and myriad plants and animals, many of which are threatened or endangered, keep you and I alive. That forest cleans the water that we drink and the air that we breathe. Every living species that calls the forest home, whether it be a tiny ant or a Florida black bear, is part of a food chain that includes homo sapiens sapiens (me and you!). A protected State Forest is not the place for military maneuvers. Living species are masterpieces, legends. Their brethren in the Florida panhandle have been bought, sold, built on, and all but destroyed. They've already been relegated to this small patch of wilderness. It may seem like BRSF is endless, but understand it's the last of this type of ecosystem left on EARTH! There is nowhere else for these legends to go. Let's let them be, without being stomped on or driven over; even the ants.  Victoria  Don't know if the comment topic is correct, but do know that wild or semi- Kovach  pristine land in this area does need to be kept that way as between commercial usage, housing and military, an ecosystem -or ecosystems -do suffer at the hands of humans. There's so much room on the reservation, it's hard to imagine needing more. In a hundred years, what would be the most important -an area compromised by some pretty severe human activity or one that has been preserved? Poor critters should have a vote. Unfortunately, they don't. I do want to say that you do have some good programs like saving the stands of long-needle pine, etc. That is to be commended.  Wanda Lemon  I oppose the use of military training exercises in the Blackwater State Forest and the Tate's Hell State Forest (near Apalachicola). The use of these exercises in protected wildfire areas could be very devastating and disruptive to many of the plant and animals who live there, disturbing their habitats and endangering their lives. In addition, if the military were to utilize these forests for their purposes, civilians would not be allowed to enjoy the hiking, canoeing, horse riding, camping, etc. that these parks currently allow. That enjoyment would be taken away from us who regularly enjoy these parks. To allow the military to do this would disturb the wildlife that live there and the people who visit there. Please, keep military training exercises on military bases -do not encroach upon the serenity and the enjoyment that these parks give to so many, including the plants and animals who live there. Besides, they were there first.  William Holcomb  Self  As a former EOD tech, I know training is important, but so are our State Forests. Training activities and any landing facilities, radio telemetry sites, or other options planned for Tates Hell State Forest and Blackwater State Forest should instead be put in Apalachicola National Forest or Ocala National Forest where the federal government can repair any damage done, fight any fires started, clean up oil and fuel spills, and monitor trash disposal. The US Military is notorious for open pit burning and burying things that industry could not do. There are other bases, and even the Avon Park bombing range to operate on.  Name  Organization  Comment  Please leave our state forests alone.  William Owen  Please reconsider using our forest for training,We grew up near Griffass AFB in Rome NY and are painfully aware of how This type of training can go bad.A close friend was in charge of cleanup after fuel spills and plane and chopper crashes in the Adirondack Mts.Some site still have not fully recovered . We have set aside few small areas to be wild and free,Please let Tates hell Be.  WRITTEN SCOPING COMMENTS APPENDIX B, PUBLIC AND AGENCY INVOLVEMENT | APRIL 2014 TRANSCRIPTS 27 AUGUST 2013 28 AUGUST 2013 29 AUGUST 2013 THIS PAGE IS INTENTIONALLY BLANK. ADDENDUM D SCOPING MEDIA COVERAGE THIS PAGE IS INTENTIONALLY BLANK APPENDIX C CONSULTATION DOCUMENTATION C.

AIR QUALITY 6  D.1 AIR QUALITY PROGRAM OVERVIEW  7  In order to protect public health and welfare, the United States (U.S.) Environmental  8  Protection Agency (USEPA) has developed numerical concentration-based standards, or  9  National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), for six “criteria” pollutants (based on  10  health-related criteria) under the provisions of the CAA Amendments of 1970.  There are two  11  kinds of NAAQS: primary and secondary standards.  Primary standards prescribe the  12  maximum permissible concentration in the ambient air to protect public health, including the  13  health of “sensitive” populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly.  Secondary  14  standards prescribe the maximum concentration or level of air quality required to protect  15  public welfare, including protection against decreased visibility, damage to animals, crops,  16  vegetation, and buildings (40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 50).  17  The CAA gives states the authority to establish air quality rules and regulations.  These rules  18  and regulations must be equivalent to, or more stringent than, the federal program.  The  19  Division of Air Resource Management within the Florida Department of Environmental  20  Protection (FDEP) administers the state’s air pollution control program under the authority of  21  the Florida Air and Water Pollution Control Act and the Environmental Protection Act.  22  Florida has adopted the NAAQS except for sulfur dioxide (SO2). The USEPA has set the annual  23  and 24-hour standards for SO2 at 0.03 parts per million (ppm) (80 micrograms per cubic meter  24  [µg/m3]) and 0.14 ppm (365 µg/m3), respectively.  Florida has adopted the more stringent  25  annual and 24-hour standards of 0.02 ppm (60 µg/m3) and 0.1 ppm (260 µg/m3), respectively.  26  In addition, Florida has adopted the national secondary standard of 0.50 ppm (1,300 µg/m3).  27  Federal and state of Florida ambient air quality standards are presented in Table D-1.  28  Based on measured ambient air pollutant concentrations, the USEPA designates areas of the  29  U.S. as having air quality better than the NAAQS (attainment), worse than the NAAQS  30  (nonattainment), and unclassifiable.  The areas that cannot be classified (on the basis of  31  available information) as meeting or not meeting the NAAQS for a particular pollutant are  32  unclassifiable and are treated as attainment until proven otherwise.  Attainment areas can be  33  further classified as maintenance areas, which are areas previously classified as nonattainment  34  but where air pollutant concentrations have been successfully reduced to below the  35  standard.  Maintenance areas are under special maintenance plans and must operate under  36  some of the nonattainment area plans to ensure compliance with the NAAQS.  All areas of the  37  state are in compliance with the NAAQS. Therefore, every county within the project region of  38  influence (ROI) is classified as being in attainment.  APPENDIX D, AIR QUALITY |  APRIL 2014 1 Source: USEPA, 2006 (federal standards); FDEP, 2010 (Florida standards) μg/m³ = micrograms per cubic meter; mg/m³ = milligrams per cubic meter; NAAQS = National Ambient Air Quality Standards; ppb parts per billion; ppm = parts per million 1. USEPA plans on promulgating a new carbon monoxide (CO) standard in August 2011.

The air quality is monitored for carbon monoxide  3  (CO), lead (Pb), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), and sulfur dioxide  4  (SO2).  The monitors tend to be concentrated in areas with the largest population densities.  Not all pollutants are monitored in all areas. The air quality monitoring network is used to  6  identify areas where the ambient air quality standards are being violated and plans are  7  needed to reduce pollutant concentration levels to be in attainment with the standards. Also  8  included are areas where the ambient standards are being met, but plans are necessary to  9  ensure maintenance of acceptable levels of air quality in the face of anticipated population or  industrial growth.  11  The end result of this attainment/maintenance analysis is the development of local and  12  statewide strategies for controlling emissions of criteria air pollutants from stationary and  13  mobile sources. The first step in this process is the annual compilation of the ambient air  14  monitoring results, and the second step is the analysis of the monitoring data for general air  quality, exceedances of air quality standards, and pollutant trends.  16  The FDEP Northwest District operates monitors in several counties, including Bay, Escambia,  17  Holmes, Leon, Santa Rosa, and Wakulla Counties.  Over the years of record, there have been  18  exceedances (pollutant concentration greater than the numerical standard) of NAAQS.  19  However, there has not been a violation (occurrence of more exceedances of the standard  than are allowed within a specified time period) of an ambient standard (FDEP, 2003).  21  D.1.1 Project Calculations  22  D.1.1.1 Methodology  23  Impacts to regional air quality are determined by comparing the project emissions with the  24  total emissions on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis for the ROI’s 2008 National Emissions  Inventory (NEI) data. Potential impacts to air quality are evaluated with respect to the extent,  26  context, and intensity of the impact in relation to relevant regulations, guidelines, and  27  scientific documentation. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) defines significance in  28  terms of context and intensity in 40 CFR 1508.27.  This requires that the significance of the  29  action must be analyzed with respect to the setting of the Proposed Action and based relative  to the severity of the impact.  The CEQ National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Regulations  31  (40 CFR 1508.27(b)) provide 10 key factors to consider in determining an impact’s intensity.  32  To provide a conservative evaluation, the impacts screening in this analysis used more  33  restrictive criteria than are required under other regulations.  Rather than comparing  34  emissions from construction activities with regional inventories, emissions were compared to  the individual counties potentially impacted, which is a smaller area.  36  The Air Conformity Applicability Model (ACAM) version 4.4.5 was utilized to calculate grading  37  activities by providing user inputs for each. The ACAM calculations were augmented by  38  emissions calculations of aircraft, munitions, and vehicle (land and water craft) emissions  39  completed in Microsoft Excel.  D4 APPENDIX D, AIR QUALITY |  APRIL 2014 1  D.1.1.1.1 Construction Emissions  2  Calculations for construction emissions were completed using the calculation methodologies  3  described in the U.S. Air Force ACAM.  As previously indicated, a conformity determination is  4  not required since Okaloosa County is designated as attainment.  5  The ACAM was used to provide a level of consistency with respect to emissions factors and  6  calculations. The ACAM evaluates the individual emissions from different sources associated  7  with the construction phases. Phase I is the site preparation phase and Phase II is the actual  8  building/facility construction phase.  These sources include grading activities, asphalt paving,  9  construction worker trips, stationary equipment (such as saws and generators), nonresidential  10  architectural coatings, and mobile equipment emissions (U.S. Air Force, 2003).  11  Airstrip expansion and clearing around airstrips would require land clearing activities.  It was  12  assumed 60,000 square feet (ft²) would be required for airstrip expansion, with 500 feet on  13  each side of the airstrips. Based on these assumptions, the construction emissions were  14  calculated using the methodology expressed below.  15  D.1.1.1.2 Grading Activities  16  Grading activities are divided into grading equipment emissions and grading operations  17  emissions.  18  Grading equipment emissions are combustive emissions from equipment engines and are  19  calculated in the following manner:  20  VOC = 0.22 (lb/acre/day) * acres * DPY1/2,000  21  NOx = 2.07 (lb/acre/day) * acres * DPY1/2,000  22  PM10 = 0.17 (lb/acre/day) * acres * DPY1/2,000  23  CO = 0.55 (lb/acre/day) * acres * DPY1/2,000  24  SO2 = 0.21 (lb/acre/day) * acres * DPY1/2,000  25  Where  26  acres = number of gross acres to be graded during Phase I construction  27  DPY1 = number of days per year used for grading during Phase I construction  28  2,000 = conversion factor from pounds to tons  29  lb = pounds  30  NOx = nitrogen oxides  31  PM10 = particulate matter with diameter less than or equal to 10 micrometers  32  VOC = volatile organic compound  33  34  All emissions are represented as tons per year.  35  Grading operations emissions are fugitive dust and tiny soil particles distributed into the air  36  through ground disturbance and are calculated using a similar equation from the Sacramento  APPENDIX D, AIR QUALITY |  APRIL 2014  1  Air Quality Management District (SAQMD) and South Coast Air Quality Management District  2  (SCAQMD) (U.S. Air Force, 2003). This calculation includes grading and truck hauling  3  emissions.  4  Emissions calculation:  PM10 (tons/yr) =60.7 (lb/acre/day) * acres * DPY1/2,000  6  Where  7  acres = number of gross acres to be graded during Phase I construction  8  DPY1 = number of days per year used for grading during Phase I construction  9  2,000 = conversion factor from pounds to tons  yr = year  11  The calculations assumed that there were no controls used to reduce fugitive emissions. Also,  12  it was assumed that construction activities would occur within calendar year (CY) 2009  13  through CY 2017 (2,922 days), and that grading activities would represent 10 percent of that  14  total, or 292 days.  Construction activities not already approved in the Final Environmental  Impact Statement Record of Decision (ROD) were assumed to begin in quarter three of  16  CY 2011 and continue through CY 2017 (2,008 days).  The emissions factors were derived from  17  the SAQMD and SCAQMD (U.S. Air Force, 2003).  18  D.1.1.1.3 Stationary and Mobile Equipment  19  Emissions from generators for mobile emitters were calculated assuming six hours of  operation per event, five events per week and five sites operating simultaneously. It was  21  assumed a diesel generator would be used. Off-road vehicles (all-terrain vehicles [ATVs],  22  motorcycles, and high-mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles [HMMWV, “humvees”]) and  23  watercraft emissions are calculated. The number of hours of operation varies based on the  24  activity.  Detailed information is provided in Chapter 2 for each activity type.  Each activity has the potential to use a mixture of vehicles.  To determine air pollutant  26  emissions, calculations were completed for each vehicle type specified, assuming the total  27  number of vehicles consisted of only that vehicle.  The vehicle exhibiting the highest overall  28  emissions was chosen to represent vehicle emissions for that activity to be compared to the  29  ROI. Thus, emissions from any mixture of vehicles would have emissions less than or equal to  the emissions calculated.  31  The following equation was used to calculate generator and off-road vehicle emissions:  32  EP = (EF * OT * LF/100 * hp/1,000 * N)/2,000  33  Where  34  EP = pollutant emission (tons/yr)  EF = emission factor (lb/1,000 hp-hr)  36  OT = operating time (hr)  37  LF = load factor (%)  38  100 = convert percentage to decimal  D6 APPENDIX D, AIR QUALITY |  APRIL 2014 1  hp = horsepower of generator  2  2,000 = conversion factor from pounds to tons  3  hp-hr = horsepower-hours  4  hr = hours  5  D.1.1.1.4 Aircraft Emissions  6  Due to limited information, certain assumptions were made to develop the air quality  7  analysis. The aircraft emissions were calculated using the proposed operation tempo  8  outlined in Chapter 2. The sortie activities would involve CV-22, UH-60, HH-60, C-130, CH-47,  9  C-17, Cessna 172, C-145, PC-12, M-28, and Casa-212 aircraft.  10  Aircraft Flying Operations  11  Aircraft operations of concern are those that occur from ground level up to 3,000 feet above  12  ground level (AGL).  The 3,000-foot AGL ceiling was assumed as the atmospheric mixing  13  height above which any pollutant generated would not contribute to increased pollutant  14  concentrations at ground level.  The aircraft operation of interest within the mixing zone is the  15  landing and takeoff (LTO) cycle.  The LTO is characterized by five modes of operation:  16  approach, taxi-in, taxi-out, takeoff, and climb-out. The Proposed Action and alternatives use  17  aircraft and helicopters operating under the 3,000-foot AGL ceiling, therefore all time under  18  the mixing height is included in the analysis.  19  The LTO cycle is the basis for calculating pollutant emissions.  For each mode of operation  20  during an LTO cycle, an aircraft engine operates at a specified power setting and for a specific  21  period (time in mode). The pollutant emission rate is a function of the engine’s operating  22  mode, the fuel flow rate, and the engine’s overall efficiency. Emissions for one complete LTO  23  cycle for a particular aircraft are calculated by knowing the specific engine pollutant  24  emissions factors for each mode of operation.  25  The U.S. Air Force has developed emissions factors for aircraft engines. The table lists the  26  various engine modes, time in for each mode, fuel flow, and corresponding pollutant  27  emissions factors. Using these data, as well as information on activity levels (i.e., number of  28  sorties/LTO operations), pollutant emissions for each aircraft were calculated. Aircraft flying  29  operations were calculated in MS Excel using LTO cycles.  As previously described, emissions  30  from engine exhaust occur for each operation during idle/taxi-out, takeoff, climb-out,  31  approach, and taxi/idle-in (Table D-2).  Only those portions of the flying operation that take  32  place below the atmospheric mixing height are considered (these are the only emissions  33  presumed to affect ground-level concentrations).  34  Table D-2. Aircraft and Engine Mode  Aircraft Mode  Engine Mode  Taxi/idle-out  Idle  Takeoff  Military or afterburner  Climb-out  Intermediate  Approach  Approach  Taxi/idle-in  Idle  35 Each activity required a different assortment of aircraft, in which any combination could be 36 used.  For the purposes of the air quality analysis, emissions were calculated assuming the APPENDIX D, AIR QUALITY |  APRIL 2014  1  maximum number of aircraft and hours of operation.  The aircraft that had the highest  2  emissions was used to compare to the ROI. The maximum number of aircraft, hours, and days  3  of operations that were outlined in Chapter 2 were used for the analysis of air pollutant  4  emissions per event and per year.  5  For example, for Light Aviation Proficiency Training (LAPT), four possible aircraft may be used  6  (Casa-212, PC-12, C-145, and/or M-28) for a total of four aircraft operating for two hours each,  7  five times per day.   Emissions were calculated for all four aircraft types assuming that four  8  Casa-212 would be used, or four PC-12s.   Once the emissions were calculated, the aircraft  9  exhibiting the highest emissions was chosen to represent the aircraft emissions for LAPT, with  10  the expectation that any combination of aircraft could be used and the emission levels would  11  be less than or equal to those shown in this analysis.  Table D-3 shows the aircraft used for  12  each activity type in the air quality analysis.  13  Table D-3.

Using operation tables provided in Chapter 2, the amount of time an 31 aircraft is under 3,000 feet AGL in the ROI was determined for each of the aircraft types. D8 APPENDIX D, AIR QUALITY |  APRIL 2014 1  D.1.1.1.5 Munition Emissions  2  Munition emissions for the Proposed Action and alternatives training operations  were  3  calculated using the same methodology.   For all munitions, emissions factors were used to  4  complete the analysis (Table D-4).  5  Emissions calculation:  6  Pollutant Emissions = EF *Qty/2,000  7  Where  8  pollutant emissions = emissions for the associated pollutant (i.e., CO or NOx) (tons/yr)  9  EF = emissions factor for the pollutant (lb/item)  10  Qty = quantity (item/year)  11  2,000 = conversion from pounds to tons (1 ton = 2,000 pounds)  12  Table D-4.

The database contains information on stationary and  17  mobile sources that emit criteria air pollutants and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs).  The  18  database includes estimates of annual emissions, by source, of air pollutants in each area of  19  the country on a yearly basis.  The NEI includes emissions estimates for all 50 states, the  20  District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  Emissions estimates for individual  21  point or major sources (facilities), as well as county-level estimates for area, mobile, and other  22  sources, are currently from an extract of USEPA's NEI database. Data were extracted in  23  August 2005 (1999 emissions) and August 2008 (2002 emissions).  1 Criteria air pollutants are those for which the USEPA has set health-based standards. Four of 2 the six criteria pollutants are included in the NEI database: 3 • CO 4 • NOx • SO2 6 • PM10 and particulate matter with diameter less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) 7 The NEI also includes emissions of VOCs, which are ozone precursors, emitted from motor 8 vehicle fuel distribution and chemical manufacturing, as well as other solvent uses. VOCs 9 react with NOx in the atmosphere to form O3.  The NEI database defines three classes of criteria air pollutant sources: 11 • Point sources. Stationary sources of emissions, such as an electric power plant, that can 12 be identified by name and location. A “major” source emits a threshold amount (or 13 more) of at least one criteria pollutant and must be inventoried and reported. Many 14 states also inventory and report stationary sources that emit amounts below the thresholds for each pollutant. 16 • Area sources. Small point sources such as a home or office building or a diffuse 17 stationary source such as wildfires or agricultural tilling. These sources do not 18 individually produce sufficient emissions to qualify as point sources. Dry cleaners are 19 one example; for instance, a single dry cleaner within an inventory area typically will not qualify as a point source, but collectively the emissions from all of the dry cleaning 21 facilities in the inventory area may be significant and therefore must be included in 22 the inventory. 23 • Mobile sources. Any kind of vehicle or equipment with a gasoline or diesel engine 24 (such as an airplane or ship). The following are the main sources of criteria pollutant emissions data for the NEI: 26 • For electric generating units, USEPA’s Emissions Tracking System/Continuous 27 Emissions Monitoring Data and Department of Energy fuel use data. 28 • For other large stationary sources, state data and older inventories where state data 29 were not submitted. • For on-road mobile sources, the Federal Highway Administration's estimate of vehicle 31 miles traveled and emissions factors from USEPA’s MOBILE Model. 32 • For non-road mobile sources, USEPA’s NONROAD Model. 33 • For stationary area sources, state data, USEPA-developed estimates for some sources, 34 and older inventories where state or USEPA data were not submitted. • State and local environmental agencies supply most of the point source data. USEPA’s 36 Clean Air Market program supplies emissions data for electric power plants. APPENDIX D, AIR QUALITY |  APRIL 2014 1 D.2.1 Greenhouse Gases 2 Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are chemical compounds in the Earth’s atmosphere that trap heat. 3 Gases exhibiting greenhouse properties come from both natural and human sources. Water 4 vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are examples of GHGs that have both natural and man-made sources, while other gases such as those used for 6 aerosols are exclusively man-made. In the U.S., GHG emissions come mostly from energy use. 7 These are driven largely by economic growth, fuel used for electricity generation, and 8 weather patterns affecting heating and cooling needs. 9 Typically, GHG emissions are represented as CO2 equivalents (CO2-e) based on the molecule’s global warming potential or ability to trap heat in the atmosphere relative to CO2 11 (USEPA, 2005).  Therefore, all GHG emissions calculations and analysis in this document are 12 represented in CO2-e. 13 The USEPA has recently promulgated several final regulations involving GHGs, either under 14 the authority of the CAA, or as directed by Congress, but none of them apply directly to the Proposed Action. However, Eglin AFB may be required to adjust their Title V Air Operating 16 Permit under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring 17 Rule, 75 Federal Register (FR) 31514, 3 June 2010. Likewise, Eglin has already prepared a 18 Greenhouse Gas Baseline Emissions Inventory (U.S. Air Force, 2010a) and will be required to 19 report annual emissions to USEPA under Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases, 74 FR 56260, 30 October 2009. As an affected facility, Eglin has prepared a Greenhouse Gas 21 Monitoring Plan (U.S. Air Force, 2010b). 22 The potential effects of GHG emissions from the Proposed Action are by nature global. Given 23 the global nature of climate change and the current state of the science, it is not useful at this 24 time to attempt to link the emissions quantified for local actions to any specific climatological change or resulting environmental impact.  Nonetheless, the GHG emissions from the No 26 Action Alternative and the Proposed Action and alternatives have been quantified to the 27 extent feasible in this Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for information and comparative 28 purposes. 29 D.2.1.1 GHG Construction Emissions Combustion of fossil fuels by construction equipment and constructions workers’ vehicles 31 during commutes to and from the site would contribute to increased GHG emissions. 32 Construction equipment emits approximately 22.2 pounds of CO2 per gallon of diesel and 33 worker vehicles emit 19.4 pounds of CO2 per gallon of gasoline (USEPA, 2009b). These 34 emission rates can be decreased with less idling and improved maintenance of equipment. It was assumed that construction vehicles would operate for approximately 1,248 hours 36 annually.  Of 250 potential working days, 62.5 percent (or 157 days) are suitable for 37 construction activities (i.e., no precipitation) (Sperling’s Best Places, 2010).  These vehicles 38 were assumed to each combust 4 gallons of diesel per hour (Fusetti and Monahan, 2008). 39 Stationary sources for construction were also included in the analysis.  It was assumed that a number of small diesel-fueled generators would be operated during working hours.  Each 41 generator was assumed to combust 1 gallon per hour of operation. APPENDIX D, AIR QUALITY |  APRIL 2014  1  It was assumed that construction workers would be required to commute each day for  2  157 work days.  ACAM estimates the average commute to be 15 miles one way, and 23.9 miles  3  per gallon average was assumed for commuter vehicles (USEPA, 2009b).  4  D.2.1.1.1 GHG Personnel Emissions  5  The addition of personnel to the region would also lead to increased GHG emissions.  The two  6  primary sources for these GHG emissions would be mobile emissions from added personnel  7  commutes, and emissions in the home from personnel running home heating and cooling  8  and other electrical devices.  Commuter emissions were calculated using the same  9  methodology as for the construction workers above.  The USEPA estimates that in the U.S.,  10  approximately 4 metric tons of CO2-e are produced per person per year in the home  11  (USEPA, 2010b).  12  D.2.1.1.2 GHG Operational Emissions  13  Combustion of fuels during flight operations would also cause GHG emissions.  Emissions  14  were calculated using fuel flow rates for the respective aircraft.  The emissions factor for jet  15  fuel (JP-8) is 22.1 pounds CO2-e per gallon of fuel, respectively (U.S. Air Force, 2009).  16  Calculations were based on the estimated annual sorties for each aircraft under each  17  alternative as discussed in Chapter 2 of the EIS.  18  GHG emissions from munitions use were calculated using emissions factors on a per item  19  basis as outlined in AP-42 (USEPA, 2009a). Munitions to be used under each alternative as  20  well as numbers for each munition type are listed in Chapter 2 of the EIS.  1  D.3 REFERENCES  2  Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), 2003.

NOISE 2 Appendix H provides a general noise primer to 3 4 used in support of how and why noise is modeled. Noise is generally described as unwanted sound.  Unwanted sound can be based on objective 6 effects (such as hearing loss or damage to structures) or subjective judgments (community 7 annoyance). Noise analysis thus requires a combination of physical measurement of sound, 8 physical and physiological effects, plus psycho-and socio-acoustic effects. 9 Section H.1 of this appendix describes how sound is measured and summarizes noise impacts in terms of community acceptability and land use compatibility.  Section H.2 gives detailed 11 descriptions of the effects of noise that lead to the impact guidelines presented in 12 Section H.1.  Section H.3 provides a description of the specific methods used to predict 13 aircraft noise. 14 H.1 NOISE DESCRIPTORS AND IMPACT Aircraft operating in military airspace generate two types of sound.  One is “subsonic” noise, 16 which is continuous sound generated by the aircraft’s engines and also by air flowing over the 17 aircraft itself.  The other is sonic booms (where authorized for supersonic), which are transient 18 impulsive sounds generated during supersonic flight.  These are quantified in different ways. 19 Section H.1.1 describes the characteristics which are used to describe sound. Section H.1.2 describes the specific noise metrics used for noise impact analysis.  Section H.1.3 describes 21 how environmental impact and land use compatibility are judged in terms of these 22 quantities. 23 H.1.1 Quantifying Sound 24 Measurement and perception of sound involve two basic physical characteristics: amplitude and frequency.  Amplitude is a measure of the strength of the sound and is directly measured 26 in terms of the pressure of a sound wave.  Because sound pressure varies in time, various 27 types of pressure averages are usually used.  Frequency, commonly perceived as pitch, is the 28 number of times per second the sound causes air molecules to oscillate. Frequency is 29 measured in units of cycles per second, or hertz (Hz). Amplitude. The loudest sounds the human ear can comfortably hear have acoustic energy 31 one trillion times the acoustic energy of sounds the ear can barely detect.  Because of this vast 32 range, attempts to represent sound amplitude by pressure are generally unwieldy.  Sound is, 33 therefore, usually represented on a logarithmic scale with a unit called the decibel (dB). 34 Sound measured on the decibel scale is referred to as a sound level.  The threshold of human hearing is approximately 0 dB, and the threshold of discomfort or pain is around 120 dB. 36 Because of the logarithmic nature of the decibel scale, sounds levels do not add and subtract 37 directly and are somewhat cumbersome to handle mathematically.  However, some simple H2 APPENDIX H, NOISE  | APRIL 2014 1  rules of thumb are useful in dealing with sound levels. First, if a sound’s intensity is doubled,  2  the sound level increases by 3 dB, regardless of the initial sound level.  Thus, for example:  3  60 dB + 60 dB = 63 dB, and  4  80 dB + 80 dB = 83 dB.  The total sound level produced by two sounds of different levels is usually only slightly more  6  than the higher of the two.  For example:  7  60.0 dB + 70.0 dB = 70.4 dB.  8  Because the addition of sound levels behaves differently than that of ordinary numbers, such  9  addition is often referred to as “decibel addition” or “energy addition.” The latter term arises  from the fact that the combination of decibel values consists of first converting each decibel  11  value to its corresponding acoustic energy, then adding the energies using the normal rules  12  of addition, and finally converting the total energy back to its decibel equivalent.  13  The difference in dB between two sounds represents the ratio of the amplitudes of those two  14  sounds.  Because human senses tend to be proportional (i.e., detect whether one sound is  twice as big as another) rather than absolute (i.e., detect whether one sound is a given  16  number of pressure units bigger than another), the decibel scale correlates well with human  17  response.  18  Under laboratory conditions, differences in sound level of 1 dB can be detected by the human  19  ear.  In the community, the smallest change in average noise level that can be detected is  about 3 dB.  A change in sound level of about 10 dB is usually perceived by the average  21  person as a doubling (or halving) of the sound’s loudness, and this relation holds true for loud  22  sounds and for quieter sounds.  A decrease in sound level of 10 dB actually represents a 90  23  percent decrease in sound intensity but only a 50 percent decrease in perceived loudness  24  because of the nonlinear response of the human ear (similar to most human senses).  The one exception to the exclusive use of levels, rather than physical pressure units, to  26  quantify sound is in the case of sonic booms. Sonic booms are coherent waves with specific  27  characteristics.  There is a long-standing tradition of describing individual sonic booms by the  28  amplitude of the shock waves, in pounds per square foot (psf).  This is particularly relevant  29  when assessing structural effects as opposed to loudness or cumulative community response.  In this environmental analysis, sonic booms are quantified by either dB or psf, as appropriate  31  for the particular impact being assessed.  32  Frequency. The normal human ear can hear frequencies from about 20 Hz to about 20,000  33  Hz.  It is most sensitive to sounds in the 1,000 to 4,000 Hz range. When measuring community  34  response to noise, it is common to adjust the frequency content of the measured sound to  correspond to the frequency sensitivity of the human ear. This adjustment is called A  36  weighting (ANSI 1988). Sound levels that have been so adjusted are referred to as A weighted  37  sound levels.  38  The audible quality of high thrust engines in modern military combat aircraft can be  39  somewhat different than other aircraft, including (at high throttle settings) the characteristic  nonlinear crackle of high thrust engines.  The spectral characteristics of various noises are  41  accounted for by A-weighting, which approximates the response of the human ear but does  not necessarily account for quality.  There are other, more detailed, weighting factors that have been applied to sounds.  In the 1950s and 1960s, when noise from civilian jet aircraft became an issue, substantial research was performed to determine what characteristics of jet noise were a problem.  The metrics Perceived Noise Level and Effective Perceived Noise Level were developed.  These accounted for nonlinear behavior of hearing and the importance of low frequencies at high levels, and for many years airport/airbase noise contours were presented in terms of Noise Exposure Forecast, which was based on Perceived Noise Level and Effective Perceived Noise Level.  In the 1970s, however, it was realized that the primary intrusive aspect of aircraft noise was the high noise level, a factor which is well represented by A-weighted levels and day–night average sound level (DNL).  The refinement of Perceived Noise Level, Effective Perceived Noise Level, and Noise Exposure Forecast was not significant in protecting the public from noise. There has been continuing research on noise metrics and the importance of sound quality, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) for military aircraft noise and by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for civil aircraft noise.  The metric Ldnmr, which is described later and accounts for the increased annoyance of rapid onset rate of sound, is a product of this long-term research. The amplitude of A weighted sound levels is measured in dB.  It is common for some noise analysts to denote the unit of A-weighted sounds by dBA.  As long as the use of A-weighting is understood, there is no difference between dB or dBA: it is only important that the use of A-weighting be made clear.  In this environmental analysis, A-weighted sound levels are reported as dB. A-weighting is appropriate for continuous sounds, which are perceived by the ear.  Impulsive sounds, such as sonic booms, are perceived by more than just the ear.  When experienced indoors, there can be secondary noise from rattling of the building.  Vibrations may also be felt.  C-weighting (ANSI 1988) is applied to such sounds. This is a frequency weighting that is relatively flat over the range of human hearing (about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz) that rolls off above 5,000 Hz and below 50 Hz.  In this study, C-weighted sound levels are used for the assessment of sonic booms and other impulsive sounds.  As with A-weighting, the unit is dB, but dBC is sometimes used for clarity.  In this study, sound levels are reported in both A-weighting and C-weighting dBs, and C-weighted metrics are denoted when used. Time Averaging. Sound pressure of a continuous sound varies greatly with time, so it is customary to deal with sound levels that represent averages over time.  Levels presented as instantaneous (i.e., as might be read from the display of a sound level meter) are based on averages of sound energy over either 1/8 second (fast) or 1 second (slow). The formal definitions of fast and slow levels are somewhat complex, with details that are important to the makers and users of instrumentation.  They may, however, be thought of as levels corresponding to the root mean-square sound pressure measured over the 1/8-second or 1-second periods. The most common uses of the fast or slow sound level in environmental analysis is in the discussion of the maximum sound level that occurs from the action, and in discussions of typical sound levels. Figure H-1 is a chart of A-weighted sound levels from typical sounds. Some (air conditioner, vacuum cleaner) are continuous sounds whose levels are constant for some time.  Some (automobile, heavy truck) are the maximum sound during a vehicle passby. Some (urban daytime, urban nighttime) are averages over some extended period.  A variety H4 APPENDIX H, NOISE  | APRIL 2014 1  of noise metrics have been developed to describe noise over different time periods.  These  2  are described in Section H.1.2.  3  H.1.2  Noise Metrics  4  H.1.2.1 Maximum Sound Level  5  The highest A-weighted sound level measured during a single event in which the sound level  6  changes value as time goes on (e.g., an aircraft overflight) is called the maximum A-weighted  7  sound level or maximum sound level, for short.  It is usually abbreviated by ALM, Lmax, or Lmax.   8  The maximum sound level is important in judging the interference caused by a noise event  9  with conversation, TV or radio listening, sleeping, or other common activities.  11  Figure H-1. Typical A-Weighted Sound Levels of Common Sounds  12  H.1.2.2 Sound Exposure Level  13  Individual time-varying noise events have two main characteristics:   a sound level that  14  changes throughout the event and a period of time during which the event is heard.  15  Although the maximum sound level reached during the event provides some measure of the  16  intrusiveness of the event, it alone does not completely describe the total event.  The period  APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014  1  of time during which the sound is heard is also significant.  The Sound Exposure Level  2  (abbreviated SEL or LAE for A weighted sounds) combines both of these characteristics into a  3  single metric.  4  SEL is a composite metric that represents both the intensity of a sound and its duration.  Mathematically, the mean square sound pressure is computed over the duration of the event,  6  then multiplied by the duration in seconds, and the resultant product is turned into a sound  7  level.  It does not directly represent the sound level heard at any given time, but rather  8  provides a measure of the net impact of the entire acoustic event.  It has been well  9  established in the scientific community that SEL measures this impact much more reliably  than just the maximum sound level. Because the SEL and the maximum sound level are both  11  used to describe single events, there is sometimes confusion between the two, so the specific  12  metric used should be clearly stated.  13  SEL can be computed for C-weighted levels (appropriate for impulsive sounds), and the  14  results denoted CSEL or LCE.  SEL for A-weighted sound is sometimes denoted ASEL. Within  this study, SEL is used for A weighted sounds and CSEL for C-weighted.  16  H.1.2.3 Equivalent Sound Level  17  For longer periods of time, total sound is represented by the equivalent continuous sound  18  pressure level (Leq). Leq is the average sound level over some time period (often an hour or a  19  day, but any explicit time span can be specified), with the averaging being done on the same  energy basis as used for SEL.  SEL and Leq are closely related, with Leq being SEL over some  21  time period normalized by that time.  22  Just as SEL has proven to be a good measure of the noise impact of a single event, Leq has  23  been established to be a good measure of the impact of a series of events during a given time  24  period.  Also, while Leq is defined as an average, it is effectively a sum over that time period  and is, thus, a measure of the cumulative impact of noise.  26  H.1.2.4 Day–Night Average Sound Level  27  Noise tends to be more intrusive at night than during the day.  This effect is accounted for by  28  applying a 10 dB penalty to events that occur after 10 pm and before 7 am.  If Leq is computed  29  over a 24-hour period with this nighttime penalty applied, the result is the DNL.  DNL is the  community noise metric recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  31  (EPA 1974) and has been adopted by most Federal agencies (FICON 1992).  It has been well  32  established that DNL correlates well with long-term community response to noise (Schultz  33  1978, Finegold et al. 1994).  This correlation is presented in Section H.1.3 of this appendix.  34  DNL accounts for the total, or cumulative, noise impact at a given location, and for this reason  is often referred to as a “cumulative” metric.  It was noted earlier that, for impulsive sounds,  36  such as sonic booms, C-weighting is more appropriate than A weighting. DNL computed  37  with C-weighting is denoted CDNL or LCdn. This procedure has been standardized, and impact  38  interpretive criteria similar to those for DNL have been developed (CHABA 1981).  H6 APPENDIX H, NOISE  | APRIL 2014 1  H.1.2.5 Onset-Adjusted Monthly Day–Night Average Sound Level  2  Aircraft operations in military training airspace generate a noise environment somewhat  3  different from other community noise environments.  Overflights are sporadic, occurring at  4  random times and varying from day to day and week to week.  This situation differs from  most community noise environments, in which noise tends to be continuous or patterned.  6  Individual military overflight events also differ from typical community noise events in that  7  noise from a low-altitude, high-airspeed flyover can have a rather sudden onset.  8  To represent these differences, the conventional DNL metric is adjusted to account for the  9  “surprise” effect of the sudden onset of aircraft noise events on humans (Plotkin et al. 1987;  Stusnick et al. 1992, 1993).  For aircraft exhibiting a rate of increase in sound level (called  11  onset rate) of from 15 to 150 dB per second, an adjustment or penalty ranging from 0 to 11 dB  12  is added to the normal SEL.  Onset rates above 150 dB per second require an 11 dB penalty,  13  while onset rates below 15 dB per second require no adjustment.  The DNL is then  14  determined in the same manner as for conventional aircraft noise events and is designated as  onset-rate adjusted day–night average sound level (abbreviated Ldnmr).  16  Because of the irregular occurrences of aircraft operations, the number of average daily  17  operations is determined by using the calendar month with the highest number of  18  operations.  The monthly average is denoted Ldnmr.  Noise levels are calculated the same way  19  for both DNL and Ldnmr.  Ldnmr is interpreted by the same criteria as used for DNL.  H.1.2.6 Peak Noise Level  21  The peak noise level metric characterizes the strength of impulsive noise such as sonic boom  22  peak overpressure or munitions detonations. Peak noise level can be expressed in pounds per  23  square foot (psf) or in decibel version (dB Lpk).  The units psf are most often used when  24  relating boom amplitude to human or animal response, although the direct physical pressure,  as reflected by the unit (dB Lpk) is most commonly used when assessing effects on structures.  26  Peak noise levels are strongly affected by meteorological conditions such as humidity and  27  temperature which vary over time.  To account for the variability in peak noise levels due to  28  meteorological effects, peak noise levels are generally specified as the level not exceeded for  29  a certain percentage of the time. As an example, noise generated by detonation of a certain  munitions type may exceed 115 dBP at a certain location only in the 15 percent of days with  31  the most unfavorable meteorological conditions.  The metric used to describe the peak noise  32  level exceeding only 15 percent of the time is PK 15(met).  33  H.1.3 Noise Impact  34  H.1.3.1 Community Reaction  Studies of long-term community annoyance to numerous types of environmental noise show  36  that DNL correlates well with the annoyance. Schultz (1978) showed a consistent relationship  37  between DNL and annoyance. Shultz’s original curve fit (Figure H-2) shows that there is a  38  remarkable consistency in results of attitudinal surveys which relate the percentages of  39  groups of people who express various degrees of annoyance when exposed to different DNL.  APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014 H7 1  Source: Schultz 1978.  2  Figure H-2. Community Surveys of Noise Annoyance  3  Another study reaffirmed this relationship (Fidell et al. 1989). Figure H-3 shows an updated  4  form of the curve fit (Finegold et al. 1994) in comparison with the original.  The updated fit,  5  which does not differ substantially from the original, is the current preferred form.  In general,  6  correlation coefficients of 0.85 to 0.95 are found between the percentages of groups of  7  people highly annoyed and the level of average noise exposure. The correlation coefficients  8  for the annoyance of individuals are relatively low, however, on the order of 0.5 or less.  This is  9  not surprising, considering the varying personal factors that influence the manner in which  10  individuals react to noise.   For example, individuals with autism are often very strongly  11  affected by sudden noises (Tang et al. 2002).  Persons with autism often report experiencing  12  oversensitivity to noise and are often particularly sensitive to high-pitched or sudden onset  13  noises (Grandin 1991).   Nevertheless, findings substantiate that community annoyance to  14  aircraft noise is represented quite reliably using DNL.  15  As noted earlier for SEL, DNL does not represent the sound level heard at any particular time,  16  but rather represents the total sound exposure.   DNL accounts for the sound level of  17  individual noise events, the duration of those events, and the number of events.   Its use is  18  endorsed by the scientific community (ANSI 1980, 1988, 2005; EPA 1974; FICON 1992;  19  FICUN 1980).  1 2 Figure H-3. Response of Communities to Noise; Comparison of 3 Original (Schultz 1978) and Current (Finegold et al. 1994) Curve Fits 4 While DNL is the best metric for quantitatively assessing cumulative noise impact, it does not lend itself to intuitive interpretation by non-experts.  Accordingly, it is common for 6 environmental noise analyses to include other metrics for illustrative purposes.  A general 7 indication of the noise environment can be presented by noting the maximum sound levels 8 which can occur and the number of times per day noise events will be loud enough to be 9 heard.  Use of other metrics as supplements to DNL has been endorsed by Federal agencies (FICON 1992). 11 The Schultz curve is generally applied to annual average DNL.  In Section H.1.2, Ldnmr was 12 described and presented as being appropriate for quantifying noise in military airspace.  The 13 Schultz curve is used with Ldnmr as the noise metric.  Ldnmr is always equal to or greater than 14 DNL, so impact is generally higher than would have been predicted if the onset rate and busiest-month adjustments were not accounted for. 16 There are several points of interest in the noise-annoyance relation.  The first is DNL of 65 dB. 17 This is a level most commonly used for noise planning purposes and represents a 18 compromise between community impact and the need for activities like aviation which do 19 cause noise.  Areas exposed to DNL above 65 dB are generally not considered suitable for residential use. The second is DNL of 55 dB, which was identified by EPA as a level “...requisite 21 to protect the public health and welfare with an adequate margin of safety,” (EPA 1974) which 22 is essentially a level below which adverse impact is not expected.  The third is DNL of 75 dB. 23 This is the lowest level at which adverse health effects could be credible (EPA 1974). The very 24 high annoyance levels correlated with DNL of 75 dB make such areas unsuitable for residential land use. APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014  1  Sonic boom exposure is measured by C-weighting, with the corresponding cumulative metric  2  being CDNL.   Correlation between CDNL and annoyance has been established, based on  3  community reaction to impulsive sounds (CHABA 1981).  Values of the C weighted equivalent  4  to the Schultz curve are different than that of the Schultz curve itself.  Table H-1 shows the  5  relation between annoyance, DNL, and CDNL.  6  Table H-1. Relation Between Annoyance, DNL and CDNL  DNL  % Highly Annoyed  CDNL  45  0.83  42  50  1.66  46  55  3.31  51  60  6.48  56  65  12.29  60  70  22.10  65  7  Interpretation of CDNL from impulsive noise is accomplished by using the CDNL versus  8  annoyance values in Table H-1.  CDNL can be interpreted in terms of an “equivalent  9  annoyance” DNL.  For example, CDNL of 52, 61, and 69 dB are equivalent to DNL of 55, 65, and  10  75 dB, respectively.  If both continuous and impulsive noise occurs in the same area, impacts  11  are assessed separately for each.  12  H.1.3.2 Land Use Compatibility  13  As noted above, the inherent variability between individuals makes it impossible to predict  14  accurately how any individual will react to a given noise event. Nevertheless, when a  15  community is considered as a whole, its overall reaction to noise can be represented with a  16  high degree of confidence.  As described above, the best noise exposure metric for this  17  correlation is the DNL or Ldnmr for military overflights.  Impulsive noise can be assessed by  18  relating CDNL to an “equivalent annoyance” DNL, as outlined in Section H.1.3.1.  19  In June 1980, an ad hoc Federal Interagency Committee on Urban Noise published guidelines  20  (FICUN 1980) relating DNL to compatible land uses.  This committee was composed of  21  representatives from DoD, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development; EPA; and  22  the Veterans Administration.  Since the issuance of these guidelines, Federal agencies have  23  generally adopted these guidelines for their noise analyses.  24  Following the lead of the committee, DoD and FAA adopted the concept of land-use  25  compatibility as the accepted measure of aircraft noise effect.  The FAA included the  26  committee’s guidelines in the Federal Aviation Regulations (DOT 1984).  These guidelines are  27  reprinted in Table H-2, along with the explanatory notes included in the regulation. Although  28  these guidelines are not mandatory (note the footnote “*” in the table), they provide the best  29  means for determining noise impact in airport communities.  In general, residential land uses  30  normally are not compatible with outdoor DNL values above 65 dB, and the extent of land  31  areas and populations exposed to DNL of 65 dB and higher provides the best means for  32  assessing the noise impacts of alternative aircraft actions.  In some cases a change in noise  33  level, rather than an absolute threshold, may be a more appropriate measure of impact.  APPENDIX H, NOISE  | APRIL 2014 1 Table H-2.

The  3  following sections describe particular noise effects. These effects include non-auditory health  4  effects,  annoyance,  speech  interference,  sleep  disturbance,  noise-induced  hearing  5  impairment, noise effects on animals and wildlife, effects on property values, noise effects on  6  structures, terrain, and cultural resources.  7  H.2.1  Annoyance  8  The primary effect of aircraft noise on exposed communities is one of annoyance.   Noise  9  annoyance is defined by the EPA as any negative subjective reaction on the part of an  10  individual or group (EPA 1974).   As noted in the discussion of DNL above, community  11  annoyance is best measured by that metric.  12  Because the EPA Levels Document (EPA 1974) identified DNL of 55 dB as “. . . requisite to  13  protect public health and welfare with  an  adequate margin of safety,” it is commonly  14  assumed that 55 dB should be adopted as a criterion for community noise analysis.   From a  15  noise exposure perspective, that would be an ideal selection.   However, financial resources  APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014 1 are generally not available to achieve that goal.  Most agencies have identified DNL of 65 dB 2 as a criterion which protects those most impacted by noise, and which can often be achieved 3 on a practical basis (FICON 1992).  This corresponds to about 12 percent of the exposed 4 population being highly annoyed. Although DNL of 65 dB is widely used as a benchmark for significant noise impact, and is 6 often an acceptable compromise, it is not a statutory limit, and it is appropriate to consider 7 other thresholds in particular cases. Local ordinances and regulations have been adopted by 8 many municipal governments to prevent civilian development near military installations that 9 would be incompatible with noise generated by military operations.  The decision to adopt such measures, and the specific content of the ordinances and regulations, is up to the 11 municipal government.  In many cases, the 65 DNL noise contour line is adopted as the 12 threshold level above which land use restrictions are invoked. 13 H.2.2 Speech Interference 14 Speech interference associated with aircraft noise is a primary cause of annoyance to individuals on the ground.  The disruption of routine activities such as radio or television 16 listening, telephone use, or family conversation gives rise to frustration and irritation.  The 17 quality of speech communication is also important in classrooms, offices, and industrial 18 settings and can cause fatigue and vocal strain in those who attempt to communicate over 19 the noise.  Speech is an acoustic signal characterized by rapid fluctuations in sound level and frequency pattern.  It is essential for optimum speech intelligibility to recognize these 21 continually shifting sound patterns. Not only does noise diminish the ability to perceive the 22 auditory signal, but it also reduces a listener’s ability to follow the pattern of signal 23 fluctuation.  In general, interference with speech communication occurs when intrusive noise 24 exceeds about 60 dB (FICON 1992). Indoor speech interference can be expressed as a percentage of sentence intelligibility 26 among two people speaking in relaxed conversation approximately 3 feet apart in a typical 27 living room or bedroom (EPA 1974).  The percentage of sentence intelligibility is a non-linear 28 function of the (steady) indoor background A-weighted sound level. Such a curve-fit yields 29 100 percent sentence intelligibility for background levels below 57 dB and yields less than 10 percent intelligibility for background levels above 73 dB.  The function is especially sensitive 31 to changes in sound level between 65 dB and 75 dB.  As an example of the sensitivity, a 1 dB 32 increase in background sound level from 70 dB to 71 dB yields a 14 percent decrease in 33 sentence intelligibility.  The sensitivity of speech interference to noise at 65 dB and above is 34 consistent with the criterion of DNL 65 dB generally taken from the Schultz curve.  This is consistent with the observation that speech interference is the primary cause of annoyance. 36 Classroom Criteria. The effect of aircraft noise on children is a controversial area.  Certain 37 studies indicate that, in certain situations, children are potentially more sensitive to noise 38 compared to adults.  For example, adults average roughly 10 percent better than young 39 children on speech intelligibility tests in high noise environments (ASA 2000).  Some studies indicate that noise negatively impacts classroom learning (e.g., Shield and Dockrell 2008). 41 In response to noise-specific and other environmental studies, Executive Order 13045, 42 Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks (1997), requires Federal 43 agencies to ensure that their policies, programs, and activities address environmental health APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014  1  and safety risks and to identify any disproportionate risks to children.  While the issue of noise  2  impacts on children’s learning is not fully settled, in May 2009, the American National  3  Standards Institute (ANSI) published a classroom acoustics standard entitled “Acoustical  4  Performance Criteria, Design Requirements, and Guidelines for Schools” (ANSI 2002).  At  present, complying with the standard is voluntary in most locations.  Essentially, the criteria  6  states that when the noisiest hour is dominated by noise from such sources as aircraft, the  7  limits for most classrooms are an hourly average A-weighted sound level of 40 dB, and the A 8  weighted sound level must not exceed 40 dB for more than 10 percent of the hour.  For  9  schools located near airfields, indoor noise levels would have to be lowered by 35–45 dBA  relative to outdoor levels (ANSI 2009).  11  H.2.3 Sleep Disturbance  12  Sleep disturbance is another source of annoyance associated with aircraft noise. This is  13  especially true because of the intermittent nature and content of aircraft noise, which is more  14  disturbing than continuous noise of equal energy and neutral meaning.  Sleep disturbance may be measured in either of two ways. “Arousal” represents actual  16  awakening from sleep, while a change in “sleep stage” represents a shift from one of four  17  sleep stages to another stage of lighter sleep without actual awakening.  In general, arousal  18  requires a somewhat higher noise level than does a change in sleep stage.  19  An analysis sponsored by the Air Force summarized 21 published studies concerning the  effects of noise on sleep (Pearsons et al. 1989). The analysis concluded that a lack of reliable  21  in-home studies, combined with large differences among the results from the various  22  laboratory studies, did not permit development of an acceptably accurate assessment  23  procedure.  The noise events used in the laboratory studies and in contrived in-home studies  24  were presented at much higher rates of occurrence than would normally be experienced.  None of the laboratory studies were of sufficiently long duration to determine any effects of  26  habituation, such as that which would occur under normal community conditions. An  27  extensive study of sleep interference in people’s own homes (Ollerhead et al. 1992) showed  28  very little disturbance from aircraft noise.  29  There is some controversy associated with these studies, so a conservative approach should  be taken in judging sleep interference.  Based on older data, the EPA identified an indoor DNL  31  of 45 dB as necessary to protect against sleep interference (EPA 1974). Assuming an outdoor 32  to-indoor noise level reduction of 20 dB for typical dwelling units, this corresponds to an  33  outdoor DNL of 65 dB as minimizing sleep interference.  34  A 1984 publication reviewed the probability of arousal or behavioral awakening in terms of  SEL (Kryter 1984). Figure H-4, extracted from Figure 10.37 of Kryter (1984), indicates that an  36  indoor SEL of 65 dB or lower should awaken less than 5 percent of those exposed.  These  37  results do not include any habituation over time by sleeping subjects. Nevertheless, this  38  provides a reasonable guideline for assessing sleep interference and corresponds to similar  39  guidance for speech interference, as noted above.  It was noted in the early sleep disturbance research that the controlled laboratory studies did  41  not account for many factors that are important to sleep behavior, such as habituation to the  42  environment and previous exposure to noise and awakenings from sources other than aircraft  43  noise. In the early 1990s, field studies were conducted to validate the earlier laboratory work.  H 16 APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014 1  The most significant finding from these studies was that an estimated 80 to 90 percent of  2  sleep disturbances were not related to individual outdoor noise events, but were instead the  3  result of indoor noise sources and other non-noise-related factors. The results showed that  4  there was less of an effect of noise on sleep in real-life conditions than had been previously  5  reported from laboratory studies.  6 7 Figure H-4. Plot of Sleep Awakening Data versus Indoor SEL 8 The interim Federal Interagency Committee on Noise (FICON) dose-response curve that was 9 recommended for use in 1992 was based on the most pertinent sleep disturbance research 10 that was conducted through the 1970s, primarily in laboratory settings.  After that time, 11 considerable field research was conducted to evaluate the sleep effects in peoples’ normal, 12 home environment.  Laboratory sleep studies tend to show higher values of sleep 13 disturbance than field studies because people who sleep in their own homes are habituated 14 to their environment and, therefore, do not wake up as easily (FICAN 1997). 15 Based on the new information, the Federal Interagency Committee on Aircraft Noise (FICAN) 16 updated its recommended dose-response curve in 1997, depicted as the lower curve in 17 Figure H-5. This figure is based on the results of three field studies (Ollerhead et al. 1992; 18 Fidell et al. 1994; Fidell et al. 1995a and 1995b), along with the datasets from six previous field 19 studies. 1 2 Figure H-5. FICAN’s 1997 Recommended Sleep 3 Disturbance Dose-Response Relationship 4 The new relationship represents the higher end, or upper envelope, of the latest field data.  It should be interpreted as predicting the “maximum percent of the exposed population 6 expected to be behaviorally awakened” or the “maximum percent awakened” for a given 7 residential population.  According to this relationship, a maximum of 3 percent of people 8 would be awakened at an indoor SEL of 58 dB, compared to 10 percent using the 1992 curve. 9 An indoor SEL of 58 dB is equivalent to outdoor SEL’s of 73 and 83 dB respectively assuming 15 and 25 dB noise level reduction from outdoor to indoor with windows open and closed, 11 respectively. 12 The FICAN 1997 curve is represented by the following equation: 13 Percent Awakenings = 0.0087 x [SEL – 30]1.79 14 Note the relatively low percentage of awakenings to fairly high noise levels. People think they are awakened by a noise event, but usually the reason for awakening is otherwise. For 16 example, the 1992 UK CAA study found the average person was awakened about 18 times per 17 night for reasons other than exposure to an aircraft noise – some of these awakenings are due 18 to the biological rhythms of sleep and some to other reasons that were not correlated with 19 specific aircraft events. In July 2008 ANSI and the Acoustical Society of America (ASA) published a method to 21 estimate the percent of the exposed population that might be awakened by multiple aircraft 22 noise events based on statistical assumptions about the probability of awakening (or not 23 awakening) (ANSI 2008).  This method relies on probability theory rather than direct field 24 research/experimental data to account for multiple events. Figure H-6 depicts the awakenings data that form the basis and equations of ANSI (2008). The 26 curve labeled ‘Eq. (B1)’ is the relationship between noise and awakening endorsed by FICAN 27 in 1997.  The ANSI recommended curve labeled ‘Eq. 1)’ quantifies the probability of 28 awakening for a population of sleepers who are exposed to an outdoor noise event as a 29 function of the associated indoor SEL in the bedroom. This curve was derived from studies of behavioral awakenings associated with noise events in “steady state” situations where the H 18 APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014 1  population has been exposed to the noise long enough to be habituated. The data points in  2  Figure H-6 come from these studies.  Unlike the FICAN curve, the ANSI 2008 curve represents  3  the average of the field research data points.  4 5 Figure H-6. Relation Between Indoor SEL and Percentage of 6 Persons Awakened as Stated in ANSI/ASA S12.9-2008/Part 6 7 In December 2008, FICAN recommended the use of this new estimation procedure for future 8 analyses of behavioral awakenings from aircraft noise. In that statement, FICAN also 9 recognized that additional sleep disturbance research is underway by various research 10 organizations, and results of that work may result in additional changes to FICAN’s position. 11 Until that time, FICAN recommends the use of ANSI (2008). 12 H.2.4 Noise-Induced Hearing Impairment 13 Residents in surrounding communities express concerns regarding the effects of aircraft noise 14 on hearing.  This section provides a brief overview of hearing loss caused by noise exposure. 15 The goal is to provide a sense of perspective as to how aircraft noise (as experienced on the 16 ground) compares to other activities that are often linked with hearing loss. 17 Hearing loss is generally interpreted as a decrease in the ear’s sensitivity or acuity to perceive 18 sound; i.e. a shift in the hearing threshold to a higher level.  This change can either be a 19 Temporary Threshold Shift (TTS), or a Permanent Threshold Shift (PTS) (Berger et al. 1995). 20 TTS can result from exposure to loud noise over a given amount of time, yet the hearing loss 21 is not necessarily permanent.  An example of TTS might be a person attending a loud music 1 concert.  After the concert is over, the person may experience a threshold shift that may last 2 several hours, depending upon the level and duration of exposure. While experiencing TTS, 3 the person becomes less sensitive to low-level sounds, particularly at certain frequencies in 4 the speech range (typically near 4,000 Hz).  Normal hearing ability eventually returns, as long as the person has enough time to recover within a relatively quiet environment. 6 PTS usually results from repeated exposure to high noise levels, where the ears are not given 7 adequate time to recover from the strain and fatigue of exposure. A common example of PTS 8 is the result of working in a loud environment such as a factory.  It is important to note that a 9 temporary shift (TTS) can eventually become permanent (PTS) over time with continuous exposure to high noise levels.  Thus, even if the ear is given time to recover from TTS, 11 repeated occurrence of TTS may eventually lead to permanent hearing loss.  The point at 12 which a TTS results in a PTS is difficult to identify and varies with a person’s sensitivity. 13 Considerable data on hearing loss have been collected and analyzed by the scientific/medical 14 community. It has been well established that continuous exposure to high noise levels will damage human hearing (EPA 1978).  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration 16 (OSHA) regulation of 1971 standardizes the limits on workplace noise exposure for protection 17 from hearing loss as an average level of 90 dB over an 8-hour work period or 85 dB over a 18 16-hour period (the average level is based on a 5 dB decrease per doubling of exposure time) 19 (DoL 1971). Even the most protective criterion (no measurable hearing loss for the most sensitive portion of the population at the ear’s most sensitive frequency, 4,000 Hz, after a 21 40-year exposure) is an average sound level of 70 dB over a 24-hour period. 22 The EPA established 75 dB for an 8-hour exposure and 70 dB for a 24-hour exposure as the 23 average noise level standard requisite to protect 96 percent of the population from greater 24 than a 5 dB PTS (EPA 1978). The National Academy of Sciences Committee on Hearing, Bioacoustics, and Biomechanics identified 75 dB as the minimum level at which hearing loss 26 may occur (CHABA 1977).  Finally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has concluded that 27 environmental and leisure-time noise below an Leq24 value of 70 dB “will not cause hearing 28 loss in the large majority of the population, even after a lifetime of exposure” (WHO 2000). 29 H.2.4.1 Hearing Loss and Aircraft Noise The 1982 EPA Guidelines report specifically addresses the criteria and procedures for 31 assessing the noise-induced hearing loss in terms of the Noise-Induced Permanent Threshold 32 Shift (NIPTS), a quantity that defines the permanent change in hearing level, or threshold, 33 caused by exposure to noise (EPA 1982).  This effect is also described as Potential Hearing 34 Loss (PHL). Numerically, the NIPTS is the change in threshold averaged over the frequencies 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz that can be expected from daily exposure to noise over a normal working 36 lifetime of 40 years, with the exposure beginning at an age of 20 years.  A grand average of 37 the NIPTS over time (40 years) and hearing sensitivity (10 to 90 percentiles of the exposed 38 population) is termed the Average NIPTS, or Ave NIPTS for short. The Average Noise Induced 39 Permanent Threshold Shift (Ave. NIPTS) that can be expected for noise exposure as measured by the DNL metric is given in Table H-3. APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014 1 Table H-3. Average NIPTS and 10th Percentile NIPTS as a Function of DNL DNL  Ave. NIPTS dB*  10th Percentile NIPTS dB*  75–76  1.0  4.0  76–77  1.0  4.5  77–78  1.6  5.0  78–79  2.0  5.5  79–80  2.5  6.0  80–81  3.0  7.0  81–82  3.5  8.0  82–83  4.0  9.0  83–84  4.5  10.0  84–85  5.5  11.0  85–86  6.0  12.0  86–87  7.0  13.5  87–88  7.5  15.0  88–89  8.5  16.5  89–90  9.5  18.0  Note: * Rounded to the nearest 0.5 dB.  2  For example, for a noise exposure of 80 dB DNL, the expected lifetime average value of NIPTS  3  is 2.5 dB, or 6.0 dB for the 10th percentile. Characterizing the noise exposure in terms of DNL  4  will usually overestimate the assessment of hearing loss risk as DNL includes a 10 dB  5  weighting factor for aircraft operations occurring between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.  If, however,  6  flight operations between the hours of 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. account for 5 percent or less of the  7  total 24-hour operations, the overestimation is on the order of 1.5 dB.  8  From a civilian airport perspective, the scientific community has concluded that there is  9  little likelihood that the resulting noise exposure from aircraft noise could result in either a  10  temporary or permanent hearing loss. Studies on community hearing loss from exposure to  11  aircraft flyovers near airports showed that there is no danger, under normal circumstances, of  12  hearing loss due to aircraft noise (Newman and Beattie 1985).  The EPA criterion  13  (Leq24 = 70 dBA) can be exceeded in some areas located near airports, but that is only the case  14  outdoors.  Inside a building, where people are more likely to spend most of their time, the  15  average noise level will be much less than 70 dBA (Eldred and von Gierke 1993).  Eldred and  16  von Gierke also report that “several studies in the U.S., Japan, and the U.K. have confirmed the  17  predictions that the possibility for permanent hearing loss in communities, even under the  18  most intense commercial take-off and landing patterns, is remote.”  19  With regard to military airbases, as individual aircraft noise levels are increasing with the  20  introduction of new aircraft, a 2009 DoD policy directive requires that hearing loss risk be  21  estimated for the at risk population, defined as the population exposed to DNL greater than  22  or equal to 80 dB and higher (DoD 2009). Specifically, DoD components are directed to “use  23  the 80 Day-Night A-Weighted (DNL) noise contour to identify populations at the most risk of  24  potential hearing loss.”  This does not preclude populations outside the 80 DNL contour, i.e. at  25  lower exposure levels, from being at some degree of risk of hearing loss. However, the  APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014  1  analysis should be restricted to populations within this contour area, including residents of  2  on-base housing. The exposure of workers inside the base boundary area should be  3  considered occupational and evaluated using the appropriate DoD component regulations  4  for occupational noise exposure.  With regard to military airspace activity, studies have shown conflicting results.  A 1995  6  laboratory study measured changes in human hearing from noise representative of low-flying  7  aircraft on Military Training Routes (MTRs) (Nixon et al. 1993).  The potential effects of aircraft  8  flying along MTRs is of particular concern because of maximum overflight noise levels can  9  exceed 115 dB, with rapid increases in noise levels exceeding 30 dB per second. In this study,  participants were first subjected to four overflight noise exposures at A-weighted levels of  11  115 dB to 130 dB. Fifty percent of the subjects showed no change in hearing levels, 25  12  percent had a temporary 5 dB increase in sensitivity (the people could hear a 5 dB wider range  13  of sound than before exposure), and 25 percent had a temporary 5 dB decrease in sensitivity  14  (the people could hear a 5 dB narrower range of sound than before exposure).  In the next  phase, participants were subjected to a single overflight at a maximum level of 130 dB for  16  eight successive exposures, separated by 90 seconds or until a temporary shift in hearing was  17  observed.  The temporary hearing threshold shifts showed an increase in sensitivity of up to  18  10 dB.  19  In another study of 115 test subjects between 18 and 50 years old in 1999, temporary  threshold shifts were measured after laboratory exposure to military low-altitude flight noise  21  (Ising et al. 1999).  According to the authors, the results indicate that repeated exposure to  22  military low-altitude flight noise with Lmax greater than 114 dB, especially if the noise level  23  increases rapidly, may have the potential to cause noise induced hearing loss in humans.  24  Aviation and typical community noise levels near airports are not comparable to the  occupational or recreational noise exposures associated with hearing loss.  Studies of aircraft  26  noise levels associated with civilian airport activity have not definitively correlated permanent  27  hearing impairment with aircraft activity.  It is unlikely that airport neighbors will remain  28  outside their homes 24 hours per day, so there is little likelihood of hearing loss below an  29  average sound level of 75 dB DNL.  Near military airbases, average noise levels above 75 dB  may occur, and while new DoD policy dictates that NIPTS be evaluated, no research results to  31  date have definitively related permanent hearing impairment to aviation noise.  32  H.2.5 Nonauditory Health Effects  33  Studies have been conducted to determine whether correlations exist between noise  34  exposure and cardiovascular problems, birth weight, and mortality rates.  The nonauditory  effect of noise on humans is not as easily substantiated as the effect on hearing. Prolonged  36  stress is known to be a contributor to a number of health disorders.  Kryter and Poza (1980)  37  state, “It is more likely that noise-related general ill-health effects are due to the psychological  38  annoyance from the noise interfering with normal everyday behavior, than it is from the noise  39  eliciting, because of its intensity, reflexive response in the autonomic or other physiological  systems of the body.”  Psychological stresses may cause a physiological stress reaction that  41  could result in impaired health.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  42  (NIOSH) and EPA commissioned the Committee on Hearing, Bioacoustics and Biomechanics  43  (CHABA) in 1981 to study whether established noise standards are adequate to protect  44  against health disorders other than hearing defects.  CHABA’s conclusion was that:  Evidence from available research reports is suggestive, but it does not provide definitive answers to the question of health effects, other than to the auditory system, of long-term exposure to noise. It seems prudent, therefore, in the absence of adequate knowledge as to whether or not noise can produce effects upon health other than damage to auditory system, either directly or mediated through stress, that insofar as feasible, an attempt should be made to obtain more critical evidence. Since the CHABA report, there have been further studies that suggest that noise exposure may cause hypertension and other stress-related effects in adults.  Near an airport in Stockholm, Sweden, the prevalence of hypertension was reportedly greater among nearby residents who were exposed to energy averaged noise levels exceeding 55 dB and maximum noise levels exceeding 72 dB, particularly older subjects and those not reporting impaired hearing ability (Rosenlund et al. 2001). A study of elderly volunteers who were exposed to simulated military low-altitude flight noise reported that blood pressure was raised by Lmax of 112 dB and high speed level increase (Michalak et al. 1990). Yet another study of subjects exposed to varying levels of military aircraft or road noise found no significant relationship between noise level and blood pressure (Pulles et al. 1990). Most studies of nonauditory health effects of long-term noise exposure have found that noise exposure levels established for hearing protection will also protect against any potential nonauditory health effects, at least in workplace conditions. One of the best scientific summaries of these findings is contained in the lead paper at the National Institutes of Health Conference on Noise and Hearing Loss, held on 22 to 24 January 1990 in Washington, D.C.: The nonauditory effects of chronic noise exposure, when noise is suspected to act as one of the risk factors in the development of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and other nervous disorders, have never been proven to occur as chronic manifestations at levels below these criteria (an average of 75 dBA for complete protection against hearing loss for an 8-hour day). At the 1988 International Congress on Noise as a Public Health Problem, most studies attempting to clarify such health effects did not find them at levels below the criteria protective of noise-induced hearing loss, and even above these criteria, results regarding such health effects were ambiguous. Consequently, one comes to the conclusion that establishing and enforcing exposure levels protecting against noise-induced hearing loss would not only solve the noise-induced hearing loss problem, but also any potential nonauditory health effects in the work place” (von Gierke 1990). Although these findings were specifically directed at noise effects in the workplace, they are equally applicable to aircraft noise effects in the community environment. Research studies regarding the nonauditory health effects of aircraft noise are ambiguous, at best, and often contradictory.  Yet, even those studies that purport to find such health effects use time-average noise levels of 75 dB and higher for their research. For example, two University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) researchers apparently found a relationship between aircraft noise levels under the approach path to Los Angeles International Airport and increased mortality rates among the exposed residents by using an average noise exposure level greater than 75 dB for the “noise-exposed” population (Meacham and Shaw 1979).  Nevertheless, three other UCLA professors analyzed those same 1 data and found no relationship between noise exposure and mortality rates (Frerichs, 2 et al. 1980). 3 As a second example, two other UCLA researchers used this same population near LAX to 4 show a higher rate of birth defects for 1970 to 1972 when compared with a control group residing away from the airport (Jones and Tauscher 1978). Based on this report, a separate 6 group at the Center for Disease Control performed a more thorough study of populations 7 near Atlanta’s Hartsfield International Airport for 1970 to 1972 and found no relationship in 8 their study of 17 identified categories of birth defects to aircraft noise levels above 65 dB 9 (Edmonds et al. 1979). In summary, there is no scientific basis for a claim that potential health effects exist for aircraft 11 time average sound levels below 75 dB. The potential for noise to affect physiological health, 12 such as the cardiovascular system, has been speculated; however, no unequivocal evidence 13 exists to support such claims (Harris 1997).  Conclusions drawn from a review of health effect 14 studies involving military low-altitude flight noise with its unusually high maximum levels and rapid rise in sound level have shown no increase in cardiovascular disease (Schwarze and 16 Thompson 1993).  Additional claims that are unsupported include flyover noise producing 17 increased mortality rates and increases in cardiovascular death, aggravation of post-traumatic 18 stress syndrome, increased stress, increases in admissions to mental hospitals, and adverse 19 effects on pregnant women and the unborn fetus (Harris 1997). H.2.6 Performance Effects 21 The effect of noise on the performance of activities or tasks has been the subject of many 22 studies.  Some of these studies have established links between continuous high noise levels 23 and performance loss. Noise-induced performance losses are most frequently reported in 24 studies employing noise levels in excess of 85 dB.  Little change has been found in low-noise cases.  It has been cited that moderate noise levels appear to act as a stressor for more 26 sensitive individuals performing a difficult psychomotor task.  While the results of research on 27 the general effect of periodic aircraft noise on performance have yet to yield definitive 28 criteria, several general trends have been noted including: 29 • A periodic intermittent noise is more likely to disrupt performance than a steady-state continuous noise of the same level. Flyover noise, due to its intermittent nature, might 31 be more likely to disrupt performance than a steady-state noise of equal level. 32 • Noise is more inclined to affect the quality than the quantity of work. 33 • Noise is more likely to impair the performance of tasks that place extreme demands on 34 the worker. H.2.7 Noise Effects on Children 36 In response to noise-specific and other environmental studies, Executive Order 13045, 37 Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks (1997), requires 38 Federal agencies to ensure that policies, programs, and activities address environmental 39 health and safety risks to identify any disproportionate risks to children. A review of the scientific literature indicates that there has not been a tremendous amount of 41 research in the area of aircraft noise effects on children.  The research reviewed does suggest APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014 1 that environments with sustained high background noise can have variable effects, including 2 noise effects on learning and cognitive abilities, and reports of various noise-related 3 physiological changes. 4 H.2.7.1 Effects on Learning and Cognitive Abilities In 2002 ANSI refers to studies that suggest that loud and frequent background noise can 6 affect the learning patterns of young children (ANSI 2002). ANSI provides discussion on the 7 relationships between noise and learning, and stipulates design requirements and acoustical 8 performance criteria for outdoor-to-indoor noise isolation.  School design is directed to be 9 cognizant of, and responsive to surrounding land uses and the shielding of outdoor noise from the indoor environment.  The ANSI acoustical performance criteria for schools include 11 the requirement that the 1-hour-average background noise level shall not exceed 35 dBA in 12 core learning spaces smaller than 20,000 cubic-feet and 40 dBA in core learning spaces with 13 enclosed volumes exceeding 20,000 cubic-feet.  This would require schools be constructed 14 such that, in quiet neighborhoods indoor noise levels are lowered by 15 to 20 dBA relative to outdoor levels. In schools near airports, indoor noise levels would have to be lowered by 16 35 to 45 dBA relative to outdoor levels (ANSI 2002). 17 The studies referenced by ANSI to support the new standard are not specific to jet aircraft 18 noise and the potential effects on children.  However, there are references to studies that 19 have shown that children in noisier classrooms scored lower on a variety of tests.  Excessive background noise or reverberation within schools causes interferences of communication 21 and can therefore create an acoustical barrier to learning (ANSI 2002). Studies have been 22 performed that contribute to the body of evidence emphasizing the importance of 23 communication by way of the spoken language to the development of cognitive skills. The 24 ability to read, write, comprehend, and maintain attentiveness, are, in part, based upon whether teacher communication is consistently intelligible (ANSI 2002). 26 Numerous studies have shown varying degrees of effects of noise on the reading 27 comprehension, attentiveness, puzzle-solving, and memory/recall ability of children.  It is 28 generally accepted that young children are more susceptible than adults to the effects of 29 background noise.  Because of the developmental status of young children (linguistic, cognitive, and proficiency), barriers to hearing can cause interferences or disruptions in 31 developmental evolution. 32 Research on the impacts of aircraft noise, and noise in general, on the cognitive abilities of 33 school-aged children has received more attention in the last 20 years.  Several studies suggest 34 that aircraft noise can affect the academic performance of schoolchildren.  Although many factors could contribute to learning deficits in school-aged children (e.g., socioeconomic 36 level, home environment, diet, sleep patterns), evidence exists that suggests that chronic 37 exposure to high aircraft noise levels can impair learning.  Specifically, elementary school 38 children attending schools near New York City’s two airports demonstrated lower reading 39 scores than children living farther away from the flight paths (Green et al. 1982). Researchers have found that tasks involving central processing and language comprehension (such as 41 reading, attention, problem solving, and memory) appear to be the most affected by noise 42 (Evans and Lepore 1993, Evans et al. 1998). It has been demonstrated that chronic exposure 43 of first-and second-grade children to aircraft noise can result in reading deficits and impaired APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014  1  speech perception (i.e., the ability to hear common, low-frequency [vowel] sounds but not  2  high frequencies [consonants] in speech) (Evans and Maxwell 1997).  3  The Evans and Maxwell (1997) study found that chronic exposure to aircraft noise resulted in  4  reading deficits and impaired speech perception for first-and second-grade children.  Other  studies found that children residing near the Los Angeles International Airport had more  6  difficulty solving cognitive problems and did not perform as well as children from quieter  7  schools in puzzle-solving and attentiveness (Bronzaft 1997, Cohen et al. 1980). Children  8  attending elementary schools in high aircraft noise areas near London’s Heathrow Airport  9  demonstrated poorer reading comprehension and selective cognitive impairments  (Haines et al. 2001a, 2001b).  Similar studies involving the testing of attention, memory, and  11  reading comprehension of school children located near airports showed that their tests  12  exhibited reduced performance results compared to those of similar groups of children who  13  were located in quieter environments (Evans et al. 1998, Haines et al. 1998).  The Haines and  14  Stansfeld study indicated that there may be some long-term effects associated with exposure,  as one-year follow-up testing still demonstrated lowered scores for children in higher noise  16  schools (Haines et al. 2001a, 2001b).  In contrast, a 2002 study found that although children  17  living near the old Munich airport scored lower in standardized reading and long-term  18  memory tests than a control group, their performance on the same tests were equal to that of  19  the control group once the airport was closed (Hygge et al. 2002).  Finally, although it is recognized that there are many factors that could contribute to learning  21  deficits in school-aged children, there is increasing awareness that chronic exposure to high  22  aircraft noise levels may impair learning.  This awareness has led the WHO and a North  23  Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) working group to conclude that daycare centers and  24  schools should not be located near major sources of noise, such as highways, airports, and  industrial sites (WHO 2000, NATO 2000).  26  H.2.7.2 Health Effects  27  Physiological effects in children exposed to aircraft noise and the potential for health effects  28  have also been the focus of limited investigation. Studies in the literature include  29  examination of blood pressure levels, hormonal secretions, and hearing loss.  As a measure of stress response to aircraft noise, authors have looked at blood pressure  31  readings to monitor children’s health.  Children who were chronically exposed to aircraft  32  noise from a new airport near Munich, Germany, had modest (although significant) increases  33  in blood pressure, significant increases in stress hormones, and a decline in quality of life  34  (Evans et al. 1998).  Children attending noisy schools had statistically significant average  systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p<0.03).  Systolic blood pressure means were 89.68 mm  36  for children attending schools located in noisier environments compared to 86.77 mm for a  37  control group. Similarly, diastolic blood pressure means for the noisier environment group  38  were 47.84 mm and 45.16 for the control group (Cohen et al. 1980).  39  Although the literature appears limited, studies focused on the wide range of potential effects  of aircraft noise on school children have also investigated hormonal levels between groups of  41  children exposed to aircraft noise compared to those in a control group.  Specifically, two  42  studies analyzed cortisol and urinary catecholamine levels in school children as  43  measurements of stress response to aircraft noise (Haines et al. 2001b, 2001c).  In both  APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014 1 instances, there were no differences between the aircraft-noise-exposed children and the 2 control groups. 3 Other studies have reported hearing losses from exposure to aircraft noise.  Noise-induced 4 hearing loss was reportedly higher in children who attended a school located under a flight path near a Taiwan airport, as compared to children at another school far away (Chen 6 et al. 1997). Another study reported that hearing ability was reduced significantly in 7 individuals who lived near an airport and were frequently exposed to aircraft noise (Chen and 8 Chen 1993). In that study, noise exposure near the airport was reportedly uniform, with DNL 9 greater than 75 dB and maximum noise levels of about 87 dB during overflights. Conversely, several other studies that were reviewed reported no difference in hearing ability between 11 children exposed to high levels of airport noise and children located in quieter areas (Fisch 12 1977, Andrus et al. 1975, Wu et al. 1995). 13 H.2.8 Noise Effects on Domestic Animals and Wildlife 14 Hearing is critical to an animal’s ability to react, compete, reproduce, hunt, forage, and survive in its environment. While the existing literature does include studies on possible effects of jet 16 aircraft noise and sonic booms on wildlife, there appears to have been little concerted effort 17 in developing quantitative comparisons of aircraft noise effects on normal auditory 18 characteristics. Behavioral effects have been relatively well described, but the larger 19 ecological context issues, and the potential for drawing conclusions regarding effects on populations, has not been well developed. 21 The relationships between potential auditory/physiological effects and species interactions 22 with their environments are not well understood. Manci et al. (1988) assert that the 23 consequences that physiological effects may have on behavioral patterns are vital to 24 understanding the long-term effects of noise on wildlife. Questions regarding the effects (if any) on predator-prey interactions, reproductive success, and intra-inter specific behavior 26 patterns remain. 27 The following discussion provides an overview of the existing literature on noise effects 28 (particularly jet aircraft noise) on animal species. The literature reviewed outlines those 29 studies that have focused on the observations of the behavioral effects that jet aircraft and sonic booms have on animals. 31 A great deal of research was conducted in the 1960s and 1970s on the effects of aircraft noise 32 on the public and the potential for adverse ecological impacts. These studies were largely 33 completed in response to the increase in air travel and the introduction of supersonic jet 34 aircraft. According to Manci et al. (1988), the foundation of information created from that focus does not necessarily correlate or provide information specific to the impacts to wildlife 36 in areas overflown by aircraft at supersonic speed or at low altitudes. 37 The abilities to hear sounds and noise and to communicate assist wildlife in maintaining 38 group cohesiveness and survivorship. Social species communicate by transmitting calls of 39 warning, introduction, and others that are subsequently related to an individual’s or group’s responsiveness. 41 Animal species differ greatly in their responses to noise. Noise effects on domestic animals 42 and wildlife are classified as primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary effects are direct, APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014  1  physiological changes to the auditory system, and most likely include the masking of auditory  2  signals. Masking is defined as the inability of an individual to hear important environmental  3  signals that may arise from mates, predators, or prey. There is some potential that noise could  4  disrupt a species’ ability to communicate or interfere with behavioral patterns (Manci  et al. 1988). Although the effects are likely temporal, aircraft noise may cause masking of  6  auditory signals within exposed faunal communities. Animals rely on hearing to avoid  7  predators, obtain food, and communicate and attract other members of their species. Aircraft  8  noise may mask or interfere with these functions. Other primary effects, such as ear drum  9  rupture or temporary and permanent hearing threshold shifts, are not as likely given the  subsonic noise levels produced by aircraft overflights. Secondary effects may include  11  non-auditory effects such as stress and hypertension; behavioral modifications; interference  12  with mating or reproduction; and impaired ability to obtain adequate food, cover, or water.  13  Tertiary effects are the direct result of primary and secondary effects. These include  14  population decline and habitat loss. Most of the effects of noise are mild enough to be  undetectable as variables of change in population size or population growth against the  16  background of normal variation (Bowles 1995). Other environmental variables (e.g.,  17  predators, weather, changing prey base, ground-based disturbance) also influence secondary  18  and tertiary effects and confound the ability to identify the ultimate factor in limiting  19  productivity of a certain nest, area, or region (Smith et al. 1988). Overall, the literature  suggests that species differ in their response to various types, durations, and sources of noise  21  (Manci et al. 1988).  22  Many scientific studies have investigated the effects of aircraft noise on wildlife, and some  23  have focused on wildlife “flight” due to noise. Apparently, animal responses to aircraft are  24  influenced by many variables, including size, speed, proximity (both height above the ground  and lateral distance), engine noise, color, flight profile, and radiated noise. The type of aircraft  26  (e.g., fixed wing versus rotor-wing [helicopter]) and type of flight mission may also produce  27  different levels of disturbance, with varying animal responses (Smith et al. 1988).  28  Consequently, it is difficult to generalize animal responses to noise disturbances across  29  species.  One result of the 1988 Manci et al. literature review was the conclusion that, while behavioral  31  observation studies were relatively limited, a general behavioral reaction in animals from  32  exposure to aircraft noise is the startle response. The intensity and duration of the startle  33  response appears to be dependent on which species is exposed, whether there is a group or  34  an individual, and whether there have been previous exposures. Responses range from flight,  trampling, stampeding, jumping, or running to movement of the head in the apparent  36  direction of the noise source. Manci et al. (1988) reported that the literature indicated that  37  avian species may be more sensitive to aircraft noise than mammals.  38  H.2.8.1 Domestic Animals  39  Although some studies report that the effects of aircraft noise on domestic animals is  inconclusive, a majority of the literature reviewed indicates that domestic animals exhibit  41  some behavioral responses to military overflights, but generally seem to habituate to the  42  disturbances over a period of time. Mammals in particular appear to react to noise at sound  43  levels higher than 90 dB, with responses including the startle response, freezing (i.e.,  44  becoming temporarily stationary), and fleeing from the sound source. Many studies on  domestic animals suggest that some species appear to acclimate to some forms of sound disturbance (Manci et al. 1988). Some studies have reported primary and secondary effects including reduced milk production and rate of milk release, increased glucose concentrations, decreased levels of hemoglobin, increased heart rate, and a reduction in thyroid activity. These latter effects appear to represent a small percentage of the findings occurring in the existing literature. Some reviewers have indicated that earlier studies and claims by farmers linking adverse effects of aircraft noise on livestock did not necessarily provide clear-cut evidence of cause and effect (Cottereau 1978). In contrast, many studies conclude that there is no evidence that aircraft overflights affect feed intake, growth, or production rates in domestic animals. Cattle. In response to concerns about overflight effects on pregnant cattle, milk production, and cattle safety, the U.S. Air Force prepared a handbook for environmental protection that summarizes the literature on the impacts of low-altitude flights on livestock (and poultry), and includes specific case studies conducted in numerous airspaces across the country. Adverse effects have been found in a few studies, but have not been reproduced in other similar studies. One such study, conducted in 1983, suggested that 2 of 10 cows in late pregnancy aborted after showing rising estrogen and falling progesterone levels. These increased hormonal levels were reported as being linked to 59 aircraft overflights. The remaining eight cows showed no changes in their blood concentrations and calved normally (Air Force 1994). A similar study reported that abortions occurred in three out of five pregnant cattle after exposing them to flyovers by six different aircraft (Air Force 1994). Another study suggested that feedlot cattle could stampede and injure themselves when exposed to low-level overflights (Air Force 1994). A majority of the studies reviewed suggest that there is little or no effect of aircraft noise on cattle. Studies presenting adverse effects on domestic animals have been limited. A number of studies (Parker and Bayley 1960; Kovalcik and Sottnik 1971) investigated the effects of jet aircraft noise and sonic booms on the milk production of dairy cows. Through the compilation and examination of milk production data from areas exposed to jet aircraft noise and sonic boom events, it was determined that milk yields were not affected. This was particularly evident in those cows that had been previously exposed to jet aircraft noise. One study examined the causes of 1,763 abortions in Wisconsin dairy cattle over a one-year time period, and none were associated with aircraft disturbances (Air Force 1993). In 1987, Anderson contacted seven livestock operators for production data, and no effects of low-altitude and supersonic flights were noted. Three out of 43 cattle previously exposed to low-altitude flights showed a startle response to an F/A-18 aircraft flying overhead at 500 feet above ground level at 400 knots by running less than 10 meters. They resumed normal activity within one minute (Air Force 1994). In 1983, Beyer found that helicopters caused more reaction than other low-aircraft overflights. A 1964 study also found that helicopters flying 30 to 60 feet overhead did not affect milk production and pregnancies of 44 cows and heifers (Air Force 1994). Additionally, Beyer reported that five pregnant dairy cows in a pasture did not exhibit fright-flight tendencies or have their pregnancies disrupted after being overflown by 79 low-altitude helicopter flights and 4 low-altitude, subsonic jet aircraft flights (Air Force 1994). A 1956 study found that the reactions of dairy and beef cattle to noise from low-altitude, subsonic aircraft were similar to those caused by paper blowing about, strange persons, or other moving objects (Air Force 1994). In a report to Congress, the U. S. Forest Service concluded that “evidence both from field studies of wild ungulates and laboratory studies of domestic stock indicate that the risks of damage are small (from aircraft approaches of 50 to 100 meters), as animals take care not to damage themselves (USFS 1992). If animals are overflown by aircraft at altitudes of 50 to 100 meters, there is no evidence that mothers and young are separated, that animals collide with obstructions (unless confined) or that they traverse dangerous ground at too high a rate.” These varied study results suggest that, although the confining of cattle could magnify animal response to aircraft overflight, there is no proven cause-and-effect link between startling cattle from aircraft overflights and abortion rates or lower milk production. Horses. Horses have also been observed to react to overflights of jet aircraft. Several of the studies reviewed reported a varied response of horses to low-altitude aircraft overflights. Observations made in 1966 and 1968 noted that horses galloped in response to jet flyovers (Air Force 1993). In 1995, Bowles cites Kruger and Erath as observing horses exhibiting intensive flight reactions, random movements, and biting/kicking behavior. However, no injuries or abortions occurred, and there was evidence that the mares adapted somewhat to the flyovers over the course of a month (Air Force 1994). Although horses were observed noticing the overflights, it did not appear to affect either survivability or reproductive success. There was also some indication that habituation to these types of disturbances was occurring. LeBlanc et al. studied the effects of F-14 jet aircraft noise on pregnant mares (1991). They specifically focused on any changes in pregnancy success, behavior, cardiac function, hormonal production, and rate of habituation. Their findings reported observations of “flightfright” reactions, which caused increases in heart rates and serum cortisol concentrations. The mares, however, did habituate to the noise. Levels of anxiety and mass body movements were the highest after initial exposure, with intensities of responses decreasing thereafter. There were no differences in pregnancy success when compared to a control group. Swine. Generally, the literature findings for swine appear to be similar to those reported for cows and horses. While there are some effects from aircraft noise reported in the literature, these effects are minor. Studies of continuous noise exposure (i.e., 6 hours or 72 hours of constant exposure) reported influences on short-term hormonal production and release. Additional constant exposure studies indicated the observation of stress reactions, hypertension, and electrolyte imbalances (Dufour 1980). A study by Bond et al. demonstrated no adverse effects on the feeding efficiency, weight gain, ear physiology, or thyroid and adrenal gland condition of pigs subjected to aircraft noise (1963). Observations of heart rate increase were recorded and it was noted that cessation of the noise resulted in the return to normal heart rates. Conception rates and offspring survivorship did not appear to be influenced by exposure to aircraft noise. Similarly, simulated aircraft noise at levels of 100 dB to 135 dB had only minor effects on the rate of feed utilization, weight gain, food intake, and reproduction rates of boars and sows exposed, and there were no injuries or inner ear changes observed (Manci et al. 1988; Gladwin et al. 1988). Domestic Fowl. According to a 1994 position paper by the U.S. Air Force on effects of low-altitude overflights (below 1,000 feet) on domestic fowl, overflight activity has negligible APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014 1 effects (Air Force 1994). The paper did recognize that given certain circumstances, adverse 2 effects can be serious. Some of the effects can be panic reactions, reduced productivity, and 3 effects on marketability (e.g., bruising of the meat caused during “pile-up” situations). 4 The typical reaction of domestic fowl after exposure to sudden, intense noise is a short-term startle response. The reaction ceases as soon as the stimulus is ended, and within a few 6 minutes all activity returns to normal. More severe responses are possible depending on the 7 number of birds, the frequency of exposure, and environmental conditions. Large crowds of 8 birds and birds not previously exposed are more likely to pile up in response to a noise 9 stimulus (Air Force 1994). According to studies and interviews with growers, it is typically the previously unexposed birds that incite panic crowding, and the tendency to do so is markedly 11 reduced within five exposures to the stimulus (Air Force 1994). This suggests that the birds 12 habituate relatively quickly. Egg productivity was not adversely affected by infrequent noise 13 bursts, even at exposure levels as high as 120 to 130 dBA. 14 Between 1956 and 1988, there were 100 recorded claims against the Navy for alleged damage to domestic fowl. The number of claims averaged three per year, with peak numbers of 16 claims following publications of studies on the topic in the early 1960s (Air Force 1994). Many 17 of the claims were disproved or did not have sufficient supporting evidence. The claims were 18 filed for the following alleged damages: 55 percent for panic reactions, 31 percent for 19 decreased production, 6 percent for reduced hatchability, 6 percent for weight loss, and less than 1 percent for reduced fertility (Air Force 1994). 21 Turkeys. The review of the existing literature suggests that there has not been a concerted or 22 widespread effort to study the effects of aircraft noise on commercial turkeys. One study 23 involving turkeys examined the differences between simulated versus actual overflight 24 aircraft noise, turkey responses to the noise, weight gain, and evidence of habituation (Bowles et al. 1990). Findings from the study suggested that turkeys habituated to jet aircraft 26 noise quickly, that there were no growth rate differences between the experimental and 27 control groups, and that there were some behavioral differences that increased the difficulty 28 in handling individuals within the experimental group. 29 Low-altitude overflights were shown to cause turkey flocks which were kept inside turkey houses to occasionally pile up and experience high mortality rates due to the aircraft noise 31 and a variety of disturbances unrelated to aircraft (Air Force 1994). 32 H.2.8.2 Wildlife 33 Studies on the effects of overflights and sonic booms on wildlife have been focused mostly on 34 avian species and ungulates such as caribou and bighorn sheep. Few studies have been conducted on marine mammals, small terrestrial mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and 36 carnivorous mammals. Generally, species that live entirely below the surface of the water 37 have also been ignored due to the fact they do not experience the same level of sound as 38 terrestrial species (NPS 1994). Wild ungulates appear to be much more sensitive to noise 39 disturbance than domestic livestock (Manci et al. 1988). This may be due to previous exposure to disturbances. One common factor appears to be that low-altitude flyovers seem 41 to be more disruptive in terrain where there is little cover (Manci et al. 1988). APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014  1  H.2.8.3 Mammals  2  Terrestrial Mammals. Studies of terrestrial mammals have shown that noise levels of 120  3  dBA can damage mammals’ ears, and levels of 95 dBA can cause temporary loss of hearing  4  acuity. Noise from aircraft has affected other large carnivores by causing changes in home  ranges, foraging patterns, and breeding behavior. One study recommended that aircraft not  6  be allowed to fly at altitudes below 2,000 feet above ground level over important grizzly and  7  polar bear habitat (Dufour 1980). Wolves have been frightened by low-altitude flights that  8  were 25 to 1,000 feet off the ground. However, wolves have been found to adapt to aircraft  9  overflights and noise as long as they were not being hunted from aircraft (Dufour 1980).  Wild ungulates (American bison, caribou, bighorn sheep) appear to be much more sensitive  11  to noise disturbance than domestic livestock (Weisenberger et al. 1996). Behavioral reactions  12  may be related to the past history of disturbances by such things as humans and aircraft.  13  Common reactions of reindeer kept in an enclosure and exposed to aircraft noise disturbance  14  were a slight startle response, raising of the head, pricking ears, and scenting of the air. Panic  reactions and extensive changes in behavior of individual animals were not observed.  16  Observations of caribou in Alaska exposed to fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters showed  17  running and panic reactions occurred when overflights were at an altitude of 200 feet or less.  18  The reactions decreased with increased altitude of overflights, and for overflights higher than  19  500 feet in altitude, the panic reactions stopped. Also, smaller groups reacted less strongly  than larger groups. One negative effect of the running and avoidance behavior is increased  21  expenditure of energy. For a 90-kilogram animal, the calculated expenditure due to aircraft  22  harassment is 64 kilocalories per minute when running and 20 kilocalories per minute when  23  walking. When conditions are favorable, this expenditure can be counteracted with increased  24  feeding; however, during harsh winter conditions, this may not be possible. Incidental  observations of wolves and bears exposed to fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters suggested  26  that wolves were less disturbed than wild ungulates, while grizzly bears showed the greatest  27  response of any animal species observed.  28  It has been proven that low-altitude overflights do induce stress in animals. Increased heart  29  rates, an indicator of excitement or stress, have been found in pronghorn antelope, elk, and  bighorn sheep. These reactions occur naturally as a response to predation, so infrequent  31  overflights may not, in and of themselves, be detrimental. However, flights at high  32  frequencies over a long period of time may cause harmful effects. The consequences of this  33  disturbance, while cumulative, are not additive. Aircraft disturbance may not cause obvious  34  and serious health effects, but coupled with a harsh winter, it may have an adverse impact.  Research has shown that stress induced by other types of disturbances produces long-term  36  decreases in metabolism and hormone balances in wild ungulates.  37  Behavioral responses can range from mild to severe. Mild responses include head raising,  38  body shifting, or turning to orient toward the aircraft. Moderate disturbance may be nervous  39  behaviors, such as trotting a short distance. Escape is the typical severe response.  Marine Mammals. The physiological composition of the ear in aquatic and marine mammals  41  exhibits adaptation to the aqueous environment. These differences (relative to terrestrial  42  species) manifest themselves in the auricle and middle ear (Manci et al. 1988). Some  43  mammals use echolocation to perceive objects in their surroundings and to determine the  44  directions and locations of sound sources (Simmons 1983 in Manci et al. 1988).  Research conducted on northern fur seals, sea lions, and ringed seals indicated that there are some differences in how various animal groups receive frequencies of sound. It was observed that these species exhibited varying intensities of a startle response to airborne noise, which was habituated over time. The rates of habituation appeared to vary with species, populations, and demographics (age, sex). Time of day of exposure was also a factor (Muyberg 1978 in Manci et al. 1988). Studies accomplished near the Channel Islands were conducted near the area where the space shuttle launches occur. It was found that there were some response differences between species relative to the loudness of sonic booms. Those booms that were between 80 and 89 dBA caused a greater intensity of startle reactions than lower-intensity booms at 72 to 79 dBA. However, the duration of the startle responses to louder sonic booms was shorter (Jehl and Cooper 1980 in Manci et al. 1988). Jehl and Cooper indicated that low-flying helicopters, loud boat noises, and humans were the most disturbing to pinnipeds (1980). According to the research, although the space launch and associated operational activity noises have not had a measurable effect on the pinniped population, it also suggests that there was a greater “disturbance level” exhibited during launch activities. There was a recommendation to continue observations for behavioral effects and to perform long-term population monitoring (Jehl and Cooper 1980). The continued presence of single or multiple noise sources could cause marine mammals to leave a preferred habitat. However, it does not appear likely that overflights could cause migration from suitable habitats because aircraft noise over water is mobile and would not persist over any particular area. Aircraft noise, including supersonic noise, currently occurs in the overwater airspace of Eglin, Tyndall, and Langley Air Force Bases (AFBs) from sorties predominantly involving jet aircraft. Survey results reported in Davis et al. indicate that cetaceans (i.e., dolphins) occur under all of the Eglin and Tyndall marine airspace (2000). The continuing presence of dolphins indicates that aircraft noise does not discourage use of the area and apparently does not harm the locally occurring population. In a summary by the National Parks Service on the effects of noise on marine mammals, it was determined that gray whales and harbor porpoises showed no outward behavioral response to aircraft noise or overflights (1994). Bottlenose dolphins showed no obvious reaction in a study involving helicopter overflights at 1,200 to 1,800 feet above the water. They also did not show any reaction to survey aircraft unless the shadow of the aircraft passed over them, at which point there was some observed tendency to dive (Richardson et al. 1995). Other anthropogenic noises in the marine environment from ships and pleasure craft may have more of an effect on marine mammals than aircraft noise (Air Force 2000). The noise effects on cetaceans appear to be somewhat attenuated by the air/water interface. Manatees appear relatively unresponsive to human-generated noise to the point that they are often suspected of being deaf to oncoming boats (although their hearing is actually similar to that of pinnipeds) (Bullock et al. 1980). Little is known about the importance of acoustic communication to manatees, although they are known to produce at least ten different types of sounds and are thought to have sensitive hearing (Richardson et al. 1995). APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014  1  H.2.8.4 Birds  2  Auditory research conducted on birds indicates that they fall between reptiles and mammals  3  relative to hearing sensitivity.  According to Dooling, within the range of 1,000 to 5,000 Hz,  4  birds show a level of hearing sensitivity similar to that of the more sensitive mammals (1978).  In contrast to mammals, bird sensitivity falls off at a greater rate with increasing and  6  decreasing frequencies.  Passive observations and studies examining aircraft bird strikes  7  indicate that birds nest and forage near airports.  Aircraft noise in the vicinity of commercial  8  airports apparently does not inhibit bird presence and use.  9  High-noise events (like a low-altitude aircraft overflight) may cause birds to engage in escape  or avoidance behaviors, such as flushing from perches or nests (Ellis et al. 1991).  These  11  activities impose an energy cost on the birds that, over the long term, may affect survival or  12  growth.  In addition, the birds may spend less time engaged in necessary activities like  13  feeding, preening, or caring for their young because they spend time in noise-avoidance  14  activity.  However, the long-term significance of noise-related impacts is less clear.  Several  studies on nesting raptors have indicated that birds become habituated to aircraft overflights  16  and that long-term reproductive success is not affected (Grubb and King 1991; Ellis et al.  17  1991).  Threshold noise levels for significant responses range from 62 dB for Pacific black  18  brant to 85 dB for crested tern (Ward and Stehn 1990; Brown 1990).  19  Songbirds were observed to become silent prior to the onset of a sonic boom event (F-111  jets), followed by “raucous discordant cries.” There was a return to normal singing within  21  10 seconds after the boom (Higgins 1974 in Manci et al. 1988).  Ravens responded by emitting  22  protestation calls, flapping their wings, and soaring.  23  Manci et al. reported a reduction in reproductive success in some small territorial passerines  24  (i.e., perching birds or songbirds) after exposure to low-altitude overflights (1988).  However,  it has been observed that passerines are not driven any great distance from a favored food  26  source by a nonspecific disturbance, such as aircraft overflights (USFS 1992). Further study  27  may be warranted.  28  A recent study, conducted cooperatively between the DoD and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  29  Serve (USFWS), assessed the response of the red-cockaded woodpecker to a range of military  training noise events, including artillery, small arms, helicopter, and maneuver noise (Pater et  31  al. 1999).  The project findings show that the red-cockaded woodpecker successfully  32  acclimates to military noise events.  Depending on the noise level, which ranged from  33  innocuous to very loud, the birds responded by flushing from their nest cavities.  When the  34  noise source was closer and the noise level was higher, the number of flushes increased  proportionately.  In all cases, however, the birds returned to their nests within a relatively  36  short period of time (usually within 12 minutes).  Additionally, the noise exposure did not  37  result in any mortality or statistically detectable changes in reproductive success (Pater et al.  38  1999).  Red-cockaded woodpeckers did not flush when artillery simulators were more than  39  122 meters away and SEL noise levels were 70 dBA.  Lynch and Speake studied the effects of both real and simulated sonic booms on the nesting  41  and brooding eastern wild turkey in Alabama (1978). Hens at four nest sites were subjected  42  to between 8 and 11 combined real and simulated sonic booms. All tests elicited similar  43  responses, including quick lifting of the head and apparent alertness for between 10 and  44  20 seconds.  No apparent nest failure occurred as a result of the sonic booms.  APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014 1 Twenty-one brood groups were also subjected to simulated sonic booms.  Reactions varied 2 slightly between groups, but the largest percentage of groups reacted by standing 3 motionless after the initial blast. Upon the sound of the boom, the hens and poults fled until 4 reaching the edge of the woods (approximately 4 to 8 meters). Afterward, the poults resumed feeding activities while the hens remained alert for a short period of time 6 (approximately 15 to 20 seconds).  In no instances were poults abandoned, nor did they 7 scatter and become lost.  Every observation group returned to normal activities within a 8 maximum of 30 seconds after a blast. 9 H.2.8.5 Raptors In a literature review of raptor responses to aircraft noise, Manci et al. found that most raptors 11 did not show a negative response to overflights (1988).  When negative responses were 12 observed they were predominantly associated with rotor-winged aircraft or jet aircraft that 13 were repeatedly passing within 0.5 mile of a nest. 14 Ellis et al. performed a study to estimate the effects of low-level military jet aircraft and mid-to high-altitude sonic booms (both actual and simulated) on nesting peregrine falcons and 16 seven other raptors (common black-hawk, Harris’ hawk, zone-tailed hawk, red-tailed hawk, 17 golden eagle, prairie falcon, bald eagle) (1991).  They observed responses to test stimuli, 18 determined nest success for the year of the testing, and evaluated site occupancy the 19 following year. Both long-and short-term effects were noted in the study.  The results reported the successful fledging of young in 34 of 38 nest sites (all eight species) subjected to 21 low-level flight and/or simulated sonic booms. Twenty-two of the test sites were revisited in 22 the following year, and observations of pairs or lone birds were made at all but one nest. 23 Nesting attempts were underway at 19 of 20 sites that were observed long enough to be 24 certain of breeding activity.  Re-occupancy and productivity rates were within or above expected values for self-sustaining populations. 26 Short-term behavior responses were also noted.  Overflights at a distance of 150 meters or 27 less produced few significant responses and no severe responses. Typical responses included 28 crouching or, very rarely, flushing from the perch site.  Significant responses were most 29 evident before egg laying and after young were “well grown.” Incubating or brooding adults never burst from the nest, thus preventing egg breaking or knocking chicks out of the nest. 31 Jet passes and sonic booms often caused noticeable alarm; however, significant negative 32 responses were rare and did not appear to limit productivity or re-occupancy. The locations 33 of some of the nests may have caused some birds to be habituated to aircraft noise.  There 34 were some test sites located at distances far from zones of frequent military aircraft usage, and the test stimuli were often closer, louder, and more frequent than would be likely for a 36 normal training situation. 37 Manci et al. noted that a female northern harrier was observed hunting on a bombing range 38 in Mississippi during bombing exercises (1988).  The harrier was apparently unfazed by the 39 exercises, even when a bomb exploded within 200 feet. In a similar case of habituation/non-disturbance, a study on the Florida snail-kite stated that the greatest 41 reaction to overflights (approximately 98 dBA) was “watching the aircraft fly by.”  No 42 detrimental impacts to distribution, breeding success, or behavior were noted. APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014  1  Bald Eagle. A study by Grubb and King on the reactions of the bald eagle to human  2  disturbances showed that terrestrial disturbances elicited the greatest response, followed by  3  aquatic (i.e., boats) and aerial disturbances (1991).  The disturbance regime of the area where  4  the study occurred was predominantly characterized by aircraft noise. The study found that  pedestrians consistently caused responses that were greater in both frequency and duration.  6  Helicopters elicited the highest level of aircraft-related responses. Aircraft disturbances,  7  although the most common form of disturbance, resulted in the lowest levels of response.  8  This low response level may have been due to habituation; however, flights less than 170  9  meters away caused reactions similar to other disturbance types.  Ellis et al. showed that  eagles typically respond to the proximity of a disturbance, such as a pedestrian or aircraft  11  within 100 meters, rather than the noise level (1991).  They also noted that helicopters were  12  four times more likely to cause a reaction than a commercial jet and 20 times more likely to  13  cause a reaction than a propeller plane.  Fraser et al. have suggested that raptors habituate to  14  overflights rapidly, sometimes tolerating aircraft approaches of 65 feet or less (1985).  Osprey. A 1998 study by Trimper et al. in Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada, focused on the  16  reactions of nesting osprey to military overflights by CF-18 Hornets. Reactions varied from  17  increased alertness and focused observation of planes to adjustments in incubation posture.  18  No overt reactions (e.g., startle response, rapid nest departure) were observed as a result of an  19  overflight.  Young nestlings crouched as a result of any disturbance until they grew to 1 to  2 weeks prior to fledging. Helicopters, human presence, float planes, and other ospreys  21  elicited the strongest reactions from nesting ospreys.  These responses included flushing,  22  agitation, and aggressive displays.  Adult osprey showed high nest occupancy rates during  23  incubation regardless of external influences.  24  The osprey observed occasionally stared in the direction of the flight before it was audible to  the observers.  The birds may have been habituated to the noise of the flights; however,  26  overflights were strictly controlled during the experimental period.  Strong reactions to float  27  planes and helicopter may have been due to the slower flight and therefore longer duration  28  of visual stimuli rather than noise-related stimuli.  29  Red-Tailed Hawk. Andersen et al. conducted a study that investigated the effects of low- level helicopter overflights on 35 red-tailed hawk nests (1989). Some of the nests had not  31  been flown over prior to the study. The hawks that were naïve (i.e., not previously exposed)  32  to helicopter flights exhibited stronger avoidance behavior (nine of 17 birds flushed from  33  their nests) than those that had experienced prior overflights. The overflights did not appear  34  to affect nesting success in either study group.  These findings were consistent with the belief  that red-tailed hawks habituate to low-level air traffic, even during the nesting period.  36  H.2.8.6 Migratory Waterfowl  37  A study of caged American black ducks was conducted by Fleming et al. in 1996.  It was  38  determined that noise had negligible energetic and physiologic effects on adult waterfowl.  39  Measurements included body weight, behavior, heart rate, and enzymatic activity.  Experiments also showed that adult ducks exposed to high noise events acclimated rapidly  41  and showed no effects.  42  The study also investigated the reproductive success of captive ducks, which indicated that  43  duckling growth and survival rates at Piney Island, North Carolina, were lower than those at a  APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014 1 background location. In contrast, observations of several other reproductive indices (i.e., pair 2 formation, nesting, egg production, and hatching success) showed no difference between 3 Piney Island and the background location.  Potential effects on wild duck populations may 4 vary, as wild ducks at Piney Island have presumably acclimated to aircraft overflights. It was not demonstrated that noise was the cause of adverse impacts. A variety of other factors, 6 such as weather conditions, drinking water and food availability and variability, disease, and 7 natural variability in reproduction, could explain the observed effects.  Fleming noted that 8 drinking water conditions (particularly at Piney Island) deteriorated during the study, which 9 could have affected the growth of young ducks.  Further research would be necessary to determine the cause of any reproductive effects. 11 Another study by Conomy et al. exposed previously unexposed ducks to 71 noise events 12 per day that equaled or exceeded 80 dBA (1998).  It was determined that the proportion of 13 time black ducks reacted to aircraft activity and noise decreased from 38 percent to 6 percent 14 in 17 days and remained stable at 5.8 percent thereafter.  In the same study, the wood duck did not appear to habituate to aircraft disturbance.  This supports the notion that animal 16 response to aircraft noise is species-specific.  Because a startle response to aircraft noise can 17 result in flushing from nests, migrants and animals living in areas with high concentrations of 18 predators would be the most vulnerable to experiencing effects of lowered birth rates and 19 recruitment over time. Species that are subjected to infrequent overflights do not appear to habituate to overflight disturbance as readily. 21 Black brant studied in the Alaskan Peninsula were exposed to jets and propeller aircraft, 22 helicopters, gunshots, people, boats, and various raptors.  Jets accounted for 65 percent of all 23 the disturbances. Humans, eagles, and boats caused a greater percentage of brant to take 24 flight.  There was markedly greater reaction to Bell-206-B helicopter flights than fixed wing, single-engine aircraft (Ward et al. 1986). 26 Manci et al. reported that waterfowl were particularly disturbed by aircraft noise (1988). The 27 most sensitive appeared to be snow geese. Canada geese and snow geese were thought to 28 be more sensitive than other animals such as turkey vultures, coyotes, and raptors (Edwards 29 et al. 1979). H.2.8.7 Wading and Shore Birds 31 Black et al. studied the effects of low-altitude (less than 500 feet above ground level) military 32 training flights with sound levels from 55 to 100 dBA on wading bird colonies (i.e., great egret, 33 snowy egret, tricolored heron, and little blue heron) (1984).  The training flights involved 34 three or four aircraft, which occurred once or twice per day. This study concluded that the reproductive activity—including nest success, nestling survival, and nestling chronology— 36 was independent of F-16 overflights. Dependent variables were more strongly related to 37 ecological factors, including location and physical characteristics of the colony and 38 climatology.  Another study on the effects of circling fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter 39 overflights on wading bird colonies found that at altitudes of 195 to 390 feet, there was no reaction in nearly 75 percent of the 220 observations.  Ninety percent displayed no reaction or 41 merely looked toward the direction of the noise source.  Another 6 percent stood up, 3 42 percent walked from the nest, and 2 percent flushed (but were without active nests) and 43 returned within 5 minutes (Kushlan 1979).  Apparently, non-nesting wading birds had a 44 slightly higher incidence of reacting to overflights than nesting birds.  Seagulls observed 1 roosting near a colony of wading birds in another study remained at their roosts when 2 subsonic aircraft flew overhead (Burger 1981).  Colony distribution appeared to be most 3 directly correlated to available wetland community types and was found to be distributed 4 randomly with respect to military training routes. These results suggest that wading bird species presence was most closely linked to habitat availability and that they were not 6 affected by low-level military overflights (Air Force 2000). 7 Burger studied the response of migrating shorebirds to human disturbance and found that 8 shorebirds did not fly in response to aircraft overflights, but did flush in response to more 9 localized intrusions (i.e., humans and dogs on the beach) (1986).  Burger studied the effects of noise from JFK Airport in New York on herring gulls that nested less than 1 kilometer from the 11 airport (1981).  Noise levels over the nesting colony were 85 to 100 dBA on approach and 94 12 to 105 dBA on takeoff. Generally, there did not appear to be any prominent adverse effects of 13 subsonic aircraft on nesting, although some birds flushed when a Concorde flew overhead 14 and, when they returned, engaged in aggressive behavior.  Groups of gulls tended to loaf in the area of the nesting colony, and these birds remained at the roost when the Concorde flew 16 overhead.  Up to 208 of the loafing gulls flew when supersonic aircraft flew overhead. These 17 birds would circle around and immediately land in the loafing flock (Air Force 2000). 18 In 1970, sonic booms were potentially linked to a mass hatch failure of Sooty Terns on the 19 Dry Tortugas (Austin et al. 1970).  The cause of the failure was not certain, but it was conjectured that sonic booms from military aircraft or an overgrowth of vegetation were 21 factors.  In the previous season, Sooties were observed to react to sonic booms by rising in a 22 “panic flight,” circling over the island, and then usually settling down on their eggs again. 23 Hatching that year was normal.  Following the 1969 hatch failure, excess vegetation was 24 cleared and measures were taken to reduce supersonic activity. The 1970 hatch appeared to proceed normally.  A colony of Noddies on the same island hatched successfully in 1969, the 26 year of the Sooty hatch failure. 27 Subsequent laboratory tests of exposure of eggs to sonic booms and other impulsive noises 28 (Bowles et al. 1991; Bowles et al. 1994; Cogger and Zegarra 1980) failed to show adverse 29 effects on the hatching of eggs.  A structural analysis (Ting et al. 2002) showed that, even under extraordinary circumstances, sonic booms would not damage an avian egg. 31 Burger observed no effects of subsonic aircraft on herring gulls in the vicinity of JFK 32 International Airport (1981).  The Concorde aircraft did cause more nesting gulls to leave their 33 nests (especially in areas of higher density of nests), causing the breakage of eggs and the 34 scavenging of eggs by intruder prey.  Clutch sizes were observed to be smaller in areas of higher-density nesting (presumably due to the greater tendency for panic flight) than in areas 36 where there were fewer nests. 37 H.2.8.8 Fish, Reptiles, and Amphibians 38 The effects of overflight noise on fish, reptiles, and amphibians have been poorly studied, but 39 conclusions regarding their expected responses have involved speculation based upon known physiologies and behavioral traits of these taxa (Gladwin et al. 1988).  Although fish do 41 startle in response to low-flying aircraft noise, and probably to the shadows of aircraft, they 42 have been found to habituate to the sound and overflights.  Reptiles and amphibians that 43 respond to low frequencies and those that respond to ground vibration, such as spadefoots APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014 1 (genus Scaphiopus), may be affected by noise.  Limited information is available on the effects 2 of short-duration noise events on reptiles. Dufour in 1980 and Manci et al. in 1988, 3 summarized a few studies of reptile responses to noise. Some reptile species tested under 4 laboratory conditions experienced at least temporary threshold shifts or hearing loss after exposure to 95 dB for several minutes.  Crocodilians in general have the most highly 6 developed hearing of all reptiles.  Crocodile ears have lids that can be closed when the animal 7 goes under water.  These lids can reduce the noise intensity by 10 to 12 dB (Wever and 8 Vernon 1957). On Homestead Air Reserve Station, Florida, two crocodilians (the American 9 Alligator and the Spectacled Caiman) reside in wetlands and canals along the base runway suggesting that they can coexist with existing noise levels of an active runway including DNLs 11 of 85 dB. 12 H.2.8.9 Summary 13 Some physiological/behavioral responses such as increased hormonal production, increased 14 heart rate, and reduction in milk production have been described in a small percentage of studies.  A majority of the studies focusing on these types of effects have reported short-term 16 or no effects. 17 The relationships between physiological effects and how species interact with their 18 environments have not been thoroughly studied.  Therefore, the larger ecological context 19 issues regarding physiological effects of jet aircraft noise (if any) and resulting behavioral pattern changes are not well understood. 21 Animal species exhibit a wide variety of responses to noise. It is therefore difficult to 22 generalize animal responses to noise disturbances or to draw inferences across species, as 23 reactions to jet aircraft noise appear to be species-specific.  Consequently, some animal 24 species may be more sensitive than other species and/or may exhibit different forms or intensities of behavioral responses. For instance one study suggests that wood ducks appear 26 to be more sensitive and more resistant to acclimation to jet aircraft noise than Canada geese. 27 Similarly, wild ungulates seem to be more easily disturbed than domestic animals. 28 The literature does suggest that common responses include the “startle” or “fright” response 29 and, ultimately, habituation. It has been reported that the intensities and durations of the startle response decrease with the numbers and frequencies of exposures, suggesting no 31 long-term adverse effects.  The majority of the literature suggests that domestic animal 32 species (cows, horses, chickens) and wildlife species exhibit adaptation, acclimation, and 33 habituation after repeated exposure to jet aircraft noise and sonic booms. 34 Animal responses to aircraft noise appear to be somewhat dependent on, or influenced by, the size, shape, speed, proximity (vertical and horizontal), engine noise, color, and flight 36 profile of planes. Helicopters also appear to induce greater intensities and durations of 37 disturbance behavior as compared to fixed-wing aircraft.  Some studies showed that animals 38 that had been previously exposed to jet aircraft noise exhibited greater degrees of alarm and 39 disturbance to other objects creating noise, such as boats, people, and objects blowing across the landscape.  Other factors influencing response to jet aircraft noise may include wind 41 direction, speed, and local air turbulence; landscape structures (i.e., amount and type of 42 vegetative cover); and, in the case of bird species, whether the animals are in the 43 incubation/nesting phase. APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014  1  H.2.9 Property Values  2  There are a number of factors that affect property values, which makes predicting impacts  3  difficult.  Factors directly related to the property, such as size, improvements, and location of  4  the property, as well as current conditions in the real estate market, interest rates, and  housing sales in the area are more likely to have a direct adverse impact on property values.  6  Several studies have analyzed property values as they relate to military and civilian aircraft  7  noise.  In one study, a regression analysis of property values as they relate to aircraft noise at  8  two military installations was conducted (Fidell et al. 1996).  This study found that, while  9  aircraft noise at these installations may have had minor impacts on property values, it was  difficult to quantify that impact.  Other factors such, as the quality of the housing near the  11  installations and the local real estate market, had a larger impact on property values.  12  Therefore, the regression analysis was not able to predict the impact of aircraft noise on the  13  property values of two comparable properties.  14  Another study analyzed 33 other studies attempting to quantify the impact of noise on  property values (Nelson 2003).  The result of the study supports the idea that the potential for  16  an adverse impact on property values as a result of aircraft noise exists and estimates that the  17  value of a specific property could be discounted between 0.5 and 0.6 percent per decibel  18  when compared to a similar property that is not impacted by aircraft noise. Additional data  19  indicates that the discount for property values as a result of noise would be higher for noise  levels above 75 dB DNL.  21  H.2.10 Subsonic Aircraft Noise Effects on Structures  22  Normally, the most sensitive components of a structure to airborne noise are the windows  23  and, infrequently, the plastered walls and ceilings.  An evaluation of the peak sound pressures  24  impinging on the structure is normally sufficient to determine the possibility of damage.  In  general, at sound levels above 130 dB, there is the possibility of the excitation of structural  26  component resonance. While certain frequencies (such as 30 Hz for window breakage) may  27  be of more concern than other frequencies, conservatively, only sounds lasting more than  28  one second above a sound level of 130 dB are potentially damaging to structural components  29  (CHABA 1977).  A study directed specifically at low-altitude, high-speed aircraft showed that  there is little probability of structural damage from such operations (Sutherland 1989).  One  31  finding in that study is that sound levels at damaging frequencies (e.g., 30 Hz for window  32  breakage or 15 to 25 Hz for whole-house response) are rarely above 130 dB.  33  Noise-induced structural vibration may also cause annoyance to dwelling occupants because  34  of induced secondary vibrations, or “rattle,” of objects within the dwelling, such as hanging  pictures, dishes, plaques, and bric-a-brac.  Window panes may also vibrate noticeably when  36  exposed to high levels of airborne noise, causing homeowners to fear breakage.  In general,  37  such noise-induced vibrations occur at sound levels above those considered normally  38  incompatible with residential land use.  Thus assessments of noise exposure levels for  39  compatible land use should also be protective of noise-induced secondary vibrations.  APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014 1 H.2.11 Subsonic Aircraft Noise Effects on Structure and Terrain 2 Members of the public often believe that noise from low-flying aircraft can cause avalanches 3 or landslides by disturbing fragile soil or snow structures in mountainous areas. There are no 4 known instances of such effects, and it is considered improbable that such effects will result from routine, subsonic aircraft operations. 6 H.2.12 Noise Effects on Historical and Archaeological Sites 7 Because of the potential for increased fragility of structural components of historical buildings 8 and other historical sites, aircraft noise may affect such sites more severely than newer, 9 modern structures. Most scientific studies of the effects of noise and vibration on historic properties have considered potential impacts on standing architecture. For example, the FAA 11 published a study of potential impacts resulting from vibrations caused by the noise of 12 subsonic Concorde overflights on five historic properties, including a restored plantation 13 house, a stone bridge and tollhouse, and other structures (Hershey, Kevala, and Burns 1975). 14 This study analyzed the breakage probabilities of structural elements that might be considered susceptible to vibration, such as window glass, mortar, and plaster.  The results 16 indicated that, with the exception of some already cracked window glass, there was no 17 practical risk of noise-induced vibration damage to any of these structures. 18 Some studies of the effects of overflights—both subsonic and supersonic—on archaeological 19 structures and other types of sites also have been published.  Battis examined the effects of low-altitude overflights of B-52, RF-4C, and A-7 aircraft on standing walls at Long House Ruin 21 in northeastern Arizona (Battis 1988).  The motion levels observed during all passes were well 22 below a conservative threshold for vibration in ancient structures, a level of 1.3 millimeters 23 per second, established by two previous studies.  Battis concluded that vibration associated 24 with aircraft overflights at speeds and altitudes similar to those measured in his study had/would have no significant damaging effect on Long House and similar sites. 26 Two Air Force-sponsored studies have included research into potential effects of supersonic 27 overflight on “nonstructural” archaeology and unconventional structures.   One study 28 included historic buildings, prehistoric structures, water tanks, archaeological cave/shelter 29 sites and rock art, and seismically sensitive areas such as avalanche and mud/rock slide areas (Sutherland, Brown, and Goerner 1990).  That study compared overpressure associated with 31 different types of aircraft in supersonic flight at different altitudes with failure or damage 32 stress values for these types of sites. The authors concluded that overpressures generated by 33 supersonic overflight were well below established damage thresholds.  Subsonic 34 operations—which were not included in this study—would be even less likely to cause damage. 36 Battis also completed a study that examined the potential for damage by sonic booms to rock 37 shelter and petroglyph sites located within the Valentine Military Operations Area (MOA) in 38 Texas (Battis 1983).  The Texas State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) helped design and 39 participated in this study, which involved taking measurements at a rock shelter site and at a field of petroglyphs-bearing boulders during supersonic overflights. The peak overpressure 41 for booms generated during supersonic operations over the Valentine MOA was 5.2 psf.  The 42 lower limit (the least amount of pressure needed) for damaging rock was measured in the 43 laboratory at 2.1 × 104 psf, 4,000 times the peak overpressure measured during the study. APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014  1  Air Force National Environment Policy Act documents have examined the potential impacts  2  on historic properties that might result from subsonic and supersonic overflights.  In 1995, the  3  Air Force published the Environmental Assessment for Continued Supersonic Operations in  4  the Black Mountain Supersonic Corridor and the Alpha/Precision Impact Range Area.  Eligible  5  and potentially eligible cultural resources in the area of potential effect include petroglyph  6  and pictograph panels located on a variety of rock types, historic adobe and non-adobe  7  structures with standing walls, and historic mines (which contain tunnels) and wells.  The  8  report concludes that supersonic low-altitude flights have occurred over these corridors for  9  25 years or more and have resulted in no significant impacts on cultural resources.  The  10  California SHPO agreed, and during National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 review of  11  this undertaking, concurred with the Air Force’s finding that continued supersonic overflights  12  would have no effect on historic properties.  13  As noted above for the noise effects of noise-induced vibrations on normal structures,  14  assessments of noise exposure levels for normally compatible land uses should also be  15  protective of historic and archaeological sites.  16  H.3 NOISE MODELING METHODOLOGY USED IN GLI EIS  17  Noise modeling for the GLI EIS was conducted based on operations parameters contained in  18  Section 2.3.2 in the EIS and inputs from 1 Special Operations Wing (SOW) and Florida Forest  19  Service points of contact.  Where operational details cannot be known due to the highly  20  variable nature of the proposed training, conservative assumptions were made to avoid  21  under-estimating impacts.  Methods, known operational parameters, and assumptions used  22  in calculating noise levels are described below.  23  H.3.1 Aircraft Noise Modeling Methods  24  An aircraft in subsonic flight generally emits noise from two sources:  the engines and flow  25  noise around the airframe.  Noise generation mechanisms are complex and, in practical  26  models, the noise sources must be based on measured data.  The Air Force has developed a  27  series of computer models and aircraft noise databases for this purpose.  The models include  28  NOISEMAP (Moulton 1992) and Rotorcraft Noise Model (RNM) (Wyle Laboratories 2002) for  29  noise around airbases or in areas where operations would follow a definable path.  The  30  program MOA-Range NOISEMAP (MR_NMAP) (Lucas and Calamia 1996) was created for  31  estimating noise levels in MOAs, ranges, and low-level training routes. The programs  32  NOISEMAP and MRNMAP use the NOISEFILE database developed by the Air Force. NOISEFILE  33  data includes SEL and Lmax as a function of speed and power setting for aircraft in straight  34  flight. The program RNM uses a separate measured source noise dataset which accounts for  35  the high degree of sound level variability at different angles from the nose of the aircraft.   36  Noise from an individual aircraft is a time-varying continuous sound. It is first audible as the  37  aircraft approaches, increases to a maximum when the aircraft is near its closest point, then  38  diminishes as it departs.  The noise depends on the speed and power setting of the aircraft  39  and its trajectory.  NOISEMAP divides the trajectory into segments whose noise can be  40  computed from the data in NOISEFILE.  The contributions from these segments are summed.  APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014 1 Operational points of contact estimated that for all GLI training event types approximately 20 2 percent of operations occur after 10 p.m. and before 7 a.m. As described in Section H.1.2.4, 3 operations after 10 p.m. and before 7 a.m. are assessed a noise ‘penalty’ in calculation of the 4 noise metric Day-Night Average sound Level (DNL) because noise in this time period is 5 generally more intrusive. 6 H.3.1.1 Noise Modeling Method for Helicopter Landing Zones (HLZs) and Drop Zones (DZs) 7 Several different aircraft types would use the HLZs.  Because the percent of total use by each 8 aircraft type is not known, the loudest aircraft type was used as a noise surrogate for all 9 aircraft types. Aircraft noise levels were compared for the aircraft while operating in the 10 loudest configuration (e.g., power setting, airspeed, etc.) that would be commonly used while 11 operating over the state forests.  The CV-22 would be the type of rotorcraft used most 12 commonly at the HLZ/DZs.  When operating at 60 degrees nacelle tilt, the CV-22 is louder 13 than the other rotorcraft types expected to be frequently involved in GLI training while they 14 are operating in common training configurations (see Table 3-9 in Section 3.3.3 of the EIS). 15 To model conservatively, it was assumed that all noise would be concentrated along a single 16 flight path. In fact, noise would be distributed across a range of possible inbound and 17 outbound paths and time-average noise levels would be lower at any given location than 18 those presented in the EIS. CV-22 typical approaches profiles created based on the “Approach 19 Pattern” published in AFTTP 3-3 CV-22 and departure flight profile based on data gathered 20 from a V-22 pilot.  CV-22 flight profiles used in noise modeling are shown in Figure H-7. 22 23 APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014  1  Table H-4. CV-22 Weighted Average Number  2  of Aircraft Per Sortie  # Aircraft  % Total Sorties  4  2%  2  49%  1  49%  Weighted Average Number of Aircraft  1.55  3 Dividing all operations equally among all 17 proposed HLZ/DZs in BRSF would mean that 17 4 HLZ/DZs would have to be available at all times for training purposes. Putting all operations 5 at one HLZ/DZ seemed very unrealistic, as it would not meet the purpose and need of 6 providing training variability. As a middle ground, it was assumed that 5 HLZ/DZs would be 7 active at any given time, and modeled operations would be split among these five HLZ/DZs. 8 To accurately capture variable noise directivity (i.e., noise level varies by degrees off nose of 9 aircraft AND aircraft nose direction varies for each hover event), hovering was modeled as CV10 22 flying slowly around a circular track with a radius of 75 feet. Time spent on the ground 11 with engines running was modeled as “hover” at 5 AGL. 12 Low Level Helicopter Insertion/Extraction (LLHI/E). These operations would take place 13 approximately two times per month. It was assumed that, on average, two aircraft would 14 participate in each event. It was assumed that 5 minutes would be spent conducting each 15 circling pattern and 10 minutes would be spent conducting each upwind/downwind pattern. 16 Average total time for each training event is 75 minutes, with time split evenly between 17 hovering and closed patterns.   Twenty percent of hovering time would be spent on the 18 ground, with the remaining hover time split evenly between 75 AGL, 35 AGL and 15 AGL. 19 Air Drop (AD). Airdrop operations would take place approximately four times per day on 232 20 days per year. Multiple aircraft types would use the DZs. The C-130 was used as noise 21 surrogate for all types. Although the C-17 is slightly louder than the C-130, it was estimated 22 that the C-17 would conduct airdrops once or twice per year. Operations were modeled 23 conducting drops from 500 AGL at 165 knots and 86 % NC. Airdrops would occur at 500 AGL 24 and 700 C TIT engine power. 25 Air/Land Vertical Lift (A/LVL). A/LVL operations would take place approximately four times 26 per day, 232 days per year. It was assumed that Air/Land Vertical Lift training events would 27 spend the same amount of training time in configurations as described above for Low Level 28 Helicopter Insertion/Extraction training. In addition to training at the HLZ/DZs, A/LVL 29 operations would also take place at the airstrips. 30 Table H-7 in Section H.3.1.5 shows the frequency of each of the operations types mentioned 31 above for the HLZ/DZs. As previously mentioned, it was assumed that 5 HLZ/DZs would be 32 operational at a time. 33 H.3.1.2 Noise Modeling Method for Airstrips 34 Several aircraft types would be used for LAPT training at the airstrips.  Characteristics of 35 aircraft types proposed to be used in training (see Table H-5) were compared to similar H 44 APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014 1  aircraft types available in DoD database of aircraft noise levels (see Table H-6).  The C-23  2  Sherpa was selected as the surrogate noise source because it would be expected to be only  3  slightly louder than the loudest of the training aircraft, based on the horsepower and number  4  of engines with which it is equipped.  Selection of a noise surrogate aircraft slightly louder  5  than the training aircraft yields conservative analysis results.  6  Table H-5.

To model conservatively, it was assumed that all operations would be concentrated on  10  a single straight-in track for arrivals and on a single straight-out track for departures. At  11  Muson/Blackwater Airstrip, aircraft would arrive from and take off to the north while utilizing  12  the northern half of the runway.  This restriction on operations would shift noise away from  13  the Munson Recreation Area that is located just south of the airstrip.  For aircraft operations at  14  proposed airstrips, it was assumed that arrivals and departures would occur equally from each  15  direction of the airstrip.   16  Standard aircraft profiles (i.e., altitude, engine power, and airspeed) for C-23 were used in  17  modeling, except that the  standard C-23 takeoff roll was shortened so that rotation would  18  occur before the airstrip ends.   Standard aircraft climb rates are for average aircraft loading.  19  LAPT aircraft would always be light.   Use of the standard profile puts aircraft slight lower  20  and/or at higher engine power setting, which is also a conservative assumption. Flight  21  profiles used in noise modeling of noise at the airstrips are shown in Figure H-8.  2  Figure H-8. C-23 Approach to Airstrip and Departure from Airstrip Flight Profiles  3  In addition to LAPT training, the airstrips will also support A/LVL training.  A/LVL training was  4  modeled as being split evenly between the five active HLZ/DZs and the airstrip(s) (three  airstrips in BRSF and one airstrip in THSF) in each state forest. Table H-7 in Section H.3.1.5  6  shows the frequency of each of the operations types that would occur at the airstrips.  BRSF  7  will have three airstrips that will be used for training and THSF will have one airstrip that will  8  be used for training.  9  H.3.1.3 Noise Modeling Method for Overwater Hoist Operations  Overwater Hoist Operations would occur approximately once per month and would last for  11  approximately 20 minutes.  V-22 aircraft, which would conduct the majority of training  12  operations were used as surrogate noise source aircraft.  CV-22 aircraft typically hover at  13  approximately 80 feet AGL during the training event. Table H-9 in Section H.3.1.5 shows the  14  frequency of the OHOs.  The number of locations to be used for OHO is unknown. As a  conservative estimate, it was assumed that all operations would occur at the same location.  16  H.3.1.4 Noise Modeling Method for Distributed Flying Operations  17  Aircraft would maneuver to and from designated training locations used variable flight paths.  18  Noise levels associated with these maneuvers were modeled using the program MRNMAP.  19  Operations were distributed evenly across the modeled area with the same acreage as BRSF.  The same method was applied to THSF. In order to account for more frequent use of certain  21  areas within the state forests, several conservative operational assumptions were made  22  during noise modeling. The C-23 was used as a surrogate for Light Aviation Proficiency  23  Training, the C-17 as a surrogate for Airdrop, and H-47 as a surrogate for all other ops (V-22 is  24  not available in MRNMAP available aircraft noise database; H-47 has similar noise level and  would be used in some GLI events).  Table H-10 in Section H.3.1.5 shows the frequency  26  distributed flying operations.  H 46 APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014 1  H.3.1.5 Operations Frequency  2  The tables below show the operations frequency for the various training type that would  3  occur in BRSF and THSF. Table H-7 shows the different event types that occur at the HLZ/DZs  4  and the frequency of each training event type. Table H-8 shows the frequency of operations  5  at the airstrips.  Table H-9 shows the frequency of OHOs.  Table H-10 shows the frequency  6  aircraft flying to and from training events within BRSF and THSF.  7  Table H-7.

A/LVL would also be conducted at the three proposed airstrips for total of 8.  For THSF, all operations at the airstrips were combined and added to the one airstrip. 3 Approximately 20% of total operations would occur in 2200-0700 hours for all event types. 8 Table H-8. Frequency of Operations at Airstrips AAD= Average Annual Day; A/LVL= Air/Land Vertical Lift; LAPT= Light Aviation Proficiency Training. 1 A/LVL will have the same frequency of operations at the airstrips as listed under Table H-7.

Large arms are defined as  6  being weapons firing rounds 20 mm or larger, while small arms are defined as weapons firing  7  projectiles less than 20 mm in diameter.  Both BNOISE2 and SARNAM calculate munitions  8  noise based on recorded noise levels for several weapon and projectile types using a series of  9  noise propagation algorithms. Calculations include the muzzle blast as well as the shockwave  10  generated by the projectile, which often travels at faster than the speed of sound. The  11  programs are capable of generating several noise metrics including CDNL and peak noise  12  level.  13  Because it is not known how widely munitions training would be spaced out, training areas  14  were treated as if all activities would occur at one point on the ground at each training  15  location. It was assumed that training events would be evenly distributed between two  16  hardened campsites within BRSF.  At THSF, it is not known how training will be distributed,  17  and it was also assumed that there would be two training locations.  Noise levels are based on  18  the listener being 90 degrees offset from muzzle of the gun (i.e., perpendicular to the noise  19  source and the target).  20  Army Regulation 200-1 discourages noise-sensitive land use where large arms noise exceeds  21  62 dB CDNL and strongly discourages noise-sensitive land uses where large-arms noise  22  exceeds 70 dB CDNL.  As described in Army Regulation 200-1, noise-sensitive land use where  23  small-arms noise exceeds 87 dB PK 15(met) (i.e., peak noise level) is discouraged and noise- APPENDIX H, NOISE |  APRIL 2014 1 sensitive land uses where small-arms noise exceeds 104 dB PK 15(met) is strongly 2 discouraged. 3  H.4 REFERENCES  4  Air Force (U.S. Air Force).  1993.
